Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"

Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I would love to see an obstacle course show without the added hours and hours of backstories and shitty commentary like American Ninja Warriror.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ♥
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,/r/UltimateBeastmaster
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I thought there was a xenomorph when I saw the thumbnail
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Wow Sylvester, where did you get the crazy idea for an obstacle course show?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,That looked fucking stupid.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,This is like something you'd see on 30 Rock as a parody of a show. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Hey man I appreciate you for this post.

I didn’t even know it was coming back so thank you so much"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Just commenting to show my appreciation for such a detailed post.

My tomorrow morning is gonna be great and I can't wait for that OP."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Can you explain why the first arc of season 3 is considered controversial Please? Even as a fan I am out of the loop.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Woah I guess I'm the lucky one. I just finished season 2 this week. I thought season 3 would be so far away I would forget about this. This never happens to me. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,TIL there was second season of Attack on Titan
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Really appreciate the post man. Didn't know this was coming so soon.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Hopefully this post works now. Not sure why this sub dislikes Twitter links. Hmm.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,This post is impressive! I'm stoked about the new season. And I'm also kind of glad they may divert from the manga as I was slightly disappointed as well
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,This is way sooner than I expected! Thanks for the heads up.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Prepare for a bunch of politics... 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Is there a subreddit for Anime-only watchers? I don't want to read the manga since I really enjoy the anime adaptation. 

Edit: Grammar"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I guess i watch season 2.

Have they found out what is in the basement yet?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Season one was so shockingly good that it stayed with me for quite some time. My friend recommended that the anime was easier to follow compared to a manga, which I started with and was having a hard time trying to comprehend all the flashbacks and long dialogues. The anime was, to my standard, the best anime I have ever watched. And similar to others who have posted here, I did not realize Season 2 had already been completed! Just trying to figure out how I can milk this as slowly as I can. (I'm sure I'll finish it in one sitting)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Whats ""2 cours""?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"So Hulu will have the sub later today? Am I understanding this right?
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"""Please also consider using Wikipedia and/or the Attack on Titan Wiki as well."" 

I advise strong caution with this, else you will likely come across manga spoilers!"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I thought we had another year. Feeling blessed. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Tbh I'm hyped for the OP! I heard it was gonna be Yoshiki and Hyde!
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Thanks for the update man. Appreciate it. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Wait, theres a season 2?!?!?

Oh well got something to watch now at least."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,I forgot about this lol. One of the only reasons I have Crunchyroll still 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Thank you Hulu. Their anime game is on point
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"My 13 yo daughter is a HUGE fan of this show, especially someone named Levi. She got in trouble last weekend, and won't be able to watch the new season until next week. For you other fans, what's something I could say to her about Levi that would freak her out? Nothing too spoilerish, but just something to mess with her... thanks in advance"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,[removed]
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Bummer that the dub is so delayed again
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Wow, thanks for the post. 

 I didn't even realize that s02 had come out. I got some catching up to do. Might as well rewatch 1 while I'm at it. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,ITS COMING OUT TONIGHT?!?!?! SO HYPED
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Cool! I thought season 3 was a year away... Oh god, it's already been a year since season 2"
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"I just learned there's a season two. I think I was checking on updates regularly up until 2017, too."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Still waiting on Cory in the House.
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Ooooh boy gonna watch that guy bite into his hand a few more times
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Hk my dude, gj."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Thanks for the recap, I cannot for the life of me remember most of season 2."
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Wait season 3? I've been waiting for season 2 to drop on Netflix for years...
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Does the show get better in season 2? Watched the first season and thought it was okay, it had some good elements, but I felt annoyed by the awful pace during certain parts. Because there was entire episodes that felt incredibly cumbersome and sluggish, were the momentum came to a halt, and it just felt like a waste of time. And if the rest of the show is like that then I don't think I wanna waste any more time on it. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"This is how you handle a new episode release. You give a date and a a rough time scale. Not just ""oh we will put it up on the app when we get around to it"""
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Could somebody explain why the second season took like 5 damn years to come out but this one is already coming out so soon?
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,Anyone else think season 2 missed the amazing wow factor that season 1 has?       Didn’t feel like the same anime to me. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Italy,"Thanks a lot, meatbag"
Drifters,No waaay
Drifters,I hope they get Disasterpeace to do the soundtrack for the show too. 
Drifters,This is one of my favorite games of all time. The art and musical direction is absolutely incredible; I can't wait to dive into this rich world again. 
Drifters,"My god this could be amazing.

I hope they try to keep the atmosphere from the game though -- the ""story"" of which was told entirely visually.

Something like a (more) neon, futuristic version of Samurai Jack's quieter episodes."
Drifters,"While initially exciting as I really love HLD, I'm concerned that it won't translate  well. One of the best aspects of the game is that there is no dialogue and all story and world building is done through exploration and a few cryptic cutscenes. Regardless, hoping this one works! "
Drifters,If the art is in anyway similar to that of the game it is going to be visually stunning!
Drifters,"Honestly I'd have never expected this. I *love* the game, but it's not a secret that the narrative is a bit illusive. Like it is very much there but it's not explicit. Colour me excited."
Drifters,If they do this... will they do actual legible VA or keep it in its archaic language? I’m really hoping the latter if this comes to fruition 
Drifters,Does this mean that's it's in the same multiverse as Castlevania and Devil May Cry?
Drifters,So much potential
Drifters,He needs to slow down. He just announced DMC the other day lol
Drifters,"I don't know anything about Hyper Light Drifter but watching Castlevania, I couldn't stop thinking how well Brandon Sanderson's works could be adapted into an animated show. 

Especially Mistborn. "
Drifters,I am so excited for this. One of my favorite games of all time is now getting a TV series.
Drifters,"Holy shit!! That’s awesome!

i presume there’s not gonna be any dialogue?"
Drifters,Ohh this could be really good 
Drifters,"Wtf, that's something I never knew I wanted until now"
Drifters,holy crap this is the best thing I've heard all day
Drifters,"please be good, pleassssssssse be good"
Drifters,Played for 30 mins and dropped it. Is the story that interesting?
Drifters,"I would love to see the protagonist look at his map and say, ""This is garbage."""
Drifters,That game is fucking awesome
Drifters,My mind will be blow if it looks half as gorgeous as the game. Insanely hyped 
Drifters,"I thought it was rumored they were gonna give Metroid a go. Probably would be more excited for that, but it is funny they are making a narrative out of an atmospheric game series and instead of Metroid they just went full tilt with HLD. Very excited regardless"
Drifters,ya the IP is too rich to be left alone
Drifters,"Very cool. would never have guessed, pumped for this to come out!"
Drifters,"Weird game to adapt, but he did such an incredible job with Castlevania that I support Adi Shankar on any project. "
Drifters,FUCK YES! 
Drifters,HOLY SHIT! Thats amazing. I hope they manage to capture the unique feeling the game had.
Drifters,Wait what?
Drifters,Weird. but not unwanted.
Drifters,"Hate Adi Shanker as a person, but he makes some interesting things nobody else would"
Drifters,"...

The FUCK??





Well... Alright then."
Drifters,Maybe they can tell the stories of all the other heroes you robbed of their weapons and capes and keys.
Drifters,"Castlevania was fantastic, hope they aren't stretching themselves too thin picking up all these other projects."
Drifters,Yoooooooooo
Drifters,Please be like season 1 of Castlevania  season 2 was...not good. IMHO. 
Drifters,"Oh man, his work on FEZ was incredible as well. That'd be dope if they could bring him in for this. He isn't a stranger to doing more Hollywood work too since he scored It Follows and Triple Frontier (TIL! I had no idea he did that film). Fingers crossed!"
Drifters,"Fuck yes. The game is some atmospheric very much because the music mixes with and illuminates the general aesthetic so brilliantly.


Looking forward to the TV series but also I'd really like if they could somehow retain that feeling of mystery and enigma that the game has."
Drifters,"His music is sooo good. It works both as a perfect score to the game you're playing and just as a good listen.

He's also an interesting interview."
Drifters,100%. I like all of his work but that soundtrack is really something special.
Drifters,"The art and the music were amazing...rich world though? There's almost nothing to it. You could explain all of the lore and plot in a single sentence. And I almost feel like explaining it more with a TV series is going to ruin the magic.

The game leaves you to fill in the blanks, which makes it feel mysterious and other worldly. Telling you whats going on can only make it worse in my opinion."
Drifters,"Oh my god I would love this

Also happy cake day!"
Drifters,Samurai Jack
Drifters,"The “Bootleg Multiverse” is just the branding of Adi Shankar’s video game adaptions. It doesn’t actually mean that the shows are tied together, and there is no guarantee that there will be any crossover. "
Drifters,"Think less mainstream and more highbrow.

Post Editorial: Just realized those are same producer. Carry on..."
Drifters,"No, absolutely don't play it for the story. The story is even lighter than Dark Souls in every sense. The best bits of lore, which are legitimately interesting, are locked away in walls you have to decipher manually (or read online). There's good themes and interesting concepts that are hidden away so much its a better experience to read it on a wiki.

In my opinion there's a limit to how vague you can be with your narrative while still being engaging second to second and HLD completely missed the mark.

That said the art/sound/gameplay is top of the line so it is still worth playing it for that. Hopefully the show will adapt the narrative to be more engaging in the way Castlevania did."
Drifters,How dare you have a controversial opinion! 
Drifters,"just want to throw this out as a huge fan of his work on fez and in it follows, that triple frontier score is one of the most generic ones i have heard in a film in a while. really surprised he had it in him. i really don’t take it to be any indication of his future work, however."
Drifters,"I feel like the same could be said of Castlevania, too, but they absolutely knocked it out of the park there. If they handle it the same way, I'm on board."
Drifters,Thank you!
Drifters,"A rarity, tbf. I share OP's concerns, this is a show that should be silent, like the game.

It'd be like adapting Journey onto a TV show. once the characters talk, boom, the magic is gone and it is only a pale imitation of the source"
Drifters,"Adi Shankar is also a dipshit who’s ‘bootleg’ series is a fantastic kind of laughable.

He’s a good producer though. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,No kidding. 
Drifters,"Sometimes it's the direction he's given. He could have been pushing for something amazing, and the directors, who ultimately have final say, could have made him strip away at the music until it was what they wanted and not what he wanted. "
Drifters,"Well if you are talking original Castlevania, maybe. But the sequels had plenty of stuff to draw on for plot. Named characters with actual relationships between them for example. Also...it's just Dracula with a couple of tweaks man. There was a shit tonne of stuff from outside the game to draw inspiration from. They could have basically made any kind of Van Helsing type deal, called it Castlevania and it would have worked. 

Hyper Light Drifter barely even has a premise. In fact does it even have a premise? There may or may not be an apocalypse and some really tall dudes are vaguely involved, some of which might be responsible for said possible disaster. That's literally the ""plot"" of the entire game.

I can't help but feel that all this show is going to do is make the game feel less special."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"They did say in the article that they were exploring just about every possibility, including making it wordless."
Drifters,Just because you don’t take the time to get to know the story doesn’t mean it’s not good. 
Drifters,"Yeah, I guess to be fair I haven't played a lot of later Castlevania games, true they have a definite story and characters but at the end of the day the story is usually ""Dracula's back, get 'im!"" isn't it? I think Hyper Light Drifter is intentionally vague and mysterious and let's you sort of make assumptions about the world and the story, so I could see that giving the creators a lot of creative license to tell a cool story without worrying about it fitting in to an established story or anything. They told a good standalone story with Castlevania that wasn't tied to telling the story of a specific game, I could see this giving them more freedom to do that."
Drifters,"It's similar in that there is no dialogue, that's the only comparison I was making"
Drifters,Would be dope!
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"> ""Dracula's back, get 'im!"" isn't it?

[A brief breakdown of Castlevania's plot](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Castlevania_Timeline).

Hyperlight drifters I can't even find summary of. So I'll write it. Judgement steals Jackals power. Judgement destroys some stuff. Jackal sends the drifter to get it back. He gets it back. The end.

That's literally the plot, I'm not skipping over anything. There's a bit of a difference between the two in terms of depth of source material."
Drifters,"Imagine the majority of players praising the story but since you think it takes too long to know the story it is now shit. 

I’m glad that you are an expert on literature and decide what’s good or not though, much appreciated. "
Drifters,"I think you might be misunderstanding my point. I'm definitely not saying Hyper Light as a game has as much story as the entire Castlevania series. I'm not arguing with you whether Hyper Light is or isn't a heavily story-driven game. There's no question, we agree about that.

What I'm saying is they crafted a story in the universe of Castlevania. They didn't lift a story directly out of one of the games. They used the premise and the world, and created a really satisfying, standalone story. Based on that, I think the fact that Hyper Light is vague and mysterious and light on direct narrative is not a drawback, but rather lets them tell another satisfying standalone story in a setting that is neat and mysterious."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"No it doesn’t, it’s almost incredible how fucking retarded you have to be to slam this as facts.

Believe it or not Dark Souls’s world building has been praised and it isn’t for nothing, you have to get to know the world by exploring it. It’s like saying Shadow of the collossus’s story is bad because they don’t speak in it. 

A story getting told through visuals isn’t a bad thing. Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne both have a story that gets regularly praised, even if DS1 is cryptic. 

Just because it isn’t shown in your face doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s not the main focus but they want to reward players who do want to know more about the world. 

Your whole example of showing this to an English professor is incredibly fucking stupid, I bet you can present a professor with an oscar nominated screenplay and there is still a chance they’ll say it’s fucking terrible. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"> The game is popular because it's difficult. 

lol, this is what people who haven't played the games think. By the way, the challenge in DS also factors into the story, because any human in this world that loses all hope and will to continue turns into a husk devoid of humanity. So basically, if the player stops playing, then their character will also turn into one of the mindless undead. It couldn't matter less if some English professor doesn't find that interesting."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"It's literally the story of the game. Tell me, how much do you actually know about Dark Souls other than it being hard?"
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Thanks for the genuine chuckle, buddy"
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Nah, I'm good with ending the conversation here. I want to end it on a high note"
Drifters,Good thing he deleted his responses after this it’s almost as if he finally came to terms with his own retardation. 
Drifters,[removed]
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Probably because it’s something exclusive to video games? 

Journey gets you to make a connection with a total stranger. Never been done before doesn’t make it bad.

Also I did name an example, Shadow of the Colossus. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"I find it incredible that even though Dark Souls has a massive fanbase that are so incredibly interested in the LORE and the game’s story you still think that this is somehow you’re right. 

Shadow of the Colossus is not like a silent movie, to understand what’s going on you’re going to have to explore the environment moreso then just beating the monsters. 

The comments that got deleted really show you just despise the souls games (Bloodborne looks like a PS2 game lol what are you blind) and that’s fine just don’t think you somehow think your opinion is fact when in truth you’ve never beaten any of them or played any of them besides Bloodborne. It’s honestly pathetic. "
Drifters,"That sounds quite interesting. The name makes it sound like a zombie thing like World War Z, Day Z or something. Maybe that's why it got cancelled."
Drifters,"I wish its prequel was better;
Y: The Last Man


^(It's weird how well their titles go together)"
Drifters,These posts are great. Keep it up!
Drifters,"Hmm, from the name I would expect a different show. Maybe the reason it was canceled is that it was just poorly named."
Drifters,i think this was the best sitcom ever made
Drifters,"""I landed on a fork.""

EDIT: This entire episode is fantastic, by the way. Flesh is burning na na na na naaaaaa na"
Drifters,"Rewatching these again now, niles has always been my favourite. "
Drifters,"[This is the scene that got me to watch Frasier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS41-JeZ3EE)

It was posted on here a couple years ago. I figured I'd give it a shot after watching it and I'm glad I did. The chemistry between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce is great and, in my opinion, better than most of what I've seen from sitcoms of that time. They played off one another so well. Like others said, it doesn't get the attention that Friends or Seinfeld get, but it's a really enjoyable show to watch."
Drifters,"A couple of my favourites:    
[Get Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoYAgKGnZ6U])

[Buttons and Bows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvAWUJCjgQE)
"
Drifters,That show just would not have worked without the beautiful interaction between Niles and Frasier. This is one of my favorite shows since I was a kid.
Drifters,"What's it been, twenty years? I still prefer the weeknight reruns on local tv of Frasier over most new shows on now."
Drifters,"First 5 years of the show were usually very good, after 5 years, like most sit-coms they start to go downhill. Even then they still had a a lot of top flight episodes. They really jumped the shark thou when Niles and Daphne got married.

Always loved the ‘Sherry’ episodes.
"
Drifters,"I used to be obsessed with Friends and hated Frasier, but as I grew older, Friends became my least favourite of the 90's golden trio. Now I prefer Frasier, then Seinfeld, then Friends."
Drifters,"The beach house ep kills me. Probably my favorite episode.

“So you found a dead seal, dressed it in a peignoir, doused it in perfume, and stabbed it?”

“I told you you’d laugh!”"
Drifters,"Always enjoyed this show and recommend it, although I know a lot of the jokes fly over people's heads."
Drifters,I think they should bring back Frasier.
Drifters,"""you need an etiquette lesson! """
Drifters,I got the boxset for my birthday 3 years ago and I've still not finished it. Only got one more season :(
The Chalet,"Just finished it. I didnt see any sort of promoting for it, but just stumbled across it when browsing Netflix. I thought it was fantastic. I watched all 6 episodes today, couldn't stop. My only complaint is that it was very predictable, but even with that, I was still hooked. I wish they would have done more promoting for it, I  feel like it's going to be ignored by most."
The Chalet,"I have finished the whole series and enjoyed it. I almost gave up after the first episode because of the the ""too many dang characters"" -- but I'm glad I stuck it out.  



*****SPOILERS*****



It seemed pretty obvious from the get-go that Adele was the grown-up Rodier daughter, so that wasn't surprising. But the fact that Olivier turned out to be Julian was surprising (to me).   

There are some things that are confusing and odd to me though, namely: 

1. Were we supposed to infer that the Rodiers somehow ""planned"" that boulder falling on the bridge? Seems almost impossible for them the do; yet too much of a ""coincidence"" for it to have happened naturally. 

2. Why the heck did they need to kill the retired mailman? He had literally nothing to do with what happened to the senior Rodiers. 

3. Very confusing on whose wedding they were there for. They were saying in the beginning that they were there for Manu and Adele's wedding (Manu says he needs Alice ""standing up for him at his wedding"" when she is mad about Sebastian being there); but then it turned out to be Laurent and Tiphanie's?  Did I miss something?  "
The Chalet,"I have just finished episode two, and have a hard time getting a handle on the characters. I'm looking at the credits 0:29 from the end of episode two, which are helpfully all on one page and multicolored.

If anyone can help me get my head around these people, based on what we should know about them from the exposition (no spoilers, please), that would be grand.

*Edit: I've rewatched the first two episodes and updated this list as I went, it should be fairly accurate now.*"
The Chalet,"Just got done with this. A pretty great little miniseries. The comparisons to 'Dark' are certainly not remiss. It reminded me a bit of 'And Then There Were None' as well.

Even though I figured out who the killers were and what the whole thing was about by around the halfway mark, the show still managed to be pretty intriguing - encouraging me to continue my binge-watch and find out if I was right!

SPOILERS

Adele being Amelie was pretty obvious from the get-go, to the extent that I don't think it was even intended to be a surprise (in fact the very first scene has the psychiatrist telling Sebastian that 'Adele' doesn't exist...so we know there's something dodgy about her).

I actually guessed that Olivier was Julien by around episode 3. I'd figured by then that the killings were being carried out by the Rodier kids as part of some kind of revenge plot. Olivier and Fabio were the only men who's identities weren't established in the past sequence so I knew one of them had to be Julien...and Olivier just seemed more likely of the two (he looked like an older version of Julien, and he didn't really seem to have much of a role in the present-day, so it made sense that he'd be the big reveal)."
The Chalet,"I just finished watching this series today. It was awesome!!

After 3 episodes, I started to create a tree with all characters and their relationships, since it was getting confusing. It helped me shed some light :) 

If it helps anyone else, I'll post it here (it doesn't contain spoilers):

The Chalet,"I just finished The Chalet, great storyline. I liked the pace and film style, it all seems very professional. Soundtrack was also good too, the intro music with the girl counting '1, 2, 3' is haunting.  

I discovered it by accident on Netflix. It just happened to be 'up there', and the description sounds interesting so i decided to give it a try. I'm glad i wasn't disappointed.  

I hope they continue with a Season 2. It'll be sad though that some characters are gone and won't return like Muriel, unless they revisit the past.   

The only thing that i find odd is the end credits -- it looks like it was put together by first year film students. Which is odd considering that everything else about the series looked professional.  

If you haven't seen it, give it a try!"
The Chalet,Is anyone here French (or knows French) and can translate the opening song?? I’m curious what the child is singing about.
The Chalet,who was the guy tied up near the bridge at the very beginning? 
The Chalet,"Really enjoyed the scenery and the captivating, although at times plot seems a bit contrived.

The biggest question I have:
[spoiler](#s ""What did the quartet with the lottery winnings in 1997? - why is Muriel still in Valmoline?"")"
The Chalet,"Bit late but just finished binging, wasn't Leo also Julien's daughter ? Bit odd how he didn't care about leaving her"
The Chalet,just started watching....onto episode 2...intriguing so far...
The Chalet,Hey would anyone be willing to give me a synopsis? I looked for the plot on IMDb and Wikipedia but there wasn’t much. I really just want to know what happens without watching the whole thing cause I’m interested but don’t really like scary things lol 
The Chalet,"When Sebastian's father killed Fabio... 

Holy moly. I never wanted to hit someone so hard in the face."
The Chalet,"Glad you enjoyed it too! Yeah, predictable plot in which [spoiler](#s Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned ! )


Hmm I’m not sure how Netflix does promotion, but I did see it featured on the top of my home page. They’ve got so many original series and movies now, perhaps they’re promoting the features that they think you’re more likely to enjoy, based on your viewing algorithm?"
The Chalet,"It got front page promotion for me, but I've watched a lot of French series on Netflix. I think it's based on your history."
The Chalet,"1. yes, that boulder did not fall by itself
2. a) they needed to isolate the village b) they probably assumed that everyone who stayed in Valmoline was part of the deed or part of the coverup, they had no way to know for sure c) we never learn their last names, they could well be part of Personnaz and Genesta families
3. that confused me, too. I've decided they planned on a double wedding. There's a moment in ep.2 where Tiphaine laments that she doesn't have her wedding dress where Adele says she doesn't have one, either."
The Chalet,"I think:

1. Remote-triggered dynamite blast.
2. Tying up lose ends?
3. I’m pretty sure it was Laurent and Tiphanie. Many and Adele were to marry later."
The Chalet,"I was having such a hard time figuring out the characters in the first couple episodes that I presumed Olivier was Julian just because I couldn't understand who else that character could be (I'd missed the part where they said he was an associate of Laurent, and didn't understand yet why Julian wouldn't be expected to be there). It wasn't until we learned the fate of the Rodier that I realized people were calling that character Olivier (which still didn't clarify what he was doing there). Adele/Amelie was so obvious I was almost surprised they didn't swerve us.

I also initially assumed it was Manu and Adele's wedding they were there for, mostly because they were the first characters we met so I expected them to be at the center of everything.  

Confusions aside I still thought it was pretty good though."
The Chalet,"1) could have also been Alexander, the mathematician.  Or, just remotely-triggered explosives
2) I thought he was complicit in the murders also. There were a lot of people involved, including Paul and Gaspard
3) I didn’t find it that confusing if you read the subtitles.  Tiphaine kept talking about her wedding dress and her parents, and how upset she was her wedding was ruined.  Manu/Adele were just a couple that got there early.
"
The Chalet,"I thought Etienne had a wife, and Christine was just the bar staff whom he was having an affair with. Was Christine also a Genesta too?"
The Chalet,"First, there's a thread on the Stephen King board [here](https://stephenking.com/xf/index.php?threads/le-chalet-netflix.18861/).

The song is ""Comptez jusqu'à trois"" by Samuel Hercule.

In episode 1, it goes like this:

> Comptez jusqu'à trois  
Monsieurs Mesdames  
Et l'un de vous disparaîtra  
Jamais on ne le reverra  
Entrez dans la ronde  
Méfiez-vous du monde  
Cachez-vous vite  
Avant qu'il n'attaque  
Un deux trois  
N'attaque  
Un deux trois  
Comptez jusqu'à trois  
Monsieurs Mesdames  
Un deux ---

Count to three, sirs and ladies,  
And one of you will disappear, never to return  
Come into the circle, beware the world  
Hide yourself quick so that he won't attack  
One two three  
attack one two three  
Count to three, sirs and ladies  
One two ---

In episode 3, the into gets bloodier, in episode 4 the subtitles refer to the music as ""mysterious"", and in episode 5, with an even bloodier intro, the music is ""lugubre""=gloomy, and the text changes from "" qu'il n'attaque"" to ""le massacre""."
The Chalet,Thanks for asking that...the sang was haunting and yet so innocent sounding.  
The Chalet,"He's the [spoiler](#s ""Guy that welcomes the present-day Manu and Adèle to the chalet. I believe, in the flashback, he was sitting in with Philippe and Étienne at the bar"")
Not sure why he was tied up, as he wasn't [spoiler](#s ""part of the group of four at the night of the murders"")"
The Chalet,"That's [spoiler](#s ""Gaspard, who used to work for the carpenter 20 years earlier. He's shown to be ""in the know"" in the scene with the police search."")"
The Chalet,They mentioned extensive renovations to the chalet. Maybe that went for the whole town.
The Chalet,"Yeah, so much resulted because of the damn winning lottery ticket, yet it seemed like a throwaway plotline later.

Having said that, I still enjoyed it...even if it did have a slow start and too many characters."
The Chalet,"Stepdaughter, not biological"
The Chalet,It's not particularly scary at any point.  There are plenty of violent deaths... though surprisingly little gore.
The Chalet,"i was totally thinking ""double wedding"" too! LOL  Thanks to both of you for your answers.  A remote triggered blast makes sense, as does isolating the village as much as possible. Thanks! "
The Chalet,"Then why - when Alice was pissed about Sebastion being part of the weekend festivities - did Manu tell her that he needed her ""standing up for him at his wedding"" in the car ride from the train, before the boulder falls? 

And when Manu told Philippe that his mother wouldn't be coming because ""Valmoline is done for her,"" Philippe says something like ""not even for your wedding?""  Manu says that she is not happy that he is getting married. 

Those 2 scenes seem to indicate that they are also there for Manu and Adele's wedding, at least to me. "
The Chalet,"Christine has an affair with Philippe.
I think there's a scene in ep.1 or 2 where Jean-Louis comlains about Sebastien, and I deduced it from that that she's his mother, but I may be wrong."
The Chalet,She's Christine Genesta in the end credits.
The Chalet,"I think you're wrong, as the person is already tied up under the bridge as Manu and Amelie arrive. Manu talks to Paul, the postman, as they arrive at the chalet; he's driving that jeep-like thing, so that can't have been him. [spoiler](#s ""His scene is later."")"
The Chalet,hmm got it. thanks!
The Chalet,"Yeah, that would make sense. Though it's obvious that Muriel was reluctant to have stayed in town."
The Chalet,How much would $70 million (francs?) in 1997 be worth today?
The Chalet,"I think that Manu and Adele are planning to get married a little bit later, just not that weekend"
The Chalet,Christine had affairs with both Etienne and Philippe?
The Chalet,Probably officially married Etienne after he left his wife.
The Chalet,"Oh true, you’re right."
The Chalet,"But actually, regardless of whether he took part, perhaps the [spoiler](#s ""Rodier siblings didn’t know who was involved and who wasn’t- so they just tried to tie up all lose ends!"")"
The Chalet,"If they'd let her leave, they wouldn't have been safe any more."
The Chalet,"70 million Francs is slightly under 11 million Euro, and according to in2013dollars.com that would've become 15 million Euro going from 1997 to 2017 (consumer price inflation)."
The Chalet,"I'm not seeing Christine having any affair with Etienne, is it possible they're siblings?"
The Chalet,"found it. ep.4, 20:48 from the end, Sebastien says in the psych. interview that his mother left when he was 7 years old. So Christine can't be his biological mother."
The Chalet,"That's a lot of money! Splitting it 4 ways means each got approximately 4 million Euro. I get it that they upgraded the chalet and sent their kids to school, but Christine and Muriel would still have plenty left over.  

If they do season 2, they could look into a theory of Muriel leaving some Euro for someone? Just a thought."
The Chalet,Hmm...i'll have to rewatch it again. I might still be confused by the names of some of the characters.
The Chalet,"Yes, and without spoiling it for others who haven’t watched, Seb’s mom left because of Etienne and Christian. "
The Chalet,"ep 5, 17:49 from the end implies the money was never spent"
The Chalet,"I didn't see that mentioned at all, where did you get that?
Sebastien's mother left before any of the events in the series happened."
The Chalet,Could pave the way for a plotline in S2 if it happens.
The Chalet,Sounds a bit like an extreme Harper's Island. I've added it to my list. 
The Chalet,filmed beautifully as well 
The Chalet,"more info please ? whats the setting, what did you like in particular ?"
The Chalet,"I've still got some questions, so I've set up a [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/8dyhbg/the_chalet_on_netflix_discussion_thread/).

Warning: some spoilers."
The Chalet,"Bit late but just finished binging, wasn't Leo also Julien's daughter ? Bit odd how he didn't care about leaving her"
The Chalet,"So it takes place in this village on a mountain. Something happened there 20 years ago, and now everyone's having a reunion of sorts. At first you don't know what's going on and it's kinda creepy. The show switches between present day and 20 years ago, and bit by bit you learn more about what transpired, which is really cool. It has a great sense of mystery which put me on the edge of my seat. "
The Chalet,"So far I've watched 4 of 6 episodes. I'd describe it as a cross of Dark and And Then There Were None.

It reminds me a lot of Dark, with the story taking place over two time periods, the large cast of characters, and the small town drama. "
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Norm's long time producer Lori Jo Hoekstra:

>“His test results were not good, so during the heart of COVID-19 pandemic and literally the night before going in for a procedure, he wanted to get this on tape just in case – as he put it – things went south. It was his intention to have a special to share if something happened. He looks great and it’s fantastic”  

 
>“It makes me so happy that I can share it, but also so sad that we can’t share it with him. He didn’t do this for the shock that it exists. He shot it because he loved his material and was so proud of his material. He worked so hard and it really would’ve bothered him to have done all that work and not been able to show everybody. He did it for the stand-up. I just hope people appreciate that he did this.”


Norm passed away in September after a 9 year private battle with Leukemia. The special will also have clips of Adam Sandler, Conan O’Brien, Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, David Spade and Molly Shannon reminiscing about his life and career."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"the opening line will be: “if uh you’re watching this, uh **I’m dead**!”"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Norm comes from a long line of death.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,[deleted]
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Maybe he shouldn’t have bought that deathbed
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"He’s gonna kill in this special! But not like OJ Simpson. He’s gonna kill the set , not his wife!"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"This is so Norm. God, I loved that man. ❤️ 

Not in a 50 bucks a man under the bridge way, but in a deeply closeted one."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Statistically speaking, that's when most comedians film their specials."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,What a fucking legend
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,what a treat this is
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Based on a true story is the funniest damn audiobook I've ever heard.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"It's just going to be a 90 minute moth joke, isn't it?

I'll be a little disappointed if it isn't."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,[deleted]
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"It's incredible that this has been kept secret all this time. All the people working on this must have had a great respect for Norm for this to have been released as a surprise. 

Norm will always be remembered as one of the greats. The worst thing is that the thing I'm most upset about is that Norms death was the end of Mike Tyson Mysteries."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,All his specials were filmed before his death.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This is the best news
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I didn’t even know he was sick
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Love ya Norm
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,">The comedian Patton Oswalt, he told me ""I think the worst part of the Cosby thing was the hypocrisy."" And I disagree. I thought it was the raping. It's my feeling most rapists are hypocrites. You don't meet many that go ""I like raping and I know it's not politically correct but, by god"" and people go ""well, he's not being a hypocrite and that's the worst part!"""
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"One last gift from Norm before he passed. What a damn cool guy and a comedic great. I was lucky enough to see him live at a show in Denver before the pandemic started and he was just so fantastic and so damn funny. I'm glad to have one last opportunity to see something new from him. Cheers, Norm!"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,He's also still in the new seaons of The Orville next month. Trailer just came out
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This will be the first time I cry during a comedy special.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,no way! this is such amazing news!
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This is a true dawg move
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Love you, Norm. Right now, Norm has his hand on all of our thighs from heaven."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This reminds me of that tragedy
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This is the only celebrity death where I felt as affected as I would if it was someone in my actual life. Love ya norm
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Fantastic news, but PLEASE Netflix, republish Norm Macdonald Live to YouTube, or at the very least on your own service. Yes I know there are alternative means to see it, but making it more readily available means it’ll reach a wider audience."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"“speaking of one last ride, it was announced today that the infamous O.J Simpson white ford bronco is being put up for auction today, to make it even more appealing to bidders, OJ has taken it upon himself to personally sign his name onto the hood with his ex wife’s blood”"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Please release the Norm YouTube show that you own and have scrubbed from the internet.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Norm really is going down as best comedian of all time.

Sorry, I meant chameleon. Because he changes his sexual preference frequently."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"I'm thrilled he was able to get the last of his life's work out there for us and himself, but all of this talk of Norm reminds me of that tragedy"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"God bless him, he David Bowie’d us."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,What if he finally came out in this posthumous special?
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,What a scholar and a gentleman
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This almost made me cry!! I’m so fucking happy!!
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,God bless Norm. We didn’t deserve him.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Him and Gilbert have the best podcast in heaven.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Fuck netflix...

They canned his show when he said that the way the meetoo movement was handled made him uncomfortable to be a man in showbusiness.   Then netflix proved him right by axing him,  and theres still no legal way to watch the original youtube show...

Talk about capitalising on someones death."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I didn't even know he was sick.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I didn’t even know he was sick
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,If Norm thought it was funny then it’s great and I’m going to watch.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,The more I learn about this Norm fella the more I care for him.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"I have never found Norm funny or interesting as a comedian, but I’ve come to realize that I may have been missing so much about who he really is. Im going to give his work another shot in an effort to reevaluate my biases."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"This is good news, his death was so shocking, glad he knew we would want this."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Absolute legend.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I'm not ready for the emotions this will make me feel.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Unbelievable! This makes me so happy and melancholic, all at once. One of my all-time favs, I simply cannot wait to watch this — and yet don’t feel in a rush due to its…finality. 😥"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Damn this shit made me tear up just reading the title. Thank you norm. You didn’t even have to do this. I don’t even think norm wanted to it’s just strictly for his supporters. Fucking legend.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I’m eating dinner in public and this gave me the teary feels
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This is norm being norm. Love him to deat- ah fuck
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Man alive! What a gift
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,WHAT?!? Awesome
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Damn it. Got something in my eye.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Oh god, I can't wait to see this. He knows he won't be around to deal with the repercussions so he probably went all out.

Can't wait for some killer OJ jokes."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Wow, this is something special, such a great gift that we probably don't deserve.  Just a little bit more Norm :)"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"He is so underrated. One of the best. Of. All. Time.
Show me one true comic( other than Dave Chappell) who gives zero fucs wether they like it or not. 
As a comedian, you cannot go through life worrying about offending others. The truth is, that is the job.."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,nothing like great news after a shitty day.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Me and the boys are about to get together and cry to this. RIP Norm. What a fucking baller way to go out.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"This Albert Fish guy, I mean, that guy was a real jerk!"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"After he passed away, I found an insta account that just plays norm macdonald clips and idk if i just remembered him from snl and dirty work or just being older now but holy shit I had no idea how witty and genius his comedy style was."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,that old lump of coal gave us one more gift
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,All this is gonna age so poorly when Reddit comes to cancel him after it.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I’d walk through blood and bone to watch this special
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"I’m not crying, your crying."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I will not eat a single morsel of food until Norm MacDonald is dead and buried!
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"And i just cancelled Netflix a few weeks ago - this would have gotten me to keep it just a little longer.

Norm was so funny"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Didn’t even know he was sick
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Damnit I forgot he died. Bummer.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I just came
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This man was a king till the end
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Based Norm
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,This makes me very happy
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Didn’t know he was dead. I still think Dirty Work is hilarious even though it’s stupid as shit lol
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Bittersweet
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Welp gotta leave the comment section. To early for this and I don’t want to suppress
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Ugh this is so bittersweet.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,#Y A Y ! ! ! 🤩
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Bless you Norm! You are missed so much!
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"I'm going to be up north on the 30th, so I'm just gonna drive to where I get reception and download it on the app and me and my dad are gonna have beers and watch it."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Dead? I didn’t even know he was sick.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,And here I thought the Good Place finale was going to permanently stay #1 on my list of laugh/ugly cry shows.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,What a great gift
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Norm was the fucking man. And truly one of the underrated GOATs of comedy. I will cherish this last special just to freshly hear his monotone voice once more and bait the crowd into laughing at something so uncomfortable and obtuse.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Who directed this you ask? You guessed it, Frank Stallone."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"I kind of hope he starts off with sonething along the lines of:  ""If you're watching this, I'm dead."""
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,A frog goes to the bank to get a loan.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Just when I thought I’d seen every norm video out there. There’s more material to binge. R.I.P Norm you absolute legend
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Holy shit, this is fantastic news"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"Some of the most hilarious material by norm were on jay leno, “getting recognised on plane story”….”mickeymouse story” & “cat story”….& “politically incorrect 1997 the gay porn observation”…all on utube"
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Nice try Netflix but I'm still canceling
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Out of any comedian I would have guessed Norm would do a post death special. Rip king
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,It would have been more impressive if he shot it after his death.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,"This is one of the smarter things Netflix has done.  It will slow the tide of cancels for this month.  

Usually they put out PR that the season of whatever was released last week, yawn.  This way they've built some anticipation and will get retention from it."
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,What a gift
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,YESSSSS
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I can't wait to not get Netflix for this.
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,Please god let this be funny lol
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,I'm surprised that he didn't want to name it postmortem before he passed
The Honeymoon Stand Up Special,RemindMe! 17 days
Team Chocolate,"For a really long time I thought the Noozles was a fever dream, so glad someone else remembers!!"
Team Chocolate,"I often feel as though I’m the only person who remembers Puff the Magic Dragon. I still remember the theme song. I’m 46, none of my friends have heard of it.

I also remember a Saturday cartoon called The Littles. It was about tiny people (elves perhaps?) that lived in the walls of a house, maybe four inches tall. I have a younger brother who would watch Saturday morning cartoons with me and he doesn’t remember this show, nor does my husband, who also did time watching Saturday morning cartoons."
Team Chocolate,"Oh wow. Unico. I saw that ages ago as a child, I think maybe on the Disney channel? I remembered the puppet master one quiet clearly but everyone around me thought I was insane. I’m so happy some one else remembers this quite dark cartoon for kids. Just rewatched it not long ago (I found an old VHS on EBay) and it is still creepy as all hell. I love it though."
Team Chocolate,"I just nostalgia tripped on Puff the Magic Dragon myself a couple weeks ago, after not seeing it in probably close to 30 years. That was kind of nuts. It's very strange! I had no idea they made more than one."
Team Chocolate,The Noozles is actually also Japanese. The girl's father was kidnapped in Australian animal dimension. Humans were not welcome and the main character had to wear a disguise while there.
Team Chocolate,I just watched three episodes of Puff the magic dragon on YouTube. I recommend it. Barely cried at all over the abandonment of my childhood.
Team Chocolate,"Dear god. Doing research on the Noozles and I was right! This show did get dark!

""About halfway through the series, the show suddenly got more serious as Sandy visited Koalawala Land, the dimension where her friends and many other anthromorphic Australian creatures live and the show's plot grew so dark that by the end of the series, the fate of both worlds were at stake and the mystery of Sandy's grandfather's disappearance is the key to saving them. Oh, and the Koalas of Koalawala are basically human-hating Nazis that arrest and condemn humans to eternal imprisonment on sight."""
Team Chocolate,My mother positively hated Maya the Bee.
Team Chocolate,On the surface it seems like a cute wholesome cartoon! Then it takes this slow turn into WTFNESS that is just surreal and insane!
Team Chocolate,The song is actually a real song that existsed long before a cartoon was made out of it.
Team Chocolate,"My favorite cartoon as a kid.

https://youtu.be/0FyhTBvLu4w"
Team Chocolate,Would you happen to mnow how it ended?
Team Chocolate,I do not although the dad does escape.
Team Chocolate,"The three television specials I make sure to watch every year around Christmas are Always Sunny’s “A Very Sunny Christmas,” Family Guy’s “Road to the North Pole,” and Trailer Park Boys’ “Xmas Special” (originally titled “Dear Santa Claus, Go F*** Yourself”).

On the less irreverent side, 30 Rock and West Wing (which OP included) always did a very nice job with their Christmas-themed episodes."
Team Chocolate,The entire fourth season of Mr Robot is basically a christmas special and it's one of the best things on TV right now IMO.
Team Chocolate,"Top 2 and I watch them every year:


The Honeymooners - Twas the Night Before Christmas

The Dick Van Dyke Show - The Alan Brady Show Presents


These are what Christmas tradition is all about."
Team Chocolate,"Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire, Marge Be Not Proud, Husbands Of River Song, Episodes 49 & 50 of Animaniacs, A Pinky & The Brain Christmas, A Rugrats Chanukah"
Team Chocolate,I really love the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror.
Team Chocolate,"Everyone in that show basically had the worst Christmas ever though, haha"
Team Chocolate,Interesting.  I stopped a couple episodes into Season 3 (because Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Crown both had new seasons out last week.)  Maybe I should get back to it!
Team Chocolate,"You must have stopped before the really fantastic episodes of season 3 (episode 5 onward), can't imagine you would have dropped the show otherwise"
Team Chocolate,"I stopped for like a year after the Tyrell episode, definitely was a decision I regretted when I got back into it"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Although I do love this segment, nothing can beat the blancmonges from outer space sketch. Funniest thing ever."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Ja! Beierhund!
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Why is this video not blocked in my country? I speak German and now I am laughing and dying. Hahaaaaar
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer?

Ja! Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,It's an epoch in comedic endeavor.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,First time I saw Monty Python was in a movie released in the 70's of some of the beset material from the show and my god I was laughing about this skit for years.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Fun fact: typing the joke into Google translate will result in a fatal error
Monty Pythons Personal Best,dont think I ever laughed more than when watching ANFSCD
Monty Pythons Personal Best,And Now For Something Completely Different - Made by Playboy in an old milk bottle factory.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"> Made by Playboy in an old milk bottle factory.

???"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Well, quite."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Literally the first Monty Python sketch I ever saw. Just the absurdity of it all caught my interest and I've been a fan ever since.

One thing I've always loved about their sketches were their segways. To start off in a Barber Shop to the ""end"" with a psuedo 4th wall breaking bit about the sketch was just masterful."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"I lost it at the end ""I object to all this sex on the television. I mean, I keep falling off!"""

Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Palin in one of his specials, i think Himalaya, starts singing it in China to a lumberjack. (He also sang Finland in pole to pole). Great fun."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"No idea why, had this song stuck in my head all last week, humming it at work etc."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Let the Laddie be a Lassie
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Thank you for my daily dose of Monty Python.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,This inspired me to name my kid Bevis.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"My elementary school had a talent show way back in about 1983. A group of 6th grade boys wanted to sing this song, and were initially given the ok. After hearing all the lyrics however, they were quickly banned."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Connie Booth, Polly from Fawlty Towers"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"I watched  this about 11 years ago and I had forgotten about it, good to watch it again"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,I watched Jeopardy too!
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"ha,ha I like that one.Its hilarious"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Hard to believe this hasn't been cancelled yet. Good to see (some) people still have a sense of humor.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Couldn't get away with making fun of cross dressing in 2020.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Should it seem unusual and taboo for a man to crossdress and look for sexual action in bars? Discuss.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,The laughtrack is really distracting.  Do modern sketch shows still use it as much?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"As soon as I saw The Lumberjack Song - I thought this:
https://youtu.be/A52p9jc-gOo"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,omg transphobic smh
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Monty Python is so awful. Lol, it’s “comedy” for nerds who wish they were British."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,[segues]
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Me too! I think I used to run around in the 4th grade signing this song in the house. Probably the day my Dad stopped liking me
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Does that mean it's the wife writing using her husband's signature?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"No worries, I get this song stuck in my head at least once a month."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"My college team is the Lumberjacks, i used to love to sing this song as I walked across campus."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,They aren't really making fun of it though.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Rightfully so. It's a product of its time.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,[deleted]
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"It isn't a laugh track, it is a live studio audience. I find those way less distracting, because the laughter is a lot more organic."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BFSZ8XzWOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BFSZ8XzWOM)

Yes, all manner of shows do, and this is why."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,I know you're trying to be sarcastic but cross-dressing =/= trans FYI
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"You have enormous balls calling one of the most beloved comedy troupes of all time ""awful"". Good luck with the karma."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,What about actual British fans?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Haha R.I.P. your karma
Monty Pythons Personal Best,I suck at grammar.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"[spelling] ... unless of course you did actually run around tossing ASL hands, in which case, way cool!"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Lol honestly! Before I even saw Monty Python my dad would sing an astronomy parody all the time. Had no clue where it came from till I saw MP years later
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Yesssss!

I'm a 6'5"" guy with a bear and a penchant for flannel, so I get a plethora of forestry nicknames"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Big burly men dressing up in bras and panties and skirts is actually super serious and not funny at all.

\-the current year"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Hey *I* ask the questions. 

To answer your question, it depends on the kink. I'm not familiar enough with the term to know whether it includes unethical things."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Wow. I ah.. I forgot those were once a thing.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"That's a bad example. If there wasn't a laugh track, they wouldn't insert pauses for the laugh track."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,I actually kind of like it better this way.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"I'm pretty sure that if you had the same actors with the same or a similar script not pausing for the laugh track, the scene might still work."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"The difference being that back in the day of Monty Python, the shows didn't *need* the hooting of a studio audience to let the home audience know that something was supposed to be funny."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"""I wish I'd been a girly, just like my dear papa!""

As a trans woman who's father killed himself out of the pain of being a trans woman in denial, it kind of hits a bit close to home.  Crossdressers don't wish they were girls, unless they are in fact girls.

The song isn't inherently hateful, but the fact its supposed to be a comedy when its about a deadly serious issue is something I take offense to.  Like, oh here's someone grappling with who they are and in denial about it, haha how embarrassing.  The humor comes entirely from the mocking of who the singer is."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Nah, I have ears and a brain. Monty Python is nothing but yelling random shit and people thinking it’s brilliant because it’s in a British accent."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,It would take all of reddit to kill my karma. That’s why I can say shit like this. Lol
Monty Pythons Personal Best,[spelling]
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"No the lumber jack song, why did my mom have to put that shit on all the time"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour..    
..cause there's bugger all down here on earth!    
I forget the in between bit."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Flanel is awesome, keep on rocking it."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"I know, it's so ridiculous. If it hurts someone's feelings it isn't allowed."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Based on the lyrics, it sounds like the lumberjack is a trans woman in denial, not a cross dresser. Making fun of that is...yup super serious and not funny at all."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Kink more or less means 'fetish' nowadays, ideally referring to stuff relaxed to sex but not actually including sex."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Have you never been to a live comedy show or play?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"That wasn't the point of doing it back in the day. Most of these people were improve comedians and stage actors that are used to working with an audience to get a feel for the timing and feed off that energy. The youtube generation is used to working without an audience, so it seems weird to have to need one."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,What sketch comedy do you enjoy?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"What did you think of it in 1970 when it was, you know, new?"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Oddly enough, as someone who is British, the accent isn’t what makes it special."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,LOL. You wrote “signing”... thought you might be deaf...
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Thx man! Idk, feel like lumberjack is nowhere near the worst thing to be likened to lol"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Oh you can hurt people's feelings. There are only a few specific groups whose feelings can't be hurt.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"As a real bonafide trans person, I have absolutely no issue with this song."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Yes, very sad that mentally ill people are manipulated into mutilating their bodies instead of getting the psychological help that they need."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"> Kirk more or less means 'fetish' nowadays, ideally referring to stuff relaxed to sex but not actually including sex."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Is that like where you put your phone in a cardboard box and wear it on your head?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,The funny kind.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"As also a bonafide trans person, the song itself isn't inherently bad, it's the ridicule that's thrown towards the lumberjack by the real-world audience."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,What a thought provoking response. Really adds to the conversation.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,More thought provoking than shitty Monty Python humor.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Hey, /u/kevonicus... Why don't you sit on my face, and tell me that you love me."
Monty Pythons Personal Best, Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"More thought provoking than jokes about Proust, Schopenhauer?"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Is that a Monty Python quote? Someone always tries to use a quote and it just ends up proving how unfunny Monty Python is. Lol
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Oh shut up, you silly bitch. It's just a bit of fun."
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Sounds like a shitty Monty Python attempt at comedy.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,You wanna make out?
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Stop that. Stop that. This is just silly.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,If you put the German version of the joke into Google Translate the translation comes back as [fatal error].
Monty Pythons Personal Best,And then a man went on to die laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda.
Monty Pythons Personal Best, *Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! .. Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!*
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"""My dog has no nose""  
""How does he smell?""  
""Awful!"""
Monty Pythons Personal Best,"Sooooo, anyone want to risk a war crime and translate the joke?"
Monty Pythons Personal Best,Laughing to death seems like a painful way to go.
Monty Pythons Personal Best,One of the best sketches ever created. First episode of the show too. Made me finish all 4 seasons of it. Amazing stuff.

Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"I love the ""louder and with your mouth open"" detective skit."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Personally I'd put Dr Who in the 60s list, it blazed a lot of trails. From the perspective of 60s TV nothing else \*sounded\* like it at the time, which in the days of 405 line broadcasts viewed on 18"" screens was actually a pretty big deal.

For the 70s I'd nominate Roots, it's difficult to overestimate the cultural impact it had on middle class America, again it's a show which has a living legacy today.

The Prisoner ? Really ? Patrick McGoohan's vanity project where he was thorwing shit at the wall and filming whatever stuck. It started off as a nicely left-field sequel to Danger Man but rapidly sank into chaos, seriously, read up on the backstory to the recording of the last few episodes. Great theme tune and title sequence though."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Dallas should probably be on the list. 

I can’t believe you didn’t include LOST, as it fits both your key criteria perhaps better than any other show you’ve listed."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"You could have included Oz in the 1990s, the first prestige drama from HBO even if the Sopranos quickly outshone it."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"I see a lot of praise for I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, Lost, and I’m debating on it but Sons of Anarchy."

Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),Miami Vice deserves to be in the 80s. It was once described as the first TV show to look and feel different since colour tv was invented. It's also a damn fine cop show with a terrific soundtrack
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"I know it's for very little kids but Sesame Street has to be on the list. It's a daggum American treasure. It pretty much raised and taught 50 years worth of children and had a major impact on educational tv. It never shyed away from subjects that are difficult. And while it might not be directly on the show it covered stuff like race and racism, homelessness, trauma, Autism, divorce, incarceration, HIV and even death. This show and Mr. Roger's neighborhood weren't afraid to get real with the kids. Before it came around kids shows were 100% for entertaining. Like pies in the face, cartoons, nothing of any educational value. Sesame street changed the game. It is absolutely peak children's television.

As for Peak medical shows ER is by far the peak. It was filmed like a movie and is notable for being the first show to air live in real time for two different audiences. Once for the East Coast and once for the West Coast."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),Guessing you think the walking dead fell too far out of the zeitgeist?  I think The Office has to be put on here.  Not my favorite but it’s popularity is huge even more so now and for me it kicked off the era of single cam comedies on broadcast tv.  Apologies to Scrubs and Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac show that came before it but they don’t have that impact imo.
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Educational TV, Animated series and Anime not being in this list is a darn slight."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),[deleted]
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Don’t know if anyone mentioned Deadwood but, first of all, it furthered a lot of what Oz, Sopranos accomplished in terms of what the OP mentioned re: large, ensemble cast. But the reason Deadwood is an absolute must-include, is because of the way it ushered in TV’s era of the auteur, in earnest. Yes, we saw some of this with David Chase, but in Deadwood and with HBO, David Milch shattered TV’s glass ceiling on singular creative control.

30 Rock was a huge influence on the type of comedies that audiences sought, post 2010: smart as a whip, incredibly fast and quick-witted.

I also believe BoJack (which I was very late to) will be looked back on as highly influential, in terms of its existentialism and also the way it raised expectations for what a cartoon can accomplish in terms of dramatic feelings.

If you’re including foreign series, I would also add Gomorrah."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Agree completely with your take on Doctor Who, however, I disagree with your take on the prisoner.  You're right that it is a Patrick McGoohan vanity project, but it's an overwhelmingly successful vanity project, and was way ahead of its day.

I'd say it's as important as Star Trek if you're setting up a list of essential TV Sci-Fi."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Roots and Dr. Who are really good choices, I don't know a lot about 60s who so I wasn't sure what to write about it, same with roots, but I think they'd be good additions. Thank you!

I said at the start I hadn't seen a lot of these shows, I included ones I'd seen talked about a lot so I wasn't sure about The Prisoner, I heard it did the mystery box element before any other show, but that's interesting, I wasn't aware it was so controversial!"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Agreed, you can't make a list like this without Doctor Who"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Dallas definitely makes sense, as does Lost. I hesitated with both of them because, with Lost, it has such a bad reputation due to the ending (I think the last few seasons are fine, but that made it seem to disappear a bit from the cultural consciousness). It definitely was really influential though, so it probably should be included. I'd also heard a lot of mixed things about Dallas so I wasn't sure whether to include it, and I haven't heard much about it. I'm interested to look more into Dallas though, thanks for your input!"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"YES, not only did it blow up the superhero genre on tv (after smallville arguably lit the spark), it really kicked off the whole thing with networks trying to create a shared universe. Without the Arrowverse, the bigger shared universes like the Chicago-Whatever shows wouldn't have happened. Sure, tv has always had spin-offs (perhaps most popularized by Buffy, which should have also been on the list) but Arrow and its connected shows expanded upon that in a way that no one else did, and just recently had the biggest, most expansive crossover in tv history (Crisis On Infinite Earths) that brought shows from decades ago back into the conversation."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"This is a great point, I didn't think of Arrow because season 3 and after is so spotty, but it started out amazing and it was pursuing the shared universe right around when the MCU did. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a deluge of superhero shows and shared television universes in the next decade that make this a no brainer. However, I think I'd probably put ""flarrowverse"" or ""cwverse"" as a whole on the list rather than just Arrow, since I feel like the year end crossover events are what have been most influential"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Heard lots of great things about Miami Vice, really important that it tried to change up the look of TV. I also heard that it was the first TV show to use licensed music as a background track? And honestly I think several of my best TV moments of all time use licensed music in some way"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Absolutely great choice, Sesame Street definitely defined children's television. I've been trying to track down early episodes and haven't been successful, I wish it was more available as a historical document of what kids shows were like when it debuted.

Also heard a lot of great things about ER! The ""filmed like a movie"" aspect is so important and way ahead of its time, with shows like Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Falcon and the Winter Soldier definitely going for that ""movie made for TV"" aspect that I think we're only going to be seeing more and more of in the 20s"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Yeah, I think if it had maintained the quality of the first season/first few seasons it'd definitely be a contender, but the ""showing that genre tv can appeal to a mainstream audience/can be ""prestige"" "" ended up happening more with Game of Thrones. I think The Walking Dead did kind of set Game of Thrones up for success, and I think if I was making this list in maybe 2012 or earlier it'd be a no brainer.

The Office is a good choice, I didn't end up picking any comedy for the 00s but it would be between Arrested Development and The Office. I definitely think The Office was more influential and had a huge influence on modern shows, it makes sense to include it. It also continued the cynical streak of Seinfeld/The Simpsons, but then it wrapped around into being more optimistic by the end. 

It kind of feels like we've come full circle, where I Love Lucy was super lighthearted and optimistic, and then we got more and more cynical peaking with Seinfeld/Larry Sanders Show, and with The Office, Parks and Rec, Ted Lasso, Schitt's Creek etc it seems like hopeful/idealistic TV is the new trend, and I think the US Office making Michael Scott more sympathetic kind of kicked that off.

Do you think you'd include the US version, the UK version, or both in the canon?"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"He's referring to canon in the sense of the ""literary canon.""  Basically:

>the list of works considered to be permanently established as being of the highest quality

That term itself is derived from an older usage related to which books were included in the compilation of the Bible.  They were 'canon' if they were considered the official world of god.

The definition you're referring to - used for 'official' entries in pop culture universes (""Star Trek canon"") is much newer bastardization of that concept."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"This was kind of my thought, I heard it's quality varies quite a bit but it seems to have done the ""person wakes up in a mysterious place and has to solve a sci fi mystery"" thing before anyone else, and it became such a staple of TV in the past 30 years"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"I think the hate LOST gets is wildly overstated. The ending was controversial, for sure, but it was enjoyed by many and misunderstood by more. The false narrative that “they were dead the whole time” quickly spread into the social consciousness such that even folks who never watched the show knew “how it ended and it sucked.”

Interestingly, many of the people who have binged it for the first time recently (due to lockdowns, etc.) go to the r/LOST subreddit and gush about how much the loved it and are surprised at how much they enjoyed the ending, since they had heard it was terrible. I think the show was ahead of its time and was one of those zeitgeist-altering experiences that are few and far between, whatever one thinks of the final episode."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),I know. It also brought lesser known comic book characters into spotlight. I wish they made a live action sereis about Red Robin.
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),I thougth they were synonymous arrowverse and CWverse.
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"> best TV moments of all time use licensed music in some way

Such as?"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"I think the early episodes might be on Netflix labeled as sesame street ""for adults"" since it was a bit trippier, had characters smoking out of a pipe and taught things like civil disobedience (it was a show made in the 60's after all). They might also be available on HBO max too. I know for a fact that they exist on DVD."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),I would say just us version.  There are many big British sitcoms but I can’t pick one
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),Til there’s more than one version of canon. Cheers
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Yep, this is it exactly, canon has two definitions. Also, my personal list of ""best shows ever"" doesn't look anything like this, this is more ""shows that received a lot of critical acclaim and influenced the medium."" Basically, I'm looking for the TV equivalent of Citizen Kane, Moby Dick, Shakespeare, etc"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"It's also a really early, and still very good ""What does it mean to be human in a world becoming increasingly built to stamp out humanity and individuality"" show."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"You make a good point, I wasn't aware that so many people still liked it so much, that's good to hear. I also started a pandemic rewatch (didn't get past season 2 just cause it's such a long show), and thought ""wow most of the mysteries people complain about did actually get solved.""

I think you're right that it definitely was a huge cultural moment, and it made big long form genre shows more popular. Another big thing is it's flashback structure, which still gets copied constantly."
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Definitely a really interesting theme for a show to tackle, especially in the 60s!"
Monty Python Best Bits (mostly),"Yeah, I think it popularized the use of in-depth flashbacks (OitNB used flashbacks in a similar way, for example). 

Another hallmark is the use of non-linear storytelling, which really set the show apart at the time. It is still a lesser-used technique, but when it does show up, you can see a lot of LOST’s influence (e.g., True Detective, Westworld, Bloodline, etc.).

The show has is fair share of flaws, but it’s difficult to overstate its influence on television."

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,It's an epoch in comedic endeavor.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,First time I saw Monty Python was in a movie released in the 70's of some of the beset material from the show and my god I was laughing about this skit for years.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Fun fact: typing the joke into Google translate will result in a fatal error
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,dont think I ever laughed more than when watching ANFSCD

???"
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Well, quite."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Literally the first Monty Python sketch I ever saw. Just the absurdity of it all caught my interest and I've been a fan ever since.

One thing I've always loved about their sketches were their segways. To start off in a Barber Shop to the ""end"" with a psuedo 4th wall breaking bit about the sketch was just masterful."

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Couldn't get away with making fun of cross dressing in 2020.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Should it seem unusual and taboo for a man to crossdress and look for sexual action in bars? Discuss.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,The laughtrack is really distracting.  Do modern sketch shows still use it as much?

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Monty Python is so awful. Lol, it’s “comedy” for nerds who wish they were British."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,[segues]
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Me too! I think I used to run around in the 4th grade signing this song in the house. Probably the day my Dad stopped liking me
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Does that mean it's the wife writing using her husband's signature?
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"No worries, I get this song stuck in my head at least once a month."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"My college team is the Lumberjacks, i used to love to sing this song as I walked across campus."

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"You have enormous balls calling one of the most beloved comedy troupes of all time ""awful"". Good luck with the karma."

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,I suck at grammar.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"[spelling] ... unless of course you did actually run around tossing ASL hands, in which case, way cool!"
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Lol honestly! Before I even saw Monty Python my dad would sing an astronomy parody all the time. Had no clue where it came from till I saw MP years later
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Yesssss!

To answer your question, it depends on the kink. I'm not familiar enough with the term to know whether it includes unethical things."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Wow. I ah.. I forgot those were once a thing.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"That's a bad example. If there wasn't a laugh track, they wouldn't insert pauses for the laugh track."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,I actually kind of like it better this way.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"I'm pretty sure that if you had the same actors with the same or a similar script not pausing for the laugh track, the scene might still work."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"The difference being that back in the day of Monty Python, the shows didn't *need* the hooting of a studio audience to let the home audience know that something was supposed to be funny."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"""I wish I'd been a girly, just like my dear papa!""

As a trans woman who's father killed himself out of the pain of being a trans woman in denial, it kind of hits a bit close to home.  Crossdressers don't wish they were girls, unless they are in fact girls.

The song isn't inherently hateful, but the fact its supposed to be a comedy when its about a deadly serious issue is something I take offense to.  Like, oh here's someone grappling with who they are and in denial about it, haha how embarrassing.  The humor comes entirely from the mocking of who the singer is."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Nah, I have ears and a brain. Monty Python is nothing but yelling random shit and people thinking it’s brilliant because it’s in a British accent."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,It would take all of reddit to kill my karma. That’s why I can say shit like this. Lol

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Flanel is awesome, keep on rocking it."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"I know, it's so ridiculous. If it hurts someone's feelings it isn't allowed."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Based on the lyrics, it sounds like the lumberjack is a trans woman in denial, not a cross dresser. Making fun of that is...yup super serious and not funny at all."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Kink more or less means 'fetish' nowadays, ideally referring to stuff relaxed to sex but not actually including sex."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Have you never been to a live comedy show or play?
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"That wasn't the point of doing it back in the day. Most of these people were improve comedians and stage actors that are used to working with an audience to get a feel for the timing and feed off that energy. The youtube generation is used to working without an audience, so it seems weird to have to need one."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,What sketch comedy do you enjoy?
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"What did you think of it in 1970 when it was, you know, new?"
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Oddly enough, as someone who is British, the accent isn’t what makes it special."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,LOL. You wrote “signing”... thought you might be deaf...
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Thx man! Idk, feel like lumberjack is nowhere near the worst thing to be likened to lol"
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Oh you can hurt people's feelings. There are only a few specific groups whose feelings can't be hurt.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"As a real bonafide trans person, I have absolutely no issue with this song."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Yes, very sad that mentally ill people are manipulated into mutilating their bodies instead of getting the psychological help that they need."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"> Kirk more or less means 'fetish' nowadays, ideally referring to stuff relaxed to sex but not actually including sex."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Is that like where you put your phone in a cardboard box and wear it on your head?
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,The funny kind.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"As also a bonafide trans person, the song itself isn't inherently bad, it's the ridicule that's thrown towards the lumberjack by the real-world audience."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,What a thought provoking response. Really adds to the conversation.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,More thought provoking than shitty Monty Python humor.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Hey, /u/kevonicus... Why don't you sit on my face, and tell me that you love me."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus, Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"More thought provoking than jokes about Proust, Schopenhauer?"
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Is that a Monty Python quote? Someone always tries to use a quote and it just ends up proving how unfunny Monty Python is. Lol
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,"Oh shut up, you silly bitch. It's just a bit of fun."
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Sounds like a shitty Monty Python attempt at comedy.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,You wanna make out?
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,Stop that. Stop that. This is just silly.
Monty Pythons Flying Circus,If you put the German version of the joke into Google Translate the translation comes back as [fatal error].

Monty Pythons Flying Circus,The Killing Joke
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Oh boy! I hope it's as good as their Deathnote adaptation.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Even though I know its unlikely I hope they take some notes from the abriged series.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Cool! I hope they improve on the source material, though."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Here's how I would translate this for an American audience. Just focus the whole show on the first arc set up the characters and jump back and forth from the game world to the real world. Therefore allowing to see how the real world would react to 10,000 being held hostage in a game. If they would that I think we could have a good show here. Also, give the main characters some actual characteristics instead of one note."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Sword Art Online is going to be ""an essentially Japanese property"" right up until the [tentacle rape scene](http://www.afterbuzztv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-31-at-6.32.21-PM.png) and then they suddenly decide ""Hey, that might be a bit *too* Japanese."""
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,I feel like they’d have to try and make it half as bad as the Anime is. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Monster? Nope. Code Geass? Nope. Steins gate? Nope. Psycho Pass? Nope. Freaking Sword Art Online? Yes...

Well maybe I should be glad that actually good series aren't the ones being ruined in live action."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,No i want Asuna to be played by a ukrainian or russian cosplayer with japanese dubbing
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Aww, I was looking forward to the thinkpieces and toxic fan environment."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Does this mean it's just a Japanese studio making it and they're slapping the ""Netflix Original"" label on it because they have an exclusive license, or is it actually an American studio making it but using Asian actors? Japanese live action movies and tv shows are always really low-budget and wonky looking (well, live action anime adaptations I should say, obviously Japanese film is one of the richest cinema cultures in the world if you include Kurosawa, etc. On an unrelated note, get streaming rights for Kurosawa movies, Netflix!)"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I can't think of a single live action adaptation that has improved on the original. Some have been terrible, some have been ok and maybe one or two could be considered ""good"" but they have all been lesser versions of the original."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Isn't SAO widely consider a shitty anime? Why would they want to do a live action verison?
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Only way to make this good is to replace kirito with abridged Kirito
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Is the anime worth watching? My anime-obsessed friend hates it, but I want to give it a shot. The premise sounds interesting."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Why would they choose to make a live action version of such a terrible anime?
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"If Netflix couldn't make a good adaptation out of a good animanga (Death Note), I have zero hope for their working with a dumpster fire like SAO."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I mean this is kinda cool and all but it feels kind of like a monkeys paw situation to get this news about SAO. Of all the fucking things that are gonna be adapted to live action and stay true to the source material ,Sword "" Two years worth of semen"" art online being the one feels like a cruel joke.

Plus from what i've heard about it Ready player one is already the American version of SAO."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,They gotta cast Japanese actors though.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I have no idea why they're making a live-action version of SAO... but it can't really be much worse than the anime.

This does give me a tiny bit of hope, so I might watch just to see whether it's as bad as the source material."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I have only watched a few episodes of this anime, but from what I hear the first season should be where you stop.  All the extra seasons ruin it, right?"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,if they can expand some of the concepts in the first season that would be cool but the stuff with the fairies was all dumb 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"After death note,i'm not even sure they can adapt something as bad as sao."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Live action videogame stuff? SAO related? No and double no.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"You know...not everything needs a live action version. Looking at you death note, ghost in the shell, beauty and the beast"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Here's how I'd handle a live-action adaptation:

1. Instead of a two year time skip, I'd have a lot of multi-episode 'filler' mini-arcs where Kirito either goes on random adventures or helps raiding parties clear bosses and progress through the various floors.

2. The Moonlit Black Cats would feature more prominently in the story and we'd see Kirito slowly befriend them more; especially Sachi who he will have a romantic relationship with. [spoiler](#s ""This would make their deaths far more dramatic since the viewers would get far more attached to the characters than they did in the anime."")

3. I'd make Kirito really socially awkward at first but become more of a sadistic antisocial asshole like the Abridged parody version of the character as the story goes on; especially after the Moonlit Black Cats arc where he becomes increasingly bitter and insular.

4. I'd introduce Suguha and Leafa in Sword Art Online. Rather than play Alfheim, she actually dives into the world of SAO in search for her cousin and willingly dives into the death game in an attempt to rescue him. Unlike her anime counterpart, Suguha doesn't have a crush on her cousin. She is introduced to Kirito but never finds out his real identity until later in the series [spoiler](#s ""which shatters both their in-game romantic relationship and their real-life familial relationship. Unlike the anime, they don't reconcile either and the whole experience has lasting implications."") 

5. I'd end the series with [spoiler](#s ""a final boss battle against Kayaba Akihiko on the 100th floor. None of this 'Heathcliff is Kayaba' bullshit. I mean Heathcliff would still be a really strong guild leader but he'd just be good at the game."")

6. I'd make dual wielding a core mechanic of the game and not just a special ability Kirito obtains because he is the chosen one.

7. I'd explore more of the romantic subplots between Sachi, Lisbeth, Silica and Leafa. I'd make them actual relationships which develop and fall apart in various ways. [spoiler](#s ""I'd also make sure that Kirito doesn't end up with Asuna."")

7. Alfheim Online never happened. [spoiler](#s ""This means no Asuna being held against her will by a guy who wants her hand in marriage who has her imprisoned in a tentacle rape dungeon."")"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Or, here's a crazy idea: Don't make a live action version of a story that's already been told perfectly well in animation.

Well... ""perfectly well.""  It's not a great tv show.  But still, I don't think mediocre acting and shitty CG is going to improve it.  Just watch the show that already exists, you need to hear this story so much."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Or they could pull an Altered Carbon and make their in-game avatars white and real world selves Asian.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I view that as a bad omen. Look, first of all I dont want to sound like someone who pretends to not care about representation but then gets real butthurt when there is no white lead, I think representation is a good thing. Secondly I don't mean to say that non-white protagonist is only okay if they are controlled by a different white protagonist and romantic interest. And I dont think that the movie Frozen is reprehensible propaganda, god no. BUT the information in the article does make me think that it could be sacrificing authenticity in story telling for the sake of forced representation. And this does make me worry about the future of anime adaptions. Give me a chance, this is a bit complicated.  
  
1) In a post-racial world maybe it shouldnt matter if in an international story randomly you have characters of a whatever race, but im afraid that in art things do usually have a purpose, things just are not random, or at least are not received as random by the viewers. My suggestion is, you can totally have an asian lead and a bunch of asian or whatever characters, but if the two core characters both are asian looking surrounded by a bunch of non-asian people, then this setup will almost always be or be received as some sort of a message, even if it is not meant that way. Even in 200 years in a completely global mixed communist perfect world they would watch this movie from our time and think ""okay, is there a reason these two leads are asian? considering the context of the world they are in?"". Maybe there could be a reason, but judging from the statements from one of writers it doesnt seem that way.  
  
2) The above is not my real issue. What bothers me is that authors would be willing to care less about important parts of a characterization of protagonists, maybe out of good intentions, but to the detriment of the story telling. The writer says ""it is an asian story"", but... this does not mean anything here, its a very empty claim. And I would not even care that much if this was just a whatever tvshow, but this is one of the first big anime adaptions in tv form, and especially here I think that when there constantly are these awkward political issues in the room it will be a detriment or rather, meaningful delay to this whole endeavour.  
  
I totally want audiences to call for things like representation when the industry for whatever reasons does not deliver enough, and I want authors and industry leaders who take that to heart then, and be maybe influenced in what stories they tell and how they conduct business. But I really dont want already present stories to be reshaped into something less authentic and meaningful. Otherwise people might always look back on this age of early anime adaptions as something that cant be divorced from its societal context. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Because Asuna seems to be natural redhead isn't she only like half-Japanese though?
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Sure because clearly the characters are totally Asian.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,It's sad that this is considered newsworthy.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,You kept the Potato Chip Scene from Sword Art Online!? 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Death Note was like the best unintentional comedy film, that I've seen last year."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Laugh all you want, Willem Defoe fucking slayed in that"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Deathnote was as good as you should have expected a direct-to-netflix adaption to be

Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"""Kirito, it says I got XP! Is that bad?"""
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"It's crazy how much better the abridged series is than the real one in terms of character development and depth. Not to mention Kayaba's motivation for turning SAO into a death game...
              
Here's episode one of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"They really fleshed out the characters more in that, plus the humor about mmos would be nice"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Sociopath Kirito is the best
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,that series was awesome when they were following release schedule with the timeline
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Honestly, it's a kind of fun premise that could be very cool if they make it less of a kinky okaku erotic fiction and more of a science fiction adventure story."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,the first arc of the first season was absolutely incredible. it went downhill when they got brought out of it
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Or since the author's already rewriting the first chunk to make it less shit, just do Progressive. No stupid time skips, actually keep that weight from the first couple episodes instead of having them jump straight to OP as hell."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Yeah maybe they will just focus more on the whole your stuck in a death game and how people deal with that and learn to survive and get strong, rather than time jump all over the place and blow up their cool idea in a half a season.  

Those months that it just timeskips over in the first say 5 episodes would be so interesting, guilds forming figuring out how to farm and explore without losing people, setting up an economy and things like that, discovering all the unknown stuff would be interesting but they speed past it to have main character be the master."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"No, no, all the characters gotta keep trying to see how well Kirito can ""duel wield""."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"> Also, give the main characters some actual characteristics instead of one note.
       
How will ~~weebs~~ the audience self-inset if every character doesn't exist solely to talk about how great the ""*character*"" Kirito is? Kirito needs his harem!
        
You also forgot: Stop having the second lead get sexually assaulted for titillation purposes. Find a new way to put them in distress. Tentacle rape isn't enough to sell merchandise and blu-rays here. Be more creative than just rapey bad guys.   "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Aww I was looking forward to my live action tentacle monster rape scene.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,jesus i completely forgot about that
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Excuse me, but where the hell is that scene from?"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,just add twice the tentacle rape 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,what’s the point of making steins gate or psycho pass into live action shows? they’re already perfect. a remake has nowhere to go but down. SAO on the other hand has room for improvement. starting first off with getting rid of the harem crap. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,CG wouldn't translate well because of the mecha.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Code Geass would be absolutley incredbile, especially given how racially diverse the cast inherently is and the cool geopolitics of the show, but fuck me they'd never be able to do the fight scenes. You're forgetting it's a mech show.  That would be incredibly expensive, unfeasible, actually"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I don’t know about Code Geass.

I mean, if anyone knows about oppressing the Japanese, it would be America."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Pretty much of all series adapt they picked wrong one and the actors will be the one's blamed when shit bombs.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Curb your fanboyism, just because a trash live action movie doesn’t take away from the series. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Aight I agree with you
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,She should be played by a Japanese person…
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Don't you worry, just slapping ""Sword Art Online"" on a thing guarantees you thinkpieces and a toxic fan environment no matter what happens."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"> toxic fan environment.

Actually, I just remembered it's an anime adaptation, so we'll get that no matter what.

"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Don't worry, it's SAO, there will still be plenty to complain about by dint of its very existence."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,[deleted]
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,I just hope it'll be a series rather than a movie like Death Note was. I was so excited when I heard an adaption was being made then it turned out to be a movie. How does someone crunch hours of content into 1.5 - 3hrs? I won't jump ship until it's released or more is said. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,American studio. The Altered Carbon creators are behind this.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Actually SAO has such a shit original I'm half expecting the American version to be better written.  SAO the novel was never really meant to be published, it was a web novel from a writer who went on to write better things that inexplicably got popular out of nowhere 16 years after he'd written it and then it just snowballed into one of the biggest anime franchises of all time because weebs and otakus like VR and anime girls"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Most can't compare to a story that takes a day or two to fully tell in 2 hours. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,i think inception is far better than paprika.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Because it's a shitty anime that's extremely popular.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"It makes mountains and mountains of paper dude.  It's shitty, but by god is it profitable, in both japan and America.  Even youtubers rake in the dough when they make videos about it"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"It's ironic that it's being called shitty yet it makes bills. Kinda wonder the type of people calling it shitty. I mean supposedly there have been ""better"" animes, yet make a fraction of what SAO makes. By the end of the day, if your ""good"" anime isn't making much, there goes the future of that anime. It's like most of the ppl bashing SAO do not realistically understand that anime is a product that is being sold for money. If you do not profit, IMHO it's not ""good""."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"No, it's terrible. The concept is good and has potential for indepth exploring, but it's wasted on being a power nerd fantasy with waifus and harems. Think Twilight for guys. I only manage to watch half the first season and then stopped. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"good premise, shit execution.

just do the [abridged.](https://youtu.be/V6kJKxvbgZ0)"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,I have seen far worse.  I would say it’s an ok show if you just watch the first arc.  Stop when that obviously is over and you have seen a mostly ok story with some really nice art and a cool concept.
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"People on reddit hate it but I remember loving it when it came out, at least I loved the first season. Later seasons were kind of a mess."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,its fun but cringe-worthy in plenty of moments 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"It's good.  It's about a guy, Kirito, who understands the game they're locked in and becomes mostly OP and while a *harem* does happen, the MC is actually dating Asuna which is atypical of your normal anime with a harem.  I enjoyed it but I don't take things too seriously."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I actually enjoyed it very much. However, stop at episode 14, its the best poetic ending. If you go on, your curiosity might lead you down some weird episodes.

When I rewatched with my wife, i stopped at episode 14 and said nothing else came after, the end. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"> Is the anime worth watching?

Only the first cour (13 episodes or so) is decent. The rest ranges from mediocre to terrible."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,The first few episodes are good. The idea was great when it was called .hack. The abridged is amazing 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"the first 13 episodes are pretty good. the music is exceptional. after episode 13 it just becomes retarded and pointless. also, you have to be capable of looking past the cliche harem plotpoints that so many anime suffer from. it’s not too much of a harem. it’s about level 6 harem. but it’s there. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"You can watch the abridged series inside, it executes the concept better by making the characters more true to life.  That doesn't mean you'll like them, in fact, they're intentionally grating, but so are actual MMO players

It's better written and it's funnier, which counts for something.  Voice acting is also pretty alright, I'd say it's the third most popular abridged series of all time after DBZ and Yugioh"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"From what I understand, the first season is perfectly fine.  Just don't go beyond that, lol"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"The first season is good, although it suffers from quite a few cliches. Namely the main character being a outcast nerd who is OP in another (virtual) world. I think it manages to hold up despite this, but I believe that others could point you to other anime that pulls this type of plot off in a better fashion.

Later seasons range from bland to awful as more cliches are thrown in, character progression halts, and the main character becomes too OP for any climax to stick."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"It has a good premise, if you have to watch it, watch the abridged series, it really cuts out a lot of the crap and makes a lot of improvements to it. Like making it less of a nerd fantasy with waifus."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online," watch the abridged series

it takes the premise and makes something with it"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,Watch the first arc and stop. That's about half way through the first series and in my opinion it's fantastic until that moment where it drops the ball so hard that I can't even comprehend a suitable metaphor to describe how hard that ball dropped. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,It's a great concept. 
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,They made a movie as well
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"although I’ll never watch it and forget it exists in a week, it’s likely to be better than netflix’s death note.

easier to improve a piece of trash than a new spin on a classic."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"look less at where the money comes from, but at who the director or writer is. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"To be fair, Death Note 2017 was quite a bit better than the Japanese adaptions."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Asuna has naturally blonde hair, which is a strictly European trait.  

Asians all have dark hair, 
Australian Aborigines all have dark hair,
Africans all have dark hair, 
Micronesians all have dark hair, 
Polynesians all have dark hair, 
Eskimos/Inuits all have dark hair, 
Native North Americans all have dark hair,
Native South Americans all have dark hair, 
Arabs all have dark hair, 
Persians all have dark hair,
and people from India all have dark hair.

So if you don't want to replace the character's original race with an actor of another race, you would have to cast a white actress for Asuna.  "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"If you really want to give it a go, yes. That was how I approached it back then at least with the first 14 episodes of season 1. "
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"You should stop about 3 episodes in. The first half of the first arc is okay, and then it gets worse and worse. Season 2 is also terrible except for the brief arc where Kirito is almost totally absent."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"I mean, the anime itself is an adaptation.  I don't see why there's not space for another one.  I think it could be pretty interesting to see it in live action, as the setting is rather low-fantasy (in the first series) and probably very easy to adapt.  I probably wouldn't watch the different SAO 'games' though.  I don't think any of the later stories were better than the first."
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"Feel free to not watch adaptations that don't appeal to you. Personally I'd like to see my favourite franchises in as many formats as possible.

That said I will never invest a single second more into the dog shit franchise that is Sword Art Online"
Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online,"The Anime is a light novel adaptation, so... why tell an animated version of a story that's already been told in print?"
Something in the Rain,"Just changing channels and having something that will like catch my attention, also helped having a lot of procedurals where I didn't really need to know the plot.

Also back in the day if there was something on TV on the weekend most people will have likely watched that same thing by the beginning of the week and easy to talk about it. Now... people probably don't want to talk about a show until they get time to binge watch it. Then again things like reddit were not quite as prominent so easier to find another community for it."
Something in the Rain,"Holliday episodes where whacky fun shit happens because “just because”

I like them because it allows characters to explore relationship dynamics"
Something in the Rain,Saturday morning cartoons
Something in the Rain,"I've pretty much gone full circle in that I appreciate weekly episodes instead of full season drops. Some shows seems to need that gap between episodes so that you can talk about it, analyze and build up anticipation for next week. 

&#x200B;

I do however like that TV are more ""movie like"" with a full story arc over a season and higher production value."
Something in the Rain,"The classic writing structure of traditional tv. Each 45 minute episode had a set-up, a climax and something at the end that made you wanna tune in again next week (could be a cliffhanger, could also just be an emotionally satisfying end of the specific episode arc that gave you happy feels). 

That style of writing made it happen that viewers still - many years later - distinctly remember specific episodes of LOST or Buffy or early Supernatural.

New shows written for the binge model tend to blur together. You remember individual scenes more than full episodes. Lots of episodes just kinda end and continue in the next one, with not much thought about when to make the cut. The biggest downside for me of treating every story like an 8 hour movie and not like a tv show."
Something in the Rain,">it gave fans a predictable timetable of when they could expect their shows to come back, whereas now, not only do most shows take over one year to come back, but it varies between seasons.

I do miss that. While the downsides of that system outweigh the benefits (I'm happier without it), I do acknowledge that there was a benefit to predictability. The 2-year gap between the end of S5 of Better Call Saul and the premiere of S6 was brutal."
Something in the Rain,I miss the 20 episode seasons
Something in the Rain,Cultural zeitgeist
Something in the Rain,"This is gonna be weird, but the idea that you don't have much of a choice on what's on.

It's like that BDSM thing where people get off on being told what to do. Streaming lets us have all these choices, but we sometimes get paralyzed and end up watching nothing. 

TV forces you to just accept what's on and you won't be inclined to switch channels or put shows on hold because there's no way to watch what you missed."
Something in the Rain,"Im sure others can think of more examples but I inly know of one that comes to mind but it was viral advertising for shows. During I think season 2 of Lost, after episodes aired, a fake Oceanic Airlines ad would run, it had a number to call and the number would play a strange message. It basically led to an ARG game through a website that provided more mysteries and lore into the island and such."
Something in the Rain,"Shouting ""it's ONNNNN"" as the show comes back from commercial and hearing madly running feet as everyone hurries to make it back in time.

It was also very different when there was no guarantee that there would necessarily ever be re-runs of anything, so there was at least some sense that this might be the only time you could experience something.  Now you get people saying 'well I'm looking forward to seeing how this works for me on a rewatch' almost as soon as a new series drops, which is for sure a nice option to have, but a very different experience with the stories."
Something in the Rain,I miss premiere week in September and watching all my shows until May where they would all end roughly around the same time. I also miss watching the new episodes live rather than just watching the new episode whenever it is released in the day.
Something in the Rain,"The expectation that you could watch a random episode of a show you'd never seen before and get a complete story with a beginning, middle and end. And if there was anything from past episodes that was relevant to that story, the show would fill you in with some exposition or *maybe* a ""Previously on..."" sequence at the beginning.

The expectation's flipped now: people expect everything to be serialised instead. I got into watching Star Trek on TV when I was a kid by watching random episodes I rented on video, and I knew that would work fine. Now you see people all the time being like ""*But where do I staaaaaaaaaaarrrt?!?!?*"""
Something in the Rain,"I miss the watercooler aspect of discussing TV shows.

With a lot of streaming stuff being released all at once, it does not have the staying power that shows in the past did, because you don't give it time to build.

Hell, I remember Stranger Things S4 a lot better than I do the other seasons, just because they broke it up in half."
Something in the Rain,"Yearly releases and 20-24 episode seasons. 

These nearly 2yr or longer breaks between seasons, which was happening even before Covid, is generally a death sentence for show. Rarely do shows have these long breaks and survive after the second season mostly due to the lack of advertising that the next season is even coming out. On top of that by the time the next season comes out you have mostly forgotten what happened in the previous season and have to go watch or read recaps just so you're not completely lost. Hunters is a great example of this, the first season was at the very beginning of 2020 and the second season just dropped in January so 3yrs between the seasons it's been so long we forgot most of what happened besides which main characters had been killed so we tried to rewatch some of the first season just to refresh, but unfortunately it turned out Amazon had re-edited the entire first season cutting out nearly 2hrs of content and actually cut some very important character development scenes.

I'm not saying every show needs 20-24 episode seasons, but half hour sitcoms need more than 8-10 episodes. You are just barely getting to know the characters and as soon as you are getting into the show it's already over especially with how they drop all the episodes at once rather than weekly so you have a burst of people talking about it for about a week and then it's completely forgotten about until you hear it's been canceled."
Something in the Rain,Episodes that were basically just there to develop character. Every single thing is just plot nowadays. I Miss the balance
Something in the Rain,"Honestly, all the ""discourse"" that surrounds every TV show is exhausting now. TV and movies were better without any of that intensity.

There is so much pre-release and post-release discussion and hype around every show and movie now. It feels like it takes away from the experience of just watching something and enjoying it, instead of having a million people try to bombard you with their hot takes online."
Something in the Rain,"Randomly starting a show, from episode 14 season 3 because thats when you zipped and it was on, and now you watch it."
Something in the Rain,"1. Episodic television. Obviously, story arcs are superior, but since Netflix has taken over, most streaming shows have this ""everything is one long movie"" approach to storytelling when most shows don't have a main story arc to justify it. 
A lot of shows would be better with a few single-story episodes with a story arc around it so your television show doesn't feel like one big slog with no variety in between the episodes. 

2. I miss 13 episode seasons. Definitely felt like that was the sweet spot between too much, 22-episode seasons and currently not enough 8-episode seasons."
Something in the Rain,"The timing and hype.

LOST always comes to mind.  At its peak, I remember everyone HAD to be home watching.  During the week between episodes, there was so much speculation and discussion about what was going to happen.  It was like a weekly, mass event.

Now I feel like I'm always an episode behind, and always amazed at how everyone else seemed to find the time to binge 12 hrs of a new season all in a weekend while I'm on episode 3 of 12."
Something in the Rain,Its easy to make convo when everybody is watching the same media.
Something in the Rain,"1. Longer seasons.  Shorter seasons have their place, but they go by so quickly.  I am rewatching DS9 and I love that they have the space (ha!) for long story arcs, but also here's an episode about Quark's mom.
2. Being excited in the fall when TV shows came back and sweeps weeks because you knew they'd throw their best at you.  Now shows come with such unpredictability that it just feels random.
3. Finally, the way TV shows would mark the passing of time during the week.  You knew what was on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and so on.  It sort of set the tone for your whole week.  Objectively, on demand is better.  But I do kind of miss how excitement would build during the week and then you made sure you were home when the shows you really liked came on, or if you were desperate, set up a VCR.  Now I often don't even realize when new episodes have come out because it's all on demand.  I just check the streaming services and see what's new, but I don't normally think ""Thursday night, here's what is coming on."""
Something in the Rain,Watching on the same night so we can talk about it the next day instead of working.  :)
Something in the Rain,I miss catching up with people after the show aired the night before and chatting about it.  You can't do that anymore as everyone is on their own schedule.
Something in the Rain,Everybody watching at the same time so you have something to talk about with co workers and friends
Something in the Rain,"Appointment viewing! That sense of community you used to get when a show was so massively popular that pretty much everyone you knew was making time to watch it, at the same time, every single week. 

I remember during the first season of Survivor, no one ever made plans on Thursday, because that was Survivor night. Then you'd go into school or work on Friday, and know exactly what everyone was discussing."
Something in the Rain,Knowing the time
Something in the Rain,Bright lighting and audible dialogue
Something in the Rain,"Just turning on the TV and flipping through channels, analog style. None of this waiting for the channel to load. Could be through 10 channels in five seconds. 

Don’t get me wrong, on the whole streaming is better. But the whole having to actively decide what to watch is annoying sometimes. Sometimes I just want to flip until I find something good enough. 

I realize of course I could still get cable and flip channels, but the commercials on non-streaming have gotten way out of control."
Something in the Rain,"I miss finding a show because you stumble upon it while channel surfing and you would have ignored it otherwise. Many shows owe their success to being found this way and word of mouth spreading.

Now we are just fed content that is similar to everything you’ve watched before because of algorithms.

It’s an issue and what has happened to Music. Smaller artists complain they get less listens than they would before streaming because they are ignored - people listen to what is fed to them and can’t be discovered"
Something in the Rain,"I miss being able to talk about tv shows with people in real life as opposed to just online.  When I was young, there were 3 or 4 channels and at any given time only one or maybe two of those channels would be showing anything that appealed to children, or women, or men or whatever demographic you were in.  So, the next day you could talk to whoever was at school or in the office about what you watched the night before because at least half the people around you would have watched the same thing.  Now, not only am I not watching the same shows, I have never heard of most of the shows that my friends are watching and they have never heard of the shows I am watching.  And we are the same demographic (middle aged, suburban soccer moms)!  If I want to talk about something I am watching I have to go online and talk to strangers."
Something in the Rain,"I miss the bumpers. Not commercials but the ways that networks would create a feeling of watching their channel almost as if it were watching a stage get ready in-between scenes. 

Bumpers really gave you a different feeling about TV it feels like an experience and not just media straight to the eyeballs."
Something in the Rain,"Something that really ended with GoT and hasn't come back even with shows like White Lotus and Last of Us: A singular television show that we can all gather around. 

There's just sooooo much content out there that even the most popular shows are only watched and spoken about by a fraction of people for a fraction of the time. So much joy of television is in the conversations with others and some of the magic is lost when so few people are watching something or everyone is watching so much their attention is split. 

The other thing... its impact on movies. I legitimately miss the theater experience. I go once in a blue moon when there's truly a movie I want to see or believe it should be seen on the big screen. But ultimately, every time is so expensive that it's hard to justify. 

I genuinely believe a critical factor to the loss of the theater movie that isn't superhero or some big action film is because everything else just goes to streaming."
Something in the Rain,"Having non-immediate gratification.

This generation will never know about having to wait for anything,   and the exciting anticipation it would build."
Something in the Rain,There’s something quite special about a 22 episode season taking up 6 months of your life. The stakes on a show like The OC or ER must have felt so real.
Something in the Rain,Sweeps week.  They used to have a week where they took a snapshot of the tv ratings and used it for advertising. So during that week there would be crazy guest stars and soecial eoisodes for all your favorite shows to try to get more people to watch.
Something in the Rain,"We watched the news.  Real news, not the endless pundit shows we have now.

We watched the national news at 5:00 because that's what was on, and then the local news after that.

The networks didn't have to compete, so they did real reporting, and in a half hour, you got 20 real news items.

Now, you can get content tailored to reinforce your own position, or you can ignore it entirely."
Something in the Rain,The weekly TV Guide magazine that would come in the mail.
Something in the Rain,TGIF
Something in the Rain,"Saturday morning cartoons, Disney Afternoon, Wonderful World of Disney, TGIF"
Something in the Rain,"The Fall TV season when the Big 3, then the Big 4 (and other broadcast networks) would introduce all their brand new shows with all the hoopla required in September through October. And the classic TV Guide Fall Preview issues that came each year."
Something in the Rain,"Not something I miss particularly, but I understand their purpose: Filler episodes.

Filler episodes have their purpose, mainly to give some time for actors, writers and crews, they allow to be filmed in such a way they take less days to shoot, and some of the scenarii are written in advance, they also allow to change stuff up when needed, an accident, a death of an actor or a public personality (exterior to the show) or an important event.

Also they help form new writers, something that is lacking in the streaming/binging format. You get all those shows nowaday, but no real experienced writers in it
The 22-26 episodes format allowed to have some episode with rookie writer taking the helm (with some supervision from the head writer) and do their stuff and learn more.

Now, we get stuff like The Witcher, The Wheel of Time, LotR, etc... where writers want to make their mark but disregarding 30, 40, 80 years of lore... and getting a subpar product and the rage of fans.

If you compare that to other show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, NYPD Blue, Lost, Bones, Veronica Mars, to name a few of different genre, they all have some stuff in common, they all have a clear head writer/show runner, they all have filler episodes, but they all have a lot of writers, some more experienced and other less so. But some of those lesser known writers gained fame and are now trusted to have their own project. This happens rarely with the new streaming/binging format, unless they landed one of those now trusted writers."
Something in the Rain,You guys know traditional TV still exists right?
Something in the Rain,24 episode long comedies.
Something in the Rain,"I say this as a viewer as well as someone that works in the industry.

I miss 22 episode seasons."
Something in the Rain,Filler/monster of the week episodes. I feel like so many shows now are 8-12 episodes that are are hurtling to an end point and it's all about getting to that end. I miss when shows could stretch their legs and fool around.
Something in the Rain,"The shared experience. When you went back to school/work the next day, most of your friends would have watched the same stuff at the same time."
Something in the Rain,[Elaborate Sunday night movie intro animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVaJWRfNuQc).

Something in the Rain,"Everyone going to school/work/hang out with friends the next day and discussing the same episode you’d watched the night before.
I remember being in school when Friends finished and it’s all people were talking about.

It sort of happens now with shows that become available to stream weekly, like The Last of Us etc. but back then we only had a few channels so everyone watched the same thing."
Something in the Rain,"I miss the collective following of the show as episodes come out each week, discussions, hypothesises of what will happen next with family, friends and work colleagues."
Something in the Rain,"The absolutely unhinged summer lineup on network TV. Celebrity this, game show that. I always looked forward to those weird shows."
Something in the Rain,"TV was an event. You HAD to watch a certain show at a certain time or you would miss it. Such high stakes haha! 

The event aspect of it, always made it THE thing to talk about the next day. Made everything feel truly special and not oversaturated like today."
Something in the Rain,"I have nostalgia for commercials from a network would have characters from different shows interact. Like cartoon network where cartoons would hang around town, or USA where you might have Michael from Burn Notice sending a care package with sunglasses and C4 to the guy from Royal Pains."
Something in the Rain,I miss good MOTW/Supernatural shows.
Something in the Rain,"Yup - I miss the TV season and episode releasing weekly. It was nice having the summer with just summer programming, or repeats.


I also liked having water cooler shows - now instead of a bunch of theorycrafting week by week and between the breaks, it's people watch at whatever speed and there's no real discussions. It was also nice when shows went on hiatus, there was time for people to catch up!


Now we're just inundated with shit and shows have to sink or swim - no giving them time to try to thrive, if they don't get finished in 3 weeks the series gets cancelled.


Also, filler.


8 episode seasons suck. There, I said it. Sometimes, plots need time to breathe - it doesn't have to go bam bam bam all plot all the time. Just plot doesn't let us learn as much about the characters as we would if there was at least a bit of filler. Filler episodes help us learn a lot about the characters and who they are."
Something in the Rain,"I miss sweeps week. When shows would do the craziest stuff to get viewers.  Also one off episodes of shows with large casts so they can focus on one character who normally doesn't get enough time, or just an episode where they can goof off like in a timeloop or something.  Stuff like that is why the characters from older shows are so iconic and well remembered."
Something in the Rain,"Hearing about a new show, and actually wanting to watch it? Most new show descriptions sound like assignments to be gotten through, rather than entertainment to be enjoyed."
Something in the Rain,"I miss that fact that if you wanted all the shows you paid one price for all the channels(albeit a high price) and then had access to all the shows.  Now I pay for multiple streaming sites, most of which have different tiers now not to mention I have to remember login information and it’s usually just for one or two shows.  90% of the time if I think of some old movie or show I wanna watch it’s either unavailable or I have to pay separately to watch it."
Something in the Rain,"Back in the day, when you turned the TV on, it was on. You didn't have to update software, identify which member of the household you are, or choose from 10 different streaming services before finally locating your show."
Something in the Rain,Can’t lie I miss them catchy song commercials ngl
Something in the Rain,"Turning on the TV and having it come on immediately, in the middle of whatever show was airing on the channel it was last on. Then you could change the channel and it was immediate.

Nowadays I turn on the TV and it takes some time to boot up. Then I have scroll to select a streaming service then I have to scroll to a show (or perform a search). 

I know I’m going tell my grandkids about the good old days when the TV just turned on. I’m sure they’ll giggle and say, “Oh grampa, you’re just making stuff up!”"
Something in the Rain,"This might seem odd, but literally nothing. I find this streaming era superior in every way from binging, to no commercials, it could not come soon enough"
Something in the Rain,I miss having to run to the bathroom between every commercial of a show or movie without wanting to miss anything
Something in the Rain,"Nothing!  I never liked broadcast television and streaming is slowly turning into, On-Demand Broadcast Television, with the ads and the weekly episode release nonsense."
Something in the Rain,Nothing at all
Something in the Rain,"I have largely lost interest in TV, and while I do overall prefer the 'prestige format' and emphasis on cohesive, bigger budget production, I also miss the 90s and early 2000s when a season was like 22+ episodes. I kinda miss the 'dud' episodes, the filler eps that lengthened out even the best shows. 

X-Files, Buffy, and Millennium were all shows I really enjoyed, for example, and they all had episodes that felt lazy and uninspired AF. I kinda miss having those. Now that the emphasis is on quality and a cinematic feel, shitty episodes are judged more harshly, and a lot of times the creators are frustrated because they aren't trying to make duds-- whereas in the past, I think dud-episodes were more of a reality of creating, and creators would be aware going into filming that particular episodes occupied some space between filler and trash."
Something in the Rain,Scheduling. I do binge but sometimes it's over too quick and you're waiting sometimes years for more. I used to like the clearing your schedule getting everything ready for the day and time of your favourite show. Making it a special event during the week. Some shows are still released weekly. Like the Peripheral on Amazon came out every Friday. Good show but also gave me something to look forward to.
Something in the Rain,I don’t miss a single thing about regular TV.  Not one.
Something in the Rain,"Prime time TV watching, Just contemplate the ""must see TV wars""  you had amazing line ups of shows and each channel tried to out do the next.  Which I think led to better shows, they didn't cater to a special interest group but to the masses. Also you had special episodes (google what happened to the NYC sewer system after the Mash Finale) holiday episodes, there's nothing like that now.  You also could setup a weekly cliff hanger MUCH easier.  Think about the first 2 seasons of LOST, or Alias or the original Quantum leap.  They left you guessing for A WEEK or more.  Now all TV shows play out like a movie, because there's no need for a cliffhanger, people just click start next episode.  


Commercials- yes commercials suck but hear me out on this one.  You watch TV now what do you see pharma and insurance ads.  Back then commercials were a spectacle in themselves.  In the hay day of traditional TV you had the Bud commercials, Trailers for new shows and movies, clothing ads, Food ads (Doritos, Pepsi, Coke, McDs, BK, etc.), Computers video games the list went on, and some of these ads were short stories underlying a bigger narrative or ad campaign.  Then there were the jingles and slogans."
Something in the Rain,Movie trailers just playing and you get to see what looks interesting. Same thing with ads for other shows.
Something in the Rain,I really miss having my Thursday night comedies on NBC on a two hour block.
Something in the Rain,"Not much, but streaming has largely eliminated the water-cooler casual discussions.  You get to have it with some shows, but that is only on the internet with the rabid fans who watch it right away.  This leads to more extreme (and sometimes toxic) discussions."
Something in the Rain,"There's something about the feeling of knowing you are watching the exact same thing at the exact same moment as other people. You still get it with sport, but just things like cartoon blocks and knowing people with similar interests to you were doing the exact same thing."
Something in the Rain,"I guess I miss the fact that in the old days, I could channel surf and discover new stuff.  Technically I still can, but there's so much out there that I'm not going to discover via channel surfing because its all on streaming.  And somehow them shoving in my face the new shows or whatever their algorithm decided I would like just isn't the same."
Something in the Rain,Nothing!
Something in the Rain,"Honestly, nothing. 

I spent way more time in front of the TV when I could channel surf, I'd watch whatever was on Comedy Central before or after ""The Daily Show"" or whatnot, and it was fine, but I don't really mind having that time back, even if it's just sleeping a bit more. 

The amount of stuff out there is overwhelming, and it all being spaced out over 20 different streaming services is infuriating (I have hope this will eventually resolve itself because people aren't going to pay for more than, i dunno, 4?) but it was overwhelming in the days of cable as well, we just didn't hear about as many shows because there wasn't social media?"
Something in the Rain,"I might be the only person to say this, but the thing I miss the most is ad breaks. I don't why, but something about them gave life to the tv experience. It also helped make hour long episodes hold your attention for longer. Streaming by comparison feels much lonelier. Even advertisements on services like YouTube feel a bit hollow. It may be just me who has this opinion, but I wish live tv with ad breaks was more popular."
Something in the Rain,Not a damn thing.  Traditional TV was a pain in the ass.  Especially pre-DVR and OnDemand.
Something in the Rain,"20+ episode seasons.

Even ""filler"" episodes, that people constantly complain about, have meaningful character development and lore. Streaming shows are so laser-focused that each season is over by the time i start to partially get invested or care about anything. Disney+ is the worst at this. An average 6 episodes that are maybe 30min long."
Something in the Rain,Nice idea but you’re going to have to watch a commercial every 5 minutes. Read a book
Something in the Rain,"I miss the sense of community; I'm old enough to remember 3 networks and if the President was on, the night was ruined.

We all had to watch the same shows at the same time. If you missed a week, you had to pray it would show up in a rerun, or you'd never see that episode. (Prior to syndication, of course.) 

Now, I'm married with two kids and three grandkids, and between all the streamers and DVR stuff, we all have to wait for each other to catch up with shows before we can talk about 'em."
Something in the Rain,"Just having a standalone story or adventure with well-developed characters, without the creators worrying or fans complaining that it's ""filler"" for not adding into some uninteresting series-long arc."
Something in the Rain,"I like bottle episodes now and then. Cast encounters a problem, resolves it, job done. Not everything is part of a huge dramatic and sometimes exhausting multi-season arc. Maybe they'll reference it in an episode one season later, maybe not.

As a corollary, the writers had to make the episode interesting in and of itself, and not rely on mystery box teasing.

The best shows had a bit of both. X-Files had monster of the week, but also had the ongoing plot about the alien invasion and government's involvement, Fox's missing sister, etc.

House had some major arcs between characters, but most episodes were patient of the week.

It let you get to know the characters more. Like with Star Trek: Discovery, I remember so little of the characters because it was 3 seasons of them dealing with quadrant ending threats almost from start to finish. 

I also miss being able to talk about shows with friends or coworkers more. Because there were fewer shows on, and they aired at the same time, everyone was ""caught up"". Now you have to have picked the same streaming show, and be watching at roughly the same time."
Something in the Rain,I don’t miss anything about traditional TV
Something in the Rain,"That guide… back in the day. Would watch ads… and see what’s on TV. Every few seconds it would freeze for you can see what’s on…

“Aw shit! I missed the channel… gotta wait for a while to catch what’s playing later.”"
Something in the Rain,45 min episodes. People do not know how to pace TV in the 10 hour movie (yuck) era
Something in the Rain,Nothing
Something in the Rain,"I miss people not being loud/interrupting the show by talking to me or each other and just being disruptive. With streaming,m they just assume I'll pause it or skip the video back and bit to catch what I missed instead of being courteous and letting me watch a show in peace. Dramatic tension be damned. I really wish I could be left alone and my time and attention respected just for once."
Something in the Rain,"I just seriously miss the summer break.  I have to admit that I am sadly addicted to TV and as a kid the summer gave me a chance to keep the TV off and enjoy other things.  Than I would wait with anticipation for the TV Guide to show up that had a spotlight on all the new TV SHOWS.  

Now its just an onslaught of content."
Something in the Rain,"Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was horrible! You could only watch a show at a specific time, the reception even over cable wasn't always very good, and then there's the commercials which have just gotten worse!

Nope! I don't miss any of it! I cut the cord before the expression was even coined!"
Something in the Rain,"Not that i like comercials but back when tv was king a lot of companies would put in effort with their comercials. now with a large amount of people watching shows online or via streaming the incentive to still put that effort in just doesn't exsit because people can skip ads or play on their phone until it's over.

atleast in New Zealand growing up there were a bunch of classic ads and jingles that absolutly everyone knew. i can't remember the last time an ad entered the zietgist like they used to."
Something in the Rain,"Ease of access.

On cable:
Turn on TV > Go into the guide > Channel surf until you find something cool > click on the channel > watch it


On streaming:
Turn on TV > Select the app > Click on the search button > Slowly type out what you want to watch > Find it > Click it > select an episode > binge

That, and the lack of binge culture. It was still there, yes, but it was only once a week. 

TL;DR: Streaming takes too long and I hate binge culture."
Something in the Rain,"I know that we can pause/rewind/etc at will but it was a bit exciting to run to the shitter and trying to time it to end right when the commercials were over. 
 
Interestingly enough that’s the first thing I was glad I didn’t have to do when streaming, and even TiVo, became a thing.

I still remember hearing a weird factoid about the Seinfeld finale (I think) where when the commercial break came on there was a record spike in water/energy usage as people took shits and microwaved some food."
Something in the Rain,"There's 89 comments right now, and just about 10% are saying ""nothing."" Just consider that we've been here before - silent to talkies, radio to TV, black-and-white to color - and in retrospect it gets accepted that the transition wasn't 100% to the good. There's always a tradeoff, even if it's a small one.

And there's always marketing involved - sound equipment to be paid for, radios and TVs and color TVs to be sold. Part of the marketing has always been to convince people that the old style has nothing to recommend it. That marketing line (which isn't exclusive to the entertainment field) is almost never true, and isn't likely to be true now."
Something in the Rain,Nothing honestly. Broadcast television was kinda awful back in the day and is like 99% ads these days.
Something in the Rain,Nothing.. Not a thing
Something in the Rain,"Slight tangent, but with all the streaming services gatekeeping and locking their content, and series being split across services (or ""not all episodes in the same space""), I'm beginning to feel nostalgic for torrents.

So much easier to click and download an episode. Despite Netflix being a bit anti-consumer at the moment, I feel sorry for them for forcing the industry open, and then being cannibalized by the competition."
Something in the Rain,"Honestly… nothing. 

I stopped watching TV and switched to YouTube around 2010 - 2011. 

Then jumped on to streaming services."
Something in the Rain,I miss absolutely nothing from traditional TV. honestly.
Lost in Space,"Statement from Estrin's family:

>“Zack Estrin was our everything. The best husband, father, son and friend. He loved to make everyone happy. He loved to make everyone laugh. He loved being a writer/producer and being a part of creating these shows that people enjoyed. But above all, he loved his family and friends. Thank you all for being a part of his life and ours.”

EDIT: Cause of death was cardiac arrest."
Lost in Space,That's really sad. I thought the Lost In Space reboot was unique and had a lot of soul while staying true to a lot of the core themes from the original. Would have loved to see what else could have came out from him.
Lost in Space,Sad when anyone dies at 51. Sorry I didn’t know who he was but my condolences to his family 💐
Lost in Space,That’s super sad.  Does anyone recommend Lost in Space?  Always thought it looked amazing.
Lost in Space,Damn. 51 is young.
Lost in Space,"51, fuck, I'm 53."
Lost in Space,"He actually had a pretty cool career. Prison Break, The River, Point Pleasant, Tru Calling, Once Upon a Time In Wonderland, The Whispers, and he got his start on Charmed and Dawson's Creek before producing that great movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with Will Ferrell. The guy made a lot of hours of entertainment that I really enjoyed watching. A lot of underrated stuff. This is really sad. RIP."
Lost in Space,Oh wow. Lost in space in one of my inspiration to get into directing films. This really sucks.
Lost in Space,That’s too bad….way too young. He did a great job with the LIS reboot.
Lost in Space,Natural causes at 51?
Lost in Space,Too young. Rip
Lost in Space,🙏🏻. At least Lost in Space was able to get by Netflix’s cancellation barriers and saw a proper end.
Lost in Space,At first i thought this must be suicide because of the previous posts on reddit on how devastated he was. Must have been a stressful period for him. The body can only take this much
Lost in Space,since when did reddit become an obituary?
Lost in Space,weak
Lost in Space,How does one die of natural causes at 51?
Lost in Space,"Agreed. That series took me from “really, they remade what?” to binging (edit: bingeing? How do you spell that?) each season when released."
Lost in Space,"Totally agree, and it was a show that my kids and I really enjoyed watching together, which can be hard to find."
Lost in Space,"Totally agree, it’s been a fun reboot that really was fun to watch. Sad that he won’t get to finish the story he helped start. RIP"
Lost in Space,"It's really good. The story is great, characters are great, but the VFX are on another level amongst its contemporaries. Lost in Space was a real gem that really didn't get the attention it deserved."
Lost in Space,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Lost in Space,Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.
Lost in Space,"Some of the backstory falls apart if you pull at the sci-fi, a few big things aren't answered.  But it's heart was always in the right place and I really enjoyed it overall."
Lost in Space,"It's a decent tribute to the original show, down to completely nonsensical logic. Recommended to anyone who likes classic sci fi."
Lost in Space,"It's a fun watch. It's definitely one of the better reboots out there. 

Sure it's a low bar, but still, it's pretty good. If you're already this interested, definitely try it out :D"
Lost in Space,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Lost in Space,"Not really, unless you have kids and are watching it with them. It looks good, but the story gets rather nonsensical very quickly. It's a good show for kids, who will enjoy the young characters, the robot and the cool effects and not worry too much about plot holes or characters acting in an illogical manner."
Lost in Space,"I’m the first episode they keep zooming in on that ugly Judy’s face to be edgy. I’d you can stomach that, it’s worth watching."
Lost in Space,"It’s pretty cool, kind of falls off by the last season, less  believable, but it finishes the story.
The Robinsons are a bunch of geniuses who are in constant peril and keep going on the edge of chaos on their genius ways, mad skills, and somehow sexy robot. The techno babble is convincing. Just ignore anything you know about Relativity, there’s no time dilation to speak of.
Parker Posey is brilliant as ever at making you uncomfortable, but manages a sympathetic villain as Smith."
Lost in Space,Granddaughter and I watched the campy original show and the Netflix version and enjoyed both👍
Lost in Space,"Yeah, just how is this happening?"
Lost in Space,"Damn, haven’t heard anyone mention tru calling in maybe ever but I loved that one"
Lost in Space,Turns out people get sick at all ages
Lost in Space,"""Natural causes"" isn't a thing. Not even when you're old. You die from SOMETHING.

Here it likely means some sort of illness as opposed to suicide, accident, or homicide."
Lost in Space,"I lost a boyfriend I loved dearly to natural causes at 31, it was a pulmonary embolism shortly after he returned from a flight he took. It’s crazy but not super uncommon for healthy young people to randomly be taken. Unfair isn’t even beginning to express how I feel about that part of life."
Lost in Space,"I think you are confusing it with [the ""Final Space"" situation](https://collider.com/final-space-pulled-from-streaming/)."
Lost in Space,Devastated about what?
Lost in Space,Shut up
Lost in Space,"Stroke, heart attack, unpublicized chronic medical issue, cancer, etc. Did your body kill itself? That’s natural causes."
Lost in Space,"Natural means something medical like cancer or heart attack, and not from a gunshot, car accident, a multi story fall, Inigo Montoya's blade, etc."
Lost in Space,Bad Jeans
Lost in Space,"Unaddressed diabetes or irreversible heart damage. There was some woman castmember from the Elvis film that recently died at 44 due to full blockage in her arteries, but I don't recall her being obese or anything. Then there's the slew of athletes with either blockage or undiagnosed arrhythmia like Jason Collier, Neil Reed,  Yinka Dare, Reggie Lewis and Darryl Kile one of the few near recent MLB pros to die while still actively playing."
Lost in Space,"My moms father died at 39 of a heart attack. It’s young and sad but that’s why we got to try and make each day count and good even when it’s a bad day, try and have some great moments"
Lost in Space,"My brother has a heart condition that can kill him if he lifts something over 100 lbs, or if it just feels like it. He’s 40. That said, cardiac arrest doesn’t necessarily mean natural causes. Hookers and blow can cause cardiac arrest."
Lost in Space,"You’re going to see a lot of people suddenly die who are over 45 in the next 10 yrs. Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues. Seriously. It’s just gonna be the norm. Not saying I know this is related but it’s not unlikely."
Lost in Space,Happens all the time. Anterior MI leads to ventricular fibrillation and its all over in 5 minutes unless you have good cpr and interventions to open the artery.
Lost in Space,I had a heart attack at 34. Probably because of how much sugar I consumed despite being at a healthy weight and being active. Sometimes bodies suck.
Lost in Space,"Basically all that means is ""did not die due to outside forces."" It's sad to have a heart attack at 51, but I have no idea what his medical profile or stress levels looked like."
Lost in Space,"My father at 50, my uncle at 50-stroke/heart attack-which are natural causes in medical terms. For us the family they died too young."
Lost in Space,"The story finished.  The last season finished the story (Will Robinson being huge hastened that).

It was such a great family show.  Something that's not seen much these days.  A show that is fun to watch by adults and kids.  They didn't decide to toss in some random boobs and the plot was easy to follow yet very interesting."
Lost in Space,Classic serial movie trope with a family of Mary Sues. Check.
Lost in Space,"Ditto. Point Pleasant was really cool too. One of the better network antichrist horror shows. I remember being really bummed when it got cancelled. It was during Fox's slash-and-burn-all-genre-series era. Dark times (for Dark Angel, lol)."
Lost in Space,"Natural Causes means you died from something internal (ie cancer, heart disease, etc.)"
Lost in Space,"Very sorry to hear that! 
Terrible. I personally am very afraid of cardiovascular arrest / stroke / aneurysm - related death or debilitation, and I wish that cardio system health was easier to access and part of a regular screening process. 

It is absolutely unfair, that as humans we proceed to pass along genetics with total abandon and that it can be so random. I knew a guy who was in excellent health and jogged almost daily, who died of the same thing. Meanwhile people who are obese and sit around smoking all day can live to 85."
Lost in Space,You are totally right. My mistake thanks for correcting me
Lost in Space,awwww 😰😰😰😰 go stream on twitch
Lost in Space,"Yup. Great Grandfather was 49, Grandfather 50, my dad 51. All heart attacks."
Lost in Space,For some reason I always thought natural causes had to do with old age.
Lost in Space,Who is Jean Renault?
Lost in Space,Fucking Wranglers!
Lost in Space,/r/boneappletea
Lost in Space,Acid wash kills.
Lost in Space,"> Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues.

Any proof that this guy even had COVID?  It seems sort of crazy to put that out here like that.  To me, making a blanket statement like that is no better than saying “the vax has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues” so you’re going to see a lot of sudden death over the next ten years."
Lost in Space,Yea you’re right I was thinking of a different show (the expanse) that left the story unfinished. Will and the robot going off on their adventures was a great ending (spoiler alert).
Lost in Space,that kid really had a growth spurt
Lost in Space,"Never actually heard of that one, I’ll give it a watch, thanks homie."
Lost in Space,Exactly that's what I meant. Didn't say it as well
Lost in Space,Yea exactly! You hear a lot about running related deaths due to heart conditions they never knew they had etc. It's tragic.
Lost in Space,"It's all good, I had it mixed up myself at first because the names are so similar."
Lost in Space,😘
Lost in Space,[deleted]
Lost in Space,"Christ. That’s terrible I’m sorry. Pancreatic cancer has taken my great grandfather, grandfather, and uncle. It’s sometimes frightening knowing that you can be predisposed to something like that. Take care of yourself."
Lost in Space,I’m sorry to hear that. It’s a similar story with my mother; her siblings and both parents died at 46. Needless to say she was very happy to turn 47.
Lost in Space,"My family is similar but with a 12yr gap. So for me it might be anywhere from 60-72. 
/remindme in 25 years"
Lost in Space,"Yup! Great great grandma, great grandma, grandma all had heart attacks at 49. Grandma survived though. My mom had a heart issue but she very paranoid and had it checked out in her early 40s."
Lost in Space,Do you plan to just live in a hospital for your 52nd year?
Lost in Space,You have a time bomb in your chest.  Take care.
Lost in Space,"> Any proof that this guy even had COVID?

40% of all adults have had COVID (as of June 2022) and 20% of those infected could specifically be diagnosed with ""Long COVID"" symptoms.

While there is no evidence of an association *in this specific instance,* a generalized comment that we may see a rise in sudden, unexplained issues related to our circulatory systems is something that IS supported by statistical and medical evidence.

As opposed to a claim about ""the vax"" which is supported by neither."
Lost in Space,[removed]
Lost in Space,"Have you read the expanse books? There’s a 30 year time jump…. There’s some people that say it will come back later, but it’s also a bit of a tough pill to swallow for a TV audience."
Lost in Space,"Spoiler, but one that everyone would predict and still doesn't tell you what happened at the end."
Lost in Space,"OH. I legitimately thought that the character had been like... ""Honey I Blew Up the Kid""ed for some reason which made the story go faster for some reason."
Lost in Space,"Thank you. I do get my choloesterol checked. It’s fairly normal, surprisingly. A lot of those deaths, esp my dad was also due to smoking. I don’t smoke."
Lost in Space,"As far back as anyone can remember no male in my family had lived past 63. Not a particular cause, it was more like a curse. My dad was the first to buck the trend. I’ve been enjoying the extra time we’ve had together."
Lost in Space,Thank you. I was 16 when my dad died but my poor twin aunts were 2 when my grandfather died. They never knew him.
Lost in Space,"Thank you. I do have other male relatives on my dad's side that are living past 50. That's a good thing. And much better health care exists today, no matter how much we complain about it. My grandfather would have lived in this day in age for sure."
Lost in Space,"I’m pretty sure that more than 20% of Americans were vaccinated. The only real way to get good data on this would be to run a statistical  regression analysis on the cardiac health outcomes between populations with similar COVID infections but divergent vaccine adoption. I’d suggest U.S. and Sweden because we have similar infection rates but Sweden had very low vaccine rates. And if critics don’t like that (because Sweden’s diet tends to be better) pick another country like Canada v Sweden. 

The point is that this sort of research won’t get funding or publication under this sort of environment. But I suspect that we will start seeing the results of these types of studies looking backwards at the Pandemic in the 2030s…after the politics have died down."
Lost in Space,[deleted]
Lost in Space,"Ignore me if I’m prying, but have you been to a cardiologist? I’m curious what the protocol is for someone with a family history like this."
Lost in Space,I do need to watch my weight but I move everyday. I get multiple 10 plus mile work days during the week and weights too. I’m trying!!
Lost in Space,Half way through the last season of Lost in Space. Sucks that it’s the last.
Lost in Space,"Lost in space is fantastic because I can watch it with my kid, it's a modern sci-fi show that is genuinely family friendly during a time of all gritty (or ""gritty"") or crude scifi.

It sucks it's over."
Lost in Space,"The only people who watched the new Home Alone were time traveling archeologists on a quest to pinpoint exactly where it all started to fall, apart."
Lost in Space,Hawkeye got people to NWH.
Lost in Space,"Man, I’d kill for a Will Robinson and The Robot spin-off ."
Lost in Space,Didn’t know lost in space was still even around. Tried to watch it a few years ago and couldn’t get past the first few episodes
Lost in Space,"I don't think Netflix had much confidence in Lost in Space season 3, and did not really advertise it anything as heavily as they did the first two seasons. And lo and behold, it dominates December. I thought season 3 was far better than season 2, frankly, and I was quite amused how they addressed the growth spurt of the Will Robinson actor. 

I was in a distinct minority on the Dr. Smith character, however. I thought they made a blunder in the way they rewrote that character, so I was glad they relegated the character more to the background in season 3."
Lost in Space,Seems like the wrapping up of Lost In Space was a bit premature.
Lost in Space,Huh. I haven’t seen any of those shows.
Lost in Space,"good that lost in orbit ends on season 3, it become insufferable (thanks netflix for allow fast foward) i take at least 20 minutes of each episode of useless fill scenes, so much waste opportunity. Honestly i was wishing they kill will for real.... THAT would be unespected and original and a great end to this sentimental trainwreck."
DOREIKU The Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
DOREIKU The Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
DOREIKU The Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
DOREIKU The Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
DOREIKU The Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
DOREIKU The Animation,Why is he Sonic
DOREIKU The Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
DOREIKU The Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
DOREIKU The Animation,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
DOREIKU The Animation,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
DOREIKU The Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
DOREIKU The Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
DOREIKU The Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
DOREIKU The Animation,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
DOREIKU The Animation,Never meet your heroes
DOREIKU The Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
DOREIKU The Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
DOREIKU The Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
DOREIKU The Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
DOREIKU The Animation,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
DOREIKU The Animation,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
DOREIKU The Animation,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
DOREIKU The Animation,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
DOREIKU The Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
DOREIKU The Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
DOREIKU The Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
DOREIKU The Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
DOREIKU The Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
DOREIKU The Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
DOREIKU The Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
DOREIKU The Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
DOREIKU The Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
DOREIKU The Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
DOREIKU The Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
DOREIKU The Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
DOREIKU The Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
DOREIKU The Animation,Never go full John K
DOREIKU The Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
DOREIKU The Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
DOREIKU The Animation,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
DOREIKU The Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
DOREIKU The Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
DOREIKU The Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
DOREIKU The Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
DOREIKU The Animation,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
DOREIKU The Animation,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
DOREIKU The Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
DOREIKU The Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
DOREIKU The Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
DOREIKU The Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
DOREIKU The Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
DOREIKU The Animation,Ah geez 😳
DOREIKU The Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
DOREIKU The Animation,100 years
DOREIKU The Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
DOREIKU The Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
DOREIKU The Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
DOREIKU The Animation,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
DOREIKU The Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
DOREIKU The Animation,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
DOREIKU The Animation,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
DOREIKU The Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
DOREIKU The Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
DOREIKU The Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
DOREIKU The Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
DOREIKU The Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
DOREIKU The Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
DOREIKU The Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
DOREIKU The Animation,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
DOREIKU The Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
DOREIKU The Animation,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
DOREIKU The Animation,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
DOREIKU The Animation,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
DOREIKU The Animation,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
DOREIKU The Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
DOREIKU The Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
DOREIKU The Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
DOREIKU The Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
DOREIKU The Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
DOREIKU The Animation,Yoga
DOREIKU The Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
DOREIKU The Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
DOREIKU The Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
DOREIKU The Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
DOREIKU The Animation,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
DOREIKU The Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
DOREIKU The Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
DOREIKU The Animation,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
DOREIKU The Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
DOREIKU The Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
DOREIKU The Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
DOREIKU The Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
DOREIKU The Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
DOREIKU The Animation,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
DOREIKU The Animation,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Didn’t George Washington dip his balls in the Potomac so I wouldn’t have to give a fuck about these people?
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Be like former princess Mako, fully commit to commoner life and denounce royal ties."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Future seasons of the crown are going to be spicy
Harry Enfield and Chums,"**NO WAY!!!!**

Never in my wildest dreams did I think they would take aim at the royals family.."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"*raises hand quietly* I actually thought it was a really brilliant portrayal of how damaging Tabloids can be. I was super interested in her legal case against the Mail.

I found Harry to introspective and thoughtful. I found the footage of people REGULARLY STALKING THEM to be absolutely obscene. Like, the moved to an ISLAND and still had people chasing them in boats. I also think their departure and refusal to take Crown (read: blood) and taxpayer funds to be very respectable.

I think I’d die if I had that many cameras around. Even most big celebrities aren’t harassed like that!"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Yawn.
Harry Enfield and Chums,Please respect their privacy by not watching the series.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"It’s unfortunate they are having family issues. So do many. At this point though, it’s well past appalling that these incredibly privileged people (whose privilege comes built on the backs of others through colonialism) are still on about this when so many in the US and UK (not to mention around the world) are struggling with whether to pay for heating or food."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"They need to just stop. 

They are free to go live their lives in the unassuming way they say they want, but clearly that’s a lie since they keep seeking attention in the worst ways possible."
Harry Enfield and Chums,The most victimized victims in the history of victim hood.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Poor rich people have rich people problems. Harry was born into a palace, now he's signed a $150 million dollar Netflix deal. Such a poor life. What a pair of pathetic attention seeking narcissists. Anyone who cant see Megan loves the spotlight and causing drama is blind."
Harry Enfield and Chums,I can’t take these people seriously. They want “peace and privacy.” But then go air all the dirty laundry on TV to maintain their wealth. Tad hypocritical.
Harry Enfield and Chums,Where does Netflix get the impression that cutting a $100 million deal with these uninteresting people is a good business move?
Harry Enfield and Chums,I don’t care. Fuck this drama. Nobody should care.
Harry Enfield and Chums,Thought we stopped caring what happens over there 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 in 1776?
Harry Enfield and Chums,Monarchist bots running amok here

Harry Enfield and Chums,Oh just go away and wander a castle
Harry Enfield and Chums,"A wise man once said ""Fuck the King"""
Harry Enfield and Chums,The whole concept of “royals” in a modern society  was always crazy to me even as a child
Harry Enfield and Chums,"I'm telling yall this is what Harry has wanted this whole time. Everybody blames Megan, but I fully believe Harry is trying ti take down the royal family."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"As a red blooded American, all royals, past and present, can go fuck themselves. I don't give a shit, fuck the monarchy in all it's forms, everywhere in the world."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"It’s their story & if they want to tell it, so be it. Might as well take control of their personal story vs tabloids & chat hosts like Pierce Morgan & Osborn. Morgan & Osborn are 2 of many examples of retreads getting rich off this Royal shenanigans. Gossip & talk show hosts & you tube influencers have been paid a lot to retweet & retell old magazine stories on the USA couple (Harry/Meg).

The Prince has to have trauma or issues from growing up with media gossips & paparazzi chasing his mum. 

Decades of media/tabloids writing stories on the Prince. Then the Prince & his usa wife. Neither were paid by the gossip entities. And many recyclers glommed on, repeated & spun their two cents, while reaping in money. If someone is going to watch it’s their choice. No one is forcing anyone to watch.

I have not watched. Not a current top ten for me on my Netflix selections. To each their own. Its curious the level of vitriol by commenters.

No free labor, don’t see anything wrong in them taking control of the narrative & being compensated."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"When they have 10. Bucks to get gas and food until payday then I'll believe they're poor
Privileged fucks"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Do you think she realizes she’s the villain in this saga?
Harry Enfield and Chums,"On one hand, I understand the notion that there’s no reason why I should care about these people. Their lives hold no bearing to my own, so…whatever. 

On the other hand, it’s embarrassing how many people jump on the “oh poor little rich people” bandwagon. Everyone is so quick to jump to hyperbole as their only justification for shitting on these people. Just because someone isn’t having the literal worst life experience doesn’t mean they should (A) not have the right to tell their story, and (B) get ridiculed for it, and that being the only reason. Grow the fuck up and get a life if you care so much about celebrities enough to worship them *orrrr* shit on them on the internet. See my first paragraph."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Why do they continue to poke the royal family? I thought they didn’t want anything to do with them?
Harry Enfield and Chums,Cry me a RICH ass river.
Harry Enfield and Chums,So much hate for two people... meanwhile they probably cant hear you through their scrooge McDuck sized pool of gold coins that their family swims in daily.
Harry Enfield and Chums,It’s literally just a money grab
Harry Enfield and Chums,Who gives a F!
Harry Enfield and Chums,GO AWAY
Harry Enfield and Chums,FUCK OFF AND LIVE IN PEACE LIKE YOU WANTED TO DAMN
Harry Enfield and Chums,"So they still milking it? Why are we getting daily news about these two, that no one gives a fuck about?"
Harry Enfield and Chums,"It's a bummer that being a real princess isn't really like the Disney version though, isn't it?"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Most people could only dream of having their problems
Harry Enfield and Chums,This thumbnail makes her look like a Disney female Goofy character
Harry Enfield and Chums,"I have naturally, a  very uncomfortable feeling on the royal family after their delayed response to Diana’s death and their treatment of her during the time Charles was clearly cheating on her  with Camila. I’m disturbed that Harry’s wife was judged by the color of her skin by the royal family. 

Other than that, I don’t understand these big event programs that Harry and Megan continue to promote and produce. Why do we need a whole series about Harry and Megan if they supposedly want to keep their lives private and without scrutiny? Why did we need the Oprah interview in Santa Barbara when Harry and Megan could have put out a report or a statement or even written a book? What’s with all the on air television stuff? Why do they want all this attention drawn to them if they are complaining about all negative attention drawn to them? What exactly will a series that slams the royal family do for their lives other than make them even more talked about in media?

I really hate rich people making money off complaining about how they aren’t treated right by the media. Anyone else feel the same way?"
Harry Enfield and Chums,"I totally support Harry and Meghan at what they did. Watching this documentary it makes complete sense why they left, all these constant hateful media stories against them by British tabloids and the Royal Palace did nothing to help them, meanwhile they write a joint letter when William is concerned with Harry's signature but Harry wasn't even consulted about that.. isn't the double standards clear here?? 

It's also very important to understand that Harry believes British tabloids were partly responsible for death of his mother and he fears if he does nothing and continues things as usual, same may happen to his wife as well and hence contrary to what we are led to believe it was Harry's decision to leave UK and settle elsewhere. 

I know some might not like to hear it but British monarchy should end, its a relic of the past. At least Harry and Meghan are in US making money by having a deal with Netflix among others and not getting taxpayer funded money unlike the British Royals."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Lots of simping for the Royals in this thread lol. 

*""Who cares?!""*

Clearly, you do. Quite a bit."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Wow, the impact of skin. We all know what this is about."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"This is so meaningless. A Hollywood gold-digger seduces a world-naïve royal and all of a sudden she is someone whose opinion is meaningful?  

She is a manipulating genius. He is a cuckold. And people who care at all what they think or say are the same people who made the tabloids rich - tiny-minded people with no lives trying to expand theirs vicariously through the difficulties of others. 

Personally I'm a bit peeved at Netflix for giving them a nickel. That's MY money you morons. Stop spending it on greedy narcissists - and give me some product higher up the intellectual scale, like more Worst Witch."
Harry Enfield and Chums,I'm ready for her to go away.  Nobody cares.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"i mean, yeah. it was always going to.

it's interesting because the royal family have the royalists who support and defend them and now harry and meghan can tap into the republicans/anti-monarchists and use them in the same way. it doesn't matter if william bullied them out of the royal family or whether meghan was actually walking satan scorching the UK in her wake- what matters to the people who support harry and meghan/william and charles is that they're laying the accusation.

in any argument going forward you'll have people arguing against the monarchy using information and quotes pulled from this documentary series and they'll use it as the absolute truth. i hate the way celebrities weaponize their fan base."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Do. Not. Fucking. Care.
Harry Enfield and Chums,Who cares about these privileged fucks? Stop whining. You have more than most of us will ever dream of.
Harry Enfield and Chums,She spends all her time crying victim and talking about the royal family
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Nobody asked, nobody cared and still they continue with this shit."
Harry Enfield and Chums,who the fuck cares
Harry Enfield and Chums,Cash grab. They want the status of being royalty without being royalty. It’s embarrassing.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Wow look unskilled people using fame and birth circumstances to make more money - why do I give a single fuck. If they really wanted to get away from the tabloids maybe they could not do this? And like, contribute something to the world? I don’t know, I’m just trying to ‘work hard to get ahead’"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Lizzie must’ve left little Harry out of the will lol
Harry Enfield and Chums,No shit?
Harry Enfield and Chums,Oh no way!!! /s
Harry Enfield and Chums,"I can't believe that these two are getting air time.  The people that support them will continue to do so and those of us that know that they are lying, conniving and self serving will continue to know."

Harry Enfield and Chums,I thought they wanted out of the spotlight?
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Do not understand their end game. Do not understand why she feels it’s her job to bring the Royal family to its knees and upend 100+ years of tradition. Is it all good tradition… no…but what does she hope to accomplish by taking down this family? It may change some things but more than likely not. It’s not a life most people would choose but she willingly chose it. Love does not conquer all. It’s a naive attitude. People will get bored with this narrative. In the end, they will have ruined all family relationships"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Who cares about these rich doofuses lives
Harry Enfield and Chums,Can’t stand all the recent media about this trash family. Who gives af? Spoiled brats whining about the behavior of other spoiled brats. Girl was already a celebrity and expects us to grieve about an old lady who was mean to her. Piss off and get real problems.

Harry Enfield and Chums,Netflix busted through the bottom of the barrel to scrape the rocks beneath. Who is this appealing to? Boring spoiled people?
Harry Enfield and Chums,When does she drop the sex tape 😙
Harry Enfield and Chums,"I am honestly curious if they are somewhat “lacking funds”. With all of the paparazzi and interest around them they have to pay a bunch for private security for the rest of their lives. Also if they want to maintain their lifestyles that they have had as royals they are going to have to rack up the cash. Harry doesn’t have any other skills and Meghan is just an okay actress. This is the only way they are going to keep enough cash and be able to work with their charities, going to the media."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Who the fuck cares?
Harry Enfield and Chums,"The article must have been written by a gay dude or a woman.

Honestly, there's no straight male on this planet that gives a shit about this couple or the royal family."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Is this article for “freakin real?” Who gives a feck. Middle aged millionaires whining about how hard their lives are. Couldn’t make it past 20 minutes of the first episode. Was so boring!
Harry Enfield and Chums,I could not give any fewer fucks about this if I tried.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"“Leave us alone!”

“Here’s an Oprah interview and an Netflix doc. Give us attention.”"
Harry Enfield and Chums,"at first i didn't like them because everyone else didn't like them and i assumed the hate was justified. and maybe it is. they dont do themselves any favours what with the way they portray themselves sometimes. but then i watched their documentary and honestly, i like it. i think the only thing they're doing wrong is that a lot of the focus seems to be on megan, whilst to me, this story is really about harry. that is, if you look at things from the bigger picture. megan is the instigator of upheaval, but it's harry life that is being upheaved in the first place. she wouldn't get to play the role of the 'rescuer' or 'saviour' if it wasn't for his predicament. i understand his inner turmoil in regards to his family. he was raised to be the 'spare', meaning that his role in the royal family doesn't actually serve any purpose unless william dies, and thus he probably feels that there's nothing for him there. he was also very close to his mother diana, so honestly i think his hatred towards the monarchy is completely justified, seeing as they either murdered her, or at the very least, were complicit in her suffering. if i was him i wouldn't feel safe in that family either. 

people throw stones at him for being born into generational wealth and privilege, but dont realise that may others are too without the burden of having to partake in pointless royal duties, in support of an establishment that literally cost him a parent. he has nothing to lose in leaving. he was never going to be king anyways. 

i dont think hes ungrateful, quite the opposite. hes quite clearly an underdog who's finding himself and honestly, as he should. i think that level of sensitive introspection is something that many more young men need to participate in. when i watch this documentary i see a man on his own personal journey, and if megan is a part of that, then so be it. hes a good dad and a good husband. those are the only roles he *actually* has to fulfil and so therefore i have respect for him. its something charles and to some extent william, weren't able to do."
Harry Enfield and Chums,Imagine your wife hates her in laws this much…
Harry Enfield and Chums,When is their series about children with cleft palattes coming out?
Harry Enfield and Chums,"How Then..,

Meghan and Harold magnify the cracks in the preposterous hearts of the domineering men who built a world empire from a tiny island fortress. Yet. Their documentary suggests a frank earnest honesty in the British court that (though abrasive and glued together by “tradition,”) was/is likely absent in the courts of Hitler and Stalin and Xi. Frankness is not a wise trait in a land of photoshop erasure."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"She was in this family for what two years, and Harry doesnt even know who his father is"
Harry Enfield and Chums,"When i firts hea4rdof this ""Self-serving"" came to mind"
Harry Enfield and Chums,"If you cannot rise up without bringing others down, then what are you?"
Harry Enfield and Chums,Please do not talk about them?
Harry Enfield and Chums,I have lost all respect for Tyler Perry. And I had a lot!!
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Awwwww…but they sure like their titles though.

Not all families get along but to make millions of dollars trashing them in front of the world is downright gross."
Harry Enfield and Chums,"How'd that spotify deal work out lol.  

Seriously does ANYONE in America actually care about them?  Is the media so out of touch by pushing these two and giving them these bloated content deals?"
Harry Enfield and Chums,I think the documentary revealed a lot of truths which many commenters fail to see because of their predisposed hate.
Harry Enfield and Chums,These sorts off things seem to go where she goes.  Rather not waste my time.  It is what it is.
Harry Enfield and Chums,"Do these two useless idiots have anything to show except talking about the royal family?

For people who were so badly offended by the royal family they sure talk about them quite a lot."
Harry Enfield and Chums,not only did he dip them but he gold plated them British killing machines
AMO,"Michael Kelly eventually became the highlight of House of Cards for me as the show went on, glad to see him in this"
AMO,Michael Kelly is always a pleasant surprise
AMO,Michael Kelly was also in Man of Steel. Not his first DC rodeo.
AMO,"I'll watch Michael Kelly in anything. He was fantastic in Generation Kill, House of Cards and in his 6-episode stint on The Sopranos. He plays the ruthlessly efficient/ultra competent supporting character very well, but I'd love to see him get a chance at playing the lead role."
AMO,Shohreh Aghdashloo has such a gorgeous voice.
AMO,"Glad they’re bringing back The Batman’s version of cobblepot, they transitioned him well from a comic book Caricature to a believable mobster who ties in well with the gangsters from Frank millers work. I liked how they did the gangsters in general in that film
They “felt right”"
AMO,Michael Kelly would be pretty good Victor Zsasz.
AMO,"I just love Shohreh Aghdashloo's voice, it's like 50 years of bourbon and cigarettes."
AMO,"Pretty exciting. 

I've seen complaints that Penguin is yet another Batman series without Batman (see Gotham, Pennyworth). I personally prefer these shows, provided they're executed well with a decent production budget. There's a lot more room to tell novel stories and provide new perspectives on old stories."
AMO,"I will watch anything with Shohreh Aghdashloo. She's one of the most engaging actresses on screen and her voice is like pop-rocks in honey.

Michael Kelly was one of the best parts of House Of Cards, tons of charisma."
AMO,I'll watch Shohreh Aghdashloo read a phone book. She's great.
AMO,"Michael Kelly has been great in everything he’s been in.  He even stole the show in the Dawn of The Dead remake, and is so deserving of getting some lead time!!  Bravo!"
AMO,Oh that guy on the left is cool
AMO,"Gotham, Pennyworth, and now Penguin. When are we getting a live-action Batman series?"
AMO,I will watch just for Shoreh.
AMO,"I'm an Expanse fanatic and I always tell people it's the best cast show across the board I've seen. Many shows nail their leads, few shows nail pretty much everyone. I just picked those three as they are great core cast."
AMO,Shohreh ? What a W
AMO,Great casting!
AMO,I wish they cast Paul Heyman to be Penguin
AMO,Shohreh Aghdashloo is fuggin' awesome
AMO,"3 supremely talented actors/actresses that have always been great in anything I've seen them in.

Didn't even know this show was a think before seeing the story, will give it a look now."
AMO,I don’t even understand why people said colin did a great job as penguin. Dude just played a Italian mafia caricature we’ve seen a jillion times in Scorsese movies/ sopranos.
AMO,"Awesome

Cannot wait for this universe to grow"
AMO,I hope we see Batman a little bit in this or in the final episode
AMO,I can already hear her voice
AMO,Is there any point in watching this if they didn't cast Danny DeVito?
AMO,Not feeling it for this show. The Batman was an okay movie but Im kinda out the second I know its just another Batman show without Batman.
AMO,It kills me that they’re rebooting the DC Universe but we still have to deal with mass shooter Riddler as a concept because this show continues on...
AMO,"Oh look more not Batman, Batman supercape shit."
AMO,They're not gonna top the old Penguin on Fox.  Him and Victor zsasz were top notch.
AMO,"that guy, who, and who 

i do like that guy - hes like a dramatic todd barry

the whos look familiar but i cannot place them"
AMO,"I’m bored already. 

I wonder if we’ll hear about Batman in every episode and never see him."
AMO,Really good cast - but please please stop with the Batman expanded universe crap !    Too much Batman.
AMO,[deleted]
AMO,Fucking tired of the superhero shit. Can HBO just stop sucking off nerds for a second and give us another season of Corporate?
AMO,"Admiral Rahn… oh wait, wrong universe 🤦‍♂️"
AMO,wasn't that guy was in Man of steel too?
AMO,🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
AMO,This is a great fix for when you criminally under use a character in a movie. Just give them a show
AMO,"I'm actually looking forward to this. Penguin is possibly my favorite Batman villain, and more importantly, he can exist completely *without* Batman at all. His origin isn't tied to the Bat, he wasn't friends with Bruce before some tragedy occurred, he isn't even particularly obsessed with Batman outside of being a crime boss in Gotham and having to deal with Batman interfering with his operations. Hell, half the time he just pays Bats off with information and calls it a day. Plus, my favorite part, aside from a mildly eccentric bird fetish, he isn't completely insane. He commits crimes for reasons that make logical sense. He's just a mob boss with a few gimmicks."
AMO,I looooooove Shohreh. Fantastic actress and her voice is so unique and mesmerizing
AMO,That's a pretty fine cast
AMO,Will p wee Herman come back as his dad?
AMO,Hopefully there is some good profanity in the script for Shoreh.
AMO,"Michael Kelly was amazing in Taboo, can’t wait!"
AMO,Damn! I like all this people very much but I didn't like the Penguin at all that much.
AMO,Yeah I loved him HOC
AMO,Stamper threw the brick.
AMO,Definitely one of the best parts. That ending was out of character - but I guess it was out of character for everyone.
AMO,Shoreh makes everything she’s in better too!
AMO,Doug Stamper is back at it again
AMO,He’s great in Jack Ryan
AMO,"and that wasn’t even his first “superhero” rodeo, he was the abusive dad in Chronicle"
AMO,"His bits in *Fringe* and *Black Mirror* weren't bad, either."
AMO,He’ll always be CJ from Dawn of the Dead for me.
AMO,"Just finished sewing 4 of Jack Ryan, I was happy to see him, great character.

Edit: season 3… stupid autocorrect"
AMO,Also great as a serial killer in The Shield
AMO,~~He's also in a few Martin McDonagh films (In Bruges and 7 Psychopaths)~~ edit: Ignore this. I confused him with another actor who kinda looks like him
AMO,Him and Ty Burell are always going to be known to me as 'those guys from Dawn of the Dead' lol.
AMO,He was also awesome in Person of Interest!
AMO,Every time she drops a gravelly f-bomb in the expanse I get a tingle
AMO,"I saw the r/askreddit thread about a female Morgan Freeman, and I wholeheartedly agree that it’s her."
AMO,"Whenever a video game needs someone to voice a wise matriarch, they know who to call."
AMO,I LOVE that woman! She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. And that velvety voice. She is a scene stealer. I'm so sorry The Expanse is over.
AMO,"I could honestly listen to her talk all day. That woman has a voice like a smoked, honeyed whiskey. She’s one of my favorite actresses. Super talented, and then *that voice*!"
AMO,Is she the one in Arcane?
AMO,Her and Sophia Bush. But I'm more interested in the show now because Shohreh Aghdashloo is great.
AMO,Her voice is so recognizable and badass
AMO,Adore her. So fun to listen to her filthy mouth in Expanse. Has that voice that reminds me of Silvia Sidney in Beetlejuice lol.
AMO,"Yeah, reminds me of my grandmother with a 10 pack day habit"
AMO,"Fun fact. She played a character in the show Flashforward whom people referred to as ""Eartha"", because she sounded like Eartha Kitt. Eartha Kitt, of course, played Catwoman in the 1960s Batman TV show."
AMO,"Its a smokers voice...

But damn it suits her"
AMO,So hot
AMO,I only watched her in The Punisher and tbh I think her voice is a little bit too distracting. It's gorgeous but very distinctive.
AMO,I want her cast as Cadsuane in the Wheel of Time series so bad.
AMO,Disagree. Sounds like a raspy old smoker.
AMO,"Too raspy, she sounds like she’s been smoking for 50 years"
AMO,"Persian, duh"
AMO,"I feel like DeVito's version is really the only version of Penguin that was completely off base.  Penguin isn't supposed to be insane, just a morally bankrupt presence that Batman often allows to continue since he's the enemy you know and doesn't stand to benefit from the city descending into chaos (and is sometimes an informant)."
AMO,Anthony Carrigan stole every damn scene in Gotham as Zsasz. I’d love to see him reprise the role.
AMO,Too old.
AMO,"I’m just happy that we not only get a taste of The Batman universe before Part 2, but it’s also 6-8 hours of content."
AMO,She sounds like a three pack a day smoker talking through two layers of silk. She’s amazing.
AMO,"As long as she drops an f bomb every third name, I’m in."
AMO,He’s also great in Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan!
AMO,His name is Douglas Stamper
AMO,Never.
AMO,You have 120 episodes of live action Batman you can watch right now.
AMO,WB and DC just don't want that for some reason .
AMO,You already have one. It’s called The Batman.
AMO,DC/WB would see it as a waste of money
AMO,"I'm not convinced we'd actually want that, not with the quality that DC are putting out. Gotham was basically a teen drama, I admit I haven't seen Pennyworth but I doubt it's the level of intensity you'd need for a good batman live action show."
AMO,Considering none of those are related at all..
AMO,When are we getting a Batman Animated series?
AMO,"You mean a Batman show about Batman?  I hear you fam! We have Green Batman, Boy Batman, and Lesbian Batman coming up!"
AMO,"The budget and spotlight would kill it.

Making it lower budget would kill it and hurt the film franchise.

If you notice, one of the villains in Gotham was used as a test screening for how Batman could look in that series. Definitely been thought out."
AMO,"Yeah, I don't understand the hype. This show could be called ""Falcone"" and be the exact same."
AMO,"well, it's not even filmed yet. of course, it's not there yet"
AMO,"I absolutely hated his character, personally

But the actor did a fantastic job with the material!"
AMO,I can hear her voice just looking at her photo.
Forest of Piano,"Jason Alan Carvell has bigggggggggggg shoes to fill as Malcolm X. 

>with Swizz Beatz serving as executive music producer.

Still, ugh."
Forest of Piano,"Oh, I was just thinking about this show yesterday. I stopped watching it around midway S1 and was thinking of picking it back."
Forest of Piano,"Forest Whitaker deserves an Oscar for this show, (I know what I said) better than most featured film acting"
Forest of Piano,Who's the Shogun of Harlem!?
Forest of Piano,"Wish that I could go back for first time watching again, so gooood"
Forest of Piano,*WALT!!*
Forest of Piano,"Why does it feel like another show that I can’t remember the name of. Maybe at most five years ago. Everyone trapped in a hotel and the town it was in. No one could get out.

Edit: _Persons Unknown_. And it was over ten years ago! Oh how the time flies. Thanks /u/zibook."
Forest of Piano,"What an awful fucking name, just absolutely shooting yourself in the foot from day one of ever finding this show through any search like imdb. Might as well just call it ""The"""
Forest of Piano,"This kind of random ""Twilight Zone brainstorm whiteboard"" concept is my kind of shit so I'm here for it."
Forest of Piano,The description sounds like every small town in middle America.
Forest of Piano,Looks promising
Forest of Piano,Anyone has a mirror link?
Forest of Piano,"Kinda reminds me of The Endless.

If you haven’t watched that one yet, and you like cerebral horror, it’s as weird and scary as they come…"
Forest of Piano,"I don’t think I’ve ever seen Harold Perrineau in something where his character didn’t get killed off, so his chances of survival are not looking too hot right now."
Forest of Piano,Starring Eion Bailey - the poor man's Paul Rudd.
Forest of Piano,"interesting premise, a twist on the classic 'shipwrecked' trope.   The addition of old people as monsters/zombies is a bit of a weird curveball.   I was hoping for  more of a supernatural mystery rather than a horror feeling.    
  
Like a town where no one can escape, but they can try to live a fairly normal life within the walls.   gathering and growing food, finding ways to survive, deal with randoms appearing, search for an answer, etc.  I feel like this will devolve into your standard zombie/vampire action series. from that trailer, im guessing its a demonic cult of people who trap others in this town and then kill them to steal their lifeforce or some shit"
Forest of Piano,"Sounds interesting but stupid name. 

This reminds me of a Stephen King short story that I can't remember the name of. A bunch of dead famous people, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe and others, were stuck in the town too."
Forest of Piano,This looks cool!
Forest of Piano,Augustus Hill baby
Forest of Piano,This looks really good
Forest of Piano,"If it is well received, subsequent seasons will make the mystery increasingly convoluted and will never offer a resolution, to keep the gravy train rolling. Then ratings go down and it gets cancelled.

This happens to nearly every show that has a single central mystery as its premise."
Forest of Piano,"It's a solid premise, will come down to execution and if they can give enough juice to the characters."
Forest of Piano,"Tell me you love Stephen King without saying ""Stephen King""."
Forest of Piano,"Ok, it actually looks somewhat interesting so I probably will watch it.  However, what the hell is with that name?  I know they are trying the one word, LOST, DARK, etc, but this is super lazy on their part."
Forest of Piano,"Oh  no. This sounds like something I'm working on about a town that turns out to be Purgatory. 'From' will be on Epix. I don't subscribe so I won't be watching. As par, it will be on international Netflix. It's produced by the Russo Bros., which makes me interested."
Forest of Piano,Wanda. It’s all…Wanda.
Forest of Piano,Isn't this an SCP?
Forest of Piano,Sounds like Pine Barrens?
Forest of Piano,Looks decent but not getting Epix for just this.
Forest of Piano,Normalcy… ffs
Forest of Piano,Epix shows just never work for me. They are almost good.
Forest of Piano,WAAAAAALLLT
Forest of Piano,Where's mah boy?
Forest of Piano,Bit of a Wayward Pines.
Forest of Piano,Persons Unknown (2010) ?
Forest of Piano,Also Stephen King’s Under the Dome
Forest of Piano,I liked Persons Unknown. I still remember the cliffhanger ending.
Forest of Piano,There’s also a Netflix show where this happened but it had the caveat that all the adults had disappeared
Forest of Piano,"This article brings this as well - https://www.polygon.com/22801234/from-horror-series-first-look-trailer

You, Us, Them, We, Her and now From."
Forest of Piano,"No kidding, sounded interesting so I googled where to stream it and it was all just general results about streaming services"
Forest of Piano,*wrecked*
Forest of Piano,"I feel like these shows can turn too heavily on the reveal and diminish the whole thing. So help me, if it's just another mysterious fucking corporation doing this... It'd be nice to have a show where the reveal is so damn good that you want to watch the series again to try and pick up missing clues."
Forest of Piano,"Epix has some good shows on their platform.  
  
Condor, Deep State, Berlin Station, War of the Worlds, Godfather of Harlem, Pennyworth, Get Shorty and some others."
Forest of Piano,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBiwGuJYS70
Forest of Piano,"The Matrix series.

*so far*"
Forest of Piano,Pretty sure he lived in The Matrix
Forest of Piano,Claws¡
Forest of Piano,"The new trend is to feature a big actor in the trailers and marketing for your new show and then kill them off in the premiere.  I can think of three shows that have done this recently.  [spoiler](#s ""Big Sky, Mayor of Kingstown and Invasion"").  It's similar to GoT and Sean Bean but in the first episode instead of the end of the first season.  Definitely something that goes all the way back to things like Oz and The Shield but I've noticed it more and more recently."
Forest of Piano,"He matured very nicely, IMHO. Got gravitas he was lacking in LOST."
Forest of Piano,"What ?       
[Eion Bailey and Paul Rudd look nothing alike !](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRRwoy9JeZzwDieJDQcXZDviDF018fmTqFLKw&usqp=CAU)"
Forest of Piano,Everyone's the poor man's Paul Rudd.
Forest of Piano,Looks more like vampires of all ages who have to be invited in.
Forest of Piano,You know they got a hell of a band.
Forest of Piano,"Kind of run-of-the-mill idea, no?"
Forest of Piano,"I GOTTA FIND MY SON, MAN"
Forest of Piano,CAAAARRRRLLLLLLLLLLLL
Forest of Piano,That was my first thought
Forest of Piano,"> Persons Unknown

Yep. That was it."
Forest of Piano,"Interesting, is there any way to get ahold of this show? Might be worth a damn."
Forest of Piano,God why did you have to remind me about that show?!
Forest of Piano,There's a book series called Gone which would be amazing...
Forest of Piano,And then there’s the most famous “IT” 👀.
Forest of Piano,">Her

[Her?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oo6iEqkFnI)"
Forest of Piano,"More shows need to go with ""The Prisoner""'s method. Reveal next to nothing, contradict what little you do reveal, and acknowledge none of it. Just be absolutely baffling.

(And I don't mean JJ Abrahm's mystery-box bullshit, actually go into it with a plan and roadmap, don't just make it up as you go along and hope no one notices)"
Forest of Piano,"> Deep State, Berlin Station, War of the Worlds, Godfather of Harlem, Pennyworth

God all those shows have the same problem. They are all almost good."
Forest of Piano,"Great, thanks !"
Forest of Piano,I’ve only seen the first one so I didn’t even know he was in the other ones.
Forest of Piano,"Wow 2 responses about the matrix in like 5 seconds. As I said to the other guy, I’ve only seen the original but that’s interesting."
Forest of Piano,Why does a poor man need Paul Rudd? What is he good for?
Forest of Piano,"That's the one, thanks! I was wrong about Marilyn. It's been a long time since I read it."
Forest of Piano,It's been done.
Forest of Piano,THEY GOT MY SON!!
Forest of Piano,Same. Such a great first series
Forest of Piano,And had to eat Chinese food every day
Forest of Piano,"According to justwatch.com, you can buy it from Apple or Amazon. If you want to stream then I suggest the high seas"
Forest of Piano,It’s got to have the biggest delta between concept and execution of any show.
Forest of Piano,And there's gonna be NOPE.
Forest of Piano,"At least It was named before searching for shows online and in apps was a thing people did, and even then you could say Stephen King’s It and would be asking in bookstores. Calling a show From in 2021 is another level of pain in the ass. It’s not on the first page of Google results for its own title. I genuinely cannot figure out which streaming service or TV network is going to show it in my country because I can’t get relevant search results. “where to watch from”, “stream from”, “from airing on”, god this is stupid."
Forest of Piano,GOT to eat Chinese everyday
Forest of Piano,I have abandoned the forbidden seas years ago. Guess I'll have to fund Bezos's next space adventure if I want to see it.
Forest of Piano,I love Chinese food and could do it for maybe a week. Two at the most
Forest of Piano,">also why did no-one complained about this who actually watched the serie?

My eyes simply don't notice it for some reason, which I'm very glad of because it sounds like hell for people who can't see anything *but* the shakes."
Forest of Piano,I didn't notice it at all and I can't watch anything that is shaky or does that vignette type thing because it gives me vertigo.
Forest of Piano,"you are confusing your personal distain for a certain method of cinematography, with quality and skill."
Forest of Piano,"This is bait guys lol just ignore it 

It's clear the user isn't interested in actually discussing this or learning about it. 

This thread is a circle jerk of bullshit"
Forest of Piano,"The intensity of the story is reflected through the cinematography. Where you wanted to see a steadicam, they went handheld. I’m usually sensitive to bad handheld work, but I thought hey did a great job. I think it’s just preference."
Forest of Piano,You have opinion on a style and bad camera work confused. It’s all intentional if you did see a “shaky cam”.
Forest of Piano,"Sounds more like it didn't suit your preferences, but maybe you have higher than normal sensitivity to camera movement?"
Forest of Piano,"The hand held camera adds a bit of realism to a work. It makes the viewer feel like this is something they are witnessing naturally. It’s not for everyone, but I thought the entire show was amazing."
Forest of Piano,nobody is complaining about it because apparently nobody is as pretentious and annoying as you
Forest of Piano,"You sound like my nanna, maybe you have been ruined by too much General Hospital also?"
Forest of Piano,"""*I* don't like this particular aesthetic, therefore it's bad!"""
Forest of Piano,Didn’t notice. Show was amazing for me!
Forest of Piano,There's absolutely no shaky cam in this series compared to what we all know shaky cam looks like. The Bourne movies are shaky cam. TLOU most certainly is not. And all of your condescending replies to people here are making you look very fucking dense in the head and shitty.
Forest of Piano,"Are we on schedule for the post-season backlash? 

*checks watch

Yup, right on time. All aboard."
Forest of Piano,"I didn’t notice it for once. But I’m not downvoting you, because it’s a legitimate complaint. I won’t be surprised if tv manufacturers start shipping a “shake removal” feature in TVs in the near future."
Forest of Piano,I didn't notice after episode 1.
Forest of Piano,"Craig doesn't direct any other episodes no. Other directors have a different style and do not do this. 

I did in fact see some minor complaints about this when it aired. But it's ultimately belied by the story and the rest of the show is different."
Forest of Piano,then why did you not notice it? to me it directly became clear. i am very sensitive for bad camera work.
Forest of Piano,"no quality or skill is needed with a bouncing camera. every idiot can do it,  it takes skill and quality doing it with a steady cam."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"To anyone who hasn’t played TLoU2, just leave any TLoU thread. Too many people hint at stuff that’ll happen in the future in these threads."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,These guys think they are way smarter than they are.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,[removed]
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Omg it’s a tv show not a moral compass. My god can we not have anything?!
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Gonna be so thankful i got a teenage girl brain slurry vaccine when cannibal rapists chop off my legs or a bloater rips out my spine
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Joel entering the Avatar State to save Ellie.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Thanks for the heads up
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"As someone who hasn't played the game, all of these discussion threads are so frustrating. Everyone constantly talking about what happened in the game. I don't care about the game, I'm just trying to enjoy the TV show."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I have played neither game and am watching this series and loving it so far. Thank you for the heads up, even though so much time has passed. Appreciate it"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Bless you
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,I basically told all of my family and friends to *not* read any article or community regarding it because people are so toxic about it in general if they wanted to keep fresh eyes and not be spoilt.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"The HBO specific sub really needs to enforce a ""No Game Talk"" rule or have ""Show Only"" threads"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,It wouldn't be a problem if they'd fucking release it for PC
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I still understand his PoV. They were going to kill his daughter again. I also understand that it's not the morally ""right"" thing to do, and it's also very selfish. But a lot of parents would go for the selfish option without even thinking of the impact it'd leave on their child.

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.
> 
> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

Heck, larger themes like ""loyalty"" and ""brotherhood"", etc. were a huge part of the driving forces in LoTR."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"> It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,[removed]
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,What?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,...they do have show only threads
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Rekt
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Retcon
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Yes.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,Why the downvotes?
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."

One of the issues with alternate history media is that you really need a specific central character(s) that the audience can relate to as a newcomer so you can unfurl the world to new eyes, then you have to make them care about the characters who are playing this world out -- its incredibly difficult -- you need to set the rules and then tell me how they work and who I care about

Its ""easy"" to play world builder in alternate history, because you can simply make anything true, without necessarily needing real-world logic, but in the end, it has to be a  grounded story about people who happen to live in those times, and not about ""those times""

It's called living vicariously. Most people don't have those things, but like to dream they do. So they watch others who do have them and imagine it's them living that way. 

It's extremely unhealthy, causes jealousy and resent. You can see that plainly now with all the hate being shown to anyone who's wealthy by all those who aren't."

Harry Enfield Presents...,"Sorry, but poor people rarely have ominous sword collections or suspicious butlers, much less the budget for a network of secret passages/safe rooms."
Harry Enfield Presents...,"A fair number of mystery shows do this and then expose the faults of these people.

Sherlock Holmes (not the Cumberbatch one) and Poirot in particular often have a critical look at Britain's upper class in multiple stories.

You flit between Holmes extolling the virtue of his homeless network for gathering intel without bias, and ripping into the shallow self-serving prideful arrogance of a prince to Poirot being used as a foreigner living in the UK to show the hypocrisy and arrogance of the upper-class Brits that he investigates.

Give Jeremy Brent's version of Sherlock a watch, and David Suchet's version of Poirot if you are open to suggestions.

I've been rewatching Poirot recently due to it being run on TV when I usually have my dinner as of late and it's actually surprising how relevant a lot of Poirot's points are despite half of the episodes being made in the '80s-'90s."

While guesting on a talk show, horror novelist Jordan Manmouth claims he is immune to being frightened by the nightmarish creatures he creates - and comes to regret the taunt when he is terrorized by a black-caped phantom in reflections.

But there’s a reason the lights are always on, in closets and drawers and in every corner of the house. It’s to completely prevent shadows from forming at all.

'Dark Angel' - I have to say this is probably the inspiration for 'Carrie'. A man's wife goes through a terrible transformation.

Harry Enfield Presents...,'Easy' on Netflix has a few good ones. The show revisits some characters through the seasons but episodes all stand alone just fine.
Harry Enfield Presents...,"[**""Her Pilgrim Soul""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Y707u0SHU) from the **1985** ***Twilight Zone***. I once amused the hell out of Alan Brennert (the writer) by bringing him *every* version of that to sign: the DVD box set, the short story anthology with the prose version of the story (adapted from the teleplay, not the other way 'round), and the book/CD of the off-Broadway musical *(Weird Romance).*

The commentary track on the DVD of the episode has Brennert, Wes Craven, and the showrunner Philip deGuere.  I crack up every time when Craven and deGuere mention how they'd broken down crying while watching it to prep for the commentary.

I also loved the companion piece in that episode, (also Alan Bennett scripted), [**""I of Newton""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoQ6ZC8EUQ0), based on the Joe Haldeman short story.  Ron Glass was sexy as hell as the devil.

>.... I don't think the first revival of The Twilight Zone is particularly beloved.

It is, but mostly by old farts who watched it on broadcast back in '85. :)

>but it sure had a lot of talent involved. ...George R.R. Martin and J. MIchael Straczynski wrote episodes

You forgot Harlan Ellison, Alan Brennert, and Rockne S. O'Bannon. :D

>Wes Craven directed several episodes, and Bruce Willis even starred in one.

It was pre-*Moonlighting,* so nobody knew who he was, back then.

Willis appeared in the pilot episode (""Shatterday""; Harlan Ellison short story, adapted by Alan Brennert). Brennert is hilarious in the commentary track on the DVDs about how Ellison was so angry at him over it, that he actually handed it back to Ellison and told him to try his hand adapting.  Only to have Ellison shouting ""You son of a bitch!"" at him the next morning, to which he yelled back, ""Not as easy as you thought, huh?!"".  That's why Ellison threw in the dialogue line, ""Alan? Alan is that you? You do me better than anybody else!"" as a compliment to Brennert's writing.

BTW, Helen Mirren was in [""Dead Woman's Shoes""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C53V2rLZT70), a gender-flipped remake of the classics series ""Dead Man's Shoes.""

But for me, the most amazing casting was probably Danny Kaye in [""Paladin of the Lost Hour""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdgpx_VtO30) by Harlan Ellison. Ellison's commentary track is fun, too.

It wasn't particularly well written or acted or anything, but it has haunted my thoughts for 20 years in much the same way that crossroads and blues do. 

There is a fascinating depth to music beyond that of lyrics or emotion or theory, something metaphysical in its very manifestation rarely alluded to in media outside of generic catch phrases like ""it just came to me."" It's the culmination of art and philosophy in an appreciation for the wellspring of human creativity that is one's soul.

Megalo Box,"One of the anime that r/television audience will like. I suggest you folks to give it a try. Not a top notch masterpiece, but a solid decent show worth the time."
Megalo Box,Loved Megalo box. Loved that they down scaled the resolution so that it would look like an early 2000's late 90's anime. Real bold move.
Megalo Box,The music is top notch
Megalo Box,Nice. I was wondering how long until they dubbed it. It was a good little show. Can't wait to rewatch it in English. 
Megalo Box,"What some people might not know is that this is loosely based on the anime classic *Ashita no Joe*, which ended in 1981. *Ashita no Joe* is excellent, featuring excellent character development for its protagonist, Joe Yabuki. 

I honestly think Joe’s character development is almost as impressive as that of Zuko. If you know who Zuko is, you know that the comparison is a huge compliment to Joe and the writing on *Ashita no Joe*."
Megalo Box,Wow to see an anime post on this sub must show how hyped this anime will be. Just checked the wiki and looks like its a straight to US before Jap type marketing. This could be the 2nd real step of anime exposure being mainstream since Netflix happened.
Megalo Box,i just finished watching this after a friend recommended it to me. really solid fighting anime with some phenomenal action scenes. was surprised at how good the writing and characterization was. the show is a lot more emotional than it looks. i genuinely enjoyed my time with this show.
Megalo Box,Damn this looks really good.
Megalo Box,"Man, that's some refreshing fucking art. 

It looks like it was made during the golden age (late '80s to mid '90s) not in 2018."
Megalo Box,My only problem with it is how predictable it is. Loved the art style though.
Megalo Box,For some reason they animated it in 480p (blurays look the same) which I find really distracting when much older animes like EVA look stunning now in HD.
Megalo Box,Has some nice Art but couldnt hold up story wise or choreography wise until the end.

Megalo Box,">Just checked the wiki and looks like its a straight to US before Jap type marketing.

I'm not sure what you mean? This show aired in Japan months ago. "
Megalo Box,"They animated it in high definition, then downscaled it."
Megalo Box,"Interesting. Personally I enjoyed that aspect of the show, it made it feel older and a bit rough around the edges, which lends itself to the anime’s aesthetic pretty well."
Megalo Box,"The ending fight was lame though. Felt as if they ran out of gas at the end. 

Spoiler

Joe vs Aragaki(?) was much better."
Megalo Box,That's understandable but is your reasoning because you live outside of the U.S.?
Megalo Box,"It's on Crunchyroll right now, in full. But it's subtitled, not dubbed."
Megalo Box,"[spoiler](#s ""It went from underdog against guy with top o the line machine, to two guys just duking it out."")"
Megalo Box,No I live in the US
Megalo Box,I know that’s why it sucks it’s going to AS dubbed and not Funi
Megalo Box,Then what seems to be your concern?
Megalo Box,"It’s a better platform and there are no commercials. You can watch the episode whenever you want, etc. "
Megalo Box,Understood. I'm sure that you're aware that the episodes will be available to watch with very limited commercials here as well - http://www.adultswim.com/videos/megalobox
Megalo Box,Yes on their website that only works on a computer 
Megalo Box,They do have the Adult Swim app available for most devices.
Megalo Box,Roku and Firestick
Megalo Box,"Yup, Android and iOS as well."
Megalo Box,Which are mobile 
Megalo Box,"Yup, that's all of them - http://www.adultswim.com/apps/"
Megalo Box,"That looks totally great. Especially the character designs. The background doesn't look that good. But still, looks to be very intense. "
Megalo Box,"It's supposed to be a modern re-imagining of Ashita no Joe, a 50 year old boxing manga. The 1st episode is pretty good, and I can't wait for next week."
Megalo Box,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Megalo Box,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Megalo Box,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Megalo Box,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Megalo Box,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Megalo Box,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

Megalo Box,I have no idea why I thought of [Titan A.E.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_A.E.) when I saw this headline.
Megalo Box,This is going to be a difficult arc for a lot of people...
Megalo Box,Can't wait
Megalo Box,Does anyone know of a good recap video? Preferably for both of the first two seasons?
Megalo Box,"Definitely one of my favourite anime & manga.

Most of every season is just so medicore and full of pandering, AoT is refreshing and gets only better imho"
Megalo Box,My god that KENNY line is cheesy af
Megalo Box,"Anyone know if its one episode at a time, or the entire season a la Netflix?  Jesus tap dancing Christ I cant wait!!!!!"
Megalo Box,hope funimation does simulcast as quickly as tokyo ghoul and such.
Megalo Box,The human with the hat looks like a Titan himself!
Megalo Box,[deleted]
Megalo Box,"I feel like I've grown too much to enjoy animes now, but this one has got me so hooked I got into the manga to follow the story (and it's amazing how even better it gets).  

Who could recommend something similar to me ? Dark, smart, mature, non-cheesy anime ?"
Megalo Box,Is season 2 dubbed?
Megalo Box,I can never decide if this is the cleverest dumb show or the dumbest clever show.
Megalo Box,[deleted]
Megalo Box,[deleted]
Megalo Box,They fucked up big time by making season two long after season 1. Mostly everyone forgot it after that.
Megalo Box,Anime action scenes are seriously so fucking ugly to look at
Megalo Box,"Stop making this show ... A1 is too good of a studio to be wasted away like this.

Edit: Production IG"
Megalo Box,It's the final edit.
Megalo Box,It was probably a recording of the NA premiere of the first episode rather than a leak.
Megalo Box,"its this weekend on the 22nd, not sure why they are saying next week in this video unless its for another country."
Megalo Box,And August 18th on Toonami for the English dub.
Megalo Box,3 days (yarr)
Megalo Box,"Even though it’s not, what a great god damn movie! So underrated! "
Megalo Box,"I've already seen episode 1 and they are making a lot of changes to the pacing of this arc, so I don't think it will be as divided as it was when it was going on in the Manga."
Megalo Box,"The manga had a wait of a month per chapter, which may have been tough for most to handle or such a slow paced arc. Since we have a week per episode, I think it'll turn out great. "
Megalo Box,From what I heard they're making some changes in the anime so hopefully it'll be improved.
Megalo Box,"This is the arc that put me off reading the manga. My friend said it has gotten a lot better, but now I'm so far behind that figuring out where I was before seems like too much of a hassle. Those chapters are dense."
Megalo Box,"Yeah, it's one of the best arcs in the Manga, but it's really harsh to dumb people who can't read said manga and are just there to see cool pictures."
Megalo Box,"With the changes they've made from just the first episode, looks like it's not going to be."
Megalo Box,Same
Megalo Box,"Same, just commentin in case u get an answer."
Megalo Box,"I felt the complete opposite. I watched the first season and it was pretty good, then I started reading the manga all the way through. It basically ruined it for me cause it went to shit after a certain point, which in turn made me not care about season 2 or season 3 of the anime because the plot just became awful.


I've continued reading the manga since it doesn't come out that often just to see how it turns out and I truly think it has gone downhill pretty much the entire time."
Megalo Box,"Lol, do you watch any anime? This type of exaggerated overdramatic stuff is in 99% of them"
Megalo Box,that's what this show has always been. you can't play this stuff straight and not over do everything.
Megalo Box,One episode per week.
Megalo Box,Airs in Japan one episode a week.
Megalo Box,"If it’s like season 2, Crunchyroll "
Megalo Box,"Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Funimation."
Megalo Box,"I’ve always been the outlier of my friends when it comes to anime. I don’t have anything against it, I just tend to gravitate towards other things. So others may be able to give better suggestions, but the ones that my friends have managed to hook me on that you may enjoy are Parasyte, Berserk, Tokyo Ghoul, Death Parade, and - for completely different reasons - One Punch Man. "
Megalo Box,"There are a lot as long as you're not looking for something completely new.


Monster is a really popular one about a freelance detective tracking a serial murderer.  It's pretty long.


I always suggest Texhnolyze, which is set in a futuristic underground city run by the mafia.  The ""main character"" is a cage-fighter who has his arm and leg cut off and is left to die by the mafia boss after the boss' wife set him up.  There's a very strong theme of transhumanism(transcending the human body), if you're into that.


/u/XxVaynexX already mentioned Parasyte and Berserk, which both definitely fit your description there while also having very strong action/horror elements.


The jury's still out on Tokyo Ghoul.  I find it entertaining, but I think it leans very shonen, as in there's nothing really cerebral about it at all and fights are determined by ""power levels""(RC cells) and special abilities.  It *is* very gory and later in the series(to be released), there are some more mature themes about the protagonist complex(you know, even the ""villains"" think they're saving the world).


And I'm sure you must already know about Ghost in the Shell.  That's basically a must-see if the political scenes don't put you to sleep(I had that problem as a younger viewer).


Oh, I almost forgot my favorite from this season!  **Megalo Box!**  Megalo Box is, as you could guess, a type of boxing sport, but the competitors wear ""gear"" which are strength-enhancing devices for devastating blocks and punches.  The main character is too poor to compete in Megalo Box and makes a living throwing underground boxing matches.  When he has a chance meeting with the Megalo Box champion, he sets his goals on making it to the finals of the Megalo Box tournament just to fight him again.  Great story with a lot of good characters and twists and **THE   MOST   BAD-ASS   OST** in recent memory."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,There was Season 1?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Why?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,It’s cute I liked watching this show when you’re like babysitting or something... I surprised they have new episodes already the show just came out in May. I’m hoping that means shows like dragon prince or hilda will be back sooner than later 
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Children watch TV too. And it does very well for netflix in that department 
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Yes.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Can't they watch a good show? Like Hilda?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,y
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Checkmate, Theists....

Actual proof there is no God."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Why does every Dreamworks movie get a mediocre Netflix spinoff now?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Kill me please
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Well, they can't all be winners."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,They didn't even try to get a good Baldwin impersonator
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Wow, first puppies, then kittens...so original

/s"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Well... I'm excited /s
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Netflix will approve just about anything.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Oof
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Strang font on the newspaper toward the beginning of the episode Cat Cop. It looks like a legit language of some sort not just random nonsense 
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Gott im Himmel! I didn't think it could get any worse.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I can't see anybody enjoying this.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Because the movie was solid?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Because parents put this shit on all the time for their babies. This shit is basically all kids to these days-watch Netflix. 
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,the king julian show is actually really good. and kinda messed up
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,They should’ve hired Trump.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"It sounded like Deidrich Bader, I think. "
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,its based on an oscar nominated film so.....
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"First season was surprisingly funny ...


I am glad it got renewed.."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"What’s left Star girl, Superman and Gotham knights"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"They're staying in the superhero business despite cancelling half their superhero shows, ending their biggest one after next season, and in the midst of a new parent company reorganizing the corporate structure that gets DC TV and film made?"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"So, this might be a dumb question but I'm genuinely wondering...  Does anything they mention *now* about things planned for the future, be it about ""staying in the superhero business,"" or about Babylon 5 being in active production, etc. actually *matter*?  If the CW sale goes through, wouldn't it be someone else making those kinds of decisions, and they could basically just scrap it all not long after the sale (outside of maybe things that are already renewed for next year, since I'm guessing there are contracts in place which they may not be able to back out of).  I could be wrong about this, but it seems so weird that they're talking like they have a definitive plan for the future, when that future is not set in stone."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I wonder how long after the CW sale closes to Nexstar or whoever they dump Pedowitz and most of the current CW shows.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Can you not?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I mean it seems like they've been the CW's most successful shows despite how poorly they've been handled, so it makes sense they stay in the game."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,are you? are you really? because the cancellation of several superhero shows says differently
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I hope Gotham nights is better then it looks. Not many shows left
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Stop ruining superheroes, bro."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"""Fuck.""  -Grant Gustin"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Unfortunate.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Haha
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"They should start doing a better job if they want it to last- Arrow got so shitty over the years; Super Girl & Black Lightening were pretty good; Legends got SUPER boring, same with Flash; that Superman one is kinda meh- quit spreading the writers so thin and focus on a series or two at a time instead of six with massive (mostly enjoyable) crossover events- quit with the giant fillers and super long feeling 20+ 42min episodes with one main baddy and half assed sides, give us 10 episode baddy’s followed by a mid season break, then a 10 episode new baddy or else it’ll feel so drawn out and stale again."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"LPT: How you create a successful (superhero) show is by not focusing on the no-name nobodies and not having the most awful writing ever.

It's really no surprise Naomi got canned because nobody even knew who the fuck Naomi was.

It's also really no surprise Batwoman got canned because Batwoman started out by literally stealing Batman's persona."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Is that why the only superhero show coming back later this year on the CW is Stargirl?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Give me Batman Beyond or go to hell!
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Stargirl and Superman will probably move over to HBO Max (they already are on it in some countries, the first season of Stargirl was on the pre-HBO Max DC Universe service, and Superman has sometimes had scenes that are only available if you watch on HBO Max). Gotham Knights' survival will depend almost entirely on how good its ratings and fan reaction are but even then I can't imagine it staying on CW once the sale closes unless it is somehow a runaway hit. The Diggle show probably isn't happening unless the deal with Nexstar falls completely through and suddenly WB needs *something* to put on."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Technically, Riverdale is now a superhero show."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Diggle is getting his own show too
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,HOLD UP. Is it official that they're ending Flash after S9?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Well you can't keep an actor on forever
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if the first thing they do after the sale closes is fire Pedowitz, a guy who has run the network for over a decade and never made a penny of profit.  I also wouldn't put a lot of stock into his vision taking place.

My guess is the future of the CW, or whatever it is called if it gets renamed, is cheap reality shows or reruns.  Younger people just don't watch broadcast TV in enough numbers to justify DC shows and B5."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Exactly. Nobody knows what will happen if/when The CW is sold.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,60 seconds. Dude had a long run but the channel will be dead seconds after the sale when all programming is just reruns and reality.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,If they would put just a bit more money into writers they would do far better.  In the past the writing was decent and it worked with good looking and inexperienced actors. Now it’s bad writing and inexperienced cheap actors making it completely unwatchable. They need to go back to the thing that made them a popular guilty pleasure
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,There will be budget cuts at HBO Max. Zaslav has $3 billion is savings to find. They will have no cash to fund CW shows.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I'd be shocked if that even got a pilot order, let alone a series."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,That definitely needs to be canceled along with Gotham knights and bring stargirl and Superman to hbo max.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.  Post-sale CW could very likely be a very different channel than what it is now.  I could imagine some shift of programming to other places, like if they want to still make Babylon 5, but releasing it on HBO Max.  That could actually be good for the show, since it might have a bigger budget as well.

I'm not sure if the Arrowverse shows would be something HBO Max would be interested in, but if they did there could be a shift in production and writing as well."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,They'll give him a gold watch to thank him for his service keeping the ship afloat during the Netflix deal era and pat him on the back as they walk him to his Uber.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Sounds like it.  Let's face it, if you are a network you either go big with original programming and aggressively court the retirees who still watch network like CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox, or you go home to the cheap programming of reruns and reality.  I don't see Nexstar having the money to go big."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Yeah, HBO Max is going to change as well in the coming years. My guess is they make less big and expensive series like they have in the last year or two. 

It's unfortunate because I've quite liked their output as of late."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,What you got against Diggle?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Yeah, I suspect that all new shows that formerly were going to go to the CW will have to be almost entirely paid for by the streaming companies, and only run delayed on the CW if they are really, really cheap."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Exactly. And that’s why the mass cancellations occurred. Once Nexstar takes over, it’ll be cheap reality shows and acquired programming filling the schedule, effectively turning The CW into an ersatz MyNetworkTV."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Not a good enough actor to lead his own show good side character actor. I stopped watching after season 5 of arrow did he become his own superhero? Not sure why he would even get his own show.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Which would still be an upgrade from Greg Berlanti shows.  Last I saw, Ion TV gets much higher ratings than the CW and MeTV gets about the same ratings."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"He's the CW Green Lantern, but he hasn't taken the role yet. He did find the ring.

Why is this downvoted? Did you people not watch the ending of Arrow?"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Extremely unlikely he becomes Green Lantern. Arrow ended 2 years ago and he has yet to assume the role plus HBOMAX is developing an actual Green Lantern show. Doubt they’ll do 2 especially with one on a CW level budget. It was nothing more than fan service, they didn’t even show the ring, just a green light lol"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people watched the crossover and then just skipped the finale but you aren't wrong lol
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Why would they need a Green Lantern show on a network they're trying to sell when they're *already* making a Green Lantern show for HBO Max?
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I don't know what they'll do with Diggle and his show. But his Flash appearance did have him getting migraines because he ignored the ring or whatever. They were leading to something, and it'll probably never get a resolution"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Series is pushed so far out they probably don’t even know what there doing with the series at this point
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,It's been Wanda all along
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Wandavision would have been so much better if Agatha's character had no part in it and they just let Wanda be the villain in the eyes of those around her. Like I'm way more interested in her dealing with the horrible things her trauma led her to do than I am in shifting the blame to some other character who was only just introduced in the franchise. By the final episode when there was just another big battle between people with similar powers just in different colors, I felt really let down.

No shade to Kathryn Hahn though. She's awesome."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I really liked the Evil Dead parts she had in the last Doctor Strange movies.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Too bad the Doctor Strange movie ruined the show’s character development, killing my interest in more of her. I’m not sure how they so deeply squandered the Scarlett Witch storyline, but I’m ready for the whole MCU to find a new direction away from this one."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Great to hear
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I love Kathryn Hahn, but I cannot fathom how anybody cares about Agatha, even a little. Or a show about random MCU witches"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Honestly will take as much Lizzy Olsen Wanda as she can give us after the break. Fast track a Wanda movie maybe
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Wanda 

^^featuring ^^a ^^cameo ^^by ^^Dr. ^^Strange 

was my favorite recent marvel movie."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Lmao nobody stays dead in marvel. Fucking ridiculous
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I just don't see how Wanda could ever be redeemed.  They absolutely butchered her character beyond redemption, murdering people left and right for children that *do not exist*.  It's baffling."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I'll be back 😎
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"If so, I’ll watch. There’s only a few marvel characters I care about at the moment and the biggest one is the scarlet witch."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Marvel’s Coven of Forgettable Bloat Spinoffs
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,How does anyone possibly give a shit about this
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"The whole Marvel Universe was created by the Scarlet Witch is a dream, she wakes up and just turns out to be ultra imaginative. We are all spared anymore superhero movies/TV. Honestly I tried watching the latest Antman in the cinema and not even Paul Rudd can save that one. Please God no more."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Dr strange ruined her character.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"I kinda hope so. I mean we didn't see her die, and she's too powerful to go down like that."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Refreshing to see a star of the level of Olsen be always interested in returning to the MCU.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Keep it
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,MoM was so bad I think she needs to stay dead awhile and remember the plot of WandaVision.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I sure hope so because that would be great
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Does anyone, even a single individual, want or need this series?"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Westview didn’t look that great when it went back to normal. If you take away the mind control, I’d rather have Wanda’s version if I was a citizen. 

In fact I believe we should see that sentiment. Some folks hated it, but some people were completely onboard and want it back, at least some version of it."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"wow, exciting peojects coming up. Can't wait for that IronHeart show as well"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,As long as she eliminates the cheesy hand gestures.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Agatha does not need a show. What she got in Wandavision is enough. We need more Moonknight. More series like What If... More Ms Marvel.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Oh, to F’ing apologize to everyone you held captive and tortured out of your own sick selfishness? Cuz ya still haven’t done that, or made up for everyone you murdered in cold blood shortly after."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"They need to say phase 4 was in another earth,  have it pan back and we have our heros watching a screen. Seeing what happened in a different world. We could reset the characters and even have the real cap back."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Another tv show??
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I hope so. We saw a bit of Wanda’s mental trauma in MoM but she didn’t fully melt down like she does in the comics. Agatha could really push those buttons and get us to crazed disassembled/house of m wanda
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Fuck shit just keep her die
Rostered On,i meant to finish the first season. thanks for the reminder
Rostered On,"I was honestly kind of underwhelmed by the premiere. I really enjoyed the first season and found the characters were spot on representations of the different people in retail. But this first episode I feel all the characters are leaning into becoming caricatures of caricatures and becoming too outlandish.

Will still keep watching though."
Rostered On,I think I watched the first season of this on Netflix. I remember it being weird and the main dude talking to the audience didn't feel right. It had some funny moments.
Rostered On,I found out about this show through a facebook ad. I really enjoy the show
Rostered On,"This might be the least surprising TV news I've seen in a while.

I'm convinced Helstrom is going to be advertised as a limited series and only last one season. Feels weird to have that going forward while the rest of Marvel TV's output gets killed."
Rostered On,I like the show and I hope it ends properly knowing it’s ending. But am worried since I’m sure filming has been completed.
Rostered On,"That's a shame, I was hoping they'd get far enough along to introduce Victor Mancha."
Rostered On,"Absolute bummer. Loved this show, but the writing was on the wall with all the other Marvel shows getting canceled."
Rostered On,Not surprised. Wish they'd have just beought them back. None of the shows conflict with the MCU (except maybe the timeline of presidents since obama seems to have been elected at some point but lost to the Republican the next year). Hope marvel studios brings them back with new showrunners later. Really loved the actors for almost all of these shows. They're well cast imo.
Rostered On,All that's left is Helstrom and then Marvel Tv shows will finally be canon
Rostered On,"Good. Season two was dull and it’s not even close to the magic and charm of the comics. 

I wish they had just done an animated series instead so they could have more creative freedom and not worry about cost."
Rostered On,"Other than Agents, these shows have been really average."
Rostered On,I hope they give it a proper ending.  I was planning to start watching Season 1 on D+ but if it just abruptly ends with no resolution than I may skip it.
Rostered On,The ax parade claims another.
Rostered On,Is anyone really surprised?
Rostered On,"I really hope Feige gets a chance to get his hands on the characters of all of the fallen Marvel Television shows eventually, even if they ignore the events of the shows and even if they have to recast."
Rostered On,"Quite average show by marvel or tv standards. Dino was well done i give them that, but underwhelming villains never made me interested in the series - The Gifted does better job."
Rostered On,"You're out, Jeph."
Rostered On,I hate that marvel tv has been destroyed. There were some great characters and shows.
Rostered On,Is this mainly because of Disney+?  Like the Marvel Netflix tv shows?
Rostered On,Couldn't get past the 3rd episodes. That's 1 less crappy comic book show out there.
Rostered On,">Helstrom

Perhaps it was too far in production to scrap at this point. Besides, it is a limited web series."
Rostered On,"Well, they could just move it from Hulu to Disney. The show isn't bad, and I think it would be a good addition to the catalog. Although it might not fit in perfectly with the MCU, since the Snap and the Blip."
Rostered On,Just like the comic... Right guys?
Rostered On,They didn't deserve Victor Mancha. This show was casted well. It's the writing that isn't worthy. Not sad to see it go. Not happy either.  I hope it is remade with a new writing staff. Bring back the cast. Sorta how the new comic is. With them older.
Rostered On,That seems to be how the Netflix series treated it. Guess that's maybe canon now? Or possibly just tv canon.
Rostered On,most of the marvel tv stuff already is canon that might change though
Rostered On,He has his hands on them now. He has complete control which is why all of this stuff is being killed off.
Rostered On,"> it is a limited web series.

Have they flat out said it's a limited series? I don't see what's stopping Hulu from just pulling the plug now, TV show's cease production all the time."
Rostered On,"I dont think so. It was announced at the same time as Ghost Rider but Ghost Rider was cancelled a while ago. And out of those two shows, Helstrom is the one that I thought was least likely to make it"
Rostered On,They have 10 episodes in Vancouver through February and just started last month. Morale gotta be pretty low there right now.
Rostered On,"Rowell's *Runaways* series captures the ""nothing's quite the same"" feeling you get when you meet up with old friends after a long time and your lives have each gone their own ways so well. I'd love to see that brought over to the small screen."
Rostered On,"One problem Runaways is always going to have on television is the budget. This is one of the flashier properties in Marvel's catalog. I mean, you know it's bad when Old Lace isn't shown in places where she actually is when the camera flips angles a tiny bit and when Karolina isn't rainbow while in combat.

This is one of the few properties which *needs* the care and budget of a theatrical release."
Rostered On,The movies are canon for the shows but not the other way around if that makes sense.
Rostered On,Netflix stuff is still out til 2020-2021 with legally no discussion allowed to happen til the rights lapse
Rostered On,"I was talking more about the Netflix series. Those aren't offensively contradictory to canon (other than Alfre Woodward and Mahershala Ali playing different characters in the films and netflix series) that it would be insane to officially implement them, but they also don't have the same tone as the films which Feige might see as warranting a full reboot for them."
Rostered On,"Again, if its far along enough on production and they think it is a salient enough property, there is no rationale for the higher ups at Disney to scrap what they have."
Rostered On,They already started last month and are committed through Feb. Might just be sorta like Swamp Thing with DC
Rostered On,At least with Ghost Rider that version of the character already had a ton of fans.
Rostered On,I'd like to see that too. Rainbow Rowell is a pleasant surprise. After the epically long list of people who tried to write The Runaways and failed. So nice that someone has finally succeeded in succeeding Brian K. Vaughan.
Rostered On,"I know I won't miss that game of keep away they played with the audience. Otherwise known as,'Uh, where the hell is Old Lace?"" I don't actually see this as all that flashy. Beyond the fortune needed to make Old Lace. Karolina's effects don't seem like they should be that much. Maybe they were. I just don't think the budget was their biggest problem. The writers made soooooo many mistakes. When you don't have the budget you need, you need to have the sort of writing that makes the audience forgive the budget deficiencies.  Unfortunately I think this is going into the vault until people forget it. Ultimately to be rebooted."
Rostered On,It does not.
Rostered On,But they scrapped New Warriors without airing a single episode and I'm pretty sure that show filmed one season.
Rostered On,The shows reference the movies but the movies never reference the shows.
Rostered On,They only filmed the pilot for that one.
Rostered On,"One exception, Jarvis..."
Rostered On,So it's canon got it.
Rostered On,"Nah, I read in an article they shot the entire season."
Rostered On,"I love that you go from ""im pretty sure"" and once corrected you double down and act like you know the truth completely."
Rostered On,your wrong a entire season got ordered but was never shot
Rostered On,I was originally going to say I read it in an article in my first comment but didn't...
Rostered On,I'm not but okay 🙄
Rostered On,"You are though, there's a reason you wont provide proof that you're right."
Rostered On,any season that gets filmed would get aired especially with streaming services allowing companies to air it at little no cost.
Rostered On,Then provide us your source. But you can't because there isn't one
Rostered On,"I love Superstore, I love The Good Place, I love Trial & Error (MURDER BOARD! MURDER BOARD!) and I love the Nine Nine.

So, is AP Bio worth checking out? I think I’d like it but I can’t imagine it being on the same level as these others

Edit: Y’all convinced me. I’ll start watching!"
Rostered On,"does AP Bio improve?

I didn't enjoy the 1st 3"
Rostered On,"Looks like NBC Thursday night is back on the menu, boys!"
Rostered On,"Can they pick up The Mick as well? 

I love that show"
Rostered On,"Retail, courtroom, police station: Let the workplace comedies run wild again"
Rostered On,Superstore and Brooklyn 99 are my two favorite comedies out there right now (network at least) followed by American Housewife. I’m so freaking happy about this I could scream!
Rostered On,"AP Bio is good, grew on me. Can't wait for S2. "
Rostered On,"It took a couple episodes for the new Will & Grace to find its stride, but it’s very good now. It finally knows what it is. 

Happy for NBC — haven’t watched much on here since the Community, 30 Rock, The Office, and Parks & Rec days. Maybe I’ll watch B99 and Superstore, too. "
Rostered On,"They should bring back the must see tv slogan that they got rid of after a Community, 30 Rock, Parks and Rec and The Office ended."
Rostered On,I thought trial and era was kinda funny. But wasn't it cancelled?
Rostered On,"The old Will & Grace was amazing, but the reboot isn't as much. IMO Part of the problem is that they're still banking on gay/effeminate jokes which don't fly anymore. Also their jokes are predictable from 6 lines of dialogue away. "
Rostered On,"How is the good place?  I watched the first season and read some stuff on the first half of the second season, but it seemed like there want much to go on after"
Rostered On,"I read the title and thought, ""Jeff Ross has a show on NBC?"""
Rostered On,I agree with all of your points except Will and Grace. It’s the top rated comedy on the network
Rostered On,"All shows that barely get a 1'ish in the demo (on a good day)...may not be a 'comedy' blackhole anymore, but certainly a ratings one...."
Rostered On,Yes. I wasn't paying attention. 
Rostered On,I heard about the cancel and renew the same day. My ex watches the show. 
Rostered On,Trial and error is coming back.
Rostered On,Ratings are still trash
Rostered On,Nine nine is pretty boring.
Rostered On,Is AP bio really good? I can't imagine Glen Howerton not being Dennis.
Rostered On,"I've tried to like superstore after reading a lot of praise for it, but I just can't find it funny. It makes me laugh periodically but not even once an episode in average. And yes, i watched episodes from the current season. I love good place, trial & error, and b99. AP Bio I tried the first 3 episodes and really couldn't get into it. I might give it some more time"
Rostered On,"None of these shows are that funny, they're like sketch comedies that took their plot too far and can't turn back. "
Rostered On,Aaaaand Brooklyn 99 is gone. 
Rostered On,I watched S1of Superstore. None of the characters changed and too many were unlikeable. I’m shocked it got a S2 let alone S3. 
Rostered On,"It's worth watching for the ""Innovative Principal of the year"" episode."
Rostered On,I've been binging on AP Bio the past day or so. It's definitely not bad. Took me a little getting into but it has some good laughs. I enjoy it and look forward to another season. 
Rostered On,"If you appreciate recurring jokes, running gags, and consistent storytelling (certain things don’t just “reset” every episode) you should like AP Bio.

(Based on the shows you listed the answer is Yes)"
Rostered On,"I forgot about trial and error. What a great show, didn't know season 2 was coming out!"
Rostered On,I think it's genius.  Easily a spiritual successor to Community but very much its own brand of wit and madcappery.
Rostered On,What's superstore and trial and error about 
Rostered On,No.
Rostered On,Yes
Rostered On,"I feel it does, but I can tell it’s one of those shows that’s going to really improve with a second season. It has a lot of potential and a really funny cast. "
Rostered On,"I think so, but if you didn't like it because of the tone or Glenn Howerton's character, I don't think your opinion will change."
Rostered On,I think it does
Rostered On,Very much so. Once you get used to the characters it's pretty great.
Rostered On,"At one point earlier this decade, the Thursday lineup was The Office, Parks and Rec, Community, and 30 Rock. Two straight hours of top tier comedy on one network, on one night. What a time to be alive"
Rostered On,"NBC never used “Must See TV” during that era, they retired it when Will & Grace went off the air on 2006. 

But they actually did bring it back this season along with the W&G revival. They advertised the entire night as “Must See Thursdays”. "
Rostered On,"No, season two is this July"
Rostered On,My complaint is that it's just like the old Designing Women - lots of political posturing and applause-whoring. I fully expect the reboot of Murphy Brown to be the same. So edgy!
Rostered On,The Good Place is the best comedy series on TV by a wide margin IMO. S2 is really good.
Rostered On,Trust me s2 goes *hard*. The show doesn't care about maintaining status quo and that's what I love about it
Rostered On,"After only 2 seasons its one of the best comedies ever. The writing is genius, once you start to notice all the little details it shows how much time they put into this show. And they somehow constantly keep the show fresh."
Rostered On,"It has what no other series has - the element of surprise. You really don't know what's coming next, and it's so well written and acted that the ride is half the fun. Every time it changes you think it won't be as good as before, but it's better - the characters are deeper and richer and more fully developed. It's like a master class in how to write a great show."

Loaded,National Treasure isn’t even from the 90s.
Loaded,"My only problem thusfar is the friend that records everything.
Stop making evidence!"
Loaded,Press X to doubt
Loaded,"I love seeing headlines titled like this, they're so obvious with how densely packed they are with nonsense.

""It is possible one of the best films this year!  Packed with the funniest youth humor possible!  I cried butterfly tears!  Some actors name!""

Also, they make me look up something I didn't know existed.  How about that?  The show is getting panned from all sides.  I mean wow, critics and audiences really hate this BOMBASTIC GOODHEARTED MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT! (articles first line lol)"
Loaded,Actually its just daft.
Loaded,This is a steaming pile of dog shit and should be avoided
Loaded,"[44% with critics, 32% with audience.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/national_treasure_edge_of_history/s01)

I get that even shills have to pay rent, but *come on*."
Loaded,Actually it sucks ass
Loaded,Who can beat the 28 minutes I wasted watching this
Loaded,"Couldn’t make it past 7 minutes.  Disney, wake the fuck up/"
Loaded,"This show is fucking garbage. Saw my father enjoying it since he watches everything, but holy, it's so bad."
Loaded,Terrible.
Loaded,Not even trying to conceal the shilling
Loaded,This show is legit dogshit
Loaded,"Daft Fun.    
Now that is the word I was looking for.    
To describe my current taste in movies."
Loaded,"As big of a fan of the movie's I am not touching this show, ever."
Loaded,There is so much wrong with this headline I don't even know where to begin...
Loaded,Well we now know who OP is a shill for....
Loaded,Lost me at “youth-focused”
Loaded,Worst acting I've ever seen. Didn't make it 5 minutes.
Loaded,It’s a pretty okay show. Not great. Not the steaming pile of shit this sub purports it to be. Honestly the worst aspect is how aggressively they are aiming this show at Gen Z when it’s thirty something millennials who would have nostalgia for National Treasure.
Loaded,The happiest three star review of my life
Loaded,"No Nic Cage, doesn’t count. Fuck this show."
Loaded,Why does the person who wrote this article look like she's about to cry?
Loaded,"Lmao, it's not as good as this article is making it out to be, but it's also not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It's just fine. Bit cringe with how they try inject gen z humor in certain parts to cater to a younger audience, and the tone is lacking compared to the movies, but it's watchable."
Loaded,"Haven't started it but... Youth focused? Is it another ""kids save the day"" remake?"
Loaded,"Any one attached to this show should be embarrassed for themselves. It’s fucking horrible, I watched two episodes and it was one of the worst written and acted shows I’ve ever seen."
Loaded,How much did they get payed to write this poop? I guess they are getting desperate as no-one is watching it
Loaded,I see it a big hit with the fans on Rotten Tomatoes at a rousing 37 percent. I guess it’s better than She-Hulk and Willow
Loaded,Turned it off after 20 minutes. The writing was so bad
Loaded,counterpoint: it’s bad
Loaded,"Hold up, is there really an albino monk assassin in this show? Now they're ripping off the problematic parts of The DaVinci Code too?"
Loaded,I’ve been hearing the exact opposite
Loaded,"“Freemasons, albino monk assassins, Harvey Keitel … this youth-focused spin-off of Jerry Bruckheimer’s adventure movie franchise is loads of daft fun”

I read that in the voice of Stefon."
Loaded,"So this is an ad, got it."
Loaded,Sounds like a bad Stefan sketch.
Loaded,"This is nothing like the fun of the first movies. Zero charisma. Even that funny little sidekick guy made the movies magic. This just more of Disney cheaply cashing in on the ip it owns.   Ahh this point with star wars and marvel basically ruined it's time to start boycotting Disney plus.

If they know we will eat this shit and keep paying our subscription fee. They will keep making shit.  RIP starwars, marvel"
Loaded,Both the series and this article were written for the Young Adult demographics.
Loaded,"The problem they have is this. These sort so of movies have very little to no political messages in them. The problem is that screenplay writers now I think are physically incapable of *not* shoehorning in some political message that derails the episode or plot, or is just in your face and patronizing. 

So they’ll ruin it with some form of modern politics."
Loaded,I read that in Stefan’s voice
Loaded,There was an article on the front page 2 days ago calling it the worst tv show ever made.
Loaded,Inb4 Reddit cries about how this show ruined their lives and this author is full of shit lol
Loaded,[deleted]
Loaded,Where can you watch it in UK?
Loaded,National Treasure sucked. Bring back something in the air of The Goonies and I’m in
Loaded,If you love the first and second movies you’ll be at home in this series. It’s basically the same thing but in a tv form.
Loaded,"If it's anything like the movies it's just daft, no fun."
Loaded,So here for it. This needs to be told from a woman of struggle- and recognized as a part of this white santuario of immigrants that some white folk know as the US
Loaded,I watched the first episode. That was enough for me.
Loaded,You had me at albino monk assassins.
Loaded,"Uh , hello advertising"
Loaded,"Suuuure. When people actually watch it, the consensus will probably be that it's another crappy Disney+ show."
Loaded,"It's a fun show... biggest issue for me is that they've tried to split Riley's character over Oren & Tessa.... and it's not worked. 

&#x200B;

If the show was Jess & Brainwave Jr with one other person, it would flow a lot better i think."
Loaded,"I remember when the Guardian was a good outlet, it was circa 1996 when it started spiralling downward"
Loaded,Not every reboot beeds to star the entire Burger Kind Kids Club from 1993.
Loaded,I guess they didnt learn from what happened with the irregulars.
Loaded,Fuck off
Loaded,"This is SOOOOO not National Treasure like. It feels like an ABC After School Special.
#AnotherDisneyFail"
Loaded,This show was destined to flop simply due to not making a 3rd movie with Nicolas Cage.
Loaded,"It's like when people call stuff from the early 90s ""so 80s."""
Loaded,Neither is the Da Vinci Code which the albino monk assassin is from.
Loaded,"Sure, but the title doesn’t say it was either."
Loaded,Is he making HD video evidence of a criminal fucking conspiracy?
Loaded,"My problem (and I wholeheartedly love how kitschy national treasure is) is her one friend is the woooorst. The guy who gets kidnapped because hes lured with shoes, ruins their escape room, and tells secrets instantly. Why are they friends with him?!"
Loaded,"nah, if anything that's the most realistic thing about it. people these days, especially gen z, literally record everything. the weird shit you sometimes stumble upon tik tok or other social media and think ""that should've stayed private"" is ridiculous. people just got used to sharing everything about their lives so they film everything, including shit they shouldn't"
Loaded,"What's with this trope in shows/movies involving kids now-a-days??

Ghostbusters: Afterlife literally had a kid named ""Podcast""

The new Mighty Ducks show has a kid that goes around interviewing everyone.

This show has the video kid."
Loaded,So def some Gen Z appeal.
Loaded,"Didn't notice the showrunners (Cormac and Marianne Wibberley) are the same team who actually wrote the *National Treasure* and *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* screenplays, did we?"
Loaded,This is The Guardian. They will praise anything (and I dislike using this term) that people would call 'woke'.
Loaded,"The article is sarcastic AF!

""Sadly Peter Sadusky dies - presumably after the script for the second episode.""

""Catherine Zeta-Jones in a blonde wig, which should have gotten separate billing.""

""It is Latin, she tells her boss, for “I am a ghost”. He reels, he does. Reels."""
Loaded,"The article is a pretty scathing tear down of the series, title not withstanding"
Loaded,"""Embedded marketing"" vibes big time."
Loaded,"most underrated/underwatched ever! best <media> you didnt know/watch! im so sick of this marketing shit. 

im glad to see even a horde of bots couldnt  bring this shit to 4 digits."
Loaded,streaming* pile
Loaded,Is it really that bad? I love the national treasure movies and anything even remotely similar to them would be great.
Loaded,… that doesn’t mean the average critic rated it a 4 out of 10. It means 44% of critics liked it. Clearly the one who wrote the linked review is among them.
Loaded,Welcome to /r/television
Loaded,"Tulsa King ep1 is impressively bad

Lmao you people unironically like Tulsa King, you're beyond redemption."
Loaded,I stopped right after the introduction. I couldn't go on. They just threw out every red tv show flag they possibly could right in the beginning.
Loaded,"I made it thru the first episode, it got worse after the 7 minute mark."
Loaded,I'm imagining this comment in response to one of those Disney Channel movies from the 2000s and its cracking me tf up
Loaded,They're woke that's the problem.
Loaded,I thought they were already woke. I can’t keep track of who is making me angry and for what anymore...
Loaded,"Sorry, they can't hear you over the sound of the cash registers."
Loaded,"The ""Youthinizing"" is getting so fucking old.

""Let's reboot this beloved franchise (insert Mighty Ducks, Ghostbusters, National Treasure, etc.) and make it with kids who are so smart and save the day while the adults are near useless!""

Even the MCU is ""Youthinizing"" the popular characters like Doctor Strange & Hawkeye"
Loaded,"idk what to say man, to me it clearly is a steaming pile of shit."
Loaded,"Yeah, that’s exactly my take. This is the first time I’ve watched something that truly made me feel “old”, in the sense that everything about this show is aimed at a whole generation (or two) below me. The thing is, it isn’t really done in the best way either. It’s clearly not written *by* people of that generation. It’s written by people my age or older, throwing in all the stuff they think younger generations care most about. “We’ll pay rent by getting a vital dance video on TikTok”. Seriously? And the way she used supposedly being non-binary to literally bully a man out of a men’s bathroom, that was truly painful (or “cringe”, as the kids would say). 

I get it, they want to make this show to draw in younger generations, not necessarily just cater to millennials’ nostalgia, but it’s so cheaply and badly done. I want to enjoy the silly adventure mystery stuff, but the rest just takes me out of it. It doesn’t take either me *or* younger people seriously at all, and at times feels almost insulting."
Loaded,dude I'm gen z and no one wants this crap. we'd be happy with good shows too
Loaded,"I agree. I'm sticking with it, but it's clearly made for a younger audience for some perplexing reason. I get it with Mighty Ducks Game Changers since it's about a youth hockey team, but National Treasure is a weird thing to gen-Z-ify when there is an actual desire for an adult (but still family friendly) National Treasure revival."
Loaded,"Agreed, that’s my issue with it."
Loaded,It's the Guardian's house look.
Loaded,"The problem isn’t the humor, it’s just a terribly written show. I’ve seen episodes of duck tails with better story lines."
Loaded,The actual content of the article sounds like it completely agrees with you about the quality of the show
Loaded,"It's not a remake. It's set around 20 years after the movies. And they are young adults, not kids. Unless you think anyone less than 50 is a kid, then yeah ... kids probably save the day (though so far I haven't yet seen much saving, more struggling)"
Loaded,There are parts of *The Da Vinci Code* that *aren't* problematic?
Loaded,I'm certain they were forced to mention DACA a set amount of times.
Loaded,"Are you a yoga instructor?

Cause that's a helluva reach just to defend bad writing."
Loaded,"Sorry… noped out in the second episode where the female protagonist made four extraordinary leaps of logic to almost instantly solve an ancient codex…. Yeah, nah."
Loaded,Catherine Zeta-Jones murdered my whole FAAAAAMILYYYYYYY!
LOST SONG,This is very “I have taken one screenwriting class”
LOST SONG,"The event where he fails to protect Ellie already happended in KC, when she saved him. He talks about with Tommy."
LOST SONG,"Everyone is allowed to their own opinion about pop culture. If OP doesn’t like it, that’s totally fine. 

That being said, this critique reads like the failures of the show are because they don’t follow the one formula for success. There are plenty of ways to make a successful, enjoyable show. OP ignores the fact that lots of people really enjoy it, even if it doesn’t follow the typical recipe for success."
LOST SONG,"I’ll argue against a few points here. 

1. Joels belief is that people are better off away from him (note how he would choose to live alone on a farm if given the choice). He believes he is responsible for the death of his daughter and Tess, and that it is only a matter of when (not if) he will be responsible for Ellie’s death.

2. Joel gets the pair lost on the trail and is responsible for the pair being ambushed by the commune’s riders. Joel freezes with fear and rather than taking action/speaking up, he allows the dog an opportunity to attack/hurt Ellie. (This is an explicit event that Joel speaks about as manifestation of his fear).

3. I propose that the conflict here is not between Ellie and Joel, but between Joel and Tommy. Recall that Joel was always looking out for Tommy, even before the outbreak. Tommy represents the last remnants of his family. The only person he’s yet to fail (besides Ellie). The conflict comes when Tommy refuses to take Ellie. This forces Joel to confront the reality that he is still responsible for Ellie. (Ge immediately sees a girl resembling his daughter, which causes a relapse into fear and causes him to once again question WHEN he will fail Ellie). 

4. This one happens offscreen. Ellie listens in on Joel and Tommy’s conversation. The conversation is crucial to understanding Joel’s feelings and motivations, but it also affects Ellie’s trust in Joel (a concept called to attention earlier this episode). 

5. This is the confrontation between Joel and Ellie. Ellie confronts Joel about his intentions to leave her. He ultimately gets defensive and lashes out. He tells her off and makes it clear he wants nothing to do with her (a lie to himself and to Ellie). The resolution to this comes when Joel reflects in bed. He visualizes his daughter, and the children he saw earlier living peacefully. He knows he doesn’t want to abandon Ellie, but he has to confront his fears. What will he do?

6. Joel chooses to stay with Ellie. He does so in a patently awkward way. A way only Joel could. He just waits by the horses. 

7. Are we here yet? Or was Joel proven correct all along? Is he failing Ellie by getting stabbed? 

So I think structurally, this is the breakdown of the story beats this episode. The confrontation wasn’t the conflict of the episode structurally speaking. It was the further complication which forced a choice. It also was a character moment as well as a relationship moment. The things Joel says are defensive but understandable. And, we see the regret he feels for saying them. 

It’s fine if this isn’t how you read the scenes initially or if you can’t see them this way. But the themes behind the characters’ actions are string. The interpersonal connections are believable. If it doesn’t resonate with you, ok. But I question what motivates you to try to prove that the lack of resonance is a product of objectively failed structure."
LOST SONG,"I don't want to attack you for what you think about the show, but I think you're missing all the nuance that the writing rides with its character driven story. 
I can't write out my disagreement for each of your points, but I think the writing is doing a great job following the game and making necessary changes to make it work for TV.
The one point you go back to a lot is how Joel doesn't show (or spoken through the writing) that he is facing this question of if he's good enough to protect this girl, but there's more to it. He's scared that he'll lose her the same way he lost his daughter and while he's the most badass person around to protect her, he doesn't think he can handle that loss again and is doing what he can only think to do to not let that happen. His chest pains, heavy breathing, when he thinks he sees his real daughter, then dreams about her and how that loss affected him.
You're entitled to you opinion, but there's is so much more there you're missing if these are the points you're latching onto.
This is an amazing story and sure you could say I'm biased from the game but I hope you look at it a little deeper and find a way to enjoy it!"
LOST SONG,"You sound like you read one book on rigid screenwriting tips, and think you are a master storyteller."
LOST SONG,"If you haven’t seen the Joel and Ellie’s relationship evolve over 6 episodes, then you’ve not been paying attention. While he feels his ability to protect her has diminished a bit due to age etc, he says that as he’s unwilling to face the much more real fact that he’s grown to care for this girl, deeply, and she’s filled a Sara size hole and he’s terrified of going through that again, so best to disassociate as quickly as possible instead of risking that pain again."
LOST SONG,It's 2023 and people still think they will be taken seriously about their pop culture critiques.
LOST SONG,"I skimmed your post and I think you seem to be confining your thinking to mainstream Hollywood storytelling's arbitrary rules, where there is almost no room for subtlety and everything has to be explicit and easily digestible for a mildly interested, casual audience.

By your criteria, 'The Sopranos' and 'Mad Men' aren't great shows either because you can't pinpoint characters' choices and motivations to a specific scene earlier in the episode/last couple of episodes.

What TV shows do you give a 10/10 to? Not trying to be condescending, but I have an idea what those shows would be like and what networks they would be on."
LOST SONG,I ain't reading all that
LOST SONG,"Opinions are a thing. No need to write an amateur essay on it. What you identify personally as bad writing, others may identify as quality character development, it’s that simple. 

However, you seem to be in the minority regarding the show."
LOST SONG,disagree
LOST SONG,"I’m only responding to point 1 because that’s all I needed to see that you’re not seeing the big picture of the story apparently. The show does not do a poor job establishing his fear of losing someone because the fear isn’t directly related to Ellie. His fear is that as he gets closer to ellie his fear in losing her like his daughter grows. It would make sense for this fear to grow as he gets closer to tommy because the “Joel, tommy, Sarah” dynamic is when he lost his daughter and failed her. They highlighted it again when the ppl had their guns pointed at ellie and he froze. He also almost lost Ellie literally the episode before last nights. Twice actually. 

And his incompetence is shown in the intro to the whole series when he proved he was unable to protect the ONE person in the world he was truly responsible for."
LOST SONG,Your entitled to your opinion. I appreciate you actually laying out reasons too. I don’t really agree but you shared your opinions in a reasonable respectful way so good on you.
LOST SONG,I can’t imagine going through all this effort with a post like this when all you have to do is simply not watch it if it’s not for you.
LOST SONG,Go outside
LOST SONG,"damn, all that for such a mediocre and nitpicking take. while it’s not a groundbreaking show, it still hovers around an 8. you keep talking about plot devices like there’s a cinema bible out there somewhere. while the episodes currently out seem to have rushed some parts from the video games, they’re quite adapted excellently to fit the narrative of the series."
LOST SONG,That was a long-ass post to tell us you don’t actually understand writing and character development.
LOST SONG,What is this garbage essay? Lmao
LOST SONG,"I just can’t understand the point of posts like this. Like what posses a person to post something this long that basically amounts to “Even though the show is a hit that everyone is talking about, all of those people are wrong, actually.”?"
LOST SONG,Hypercriticism is a plague. Its as if people go out of their way to interpret things in the most negative way possible.
LOST SONG,"Literally every reason you gave is not even close to accurate.   Typical for these types of posts on Reddit.   Your self awareness is shockingly low.   Your entire account is bashing this show.   I think we all know why.   Also, you think climate change can be stopped if everyone goes vegan lol?  Please don’t reproduce"
LOST SONG,"I’ll never understand people who don’t like something that’s universally praised by critics and viewers, feeling the need to post about how the thing they just don’t like is actually bad and everyone else is wrong for liking it so much. It’s okay to not like something. We don’t need a dissertation about how poor you think it is and how everyone is overrating it."
LOST SONG,"“Overrated” = “other people like something I don’t like, and I want to feel better about my opinion.”"
LOST SONG,What a miserable take. Do you burn your toast on purpose just so you can bitch about it to your coworkers?
LOST SONG,"If you don’t like it why did you take the time to write this? 

I don’t get why you have to call it ‘overrated’ instead of just writing it off as not your thing.

You’re not going to like every popular show. It’s almost like people have different tastes.

But it is so pretentious to write a post slating a piece of entertainment that millions of people are enjoying just because you didn’t like it"
LOST SONG,"I like it.  A lot. 

The bad writer … is you."
LOST SONG,Imagine writing all that lmaooo
LOST SONG,Lol stoped at “Joel has an incorrect belief” dude - you’re just wrong.
LOST SONG,OP trying to tell the world he is a better writer than Emmy winner Craig Mazin & the guy who co-created the entire TLOU universe in Neil Druckmann. Yeah bro I don’t think so.
LOST SONG,I feel like in the real world a ton of people do end up making/changing decisions after a night of sleep. At least people who don't feel the need to stick to their opinion because it's the first thought they had.
LOST SONG,"Never played the game, never watched the show, but this was the perfect length of read for the poop I was taking. Have a good day..."
LOST SONG,"I think you're just suffering from ""howiwoulddaitus"" you're forming opinions about how you would have done it, and missing a lot of what you say is missing. 

I was actually just talking about this last night. How a lot of plot and character development other shows would stretch over multiple episodes, are written very economically in this show. 

Just a super short example of something you say is missing... Joel believes he's unfit to protect Ellie, and unfit to be her ""father"". 

Despite all the other instances showing him failing in his goals in previous episodes, you're ignoring the PTSD. But just inside this episode he falls asleep on watch. He's pushed by fear into inaction. He is convinced he's the only one who can ""save"" his brother, yet when his brother is out in the world on his own his brother is the one who thrives. He's reminded how he failed his daughter. He gains information about how he failed to notice that the kid was bitten. 

He's old. He knows he's lost a few steps, and he thinks that the only person he knows and trusts and believes is more capable than he is is a better choice for Ellie. A better choice for his ""daughter"". So he thinks that abandoning his daughter to the care of his brother would be the best option. But that's a selfish choice, and Joel's trying to outgrow being selfish. 

Just because you might be a bad parent sometimes, doesn't mean you get to abandon your kids. 

Joel's character growth, and obstacle he's overcoming isn't just his belief that he can't protect her. It's his belief that he's a shit father who failed at saving his daughter and will fail that once again. His growth is that despite those fears... A fear that has caused him to remove himself from humanity for a decade... He now understands that being a father and committing to the future of your children is more important than your fears."
LOST SONG,"I read first point. Completely off... Perhaps you're just unable to pay attention or something... Joel has trauma from losing his daughter, he's not gonna be logical about his ability to protect Ellie. Dude... it's so fucking basic. I ain't reading the rest considering the first point is completely dogshit and doesn't even take into account the character, but is simply your personal interpretation of it from your POV instead of Joel's... 

And I was hoping for a good critique..."
LOST SONG,"I don’t understand posts like this.  Is your goal to make people who like the show stop liking it and start thinking like you?

Why not just like…not watch the show and let those who like it enjoy it.

I see these types on posts on every entertainment subreddit I look at.

Makes no sense."
LOST SONG,"I appreciate you sharing all your views and I personally disagree with a couple points. 

I think they provided multiple examples of Joel’s failures (Ellie killing the guy, the brother sneaking up on them at night, Joel falling asleep on watch). 

I think Joel does not trust many people (and Tommy shows signs of being similar to Joel in that thinking). Joel believes if he tells the community he will risk Ellie being killed on the spot. Tommy trusts Joel, but nobody else in the community has a reason to and it’s a “communist” community where they all have a say. Joel is risking Ellie’s life if he chooses to tell everyone and he HATES putting trust in other people, especially any stranger. 

I also think that Joel decision to take Ellie is a lot of things that are unsaid. Joel at this point truly cares for Eliie and is scared of messing up and losing her like Sarah. He is deeply conflicted and is attempting to send her with Tommy because it’s an easy way out for him to avoid fucking up and killing someone he is starting to (or already does) love. They have been side by side for months now due to the time lapses. I personally think he decides by letting her go he is losing her and he doesn’t want to make her upset or feel unsafe because the fatherly instinct have kicked in whether he likes it or not, and that’s why he goes. 

That’s all my feedback. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions and theory’s."
LOST SONG,It’s definitely a good show but I can’t disagree that it’s overhyped by a lot
LOST SONG,"Fair play to your post. But I feel like if there was a huge triggering event in Sunday's episode, someone else would've written a long post about being spoonfed Joel's decision/realization that he wants to continue going with Ellie.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
LOST SONG,All that for a drop of blood
LOST SONG,"What is this, college?"
LOST SONG,"I do agree that there could have been some improvements. Mostly:

Why didn’t Joel and Tommy escort Ellie?
Why did Joel change his mind?
Why did he not even consider staying at the encampment with Ellie for longer than a day?"
LOST SONG,"What you're suggesting is some The Walking Dead level of hacky writing. Following to the letter the 'how to structure a story' chapter of every 'how to write' book ever is a good way to create the most mediocre, painfully predictable story filled with the most annoying tropes;

and to suggest that the one show that actively avoids doing that in a sea of mediocre, trope-filled stories that is the zombie sub-genre is poorly written because of it is just sad for someone who calls himself a writer."
LOST SONG,"Don't care about any of that - still enjoying this show more than anything else I've watched in a long time.  I've never played or seen the video game and never paid attention to the hype for this show, so going in I had no bias except assuming that a show or movie based on a video game is going to be mediocre. 

I'm the type of viewer who has trouble staying awake for most 'critically-acclaimed' shows, and I don't even give a chance to commercial-ridden network television or reality TV."
LOST SONG,"I think the thing you're fundamentally missing is that Joel learning to let people in and trust Ellie specifically are season long arcs and this is the midpoint of the story. Of course this episode seemingly confirms Joel's worst fears, that's what mid story complications do. They bring the main character to their lowest point before they can have their incorrect beliefs changed. 

Now Joel, deeply hurt and likely incapacitated, will be forced to rely Ellie's responsibility as he recovers, responsibility that he's openly doubted for the whole show but which was really underscored at the beginning of this episode. And he's going to learn that of course he can't protect Ellie himself, he needs a partner. With time, he'll realize Ellie is that partner and that the real reason he's struggled to protect her is because he isn't trusting her and is trying to carry both their weight instead of letting her help him too. There's even a direct call back to how bad Joel's trust issues nearly screwed them over in this episode when Joel talks about how Ellie covertly getting a gun when he wouldn't let her have one was the only reason he survived the initial attack in Kansas City.

Sure, there are individual plot beats that could be improved (I agree, Joel changed his mind about going along with Ellie too quickly and easily) but a lot of your big complaints about this episode boil down to getting upset that the main character hasn't completed his character arc in the middle of Act 2."
LOST SONG,"Why do you think a wall of text justifies using the dumbest most useless word in all of criticism?


All ‘overrated’ mean is other people like something more than you and you are unhappy about it. 

It’s an opinion on other’s opinions."
LOST SONG,Where did you get the idea that for a story to be good the characters have to undergo some kind of change?
LOST SONG,"This reads like the way my English teacher wanted me to pick apart books for the sake of picking them apart before I decided is was just better to just try to enjoy for the sake of trying to enjoy them instead.

When you pick something into pure parts and categories like this, you tear asunder any implicit meaning, losing the entire 'gestalt'. The whole being greater than the sum of its parts speaks to something *beyond* just its parts *or* its sum, but rather the simultaneous vision of both the parts and the whole. You've focused too much on the parts, and lost the forest for the trees."
LOST SONG,"Not reading all of it as your first two problems are already wrong imo. He is justified in his fear of becoming incompetent to fully protect her. He's gotten very lucky so far that they've managed to make it across the US. Ellie saved his ass by shooting that guy because (unknown to him) she had a hidden gun, the dog didn't detect an infection in Ellie when it very well could have, the two people that snuck up on them despite the broken glass were actually good people and didn't immediately kill and rob them etc. He's getting old and his hearing is piss poor, as he himself states.

Your second problem - ""his incompetence isn't well established this episode"" is also wrong, as it wasn't just him over-sleeping, he also froze up when the dog went in to smell Ellie, which could have easily been the end of her.

Sorry, it just seems like you're just not properly paying attention."
LOST SONG,Your post is bad writing. (I assume)
LOST SONG,"People are watching it in droves and enjoying it.

You typed all this to fight and no one really cares"
LOST SONG,"I ain't reading all that, I'm happy for tho, or sorry that happened."
LOST SONG,I agree. I feel like the show is really light-weight. There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on but I feel like the show’s a bit rushed and we need to live in the world a bit more. The fact they spent an episode involving two other characters makes me feel like they don’t have a lot of meat to the story
LOST SONG,"It’s Reddit. Youre going to be slammed. 

That being said, the show is fine. Much better shows on HBOMax."
LOST SONG,"Since you’re such a expert, what successful stories have you written?"
LOST SONG,Next
LOST SONG,You’re a pretentious asshole. No one is impressed
LOST SONG,You don’t like a show that people like? Who cares.
LOST SONG,Have totally lost interest in this show after anxiously waiting for its premier. Bad writing.
LOST SONG,"I actually agree with you. I noticed the weaknesses of the show as far back as ep 3. I pointed it out at the time, but I got shot down too. I think the writing is quite weak, and the overall quality will suffer because of it. I'm sure they cut corners with the construction of the show. Like I noticed there are way fewer interactions with the infected and marauding scavengers than one would expect. Maybe it was to save money? Who knows. But yeah, I think the writing is weak. I've also played the game though, and I definitely hold the game to a higher standard.

Don't worry. Opinions like this typically don't do well during the run of a show. Especially if the show is fairly well liked. These days all it takes is likable characters with comfortable political messaging."
LOST SONG,The fact that you know these posts are annoying af but still posted it anyways is ridiculous.  We don't need multiple posts like this every single week.  Just let the season play out.
LOST SONG,"So people love the one off gay romance episode with exactly .05% connection to the rest of the show, but when we finally have our leads show some character development it’s boring and overrated..?

Casual fans are really wild"
LOST SONG,"I enjoy the show, but agree with you that the show is flawed. I have played the game, so any set backs the show has I can kind of fill in the gaps with from the game, but for someone who hasn't I can see some scenes might be a bit odd.I also didn't like how Joel just went to sleep and changed his mind immediately after an emotional conflict. 

More generally though, I like Pedro and Bellas portrayal of Joel and Ellie, but I think the show did a REALLY poor job of establishing their relatioship. This episode they felt a lot closer, but they also then immediately went to big conflict between each other, which I felt was a little too soon. 

They should have had a few more scenes establishing them getting closer throughout the previous episodes, but I guess its hard to do under limited time. In the game you had dozens of hours of interaction and just simple idle chatter between them which helped to establish their relationship so well, but in the show they boil it down to just a few key moments of dialogue and sometimes it can come off a tad cringey or inauthentic just because its so few and far between. 

I am interested to see the season play out though. There is still a lot of an amazing story left and if they can land it then I will be impressed. If not then, at least it was a more than decent video game adaptation. 

&#x200B;

And side note, I don't understand everyone going wild at you for having an opinion on a TV show."
LOST SONG,"It bothered me that Tommy and Joel didn’t take the trip together. That was the biggest flaw in the episode for me but I’ve never played the game nor do I know the plot of the game, and that may have simply been sticking to the storyline. It could have made for a great storyline though complete with a multitude of tragic results if they did though, IMO. 
I’ve seen game spoilers hint that the TV audience isn’t going to like where Joel’s character arc was headed but killing off the top-billed, main character in 6 episodes was bold, assuming he is dead. Taking the game spoilers at their word though and seeing the next episode highlights points to a larger character development that may make your points moot and that is, with all the hype about Pascal, it’s not about him. Not knowing what is next and simply seeing what’s been presented and how ep 6 played out, the big, very meta plot twist is everything up to now and what’s ahead wasn’t about Joel, it’s about Ellie and her development in the timeline. And that’s a story I can get into because she is one incredible and dynamic character."
LOST SONG,I would submit to you that posts about how some popular thing isn’t as good as everyone says (but is still good) are a waste of everyone’s time. It’s just not an interesting topic of conversation. Maybe go take a walk or something
LOST SONG,I like the show and I agree with all of this. Last night’s episode was really just the most egregious example of it. I’m ready to say it is the worst of the series so far. A mixture of filler and rushed plot lines
LOST SONG,no one cares
LOST SONG,Is it overrated or just...widely rated?
LOST SONG,the npc’s here will disagree  with you. but you’re spot on OP
LOST SONG,"You know, when every comment Is pointing out how horrible of a take this is, and you yourself labelled it as ""one of those posts,"" perhaps you should just not post it."
LOST SONG,"It’s just a fucking TV show, you’re taking it way too seriously, you need to get some kind of other interest in your life, or a hobby"
LOST SONG,"I feel like the acting is so forced. Pedro Pascal does alright, but I cannot get over Ellie’s character. I get annoyed in general, but the jokes and the fake laughing makes me cringe. Also, the Game of Thrones syndrome where shit hits the fan and at the very last moment something saves Ellie or Joel… maybe I am just losing interest in TV shows formulaic nature in general."
LOST SONG,"My opinion is that it’s a perfectly fine show that’s getting a lot of buzz right now because honestly there’s not a lot of current shows that are very good airing week to week. It’s successful in my opinion because they picked a great time to air it (no dragon shows, no Yellowstone, no current big shows)."
LOST SONG,Its not as good as TWD
LOST SONG,"Wow. You wrote a lot and worked really hard for me to waive it all away by saying “but I am super engaged in the people, their arc, and their story”. Sometimes that is enough and in this case they are doing it as well or better than any other new show."
LOST SONG,Not going to read all of this wall of text. If you don't like it then don't watch it. This seems like a lot of effort to explain why you don't like something to tell people that have no power to change it and probably wouldn't even if they could because they like it the way it is.
LOST SONG,yeah its not really amazing its just okay to me
LOST SONG,It’s an entirely different show to people who have played the game. We know what’s coming up.
LOST SONG,I couldn’t read your post cus it’s too long and I downvoted you because these kind of posts are so boring and unimaginative.
LOST SONG,"Idk why you’re getting all this hate lmao. Agree or disagree it’s nice to see a well thought out argument. I think it’s a good show, your critiques are definitely valid and you raise some good points. Joel changing his mind was very weak from a writing standpoint"
LOST SONG,"Please, stop with this nonsense. I'm tired of reading these overrated posts every single day. Every single popular show is overrated to someone, no one gives a shit.

What do you want, a medal for being contrarian? Do you think you're going to change the opinion of the entire world and affect the show's reputation? Like, what are we supposed to do? If you think it's overrated then great, watch it with a little less enthusiasm lol. Like, what else?"
LOST SONG,"It’s following the plot of the video game. Maybe your rules don’t apply since the story was written as game play originally then adapted for TV. Where the game writers have stuck (mostly) to the game’s plot. You’re over thinking anyways. It’s TV, not one of the moon landings."
LOST SONG,"If you want to be a good writer, I urge you to reconsider your position on so-called writing rules. These are not laws written in stone, but mere observations made by someone who just read a lot. It's good to know them, but to cling to them fanatically is really a bad idea."
LOST SONG,"Go outside and touch some grass. Self-proclaimed amateur writer critiques show that professionals worked on and knows where they all went wrong. 

You can't make this shit up"
LOST SONG,Calling things overrated is overrated
LOST SONG,People-STOP saying overrated or underrated when it is basically your opinion versus someone else's opinion! YOU are not the authority on ratings. Just the authority on your own opinion.
LOST SONG,"I think you're right.  I don't know about the analysis, but I do think the show is over-rated.  I like it.  It's fine, but not amazing."
LOST SONG,Lol you didn’t need to write a dissertation. Go outside and get some fresh or something. It is just a tv show.
LOST SONG,It is an extremely overrated and boring show
LOST SONG,">Storytelling 101: whenever you write a story, any story, for it to be considered truly good you need events that will impact the characters' lives and cause them to change, growing out of their wrong beliefs and adopting better ones.

I reject the idea that storytelling is fundamentally about characters who have wrong beliefs growing and changing to accept better beliefs, so your analysis of the show is starting from a flawed premise.

Storytelling is fundamentally about the intersection of character goals and the conflict in trying to achieve those goals. That's Storytelling 101.

I actually don't like the show btw. I stopped after the first episode because they diluted the storytelling. It took the videogame 15 minutes to get to Sarah's death, and the show took 30 minutes, because they added unnecessary backstory that sucked all the power out of the events of the story.

They got it backwards. You would expect the videogame to drag the story out, because the immersiveness of gameplay can sustain the interest of the gamer in a way that would be boring to the viewer."
LOST SONG,"Yeah, these storytelling “rules” are all bullshit. You can use them to make your story more efficient, but following them religiously is dumb. If every movie or show had to comply with these rules to be considered good, that’d mean stuff like the leftovers or everything David Lynch has ever done is bad. And it’s not."
LOST SONG,"Reminds me of Christopher Moltisanti after he bought ""How to write a movie in 21 days"""
LOST SONG,What's great is they are trying to breakdown someone's writing who literally has a podcast about screenwriting. Screams contrarian to me.
LOST SONG,Not to mention how he says he felt powerless when the Jackson guards surrounded them and he thought their dog would tear Ellie apart if it picked up the infection
LOST SONG,OP keeps acting like the previous episodes don’t exist as background for why the story is where it’s at. Op is accurate in pointing out Joel making a big deal about separating from Ellie then 10 hours later is like “let’s go” however that does not ruin the ep as OP claims
LOST SONG,"Yeah, I remember. It needed to happen again. But it's fine, if that's convincing enough for you (I don't mean it sarcastically, it's truly fine). That was not the crux of my critique. The crux of my critique was Joel's mind changing on a dime without anything triggering that change."
LOST SONG,Everyone is allowed their opinion but we can still critique his opinion.
LOST SONG,This is what I was thinking. This whole post reads like someone who took a course on story writing and then thinks that strict formula is the only way to do things. The fact of the matter is it isn't.
LOST SONG,"Apparently, you're not supposed to have opinions about this show or risk being called a bigot even if you lay out your points. Instead of responding point for point in agreement or disagreement, they respond with emotionally immature comments. I left the Last of Us subreddit because of the irrational and simple-minded fanbase. I catch the show episodes between Mondays thru Thursday because the LOU isn't must-see tv. 

Good luck with having someone reply to your comment like an adult and without middle school snark. 

I miss the days of The Walking Dead discussions before the series went to shit. This fanbase isn't for me."
LOST SONG,"Yes, people can still enjoy a show with bad writing."
LOST SONG,"Thanks for the long, thoughtful response. I don't think the \*main\* conflict is between Joel and Tommy, no. It's pretty clear to me that it's between Joel and Ellie. Just so I don't have to type a giant response, let me focus on your points 5 and 6. Having the resolution of that argument be simply ""Joel reflects in bed and thinks better of it"" is weak writing. You may disagree with me, that's fine. 

I'll even go further: in real life, it's perfectly possible that someone would act the way that Joel did, and many people do, in fact, act that way. But good writing is not simply being ""true to life."" Good writing is about creating tension, increasing the stakes (including emotional stakes) and keeping the audience on the edge until the character is forced upon a situation where he'll have to change to save the day. Joel sleeping through the night and reflecting on his problem is fairly realistic when it comes to how human can change, but it's note exciting or interesting. We want the change to be induced from the outside, forced by external events in a high-stakes situation. You might disagree with me (and many people here do), and that's perfectly fine. But that's the recipe for success for most of the best stories in the world. The reason is that, honestly, it just looks better."
Fallet,It’s hilarious. 
Fallet,Where can I find it streaming?
Fallet,"I went in expecting a noir northern European series.

I came out giggling at all the shooting in the thighs.  "
Fallet,It’s in Netflix
Fallet,Netflix! :D 
Fallet,Thanks
The Paper,This guy is GOOD!  He tracked the joke down to a local California newspaper's letter to the editor?  Nicely done!
The Paper,No trailer? :(
The Paper,"I read that as ""fictional paper firm"" and was really looking forward to meeting Slavic Michael, Slavic Dwight and Slavic Jim."
The Paper,"Is this a Netflix original?

Cause US Netflix already has a rebroadcast Slavic series, the Ukrainian political comedy ""Servant of the people"" (mostly  Russian language, some bits of Ukrainian). 

A straight laiced foul mouthed history teacher with more honor then sense of self preservation accidentally becomes a YouTube sensation when a student secretly records his curse filled rant against the government, than he accidentally becomes Prime Minister and has to battle the forces of corruption. It has a nice theme song"
The Paper,"Croatia is on the opposite end of the Slavic spectrum from Russia. That said, god bless all Slavs. "
The Paper,It's just ten hours of cousins going bowling...
The Paper,"Slavic Citizen Kane

I hope that the sled is a black white striped adidas sweater"
The Paper,The trailer is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK3FsUzPhRE)
The Paper,"Mihael, Dvajt and Jakov."
The Paper,"Your ignorance is showing. You do know that majority of the Slavic countries absolutely despise being stereotyped as Russians, right?"
The Paper,"Thanks, looks dope"
The Paper,"Yeah Im dumb allright

But it was a joke"
The Paper,The second season has just dropped on Netflix. 
The Paper,"ISTR Nigel Hawthorn was a great classical actor, he played a knight and was later knighted himself, Sir Nigel Hawthorn played Sir Humphrey Appleby.

This is a wonderful show and shows the British doing on of the things their best at, making fun of themselves."
The Paper,"I just watched the first episode for the first time and other than the realization that The Newsroom is fantastic is that I thought it was weird McAvoy smoked a cigarette in his office. It actually threw me off and that's all I could think about during that scene. Seems out of the ordinary for something like that in a Sorkin show, where the dialogue has always grabbed my attention, not some prop. "
The Paper,"I think some people smoke out of depression.  It's pretty widely accepted that smoking is a form of killing yourself, albeit slowly.  I only saw the first two episodes so far, and Will seems like he doesn't really have a lot to live for (aside from the news.)  He's going through the motions of life, but he's just hopeful enough about things changing that he's not going to kill himself abruptly."
The Paper,"the writer, sorkin is binge alcohol and tobaco user.  these themes are prominent in this as well as west wing (a main character is an alcoholic).    He is writing what he knows.  

newsroom is good, but west wing is much better imo.  Check it out if you haven't."
The Paper,Thanks for the suggestion. I hadn't realized they made it into a TV show
The Paper,I loved the first season. Hope they get to adapt the rest of the comics
The Paper,"I've been telling people to watch it. It's a mostly well done series, first episode was a bit rough. You can tell they didn't get a ton of money to make it, but really it's not a big deal. The actresses all really grew in to their roles after the first ep, or maybe two. 

I think it might have gotten more buzz if they'd done some reworking / reshoots on ep 1, just a couple nickels from Amazons more expensive shows would have done it.

There was a bit about sexuality, and I thought it was very unique and well done.

Watch the first two episodes before deciding if you want to finish."
The Paper,"Isn't it? Admittedly I've only seen up to episode 5 so far.

Don't get me wrong, it's good and you should check it out. But in my opinion it isn't spectacular, and comparing it to Stranger Things does it a disservice. It's like Stranger Things insomuch as it has teenagers, science fiction and a little bit in the 80s. May as well compare it to Doctor Who.

Edit - in terms of the hype, I am seeing it getting talked about. Mainly with people saying it's the next Stranger Things. So I guess that's working."
The Paper,Amazon buried/tanked this show and I have no idea why. It's good!
The Paper,"It's a cool series, but it's a bit hit or miss at times. I was especially skeptical at the beginning, but overall, I'm glad I persevered."
The Paper,The kid actors are all superb.
The Paper,[deleted]
The Paper,Shout out to Adina Porter. Quickly becoming a mainstay in scifi productions. A surprising career arc.
The Paper,"""This show has everything!""

Lights, psychos, Furbies, screaming babies in Mozart wigs, sunburned drifters with soap sud beards."
The Paper,"I thought the quality was very uneven. It has some really good parts in it, but the main story arc and villains felt very weak and there was a bit too much artificial drama between the main characters."
The Paper,Where is it streaming?
The Paper,"First episode was so bad we gave up on any more.

Cannot believe that some people are praising the leads, they were both terribly written and terribly performed."
The Paper,Wait when did they make Paper Girls into a show?
The Paper,"It not receiving a renewal yet has given me anxiety. I'd hate for another adaptation of Brian's work to get axed again. Especially since this like y the last man is worth the watch.
 Despite the budgetary constraints, the main characters are well casted and really put life into the material."
The Paper,"We watched it about two weeks ago, overall worth the watch. nothing revolutionary or what i would call can't miss TV yet enjoyable enough. i would question it's premise for longevity before it just becomes a rinse and repeat, which is what happened to stranger things.

my main issue with the show is how much the characters are willing to listen to people about the merits of the war on face value for who is good v bad, and proceed to act like they are honor bound to choose that side. 

>!THE TAMPON SCENE HAD ME DYING THOUGH, especially Mac with her explanation to regular v super being the size of your vagina, duh!!<"
The Paper,I liked it. It had some strange scenes but overall it was good.
The Paper,"I gave it a couple of episodes, but I couldn't get into it. Something about the dialogue seemed off to me. Idk."
The Paper,I really like the original graphic novel. I’ll look into it. I didn’t even know they were making a series. ￼￼
The Paper,"I enjoyed it although I didn’t think they were 12.

Hope the story continues."
The Paper,That description is exactly the same thought I had.
The Paper,I always wanted to see a live action mecha fight. I did not expect this show would be the thing to deliver that.
The Paper,"I forgot they made it into a show, I never see it on Prime being advertised so it totally escaped my mind. Loved the comic series so I'll check it out."
The Paper,Re-reading the graphic novel right now before watching. I can‘t wait to watch.
The Paper,I did not know this existed. i will give it a try. loved future man.
The Paper,"I like the show and the writer (I love his work on Ex Machina and Saga, plus Y: The Last Man), but the actress for Mac bothers me."
The Paper,"The acting from the young cast is really good too, esp the girl who plays Mac."
The Paper,It’s simply not that good. It’s so weird that people just can’t affect that people don’t like the shows that they like.
The Paper,Score and soundtrack were bomb too
The Paper,"I only watched the first couple episodes but found them to be really, really fucking bad."
The Paper,"because it wasn't that great, and it looked like crap....."
The Paper,"Its good but its not and epic, they didn't pit money into marketing because to didn't screen well. Ive watched it and its ok, has some great concepts and some encouraging acting but thats it. That is why there is not much hype."
The Paper,"Gave it a try, but the cast was godawful. Not their fault they are very young."
The Paper,"It doesn't deserve it, it's mediocre"
The Paper,"The plot is simple and enjoyable, effects are cheap and somewhat laughable but the setting and especially the design team did a kickass job recreating a believable late 80's feeling it really feels nostalgic."
The Paper,"well if that ain't two shows that I don't find remotely interesting, sorry OP. Not even much of a Vaughan fan, so there's that"
The Paper,Eh. Boring. Ruined a good sci fi idea.
The Paper,"It is so good. Perfect for anyone who has reached that stage of their life where they're starting to question those What Ifs, i.e. how their life might have turned out if they had made different choices in the past. And I don't mean it in a depressing way either, it genuinely helps ease the anxiety and the guilt you might have around those issues."
The Paper,Stranger Things with bad acting and no budget.
The Paper,"This comic is amazing, the series is just alright. The girls are very good but the changes they've made and the pacing aren't great."
The Paper,is it a standalone season or does it end on a cliffhanger?
The Paper,"Yeah marketing for it has been basically nonexistent. I guess them releasing it only like a month before LOTR meant they were already in marketing for their biggest show and didn't do it for this.

It's doubtful it'll get renewed because of that sadly (or maybe Amazon is conscious of that mistake and will do it anyway since they can afford to lose money)"
The Paper,"I agree, the first episode is the weakest and weirdly feels the cheapest."
The Paper,Is this a good show to watch with my 12 y/o daughter?
The Paper,"I've enjoyed it but it's nothing like Stranger Things except there are kids from the 80s. But even that aspect is nothing like Stranger Things. 

It totally does a disservice and sets a wrong expectation for people unaware of the source material."
The Paper,it needs more funding.
The Paper,"Amazon Prime, at least in the UK and the USA."
The Paper,I had to scroll too far to find this question/answer.
The Paper,"First episode should have had some significant retooling after they finished shooting the other episodes. You can really tell the production team was pulled from the minor leagues. Show is far from perfect but they got a lot better in later episodes, might have done better if they took a relook after getting things dialed in."
The Paper,"i mean to be fair most pilots with a smaller budget look rough, i tend to give a show a bit longer before keeping up with it or tossing it into the bin."
The Paper,Same. Couldn't get through the first episode. The 'gun' battle was so bad and the special effects were really low budget.
The Paper,Hopefully someday Saga gets a more successful adaptation
The Paper,"I found the age completely believable, and pretty sure the actresses were only 13-14 when filming."
The Paper,Yea I ordered it at the end of the first episode. Looking forward to reading.
The Paper,"oddly enough she would be my favorite of the four, i guess different strokes"
The Paper,Her character is eyerolling bad. She's practically satire but put in the show as a genuine role
The Paper,UNO-reverse
The Paper,Not standalone.
The Paper,i wouldn't say cliff hanger so much as a new chapter to continue the story.
The Paper,Amazon markets anything?
The Paper,I thought the marketing for RoP was pretty nonexistant as well.
The Paper,"Considering it's based on a 30 issue comic, does it need more than 1 season to tell the whole story? I remember it feeling like a pretty breezy comic that could easily be covered in 10 or fewer episodes."
The Paper,"I literally only knew they were making it a show, because they brought out to comic con."
The Paper,"Ya, I wish they could have just gotten a bit of money to polish it after they completed the series, since they really did improve a lot after ep 1. I guess there were some show running changes early from the wiki, so they just didn't have things together completely at the beginning, and it shows. Even stuff like the sound mixing feels a bit off and cheap in ep 1."
The Paper,A lot of cursing and some light discussion of sexuality. No nudity or sex scenes. Violence at PG 13 level.
The Paper,"As long as you are comfortable and she is comfortable being with you watching these things. There is a little bit of drama/violence, some swearing like kids that age do with their friends and a discussions about sexuality (which was very well done and unique btw) should be a good watch."
The Paper,If it’s on amazon then I will never ever watch it.
The Paper,"> You can really tell the production team was pulled from the minor leagues.

Seems like they had no budget to work with."
The Paper,"To me there’s a difference between 12 and 14.

I was thinking they were 14 to 16 but someone in the show said 12 plus that tampon scene.

I guess they were meant to be very precocious though."
The Paper,"I bought the ages, but the girls cursed too much, imo. Like sailors"
The Paper,I'm at episode 7 now and some things don't make sense but i like it. It's entertaining. I only wish they had more budget for better cgi but i'm glad i tuned in.
The Paper,"Well not for me, there was (and still are) posters at like every bus stop in my city since like a month. I don't really see ads in general (don't watch TV, don't listen to radio and use ad blockers) so not sure if there were more but I assume so."
The Paper,"From what I can tell, S1 covered about ten issues, so three seasons potentially?"
The Paper,"I actually don't know, I haven't watched it yet, it's on my list. If it's actually a complete story, it would move higher up on it actually (prefer to watch finished shows really)"
The Paper,"Yeah, I'd say it uses its time wisely. When the first season concludes you feel like you've experienced a good chunk of narrative. Doesn't feel like they were treading water or anything."
The Paper,"If you don’t want to support Amazon, sail the seven seas, no point missing out on good shows just because you don’t like the company."
The Paper,"Pretty obviously not the best budget. They make due better in later episodes. It's pretty amazing what you can do with not a ton of money, probably made with like 1 minute of budget from 'Grey Man' and it's at least better story wise."
The Paper,"Idk, I remember swearing a looooot at that age."
The Paper,"Teenagers do in fact swear, if anything they've toned it down from the comics, Mac is a lot more homophobic in it."
The Paper,"It's not, ends on a cliffhanger."
The Paper,"What on earth do you mean by that? I am not versed in riddles.  

I can’t believe I was downvoted.  Amazon is an awful company!"
The Paper,I cursed way more at 12 (especially with my friends) than when older. This is exactly the age where you want to play mature and do so in a very immature way.

Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Lucky Star was my favourite growing up, and it's still up in my top 5 easily.

Really cute slice of life story that I would highly recommend.

I can't even begin to imagine what would drive someone to do something so horrible."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Takemoto also directed Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, which to me, something like fifteen years after I first watched it, is still one of the funniest series I’ve ever seen in my life. The comedic timing is so perfect and exquisite. I’m incredibly sad for his family and friends."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is probably one of my top five anime movies. Well made and has [one of my favorite movie moments](https://youtu.be/bLea0MTifwo) 

I’m sad to see this happen."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,RIP
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,What a tragic loss. The guy created absolute home runs.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid was one of the most charming animes I have ever seen, in fact I had just bought the series on blu-ray a few days before the fire. Such a shame, it had just gotten renewed for a new season too. If they decide to go along with the second season without him, then I hope what they come up with would have made him proud. May he rest in peace."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"If you guys love the anime style storytelling, go and check out Hyouka. In my opinion, the art-style is beautiful, but direction in particular something truly great and creative."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I enjoyed Lucky Star greatly. Disappearance was also a fantastic follow up to Haruhi franchise, and I'd love for someone to pick up the torch and keep running.

His work will always be remembered. Rest in peace and I hope his family willl find justice in the coming weeks."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,;-;
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"It's so terrible man, just such a senseless crime. A studio that did nothing but create beautiful things. They did nothing but add to the world and the human race and one shit stain that doesn't even deserved to be called human takes away so much life. All of those people will live on through their work but it's just so damn sad that it had to end like this."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,The Full Metal Panic seasons he worked on are some of the best mecha shows you can watch. Horrible loss.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Aww man. This hurts a lot.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,[deleted]
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Kobayashi is by far my favorite slice of life anime. I fell in love with the music, the comedy, and the heartfelt moments. Rest in peace Yasuhiro Takemoto. Your work has left a wonderful impact in my life."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,An amazing talent. Gone far too soon. Rest easy and thank you for all you've created.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,R.I.P. Thank you for everything you did.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,RIP
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,F. Really liked Dragon Maid.

Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,[deleted]
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Can someone confirm that his death was caused by the arson attack at Kyoto Animation or unrelated?
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,It’s the Seinfeld of anime.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Lucky Star is the best anime you can't tell anyone about.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I'd also recommend nichijou if you enjoyed lucky star. Also done by kyoani.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"It was the show that started me on anime... 

God... It hurts my heart to know that the director of not just this, but *so many* shows that I loved so dearly was killed in this."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Best comedy ever. Nothing even comes close.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I concur. I was blown away at the time. Beautiful movie. The only one that topped it was Your Name.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Can you not at least take the time to write out ""rest in peace"" at such times? 

The internet doesn't charge by the letter

EDIT: Wow so many downvotes for suggesting someone take 3 extra seconds to write something out properly  when someone has passed away. It really shows so much respect for the deceased when all you can bother to write is an acronym instead of the phase. 

No no no ""RIP"" will do, that's all that needs to be said, I'm too FAR TOO busy to write out it out correctly. /s"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,(We don't even know if KyoAni is doing Dragon Maid S2)

Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,may i sugggest  **Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid** . i might watch again this weekend and have some whiskey in his honor...
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,You might like hyouka
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I cant believe you said irregardless.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"FYI, you don't need to add the prefix ""ir"" to regardless."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Director change can already happen. KyoAni nurtured a lot of talents in their studio that can take up the directors mantle.

That said, it's insensitive of you to put the focus there right now. They're just identified all the victims and are only now getting to assessing the damage in the material. Let's first worry about the people who are injured in the hospital and fighting to pull through, before we worry about anime sequels."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Bruh

People fucking DIED. Show some respect."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,It's a show about nothing?
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"No, that would be Azumanga Daioh"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Why can’t you tell anyone about it
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Most of the best anime are anime you can't tell anyone about. Even the good shit is often embarrassing. Like Evangelion is a masterpiece and one of the greatest works in the history of television, up there with things like Band of Brothers and Kieslowski's Dekalog, but I don't tell anyone other than fellow nerds to watch it because it's also embarrassing as fuck."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,No anime has made me laugh as much than the last episode of Fumoffu.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Do it yourself instead of bitching
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,They actually confirmed a season 2 some time ago. No idea what the fate of any of their plans are now though.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,KyoAni have said they will continue their work. Though it will almost certainly be delayed by months or years.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Gross
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Well damn, I'm sold."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I've been wrong all my life.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Stop pretending you care.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"You know what, it kind of is."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"This is absolutely the perfect way to describe the show. There is no plot, stuff happens sometimes, the characters are loveable, and you suddenly realize you’ve binge watched the whole thing and Motteke Sailor Fuku is forever burnt into you brain. 



Thoroughly recommend it."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"1) Watch the opening.

2) Show said opening to any adult.

3) Try to convince them you're not a pedophile."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"A season 2 was confirmed, it was never confirmed KyoAni was doing it.

Shows change studios all the time when new seasons come out, for example, One Punch Man."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I meant specifically the studio. We know a season 2 is in production. But there was no confirmation it was KyoAni doing the project.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I would say anything ""confirmed"" is probably stalled now unless they convince another studio to pick up the slack"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"As stated lower in the comments, we have no idea which studio is making S2 of Dragon Maid. It could not be KyoAni"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I dont like hyouka as is (I think it could have been so much better than it was given the themes and characters it offered) but that scene where he first meets Chitanda is just fucking magic. Easily one of my top favorite scenes in all of entertainment. 

The only episode i genuinley enjoyed was this one about various club activities while the MC looked over a ""booth"" by himself."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Yeah the reason why it's one of the few grammar mistakes I actually correct people on is most people who do it have no idea that it's wrong, unlike when people who know their grammar is bad but don't care enough to do anything about it."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I watched the series somewhat recently and didn't think the opening was weird or anything. *shrug*
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"They confirmed having a Dragon Maid panel at their event a while ago.  
http://kyoanido-event.com/enjoy/stage/"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"It would be very unusual for it not to be Kyoani. The only time I can think of that Kyoani has started a series and then another company has continued it would be Haruhi, and that was for a spinoff some 8 years after the original series (The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki)."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Personally I appreciate it, regardless of how disliked my opinion may be. Cheers stranger!"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,[deleted]
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"So are there any actual implications or are people just jumping to call out anything innocent again?

I thought the whole show was relatively innocent, except for the part with the dad, lol. It was just a cute, funny, and often wholesome series to me.

Edit: Just saw some comments and I still don't understand it, honestly. Not that I'd go around showing people that opening, but not that I'd do that for any other anime opening regardless."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"No it's just people joking around lol. If people can't see that then I don't know what to say lol, maybe people wanna take these things less seriously?"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Because its about ""high school girls"" the general consensus is that as an adult (especially man) This is not something you should be watching. 

Which fails completely when you realise who the target audience is and the tags lucky star fall under. You can watch a live concert of the opening theme and it will by 90% men."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I can sort of see where that's coming from at a surface level. Anyone who watches it will instantly know how clever the show is and has so many little meaningless interactions that anyone does in life(how people eat certain food, etc)."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Needs more Jojo
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Madoka magica ! 
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid,Awh no your lie about in April

Parasyte: The Maxim,Ok I will!  I was debating on whether to watch it.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"i LOVE the live action versions duology of PARASYTE!!

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3345472/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2

and Part 2...

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3345474/?ref_=tt_sims_tt

i've watched some of the anime version and have enjoyed it thus far as well!"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Also fucking watch ajinn.
Parasyte: The Maxim,I finished episode 7 where he cuts his hair but it hasn't wowed me at all yet. Does it pick up?
Parasyte: The Maxim,"It was pretty decent, although trended a little too much to being some kind of fantasy for someone to project onto for my tastes, especially given the pretty generic main character."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"For something similar, Tokyo Ghoul is really good with more fantasy elements than sci-fi.  Instead of alien parasites, the man-eating Ghouls are born that way and live among and prey on humans.  The MC, in a fashion similar to Shinichi, becomes an unorthodox mix and treads a precarious line between two worlds."
Parasyte: The Maxim,All anime is great....
Parasyte: The Maxim,"It did in my opinion, but also i was hooked from episode 3-4 so if you still don’t like it i guess it isn’t for you sadly"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"The show was good from episode one and even made me laugh on multiple occasions, if you’re that far in then and don’t like then it might not be for you"
Parasyte: The Maxim,The feel of the show changes vastly at certain points.  It's not like he's always in between school and killing parasites in the shadows and continuing his normal life.  It gets really real in the second half.
Parasyte: The Maxim,That’s just not true
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Yeah I finished it. It was great but I wish it was spread out more. Just as you start to love a character then boom, they're dead haha. That was my only problem with it, and I understand why it was done that way. But I would've liked it spread out"
Parasyte: The Maxim,They obviously haven't watched red pupa
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Or Seven Deadly Sins season 3

Or the Netflix adaptation of 7 Seeds

Or a lot of other examples"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Berserk 2017 

A fucking disgrace"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Blue exorcist. The manga did a much better job of it than the anime
Parasyte: The Maxim,Just about any Berserk adaption save a decent few
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Try knights, black clover, fair tale"
Parasyte: The Maxim,*Clang*
Parasyte: The Maxim,Kyoto Saga was really good though.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I would say that the 1997 anime and the 3rd movie are fairly decent-great, but everything else is pretty bad."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"This sounds interesting, I really liked the original *Parasyte*!"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Holy shit yes please. Interesting this is a Korean production and not Japanese, but both Hellbound and Busan were excellent"
Parasyte: The Maxim,The anime is really good but people always get upset at the ending.
Parasyte: The Maxim,How is The Grey different from The Maxim?
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Hello,

This is an earnest request to use the same theme song as the anime: Let Me Hear by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

Thank you"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Can anyone recommend shows similar to hellbound?
Parasyte: The Maxim,Stoked
Parasyte: The Maxim,"This is gonna be bad. The amount of CG necessary means it’ll sit pretty firmly in the uncanny valley. Like, why not just make another series of the anime?"
Parasyte: The Maxim,[deleted]
Parasyte: The Maxim,As long as it’s animated it’ll probably be good.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"A lot of people here love to shit on Netflix but they really crush it with the foreign content, way better than the other streamers Imo and they consistently are investing more in foreign stuff which is cool. Anyway I’ll definitely be looking forward to this"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I really liked the anime, so it sounds good!

I wasn’t fan of the original ending, so I hope it’s different here."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I love the anime. I am glad that it won't be a live action remake but it is more like the show will be in the same universe of anime but this time they will focus on South Korea. Koreans are good at horror, thriller as director proved himself in those genres too so this sounds really exciting."
Parasyte: The Maxim,I think there was a Japanese film adaptation as well
Parasyte: The Maxim,Wait you liked the TV show Hellbound? Or was it based on something that was actually good
Parasyte: The Maxim,Why? I read it and the watched the sub and dub. It was good too me and the reviews always seemed more positive than negative.
Parasyte: The Maxim,Not as many colors
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Late response, but try asking on r/kdramarecommends. They can be pretty helpful. I'd help, but I haven't seen Hellbound yet, so I don't quite know what you'd like."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"No, parasyte is a manga with aliens taking over people's heads"
Parasyte: The Maxim,You're referring to the original Korean film that won Oscars years ago. lol
Parasyte: The Maxim,article says it's live-action
Parasyte: The Maxim,It took me far too long to verify that this is a live action version of **Parasyte: The Maxim**
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Bizarre that I had a thought to myself watching Gamescomm trailers that the Parasyte premise lends itself to “in universe” stories, so I’d love to see a game. Then I see this."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"What not remake?

Are u hear ur self, dont say you forget about money heist which they call not remake and in same universe"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Some people find the ending inconclusive.
Parasyte: The Maxim,Maybe Koreans will do better with live action adaptations because so far only Kenshin has been watchable and dare say enjoyable
Parasyte: The Maxim,"A lot of kdrama and Korean films these days are based off popular manhwas (Korean manga). So yeah, they generally do fine with live adaptations."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"i dont understand why amazon bought the LOTR rights. 

it doesnt seem they even like the universe tolkien created, and they definitely dont like the fans. why didnt they just make an original fantasy universe. it would probably be very highly rated. most of the bad ratings (39% on RT) are from people expecting tolkien-like story telling and characteriziations, and they aren't getting it in their view.

i read a ton of the bad reviews on RT, and all of them said the same thing: boring, bad writing, bad unlikeable characters (morfyyd clark), very un-tolkien like spirit and world building.

not a single bad review mentioned race or black dwarves. one mentioned wokism trumping good story telling and world building which to me is pretty mild and does not rise to the level of racism.

all the 5 star reviews said the same thing too: ignore the racist trolls leaving bad reviews. i kept searching and never saw a racist troll review.

the only character that the bad reviews hated on was morfyyd clark/galadriel. morfyyd because shes a terrible actress, and her character because shes unlikeable and nothing like her amazing characterization in the LOTR books.

my other question is if amazon wanted racial diversity in LOTR, why not story tell about the Sunlands? its full of black and middle eastern type races and theres almost nothing known about them. why amazon ignores them is beyond me."
Parasyte: The Maxim,now book a therapist for sessions and start watching Neon Genesis Evangelion.
Parasyte: The Maxim,Now go watch Monster.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"If you’re into philosophy/politics or want to watch the best space opera, then watch Legend of the galactic heroes (not the remake, the new one sucks)"
Parasyte: The Maxim,AOT was also my first anime ☺️
Parasyte: The Maxim,"If you're enjoying Vinland Saga, you should check out the author's other work, Planetes. It's about a crew of astronauts picking up space debris in a future where spaceflight is still fairly new and not exactly high science fiction, but also advanced enough where orbital debris has become a serious concern. Like Vinland Saga, it's very character focused and follows a ragtag group hanging on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as well. It's faster paced, and action oriented, but like Vinland Saga, the best part of it lies in the characters and their journey. Personally I like at how adeptly the author manages to keep the main characters and side characters moving in separate circles throughout the story and unwinding different parts of a greater mystery on their own.

If you like AoT, I might suggest Gundam as well, though that can be a very long road to go down since it's such a long-running franchise. I would suggest Gundam: Thunderbolt to experiment with, since despite being part of a larger canon, it's short and self-contained story about two soldiers on the opposite sides of a nearly-finished war, fighting over the remnants of a destroyed space colony."
Parasyte: The Maxim,how anime/manga depicts feelings in the most earnest ways is one of the reasons why I've been loving them for 30 years. When I read Video Girl Ai at 17 it nearly destroyed me
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I'll never understand how something mid like AoT gets such a passionate fanbase.  
If you want something truly amazing try FMA: brotherhood."
Parasyte: The Maxim,I've felt that way too. Then I think of shows like Fairy Tail exist and I remember all other anime has been drained of artistic value by association.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I want to watch ""MONSTER"" for a long time. but +60 series is a lot for me 😮"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Wow, I love Planetes and not a big anime guy. So I'll probably try and watch Vinland now.

I will also recommend Wings of Honnemaise (sp?) for a movie if you enjoy Planetes."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Love Vinland Saga and decided to give Planetes a try and very much enjoyed the first episode. Being a sci-fi nerd and a lover of good animation i think i'm gona enjoy this one.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Great show."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"+1000 for Fullmetal. It's an annual re-watch for me. AoT is a bimonthly re-watch for me. Yep, I just like it that much, lol.

I tried to get into the Gundam franchise but instead of starting out with the mainline series, I watched Iron Blooded Orphans first and it was fucking awesome. I couldn't really get into the other series though but IBO was fantastic."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Great suggestions, thank you! I hadn’t heard of Planetes and that description sounds like something I’d enjoy a lot, thanks for that one especially, if it has a similar standard of writing to Vinland I’ll be very pleased."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"AoT does have its flaws, especially when it comes to character writing; I think Eren’s development is terrific and while I thought he was a bit boring at first, his character goes places I never even thought of. I would have liked to see more from Mikasa and Armin though, especially Mikasa. The rest of the Scout Regiment can be kind of one note, but Jean had good development though and Reiner became one of my favorite characters in the show once you learn about his conflicting loyalties. I kind of forgive it though because the constant twists and set pieces are absolutely incredible; the basement reveal, the Shiganshina fight, about half of the episodes of season 4, etc. were all fantastic. I like how morally grey it all becomes and I think just because it was the first anime I sat down and really watched it hit different for me. 

I’ll definitely be checking out FMA: Brotherhood at some point, I know it’s really highly regarded."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I liked AOT more than Fma ( first 2004 ) 

AOT is the best"
Parasyte: The Maxim,The first opening lives rent free in my mind
Parasyte: The Maxim,Because they talk like you with phrasing such as 'If you really want something amazing..'
Parasyte: The Maxim,Possibly the worst ending ever. By the end of it I was so grossed out by the nationalistic and facist themes and subtext of the story. The author is pro genocide with his reverence for mass murdering generals and sweeping all the atrocities of japan under the rug. If thats how he feels then keep it out of your art or it can't be separated.
Parasyte: The Maxim,Watch both series and compare them lol. It's like comparing fine dining to McDonalds.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"This is a problem with you not understanding the manga lol, not the manga itself."
Parasyte: The Maxim,No its about Isayama´s incompetence. You can go [read up](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/18/18683609/attack-on-titan-fascist-nationalist-isayama-hajime-manga-anime) on all the facist themes and subtext.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Lmao y’all are delusional. There are fascist themes in aot, but that doesn’t mean isayama is endorsing those themes. He’s showing how fascism arises and what situations lead to fascism. AoT fanbase is easily the worst anime fanbase lol"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"He even apologised for the ending. Theres no need to defend it, not even the author himself is.

And Griffith is not a racist but that doesn´t erase the fact that he made Birth of a Nation which is a racist movie. He even followed it up with Tolerance but the damage was already done. Whether deliberate or plain incompetence thats whats being portrayed.

Isayama is super nationalistic, and denies korean genocide. Even names one of the good guys after generals responsible for these atrocities and crimes against humanities. Says thats his hero. Imagine naming the mentor in your story after Goebbels and honor that character."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"He did not apologize for the ending lol. And again, portraying fascism does not mean you support fascism. What a dumb comment lol"
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Yes he [did](https://www.dexerto.com/anime/attack-on-titan-creator-apologizes-for-controversial-ending-im-really-sorry-2001344/). If you don´t have any arguments to defend it, then why even comment?"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Him saying sorry has nothing to do with fascism lol. He’s saying sorry bc he knows some fans will be upset.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Its not about whether you portray facism or not, its *how* you portray it.

He´s sorry because he´s not sure he did it right. Its literally in the link but you couldn´t even bother to read it. This pointless, have a good one."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"There’s literally nothing in the link that says he portrayed fascism the wrong way lol. Please quote me where he said that.

And he portrays it just fine, only the illiterate think he’s supporting fascism lol"
Parasyte: The Maxim,[deleted]
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I'm hoping he's not a singular lead. LoTR always struck me as interesting because of  it's variety of ""lead"" characters. I hope they stick with that style of story telling."
Parasyte: The Maxim,He was so good in Years and Years. Super excited to see how this goes!
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Surreal, he was my classmate. Now he is a lead in a billion dollar show. While I practically have no interests. Talk about being a success"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Can they just give us the actual title for the series already so we can stop calling it LOTR?
Parasyte: The Maxim,Of course Maxim Baldry has a beautiful head of hair.
Parasyte: The Maxim,I refuse to believe this show will ever get off the ground.  Seems like Amazon might be realizing you can't just throw tons of money at everything and succeed
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Hope they stick to unknown actors, I like when these fantasy shows do that"
Parasyte: The Maxim,Any relation to long John baldry?
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Awesome, this man is meant to be a star."
Parasyte: The Maxim,[removed]
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Wow, I thought they were a lot further along in production than that, but I guess they are still deciding who the main characters are. I really hope this isn't a train wreck."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"glad to hear that they are filming in new zealand, not sure I read that before.  can't imagine them filming anywhere else."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Loved him in Years and Years, but I'm honestly getting more of a Frodo-vibe than an Aragorn-vibe from him."
Parasyte: The Maxim,I could see him as the human form Soron.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"I'd rather them make something darker, but this is still exciting!"
Parasyte: The Maxim,he looks like the dwarf from the hobbit that had a thing with Evangeline lily
Parasyte: The Maxim,[deleted]
Parasyte: The Maxim,"This is the Gimli origin story, right?"
Parasyte: The Maxim,theyre making lord of the rings into a show? omg.
Parasyte: The Maxim,"Seeing the current crop of actors/actresses, it certainly feels like this is going to be more 'Star Wars 7-9' than 'Star Was 1-3'

Interpret that how you want."
Parasyte: The Maxim,"My best guess, is midway 2021 earliest.

They have not even started filming have they?"
Parasyte: The Maxim,It's been a snail's pace for sure but can you really blame them after investing like $1 billion up front?  They're making damn sure it'll be a great show and I really hope they pull it off.
Unforgotten,Love love loved this show. Season 2 is one of my favorite seasons of any show.
Unforgotten,"Hmmm.. going to have to move it up in the list.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking\_the\_Dead\_(TV\_series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_the_Dead_(TV_series))

Waking the Dead is a British television police procedural crime drama series, produced by the BBC, that centres on a fictional London-based Cold Case unit composed of CID police officers, a psychological profiler and a forensic scientist. A pilot episode aired in September 2000, and a total of nine series followed. Each story is split into two hour-long episodes, shown on consecutive nights on BBC One. A third series episode won an International Emmy Award in 2004. The programme was also shown on BBC America in the United States, though these screenings are edited to allow for advertising breaks, as well as UKTV in Australia and New Zealand and ABC1 in Australia. A total of 46 stories aired across the nine series. The show aired its final episode on 11 April 2011. A spin-off from the series, titled The Body Farm, revolving around forensic scientist Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald), was announced by the BBC in January 2011 and ran for just one series."
Unforgotten,i didn't know season 5 had started airing. hell yeah
Unforgotten,"I adore this show, have rewatched it a couple of times."
Unforgotten,Love Unforgotten. Excited for Season 5. Disappointed that it doesn't seem to be available to watch in the U.S. yet.
Unforgotten,"I agree, Unforgotten is a great show. What I like most about it is that it takes it's time to tell the story. For the first few episodes you see the individual suspects leading normal lives that are far different from each other. You really do wonder how they are all connected, and how they tie in with the cold case murder. It's quite an engaging premise."
Unforgotten,"Just me, but while *Unforgotten* is good, it's not at all on the level of *Happy Valley.*  The show you send *Happy Valley* fans to is *Unforgiven* (and maybe *Scott & Bailey*), since they're all written by Sally Wainwright.

I'm also not 100% sure that *Unforgotten* is necessarily going to appeal that much to the *Line of Duty* crowd, who probably want more Jed Mercurio (*Bodies, The Bodyguard, Critical).* 

To me, *Unforgotten* is kinda more for the *Silent Witness* crowd. And I'm still reserving judgement on Season 5, given that Nicola Walker's Cassie Stuart is no longer the central character."
Unforgotten,"The first four series of Unforgotten are incredible, up there with my favourite ever. Especially 2 and 4.

However, for me, Series 5 was a massive disappointment. I thought it had been written by someone different. It felt incompetently made."
Unforgotten,Agreed! Cassie is one of my favourite characters.
Unforgotten,Nice - I'll check it out.
Unforgotten,Airing on Mondays and all available to binge on the ITV Hub - no idea why they did this!
Unforgotten,"the new ITV X policy I guess, I just binged it all in one afternoon."
Unforgotten,New season was pretty good.
Unforgotten,Love this show! Can't wait to see the new season in the US.
Unforgotten,this is pretty exciting news. devastated with the last season/why she's coming in but good to have her. she was great in little boy blue.
Unforgotten,">Fans of popular ITV drama Unforgotten were left in tears at the end of series four last year, after main character DCI Cassie Stuart, played by actress Nicola Walker, tragically died following a fatal car crash.

What the fuck was that even about?  She spent the entire last season being a dick to everyone for no good reason then died in a hacky random accident.  Did Walker piss off the writers or what?"
Unforgotten,I still miss London Irish
Unforgotten,"I just presumed that the show was over. My other half will be happy though, she loved that show."
Unforgotten,"What?  The force wanted to demote her, initially. Not to mention have you ever dealt with someone you loved having dementia?  Plus Walker wanted to move on. It's not as though she is in need of work being that she usually is juggling 10 series at any time."
Unforgotten,They had renewed it before the last one ended. That's why there was even more shock to the ending.
Unforgotten,"Did you find her storyline for that season to be thematically or narratively well written or satisfying in any way?  I'm sure she wanted to move on, my question is did that decision turn things sour, because the whole thing was absolute garbage."
Unforgotten,"In the US, actually, we'll get the new series on [PBS *Masterpiece* in the fall](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/masterpiece-marks-50th-year-2021-schedule-news/) first, and then it will head to Amazon Prime/PBS Passport. At least, that's been their pattern for the previous series.

A few other British crime dramas with Nicola Walker in them that you can find on US Amazon Prime (and which I actually liked better than *Unforgotten,* but ymmv) are [*River*](https://www.amazon.com/Episode-1/dp/B084T1CQMX) and [*Scott & Bailey*](https://www.amazon.com/Episode-1/dp/B07CGFZMC5) (Walker has a recurring guest role in S3, the final season that Sally Wainwright ran). 

My current favorite UK crime drama is Wainwright's *Happy Valley,* but that left Netflix.  Her dramedy, *Last Tango in Halifax* (which also stars Nicola Walker, btw :) is up on Netflix, but a crime drama it ain't."
Unforgotten,Love this series. Just waiting for PBS to air the next one according to them 2021.
Unforgotten,"I like this show....it's like if the best episode of Bones lasted a whole season, not just 1 episode."
Unforgotten,Oooo thanks for posting I binged the early seasons ages ago actually thought it had been cancelled very cool to find these’s a new season coming
Unforgotten,"I love this show, rewatched it last year in preparation for the new series."
Unforgotten,"Love this show. I think Nicola Walker could read out a shopping list and make it interesting. Can't wait for the new series, glad I live in the UK!"
Unforgotten,"just finished season 1, was a bit disappointed, they never explained the hole in the deceased hand."
Unforgotten,"> My current favorite UK crime drama is Wainwright's Happy Valley

Unforgotten and Broadchurch are mediocre but *this* is a hell of a show."
Unforgotten,"> other British crime dramas with Nicola Walker in them

If you can find it, [Touching Evil (1997)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118497/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1) is very good"
Unforgotten,Some of us in the US watched s04e03 last night.  Where there is a will there is a way.  ;-)
Unforgotten,"Their [press release](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/masterpiece-marks-50th-year-2021-schedule-news/) said Fall 2021:

>**FALL 2021**  
>  
>The 50th season closes out with the return of some of MASTERPIECE’s most popular mysteries. Anticipated titles include ***Baptiste***, Season 2, ***Grantchester***, Season 6, ***Van der Valk***, Season 2, and ***Unforgotten***, Season 4."
Unforgotten,"Haven't seen Unforgotten, but I wish I could upvote you a bazillion times for saying that Happy Valley is a hell of a show \*and\* saying that Broadchurch is mediocre, even in season 1. Broadchurch is propped up by outstanding performances, production values, and location work, but, after the first couple of episodes, the story just treads water and Chris Chibnall's wildly overrated scripts reveal his total lack of talent.

Its success was actually hugely unfortunate because the BBC took that as a reason to put Chibnall in charge of Doctor Who, which he has completely tanked with probably the two worst-written seasons in the show's 38-season history (1963-1989 and 2005-present)."
Unforgotten,I'm so happy [Sally Wainwright is writing Series 3](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/tv/happy-valley-return-third-series-19092137).
Unforgotten,Try River if you can. Limited show of 6 episodes. Brilliant.
Unforgotten,"Ah, Robson Green. Also up [on Amazon Prime in the US](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B079RZXG99). :)

I just wish I could find Danny Boyle's *Babylon.*"
Unforgotten,Well you should watch Unforgotten then because it is far from mediocre and in fact far better than Happy Valley.
Unforgotten,"I watched ep1 this evening  
Found it a bit of a struggle..."
Unforgotten,"> I just wish I could find Danny Boyle's Babylon.

You could consider piracy..."
Unforgotten,"> Ah, Robson Green. Also up on Amazon Prime in the US. :)

You lot got Wire in the Blood?  
Robson, no Nicola, but the similarly decorative Hermione Norris"
Unforgotten,Too lazy. :D
Unforgotten,"I love this show! Excellent casting, complicated mysteries. Highly recommended."
Unforgotten,[deleted]
Unforgotten,Bout time!
Unforgotten,Bent coppers
Unforgotten,Is there any source where i can get subtitles for this show not available in Amazon us
Unforgotten,That’s literally the point of captions
Unforgotten,If you mean because of the accents as a British guy I managed to understand The Wire so anything’s possible.
Unforgotten,"The gimmicks I think are a consequence of network broadcast models that favor episodic procedurals. Each one has to have some sort of hook to make it feel different from the million other cop shows that are airing.

When you look at cable, you have things like Mare of Easttown, True Detective, The Wire, etc."
Unforgotten,"I just finished Unforgotten, great slow burn, procedural, character driven show. Each season is a cold murder case from decades in the past. The always terrific Nicola Walker is the lead."
Unforgotten,Don’t miss Broadchurch!
Unforgotten,"Happy Valley is one of my favorites and a new season is coming. 

Inspector Morse is dated but still holds up and is excellent.  Edit to add: the prequel to Morse, 'Endeavor' featuring the young Morse that also is a favorite. 
 
I've never missed a season of Vera.  

I could go on and on.  sorry.


What I appreciate about British crimes shows: 

People look like real people, definitely not runway ready 24/7.

I like the foot chases rather than the car chases.  

The acting is usually miles better.

The story lines are interesting, some are complex puzzles and some include wonderful quirky characters, some are extremely serious dramas while others are more light-hearted but not insulting in the process.   They don't all turn into a personal soap opera featuring the leads."
Unforgotten,"Two of my favorite British crime dramas are Father Brown and Foyle's War. LOVE the big ""reveals"" at the end of Foyle's War. They give you everything you need to solve the crime (but I never do!)"
Unforgotten,"More of a cop show, but Life on Mars is one of my absolute favorites (the UK original, not the U.S. version).   Just watched it again a couple of months ago.  It's only 16 eps with an ending that I'm not sure they could do today (at least that is what ran through my mind as I watched it).  

State of Play is another great limited series.    


And if you want to go ""old school"" you cannot go wrong with Prime Suspect with the great Helen Mirren."
Unforgotten,I love British shows. Line of Duty is one of my top favourites.
Unforgotten,"Watch Bosch, it’s AMAZING! None of the gimmicks, just great acting."
Unforgotten,"What's always got me about British vs American TV is in the sound design. Crime thrillers, reality TV, dramas, etc., Produced by British companies tend to have less sound overall. Quieter scenes with more poignant uses of background noise. 

Shows like Hells Kitchen, it's clear from the start where the show takes place, from added music to sounds mixed in to hype up the tension. British filmakers, in my opinion, let the visual aids add to the emotions of the scene instead of always using audio cues."
Unforgotten,"Re watched over lockdown Johnathan Creek and forgot how much I enjoyed it 

Korean crime shows are good too. Lots of drama and throws in how corruption in other units or incompetence as major hurdle to solving mystery. Risk too that one of main characters in ensemble might get killed off at any moment. Stranger was good. Even with gimmicks it’s quality like in Signal having the walkie talkie that connects to past."
Unforgotten,"Check out the bodyguard from the bbc, absolutely brilliant"
Unforgotten,The Missing is one of my favorites
Unforgotten,Whitechapel ! It's paranormal based crimes but still very good !
Unforgotten,"I have two particular favorites:

'Edge of Darkness' - 1985 (starring the late Bob Peck who some will recognise from Jurassic Park as Muldoon) - it's directed by Martin Campbell (who also directed an inferior movie version starring Mel Gibson in 2010). The 1985 miniseries is superbly written and Bob Peck is brilliant as the main protagonist. 

'Cracker' starring Robbie Coltrane - brilliantly written, particularly the earlier stories, and doesn't pull any punches."
Unforgotten,"A certain case of ""the grass is always greener"" on the other side. Some of our stuff can be pretty generic.

Also r/SilentWitness, which is the longest-running currently active crime show in the English-speaking world, can give some of the American shows a run for their money in credibility stretching - and I say this as the guy who moderates the sub."
Unforgotten,"Cracker with the late, great Robbie Coltrane. Still holds up after a recent rewatch."
Unforgotten,Line Of Duty is so damn good. I got the BritBox so I could stream all the awesome crime dramas they have on there.
Unforgotten,Strike (Also known as CB Strike) is a very good and underrated series.
Unforgotten,Line of duty is fucking amazing
Unforgotten,Luther was amazing
Unforgotten,I loved Broadchurch and really enjoyed Criminal too.
Unforgotten,Pleaseeeee watch Line of Duty
Unforgotten,I agree.  I think it's because they take time to develop the characters.  Line of Duty is a favourite and Shetland.
Unforgotten,"""Marcella"" undermines the entire argument."
Unforgotten,"I love my Acorn and Brittbox subscription. I love it that the Brittish actors look like normal people. No 5,000 watt smiles or goofy faces from trying to be forever 21 plastic surgeries."
Unforgotten,"I was binging on British crime drama during the pandemic. Some good ones are Luther, Broadchurch, Bodyguard, the stranger. Recently I watched Murder in Provence, Magpie Murders, We hunt together, Shetland, Sister Boniface mysteries, Signora Volpe. I’m currently watching Father Brown."
Unforgotten,"I agree. And also, I like how normal looking the characters are in British murder shows. You still get some attractive women, but they aren't models, showing up to 3 am crime scenes with hair and makeup perfect. Also, with their hair down! Besides the crime scene contamination, working women with long hair want it pulled back, so it's not in their face."
Unforgotten,woah woah woah. Psych is a masterpiece and I'll fight anyone who disagrees.
Unforgotten,"Cracker and Prime Suspect still hold up well. Worth a pop. 

Youve also got things like Silent Witness to look forward to."
Unforgotten,It's mostly because the British have the balls to tell a story in 6-8 episodes and end it there and not get greedy.
Unforgotten,Take a look at George Gently.
Unforgotten,Touch of Cloth is the way
Unforgotten,There was a show from canada that used to air in the US called Davinci's Inquest. I loved that show growing up.
Unforgotten,Line of Duty!!!
Unforgotten,Check out some Scandinavian ones too!
Unforgotten,It’s just so difficult watching British shows though. They all feel like they are documentaries
Unforgotten,I think Nordic Noir shows are better than the British crime shows but both are far better than the American shows since a crime show that entirely solves a crime in one hour is a stupid concept.  Of course the Nordic crime dramas are clearly derived from their British predecessors.
Unforgotten,Wait until you get into Scandinavian crime shows. They’re next level
Unforgotten,"Mystery is kinda our thing, my boy"
Unforgotten,"The first season of Slow Horses was pretty great, from the previews the second one should be too. Worth a watch."
Unforgotten,Allow me to recommend a personal favorite: River
Unforgotten,"Well their are plenty of British gimmick shows, they just fall more into your sort of cosy murder mysteries (your Miss Marple's etc.)

But yeah I'd agree overall I think most British Crime shows are more compelling.

I've seen a lot of great recommendations on this thread, but the one I curiously never seem to see is Waking the Dead. Which I always feel is a bit of a shame, as its seriously one of the greatest shows I've ever seen in my life.

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
Unforgotten,"I also appreciate the fact that in the UK a ""limited series"" is almost always a one-and-done, whereas in the US, if a miniseries is successful, the network makes a second season with a forced concept that is rarely as successful as the first."
Unforgotten,Love/Hate is an Irish crime drama that was really good (at least for a few a seasons) you should check that out
Unforgotten,Try Cracker.
Unforgotten,Shetland!!!!
Unforgotten,Ever watched Shetland? It’s amazing.
Unforgotten,"You're referring to big network shows versus BBC shows, not necessarily America versus England."
Unforgotten,"So true. After watching ""Prime Suspect"", my first British show, I was hooked."
Unforgotten,"Sounds like a person that just returned from foreign study. :)

Also assuming you're talking about network TV. 

Once you get past the accents and visual style both UK and US have their own identifiable tropes and are formulaic
 Consumed enough of each to be realizing I was sucked in because UK had a foreign enough feel."
Unforgotten,">. In American crime shows there is always a gimmick, like a mathematician helps solving crimes, a psychic helps the police and so on,

That's not true. For example, SVU or NCIS or Blue Bloods aren't consulting detective fiction. 

Also the oldest examples of this I can think of are all British. Before Numbers there was Monk, before Monk there was Cracker and before Cracker there was Sherlock Holmes."
Unforgotten,"If you haven't seen it I highly recommend ""Luther"". It's a  BBC crime drama and it's absolutely top notch. Idris Elba plays Luther and he absolutely knocks it out of the park."
The Job Lot,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Job Lot,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Job Lot,[removed]
The Job Lot,[removed]
The Job Lot," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Job Lot,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Job Lot,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Job Lot,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Job Lot,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Job Lot,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Job Lot,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Job Lot,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Job Lot,Rat King is coming
The Job Lot,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Job Lot,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Job Lot,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Job Lot,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Job Lot,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Job Lot,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Job Lot,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Job Lot,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Job Lot,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Job Lot,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Job Lot,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Job Lot,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Job Lot,[removed]
The Job Lot,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Job Lot,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Job Lot,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Job Lot,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Job Lot,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Job Lot,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Job Lot,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Job Lot,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Job Lot,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Job Lot,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Job Lot,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Job Lot,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Job Lot,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Job Lot,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Job Lot,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Job Lot,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Job Lot,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Job Lot,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Job Lot,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Job Lot,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Job Lot,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Job Lot,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Job Lot,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Job Lot,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Job Lot,[deleted]
The Job Lot,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Job Lot,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Job Lot,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Job Lot,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Job Lot,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Job Lot,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Job Lot,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Job Lot,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Job Lot,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Job Lot,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Job Lot,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Job Lot,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Job Lot,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Job Lot,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Job Lot,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Job Lot,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Job Lot,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Job Lot,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Job Lot,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Job Lot,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Job Lot,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Job Lot,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Job Lot,We gonna get the rat king.
The Job Lot,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Job Lot,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Job Lot,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Job Lot,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Job Lot,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Job Lot,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Job Lot,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Job Lot,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Job Lot,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Job Lot,[removed]
The Job Lot,[removed]
The Job Lot,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Job Lot,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Job Lot,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Job Lot,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Job Lot,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Job Lot,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Job Lot,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Job Lot,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Job Lot,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Job Lot,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Job Lot, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Job Lot,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Job Lot,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Job Lot,And more golfing
The Job Lot,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Hey Duggee,Hey Duggee >>>>>> any other kids cartoon right now. I just about lost it at the acid rave stick insect.

Walliams and Friend,"I think one of the things that give Seinfeld an edge is that the characters are never presented as good people. They're all shitty and that's part of it. So things that might have been considered benign at the time, but don't  age well are easier to shrug off. Friends continually tries to tell you they're good people and good friends when they're all actually terrible so they just become worse over time."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld just seemed to have so many things that relate to life in general. Odd given the nature of the show, but I'm always using ""like on Seinfeld"". Double dip, man hands, not that there's anything wrong with it, regifter, opposite George, etc. 

Cripes, just yesterday I saw a dumpster diver eating a donut from the trash and thought of George."
Walliams and Friend,"“We’re not gay! …Not that there’s anything wrong with that.” 

So many lines were ahead of their time and hold up well."
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld by far. To me the cynicism holds up better than the corny sentimentality where everybody hugs and learns a lesson.
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld, it’s indisputable"
Walliams and Friend,Now start watching Curb your Enthusiasm
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld and it's not close. Seinfeld has always been a better show imo.
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld has aged better because a lot of the stories are based on every day real life situations. How many times has something happened in your life that made you think of a Seinfeld episode vs how many times has something made you think of Friends?
Walliams and Friend,[removed]
Walliams and Friend,"One is the greatest network comedy ever.

the other is Friends.

IMO the writing on Seinfeld was so far ahead of the game people are still catching up."
Walliams and Friend,"I still love both these shows, and I think they both hold up. 

Friends hit its stride at the end of season 3, when Ross and Rachel really broke up. It seems the writers shifted all the characters into quirky, weird characteristics besides Ross being the lovelorn mopey guy, Monica being the straight woman, Chandler being just a comic relief, etc. This ended up giving the show refreshing storylines to feed off of as opposed to the cookie cutter sitcom it started as.

Seinfeld is similar in that it hit its real stride a few seasons in. All of the characters were gloriously unlikeable yet lovable, but I think Elaine was the real gem in the bunch. I always thought it was pretty brave for JLD to play such a brash character, for a woman comedian it was really refreshing to see her be just as bad as the guys as opposed to being the straight woman trying to keep them in check. Sweet Dee on Sunny is directly influenced by her portrayal. 

Each of these shows have catch phrases that are a part of pop culture, each show is still funny despite knowing what that joke is that you heard for the 20th time. Both are classics, but different types of shows that went against the grain and ended up becoming classics."
Walliams and Friend,"Ngl. Its interesting seeing some of the replies here as a person from the UK. Seinfeld barely got much of a chance to get going here (dont blame the people, blame the channels over here messing up schedules MAJOR at the time), whereas Friends was and is still HUGE here. Like there's legit a small chain of central perk replica coffee shops here within one of the biggest fashion stores here and you can find friends merch anywhere. 

Like due to that Seinfeld has always felt like this weird hipster show for friends haters to me. ""Oh, you like friends? That's so basic and mainstream. Seinfeld is way better."" and I know elsewhere in the world ESPECIALLY in the US it isn't true. But yeah... its just the way it feels and looks from this side if the planet. 😅"
Walliams and Friend,The funny one.
Walliams and Friend,"Lot of Friends hate one here. But honestly, They’re both really great shows that have aged pretty brilliantly. 

One took the sitcom formula and pretty much perfected it. The other took the sitcom formula and found hilarious ways to subvert it. Both shows were exceptionally cast.

I feel like Reddit seems to look at Friends as being hokey and sentimental, but it’s no worse than Parks and Reck and The Office US in that regard and the writing in those early seasons especially was really fresh and clever."
Walliams and Friend,"People on here have such a huge hate boner for Friends lol

There's a reason it's as popular as it is"
Walliams and Friend,"Asking reddit to choose between Friends and Seinfeld is a forgone conclusion, the reddit demo will always favor Seinfeld. But if you were to ask randoms on the street, Friends will win out 8 times out of 10.

I like them both but Friends is my comfort show and the one I have rewatched more often."
Walliams and Friend,"Have 30 somethings at my work place that watch Friends over and over.  One says she has seen every episode at least 15 times.  Seinfeld was smarter and has more memorable lines, but younger generations have not discovered it like they have discovered Friends.  Both funny as hell."
Walliams and Friend,"It’s highly subjective. 

Growing up with friends felt a lot more digestible and easier to follow. The narcissism of Seinfeld didn’t become clear to me until i was older and able to understand the situation the characters were placed in.

Friends storylines felt a lot more simplified. Universal storytelling vs situational experiences.

Both hold space where needed. 

Overall, for me - Friends aged well as a comfort watch and Seinfeld aged best with personal experiences."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld ages better because it fused one of the greatest comedy writers ever (Larry David) with three of the greatest performers of their time (Alexander, Richards, Dreyfuss)
No, I didn’t leave out any names here."
Walliams and Friend,"I don’t even see how the two can compare - friends is a good sitcom, but very low hanging fruit comedy that comes together with likable characters and typical “will they, won’t they” tropes, where as Seinfeld is legit great writing, had timeless jokes, unique characters, and paved the way for shows with terrible characters that have little to no development while still maintaining audience interest.  Just one man’s opinion."
Walliams and Friend,"My vote is for Seinfeld. But Im going to selfishly take this opportunity to stick up for Friends and fight back against the the online hate that show brings in. 

I am old enough to have appreciated the later seasons live as they aired and to be aware of what a massive phenomenon it was in its day. It was everyone’s favorite show (if I may generalize). I watched all the reruns at 6 and 6:30 every day. By the time the show finished I probably saw the whole series 2 or 3 times over. then I got older and went through the phase of thinking it was uncool, unfunny, and out dated. Then I got even older and it was released on HBO Max and I decided to get nostalgic and start from episode 1. The show is a monumental achievement in entertainment. They created SIX ICONIC characters over 10 seasons with a joke-a-minute prime time sitcom. The actors delivered every time. The roles they played were not easy. If you can’t laugh at Friends then that’s on purpose and you’re just trying to be a contrarian hipster who just won’t like any multicam sitcom. But if you can appreciate the format at all, let go of ego, Friends is funny. 

Seinfeld is better tho 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Walliams and Friend,"I realize I am really going to cut against the grain here, but I have to answer this question truthfully:

Friends, and it is not even close.

I’m not saying it’s better than Seinfeld because it totally is NOT. But OP said “aged better.” 

I live in NYC and I work in tourism. The number of people I’ve met who are desperate to see the Friends apartment, Friends locations real and fake (no, Central Perk is not a real coffee shop), extends into the hundreds.

I’ve not met a single person who asks me about Seinfeld.

All those Friends fanatics? They are all 20 or younger.

Friends is MASSIVELY popular among Gen Z kids, who find it alternately relatable (because stories are simple and the characters are very archetypal) and exotic (no smartphones or social media, and the characters on Friends not-so-coincidentally seem to have much richer relationships with each other).

Friends has resonated in a major, major way a generation later. Seinfeld has not. Seinfeld is much more specific in its humor and more rooted in 90s history (don’t know who George Steinbrenner and Johnnie Cochran were? Too bad for you!), and I don’t think its very white/Jewish-centric vision of New York, where other ethnicities are typically encountered in service industries or as exotic Others, has aged well for 2020s sensibilities. Does Friends have the white-centric problem, too? Hell yes, even more so, but its edges so sanded and its humor so seemingly benign that I can see why people give it more of a pass.

TL, DR: Friends has a huge Gen Z fanbase, Seinfeld does not. Ergo, Friends has “aged better”, though I agree Seinfeld was a much, much better show."
Walliams and Friend,"I like both shows, but objectively speaking, I think Seinfeld is far superior.

It just has way more creativity and unique premises and I think writing is superior. Friends is a good sitcom, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything that sets it apart from most other sitcoms as its own thing besides the fountain dancing intro titles and music. I too watched Friends first and thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, but then started seeing Seinfeld and newer shows like Community and Parks and Rex and saw how superior they are.

Seinfeld didn’t need a famous guest star every week, but I think Friends purposely went that route in the latter half largely because I think they knew the writing and characters weren’t strong enough to succeed on its own and triedmto overcompensate with big name guest stars like Willis, Pitt, DeVito, Penn and, Kathleen Turner and Goldblum, among others.

Friends was and is a very ordinary - but entertaining- sitcom with a flashy exterior and good jokes, but didn’t have the substance the way Seinfeld or Parks and Rec or Community or Frasier and many others do. It was always a fun show but I don’t think much more than that."
Walliams and Friend,Friends is 100x more popular and gets more views. So depends what you want to take into account. This is kinda like avatar where reddit thinks avatar/friends suck but the majority of the world loves avatar/friends.
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld is more farcical and Friends has a bit more heart. Maybe I’m getting softer as I get older but I gravitate more towards Friends.
Walliams and Friend,"*Seinfeld* influenced modern comedy more than *Friends* - Larry David shaped a generation of White guys' sense of humor.
  
*Friends* benefits from having some post-9/11 seasons and just *feels* more modern. Rachel also influenced a whole generation of White girls' wardrobe."
Walliams and Friend,"Controversial certainly reading the rest of this thread, but I regularly still rewatch Friends, while very little of the humor in Seinfeld does anything for me. (I also love always sunny, which people often compare Seinfeld to).

I think Friends holds up not because of the humor, but in spite of it, it's a very feel good show, it always works out for them and a lot of the struggles are relatable to a 20-30 year old trying to be a grown-up for the first time. When I'm in a bad mood and am ""stuck in second gear"", then it kind of cheers me up, but Seinfeld doesn't do that, and I'd rather watch Always Sunny for the fun hijinks with the absurd stories and bonkers characters, when I'm in the mood for that."
Walliams and Friend,"Seems a lot people here aren’t answering the question. They’re just answering what do they prefer. As for me, I think Friends has aged better. Seinfeld is a 90s show in its references. Which makes sense obviously as it was almost solely set in the 90s. As someone else said, I think Friends benefits in relation to this question from having some of it set past 9/11, when the world was a different place."
Walliams and Friend,"Never liked Seinfeld, might be an American thing I never understood. 

Friends was funny at times and woudn't be suprised if some channels sti air episodes. Just like married with children stil airs -.-"
Walliams and Friend,"This is such a weird argument. One show is a literal milestone of television comedy, the other is a show lots of people seem to enjoy. 

Apples and oranges."
Walliams and Friend,Reddit leans Seinfeld. But they’re both great
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld is funnier to me now as I’m at the age of the characters. Friends was never funny to me regardless of age.
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld and it's not particularly close. Seinfeld vs Frasier is a better question.
Walliams and Friend,"Whichever people choose, I’d say they’re both white."
Walliams and Friend,"Everything in this thread saying Friends isn’t funny to seem smarter than they are 🙄. Seinfeld is the better show, but the Friends writers room wasn’t slacking and the cast was also great."
Walliams and Friend,"One invented No Nut November, the other still gets people to clap along to a theme song"
Walliams and Friend,"Also Kevin Bright who made Friends is a huge asshole. He was an alumni of my school and came around all the time. He always introduced himself as “the guy who made Friends,”… he complained that he didn’t work on sets anymore because everyone was too Pc and wouldn’t let him give them unsolicited massages… and when he would come as a guest for our annual awards show, there had to be a special student assigned to him to make sure he didn’t act creepy to any women."
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. Friends is just white Living Single
Walliams and Friend,"For the average person probably friends, for redditors, its always seinfeld"
Walliams and Friend,"Contrary to everyone here, Friends. Seinfeld has far too many pop culture references that someone not from that era wouldnt understand. I was born in the 90s and I don't even get some of the people/references they say. There's no damn way a person born now would get a lot of the jokes. Don't get me wrong, Seinfeld is far better written but it's humor also has a long set up, whereas Friends is that cheap easy humor. You'd actually need to watch a whole episode of Seinfeld and pay attention to it in order to get the payoff, whereas Friends you could leave on the background and still enjoy it."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld is the obvious answer. Friends is a relic of that old hokey manufactured sitcom vibe. While definitely a more modern take, it has more in common with Cheers than with modern TV.

Seinfeld was so innovative in its style that people literally referred to it as a show about nothing. When you really think about that, it is bizarre. At that time, people needed each episode wrapped in a convenient storyline that taught a lesson to actually perceive storytelling. Seinfeld blew up that notion and allowed characters to exist as morally ambiguous without being ""punished"" (and then when they did get ""punished"" in the finale, the audience felt betrayed). Storylines were less cliched and more based on the small minutia of everyday life and poking holes in the absurdity of modern society -- basically the default tone of most social media platforms these days. It isn't that crazy to draw a line from Seinfeld's take on character to the beginning of prestige TV like The Sopranos and The Wire, when TV audiences finally accepted that it is far more interesting to not be force fed whether a character is a hero or a villain."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld, always. The show is/was brilliant and could never be replicated."
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. Although I would say Curb is the one that will age like a fine wine.
Walliams and Friend,"Friends is what Seinfeld would have been if the network had been calling all the development shots: get a couple more girls, make everyone younger and pretty, include a Sam and Diane couple. Given that, Friends was executed very well."
Walliams and Friend,"Well I've never liked Friends in the first place. 

But Seinfeld is immortal. It's a much more human show."
Walliams and Friend,Mulva > Unagi
Walliams and Friend,I always found Seinfeld to be more relatable.
Walliams and Friend,"One good way is to compare similar episodes. The classic Seinfeld episode about masturbation famously used “master of my domain” as a euphemism to get around network censors. The episode humorously explored the central role that it plays in our lives and differences between men and women, cleverly couched in a friendly contest. A masterpiece of sitcom writing.

The Friends episode “The one about whacking off” is much cruder. The scene where Ross and Chandler are racing to see who finishes on Joey first lacks the nuances of the Seinfeld contest. And the lack of a comparable scene with the girls smacks of early 90s sexism.

Overall it’s very clear which was the greater comedy."
Walliams and Friend,"Friends has some very dated jokes. Seinfeld has some dated situations (the speed dial episode for example), but the humor is timeless."
Walliams and Friend,"In my mind there doesn’t need to be a debate as to which is better. I like both shows.

There’s a lot of dislike for Friends here. I don’t know. I think it’s very funny."
Walliams and Friend,"A lot of Seinfeld was dealing with issues that wouldn't happen anymore, like waiting at a land line for a call or misunderstandings that we instantly solve with a smartphone. Friends was a bunch of people trying to fuck. I think Seinfeld is a way better show but it hasn't aged as well"
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld, without question.

Even though it's a 90s show about 30 somethings, it's still so applicable today and to a broad audience.

I've watched it over and over again throughout the years since I was 12 years old. I'm now approaching 30 and I know all the lines by now, and I'm still laughing and hollering at every episode. It's not like it even had just a few good episodes or seasons, there's so many classics! Heck the festivus episode was in the final season! 

It's just the all-time best comedy show and will always be my all-time favorite TV show. 

FRIENDS is probably only better to a certain demographic."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld.

The premise of Friends was created by an 8 year old girl. Me and my friends are all going to live in the same place and we can play everyday. Our boyfriends will live in the same building and we can all date when we want too. And everything is going to be really really fun."
Walliams and Friend,Friends is for the undateable.
Walliams and Friend,It’s Seinfeld by a mile. Haven’t watched Friends in quite a while but it doesn’t strike me as the type of show that would’ve aged well. Seinfeld is still funny as shit. And relevant.
Walliams and Friend,"As a HUGE Seinfeld fan, I was pretty pissed when people started comparing these two shows a little while back. In my mind it was even close.

My wife started watching friends again, and I have to admit, it was way better then I remembered. Definitely, not as good as Seinfeld, but it was closer then I thought.

Seinfeld 10/10

Friends 9/10"
Walliams and Friend,There are rarely days that go by that are not relatable to Seinfeld. It is infinitely more quotable. Seinfeld has a timeless quality that is not matched by Friends. Seinfeld and The Office is a better comparison.
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. Better jokes.
Walliams and Friend,I watched Friends and loved it for years and then found Seinfeld in 2020 and there simply isn't any comparison for me - Seinfeld is far superior and I love it dearly and watch it every day. I'm bonkos about Seinfeld 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld was more realistic in their living situation, such as not being able to afford these huge apartments on minimal salary etc. 

Oh and Seinfeld had actual comedy ..."
Walliams and Friend,"ITT, Seinfeld good, Friends bad."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld, by far.  It's always relatable and always hilarious.  Friends was good too but the characters are just so.........likeable.  The UN-likability of Seinfeld's characters makes it timeless."
Walliams and Friend,Friends is really unfunny. It tries too hard and falls flat; the humour is so forced. It also feels dated. Seinfeld is timeless. Far superior on every front.
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld and the Episode in the Hampton’s — have not seen anything better in comedy after that — Seinfeld is the GOAT 😊

Please, you have to see the baaaabbbyyyy 😅"
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld embraced being terrible people and that was part of the appeal (IASIP does this well, too). Friends characters didn’t seem horrible at the time but in retrospect they’re unbearable."
Walliams and Friend,"how is this even a question? seinfeld by faaaarrr

friends is a show set in new york fucking city and it features ONLY white people. wtf is that?"
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld is the Goat!!
Walliams and Friend,I think both are for different crowds. You probably won't ever get an unbiased answer. Not that there's anyone wrong with that!
Walliams and Friend,"Friends was never funny, All the actors are now washed up and trying to stay relevant. Didnt the show try to reboot and flop? I dont think I've ever met anyone who actually liked the show and wasnt above the age of 40. And that was a long time ago.

everyone I know who has seen sienfeld still loves it, and my family and I watch it together sometimes. Even though it can be mundane and dated at times, it still holds up really well"
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld by far. I used to be a staunch friends stan when I was a teenager but damn it's near unwatchable now.
Walliams and Friend,"Friends =  characters have redeeming values.

Seinfeld = no one has any redeeming values. 

Seinfeld all day."
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. Friends has always been trash.
Walliams and Friend,"Since Seinfeld was WAY better while it aired, it’s also better now. That’s my crazy take."
Walliams and Friend,"You’re asking this on the internet, my friend. The overwhelming consensus is going to be Seinfeld. By a wide margin."
Walliams and Friend,"friends comes off super fake now. they also seem much older then they are. 
its bizarre to me that ""a show about nothing"" was an unheard of concept and i suppose at the time ahead of its time. even though i thought seinfeld was lame (i didnt get it) as a kid its aged better. 
although it was hilarious that teens thought friends was a new netflix show. then target ruined everything by merchandising it to DEATH"
Walliams and Friend,"Friends turned into a bunch of Adults acting like dumb teens living in conditions they can't effort with their incomes in a New York that doesn't exist as they present it while handling unrelatable shit in unrealistic ways. I never liked friends and personally find it one of the most overrated shows in the history of television. Seinfeld however is very relatable and realistic which besides the set feeling outdated (yet good for the time they made it) making it sort of a timeless show, the jokes and situations still work."
Walliams and Friend,"I like them both. Friends is too nostalgic for me. But Seinfeld probably ages the best as it is a show about nothing. :D

Also, my fav sitcom from the ""old days"" is probably Fraiser. Seen it first time few years back and it is amazing."
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld is still relevant. Everyone has had a bad parking experience or been ""Happy New Year""'ed in Feb."
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. By miles
Walliams and Friend,Sinefield.  Curb is still a great show with a similar concept.
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld is timeless and still holds up. Friends is almost unwatchable now.
Walliams and Friend,Friends was shit when it came out
Walliams and Friend,"Friends, but it’s not necessarily because it’s a better show. So many shows have taken what Seinfeld did and built on it or downright stolen from it.

As a person who has watched both, I laugh more at Friends. When I watch Seinfeld, I understand that it is funny, but I’m able to predict where it’s going because modern sitcoms have been shaped by it to the point that my thought process is able to jump to the punchline before it happens on screen. 

This is so common that there’s a whole page on TV Tropes about it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld, 100%"
Walliams and Friend,Seinfeld. The jokes are actually still funny. Friends..... not so much.
Walliams and Friend,I don't find Seinfeld even remotely funny.  Maybe it's because I'm British?
Walliams and Friend,I never cared for Seinfeld.
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld’s characters are not sympathetic. We like them in spite of who they are. Friends’s characters are by comparison very sympathetic. We like them in spite of what they *do*.

I think the easiest comparison is how each show handles the rampant homophobia of the 90s. Friends leans fully into it, with all the characters unabashedly making gay jokes. When Seinfeld did the same topic, they added ‘not that there’s anything wrong with it.’ The characters are aware they’re in the wrong on Seinfeld and on Friends they are not aware they are."
Walliams and Friend,Friends is living single for white people. Seinfeld is very good but dated and doesnt resonate with gen z like friends does. The real GOAT 90s sitcom will always be Frasier.
Walliams and Friend,"Friends. When was the last time you saw Seinfeld bath salts for sale?

Friends is the ultimate American style sitcom, while Seinfeld is a B+ approximation of a British style sitcom (which is why it never had an impact there). Friends is a huge global property and I guarantee at least one episode is screening on TV somewhere as you read this. Seinfeld not so much. What’s up with that? Could it *be* any clearer?"
Walliams and Friend,"Jerry this is frank, mr steinberger is here, George is dead, call me back.

This line alone is better than friends"
Walliams and Friend,Friends has a better looking cast and is a brighter show. Those things always age better as comfort watches.
Walliams and Friend,Sienfield is much better.
Walliams and Friend,From reading the comments it looks like I’ll be binge watching Seinfeld . 😊
Walliams and Friend,Workaholics… I said what I said.
Walliams and Friend,"Seinfeld is 10000x better than Friends. Even when Friends was on tv it wasn’t very funny. Seinfeld works because it deals with very real everyday themes but through the experiences of intentionally unlikeable characters. It’s about the discomfort of social interaction, the perpetual adolescence encouraged by urban life, the mundaneness of most work, the sheer amount of luck involved in finding jobs, family relationships… Friends characters tried to be likeable but were totally unbelievable because of it. They’re all beautiful and fashionable, whereas the cast of Seinfeld is fairly average looking (well Elaine is gorgeous but she dresses in a very particular way and has naturally curly hair and her real nose etc). Friends characters had mostly low paying jobs but rarely talked about money, whereas Seinfeld had entire episodes about finding good deals on rent. George had to move in with his parents when he was unemployed. It just feels more relatable. The fat Monica jokes on friends are really tasteless and cruel. Jokes about George Constanza being portly and bald feel very human—his value is not fully attributed to his attractiveness, he still dates and gets laid, and when women reject him it typically has more to do with his personality and poor behavior than his appearance. Friends was accused of being too white for NYC but I don’t think ever responded to that. Seinfeld, with the same accusation, made a hilarious episode about George trying to find a Black friend to prove he wasn’t racist. The writing in Seinfeld is just…excellent. I could go on and on about it, but I think it’s no contest at all. Friends was a blah sitcom that aged poorly. Seinfeld was an excellent sitcom with great writing, and while some jokes don’t make sense with current technology (eg stealing answering machine tapes), it doesn’t really matter."
Walliams and Friend,"I feel like FRIENDS has aged a tiny bit better. Let me explain.


FRIENDS is a show about a group of friends going through life, from early 20s to real adulthood with complicated relationships, kids, etc. A ton of the writing still holds up IMO. The negative of the show is that its VERY typical sitcom. A bit formulaic, especially in later seasons. But we do get to see the characters grow, develop, without compromising TOO much on what made them funny. Joey and Feebie are probably the only 2 characters that suffered a ton of Flanderisation.

SEINFELD on the other hand has MUCH sharper writing and the humor is a lot more nuanced. Where SEINFELD drops the ball is that its very much a product of its time. Half of the show would not work if the characters had smartphones. Simple as that. I mean, come on dudes, there is a whole episode revolving around swapping the cassette of an answering machine. 

This is all objective in my opinion tho. I personally enjoyed Seinfeld humor a lot more. Some of the jokes take a whole episode to be set up, with a payoff as the last line of the episode. That's not easy to pull off. And this is from a guy who grew up on Friends when it was airing. I only caught SEINFELD on Netflix. Also, George Costanza is a spirit animal and one of the most glorious characters to ever grace a TV screen"
Walliams and Friend,Always sunny in Philadelphia

A Touch of Green,Nine Voyages (Sea Snake) and Ten Thousand Ships are the two shows that are no longer in development. That still leaves two live action series in development stage: Snow and Dunk & Egg
A Touch of Green,"Martin:

>I did take a few days off for the holidays, I confess. Shame on me, I guess. But now I am back in the salt mine, working… working on so many bloody things, my head may soon explode. Yes, WINDS OF WINTER, yes, yes. And HOUSE OF THE DRAGON, season two.     
>  
>And several of the other successor shows that we’re developing with HBO. (Some of those are moving faster than others, as is always the case with development. None have been greenlit yet, though we are hoping… maybe soon. A couple have been shelved, but I would not agree that they are dead. You can take something off the shelf as easily as you can put it on the shelf. All the changes at HBO Max have impacted us, certainly). We are also still developing the Wild Cards tv series for Peacock, based (largely) on FORT FREAK.   And I have Wild Cards books to edit. Oh, and did I forget WINDS OF WINTER?  No, of course I didn’t. But if I ever did, I know you folks will remind me."
A Touch of Green,"Given how well HOTD seems to have done, I'd be surprised if there weren't more green lit"
A Touch of Green,"My big issue with him is that he acts like it’s an annoyance that people care more about the penultimate book of his bestselling work that’s taken almost fifteen years to write, than fucking wild cards and an animated tv show about Yi-Ti."
A Touch of Green,I’m not sure if any of the changes will cause the studio to pass up on their next cash cow(s).
A Touch of Green,"Maybe calm down with the spinoffs and focus on quality. You managed to bring people back after GoT, don't be in such a hurry to fuck it up. Again. And finish your goddammit books!"
A Touch of Green,It’s called consolidation. Almost every network and commissioner has probably been told to half their rate of greenlit shows. This is when you know we’re in for a serious economic recession as the shareholders do not believe new greenlit shows will increase subscriptions
A Touch of Green,[deleted]
A Touch of Green,">  But now I am back in the salt mine, working… working on so many bloody things, my head may soon explode.

maybe he should just work on one thing.  

Now what ONE thing could he focus attention on...let's see...anything come to mind?  YES!  He should catch up on watching popular TV shows!"
A Touch of Green,"I don’t like when George mentions the plethora of random busy work like editing, meetings and ceremonies as part of his schedule along with WINDS.  
  None of those others matter. He has the authority to focus single-mindedly on just winds yet he always rattles on about the irrelevant things showing how busy he is. You’re busy with those because you have decided to add them to your schedule when it should have been just Winds on your schedule until you finished it.  
  I’d have thought it would be a wake up call when your adaptation started and then ENDED while you didn’t put out a single book in a decade, but apparently it is not."
A Touch of Green,How about you get back to writing those books ya bish?
A Touch of Green,That’s great. Now finish your books.
A Touch of Green,[deleted]
A Touch of Green,"> made me want to go visit Sicily… but I won’t, not until WINDS is done and delivered, I promised.

I mean, I'd be hyped to continue ASOIAF proper like anyone else, but I'll also be completely fine if it never comes. The man should be out enjoying his well-earned life, not salt mining. Especially at his age. I wish my father could have seen and done all the things he wanted to."
A Touch of Green,I wonder what George R.R. Martin is doing right now....probably not writing.
A Touch of Green,"How is this man writing fucking spin-offs with HBO when he hasn’t even *finished his book series yet*? 

Every time I walk past my bookshelf with the “first” (AKA only) 5 books from this series on it I just sigh. At this point HBO is tucking him into bed every night with a blanket made of $100 bills and diamonds. He says he has writer’s block or something like that, I say he is rolling in HBO money and he couldn’t give a fuck at this point.

Couple more years and I’m donating the books and forgetting about the series. Gonna pretend the books went the same way as the show and deal with it, fuck it lol. I really wanted to find out what happens to Catelyn Stark in the books considering her story there becomes VERY different from the show but my interest is waning and I have less and less time everyday to spend doing what I want. 

Does he expect to finish the books in 15 years and have all of us re-read the first 5 books? Doesn’t matter how quality the series is, as time passes people are going to lose interest."
A Touch of Green,Martin is both the biggest winner and the biggest loser…
A Touch of Green,FINISH THE FUCKING BOOKS
A Touch of Green,"I just wish they would do a ""Robert's Rebellion"" mini series. That would be incredible"
A Touch of Green,"Good, go finish your fucking book."
A Touch of Green,"Probably no more super expensive pilots, If they greenlight something it's going to be straight to series."
A Touch of Green,Good. Write the damn book
A Touch of Green,"Now is the time to get into reading books and playing board games, folks. TV is going a bad direction. The film industry is terrified that superhero movies and sequels are losing steam. 

A deck of cards and a good novel are looking good right now."
A Touch of Green,man hasn't even finished the first series and he wants more? Shitty author.
A Touch of Green,"Story’s ether die the hero, or last long enough to become lame"
A Touch of Green,"That's cool. HBO can green light some Red Rising content. 

Better overall story, engaged author who will actually finish his saga, and developed characters that will pull in viewers. 

I don't think A song of ice and fire will ever get finished. I don't think another show will hit the peaks of Game of Thrones. I do think better television can and will be made. 

Hail Reaper!"
A Touch of Green,"I'm so curious about the Snow show.  I really don't see how they can do it without essentially making it Game of Thrones season 9.

The political settlement at the end of Season 8 was a tinderbox, almost every kingdom was in the hands of people with disputed legitimacy.  The King was a total psycho who expressed interest in getting hold of a dragon and told Jon he'd been ""exactly where he needed to be"" despite him being where he was precipitating the total disaster that had lead to Bran becoming King.

Are they really going to ignore that and have a series about Jon Snow scrabbling out a living in an icy wasteland where almost everyone's dead, voluntarily in exile because he promised the unsullied/Dothraki he would before they left Westeros?"
A Touch of Green,"Honestly I’m cool with this, the only show that would maybe have been worth making was sea snake or a show about his son’s travels. The Jon Snow idea was stupid as all hell

Edit: what would really have been worth making is dunk and egg, but I’m just unsure if they want to touch an unfinished story again"
A Touch of Green,"You know - GRRM’s attitude about TWoW is bullshit. At this point it’s obvious he has lost interest (and the checks have been cashed, so what does he care), and should just quit. 

He’s procrastinated, made excuses, and otherwise strung along the people who enabled his success - and frankly i have lost all interest in his ending to ASoIaF."
A Touch of Green,Good! FINISH THE BOOKS!
A Touch of Green,On no! His cash cow! Whatever will he do now?
A Touch of Green,Good maybe he'll write a book. His last one came out in 2011
A Touch of Green,Good. Enough already.
A Touch of Green,Maybe he'll have time to finish the books then.  Yeah I know I'm kidding
A Touch of Green,What are the changes at hbo?
A Touch of Green,"HBO said they would have gladly paid out for three more seasons of GoT, which D&D could have left and handed it over to another set of showrunners, but they refused handing it off insisting they would do it and rushed the widely hated ending

GRRM could get help wrapping up his original version of GoT, either through pairing up or directing a team of writers based on his overarching vision, but is also refusing handing it off insisting he will do it and is mired in some combination of procrastination, irritation, and anxiety

there's a common thread here about being sitting in the iron throne without humility that I find amusingly ironic with life imitating art, or maybe it were those aspects of ego that made all the art come to life to begin with"
A Touch of Green,"The merger of HBO Max and Discovery+ has fucked up my emotional health substantially if I’m being honest. My heart is breaking after HBO cuts are slashing through my favorite series. Westworld cancelled, and I’m worrying about The Righteous Gemstones and The Rehearsal. As well as the GoT spin offs. Fuck this shit. I am furious and it’s completely ruined HBO, my favorite streaming service. This is a disaster."
A Touch of Green,HBO Max has already been backed off a cliff. I’m just counting down the days until it’s shut down by Discovery.
A Touch of Green,Fuck this merger.

A Touch of Green,"I know Zaslav is the devil and all that, but the previous approach was bound to induce fatigue and over saturation."
A Touch of Green,Good. The less the better. He couldn't get the original saga right - it starts to go completely off the rails the moment Dany hits mereen and he starts pulling new characters out of his ass.
A Touch of Green,Boo-freaking-hoo. Finish the damn books.
A Touch of Green,Just finish the books jackass

A Touch of Green,"This dude is never finishing those two books unless he's been writing them in parallel for the last what, 16 years?"
A Touch of Green,Probably for the better. We don’t need so many GOT spin offs.
A Touch of Green, How about working on your own fucking books
A Touch of Green,Not like anyone would live long enough to see them aired. Finish your Books!!!
A Touch of Green,Maybe he can write his book
A Touch of Green,Cool.  Now finish your fucking books.
A Touch of Green,Finally some good news.
A Touch of Green,Good. That John Snow show sounded awful.
A Touch of Green,Good....maybe now he can....finish writing the books!!!
A Touch of Green,Amen.
A Touch of Green,Good
A Touch of Green,Fiiiiinnnnniiiiissshhhh the boooooooks ya knob lord!
A Touch of Green,"Ok. Cool. W/e. George you have TWO books to write pal, focus on them."
A Touch of Green,Netflix liked this.
A Touch of Green,maybe its because they want your books finished first you buffoon
A Touch of Green,Did hbo put all their savings in GameStop and amc?
A Touch of Green,Good
A Touch of Green,Thank God. House Of Dragons SUCKS!
A Touch of Green,"I'm starting to lose respect for GRR Martin. Blamed everything on D&D, constantly has an excuse for why his book isn't done, and then complains some more about the spin-offs not working out...what gives?"
A Touch of Green,"""Okay, so in season 2 of House Of The Dragon, we take the dragons, okay, and replace them with Ferraris, Lamborghinis, all these other luxury cars that we can get advertising revenue for. Oh, and Bran time-travels so he can cameo in it."""
A Touch of Green,"Lol wow this business is a sinking ship, we are about to lose quality for fucking hgtv"
A Touch of Green,I cannot stress enough how unappealing a post GoT Jon Snow spinoff sounds.
A Touch of Green,"Well, I just they don't decide to remove from the catalogue when it's finished. Seriously. I cant get over Westworld removal. Sure, it didn't had good numbers/reception in the end, but first season is top tier TV."
A Touch of Green,Good.
A Touch of Green,Wonder what this means for the Jon Snow spinoff thing.
A Touch of Green,Go write your books.
A Touch of Green,"Get the minimum for the MAX, at HBO!!"
A Touch of Green,Oh no! Anyway...
A Touch of Green,Good. Fuck ‘em. Fucking kneelers
A Touch of Green,Probably for the best.
A Touch of Green,FINISH THE BOOK!
A Touch of Green,"Write George, write!"
A Touch of Green,Oh no! Maybe make shows that don't disrespect the audience?
A Touch of Green,HBO being bought by WBD was a massive mistake.
A Touch of Green,"Unironically, Zaslav made all the good moves, most of these spinoffs sound stupid."
A Touch of Green,"Dunk and Egg to me seems like a no brainer to be a great way of introducing more of the world of Westeros to the audience.  If done correctly, there can be one off episodes of fun/satirical things, and other over arching longer lore themed episodes.  Like the Blackfyre Rebellions.  We can also see other Houses and how they ""rule.""  There would be lots of commentary on the ""haves"" vs ""have nots"" etc.   Just fun adventures, with these two ""growing up"" together on the road.  Think ""Kung Fu"" with Caradine, ""walking the earth"", solving problems,  but better. I would love to see mentions of other Houses, like the Daynes, the Blackwoods and they go up to the Starks too."
A Touch of Green,"Always surprised by how entitled people seem to feel to his work. Let him do what he likes at his own pace, he’s a person with a life. HOTD was widely seen as one of the best shows of the last few years and he made the story! 

It’s totally fair to feel frustrated— many of us do and if he could finish things with a snap of his fingers of course he would. Denigrating him on a personal level fosters resentment for no reason and is also a bad look"
A Touch of Green,And Zaslav’s destruction of WB/HBO continues. They’re selling off their biggest IPs and refusing to invest in what little remains. All he wants is to flood the airwaves with MILF ******* Manor.
A Touch of Green,"I think it’s due to how bad they f*ed up GoT s8 and the backlash from fans. HotD is their way to gain back fans where then eventually they’ll greenlight more stuff. 

Also with the Discovery/HBO deal, they are gutting a lot of what I loved on HBO and putting out more reality stuff I don’t want to watch."
A Touch of Green,"Let it die, please, just let it die."
A Touch of Green,There is a god! Thank you HBO too.
A Touch of Green,Good. No more GoT. Original show was ruined near the end and house of the dragon was mediocre at best.
A Touch of Green,"good, let it stay dead"
A Touch of Green,"No one cares about the books George. It’s been more than a decade. This funny skit about you not writing was seven years ago:

https://youtu.be/lle4t4o8EDk"
A Touch of Green,Who knows what is next with Zaslav. Ostensibly his dream is to turn HBO into the CW for adults.
A Touch of Green,I canceled my HBO Max subscription today. It’s clear that the new CEO has every intention of killing what made HBO good.
Days We Stared at the Sun,*happy carnivorous plant clicks*
Days We Stared at the Sun,That's a book I haven't thought about for almost 30 years.  I remember reading this in school at a pretty early age. I'd watch this for the nostalgia of it alone.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"I remember being traumatised by the old BBC series, as a kid. Those walking plants were terrifying."
Days We Stared at the Sun,That was quick. He just got fired from Dune: The Sisterhood yesterday.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"This book gave me an unreasonable hatred of sunflowers. When I first read it, I just pictured the triffids as sunflowers, and now I get a gross feeling when I see one staring at me over a fence."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"The 1980s miniseries adaptation is by far the best, in case anyone is unsure what version to watch. It had a miniscule budget so gets by on the strength of the plot. This version is the most faithful to the novel out of the live-action adaptations. You can find it on Blu-ray (at least in the UK).

The movie was terrible, as was the 2009 series.

The book has had 3 radio adaptations also, from what I can remember: all of them decent. The 1968 radio adaptation is on Audible and is very good. Some solid acting, appropriately creepy, and also pretty faithful to the novel.

I have no hopes for this adaptation purely on the basis that basically all adaptations these days are terrible. The idea that you should translate something faithfully to screen is long gone. Every dickhead wants to put his own personal take on something when making it now."
Days We Stared at the Sun,I really got hot when I saw Jeanette Scott fight a Triffid that spits poison and kills!
Days We Stared at the Sun,"> With its post-apocalyptic setting and plot, Wyndham’s 1951 novel draws parallels to HBO’s breakout hit The Last Of Us. **In The Day Of the Triffids, after most people in the world are blinded by a meteor shower, triffids — tall venomous, carnivorous plants — start killing the rest. The story centers on Bill Masen, a biologist who specializes in triffids. He leads survivors in their fight against the killer plants and at some point rescues a young sighted girls and travels with her for several days.**


> The English book has had three UK radio adaptations and a 1962 feature starring Howard Keel. **There also have been two BBC limited series, most recently the 2009 The Day Of the Triffids** featuring an all-star cast that included Dougray Scott as Bill Masen, Joely Richardson, Brian Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Eddie Izzard and Jason Priestley. The book also influenced the British post-apocalyptic horror movie 28 Days Later.

Might be a good time to watch the original series.


Edit: Additional details from [THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/day-of-the-triffids-chernobyl-johan-renck-1235338727/):

> Sources say that Amazon intends to **adapt the book as a string of miniseries, detailing the invasion from multiple points of view in multiple cities.**"
Days We Stared at the Sun,Now if we can get a Threads reboot…
Days We Stared at the Sun,Please give the heroes the razor disc guns from the book!
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Yes!  Loved that story.  And even though they looked ridiculous, have a fondness for the first film."
Days We Stared at the Sun,I just realized I spent much of my life confusing this series with The Tripods series.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I hope they do The Chrysalids!
Days We Stared at the Sun,And I’ll bet it won’t be a patch on the 1981 BBC adaptation.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Oh good: Salke’s next race/gender swapped triumph.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Oh that I loved that movie as a kid.


Shame it is on Amazon."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Yo, is that Captain Price from COD:MW?"
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Watch it be the UK take on ""The Last of Us"" and the triffids are now zombifying plants that spread through infection"
Days We Stared at the Sun,All time fave!
Days We Stared at the Sun,Guess what I just started watching. Go on. Guess.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I'm old (and old-school). The original film scared the hell out of school-aged me and my brother!
Days We Stared at the Sun,Ooooooooh this book gave me the willies when I was in school.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I never heard of this - book or the previous media adaptations - but I hope it makes it.
Days We Stared at the Sun,FINALLY!
Days We Stared at the Sun,How many times has Triffids been adapted at this point?  There must be a month worth of days of the Triffids.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"I got this show confused with The Tripods, another 1980s sci-fi alien conquering show"
Days We Stared at the Sun,Not another one. The old movie was good. The new will be just a war hailing.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I hope 'Night of the Lepus' is next.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Again? Third time lucky?
Days We Stared at the Sun,"One of my all time favourite books. I've not been fully happy with any of the various adaptations so I hope this one does the source material justice. So many other Wyndhams need to picked up and made into shows - The Chrysalids, Trouble with Lichen, and my personal favourite - Web."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"All three of the films were fun! the one in the 80s followed the book,the one from 63 scared me as I was a child."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Feed me, Seymour!"
Days We Stared at the Sun,BBC filmed it already
Days We Stared at the Sun,I remember seeing an old listicle from some site in the ancient internet days that said this show with walking plants was one of the dumbest things ever filmed. When I looked it up it seemed really scary and unique and apparently it’s held in pretty high regard.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"So he was attached to direct for *The Last of Us* but dropped out due to ""scheduling issues"" so he could film *Spaceman* for Netflix (which wrapped in July '21 and still hasn't been released), was dropped from *Dune: Sisterhood* just this week over ""creative differences"", and now he's already on to a new project... 

Not gonna' hold my breath for this one, but I did love the original movie as a kid and - from what little I remember- thought the novel was pretty good, too."
Days We Stared at the Sun,I got the impression that he left?
Days We Stared at the Sun,"""Fired"" is kind of harsh. No way of knowing if it was that, or he left for something which had a better chance of happening."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Just looked up the book that series is based on and found this on the wiki

>It is the first book in their Great Schools of Dune prequel trilogy, which itself is a sequel to their Legends of Dune trilogy. The book is set eighty years after the events of 2004's Dune: The Battle of Corrin, in which the human military finally defeat the thinking machine armies of Omnius

Can someone explain to me what this jumble of words means and do I need a maths degree to understand the Dune Timeline?"
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Sunflower seeds are popular in trail mix, multi-grain bread and nutrition bars, as well as for snacking straight from the bag. They’re rich in healthy fats, beneficial plant compounds and several vitamins and minerals. These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Came here to say that.

BBC 1981 version, really good, follows the book closely.

2009 version, awful, no resemblance to the book except it has plants.

1960's film version, so bad I suppressed and forgotten it's existence. Dam, now I remember the atrocious ending."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"> I have no hopes for this adaptation purely on the basis that basically all adaptations these days are terrible

Did you miss To All The Boys I Loved, Station Eleven, The Last of Us, Little Women, Zola, Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere, 50% of Game of Thrones, Hidden Figures, Crazy Rich Asians, If Beale Street Could Talk, The Wonder, Fleishman Is In Trouble, Women Talking, The Whale and Dune?"
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Wow, what a stringent way to look at adaptation.  True Faithful adaptation cannot be achieved switching from one media to another. Not really, change is inevitable. The act of telling any story is a retelling, always."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"The movie was excellent, but you might be too young to appreciate it."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes and passing them used lots of skills
Days We Stared at the Sun,">  **adapt the book as a string of miniseries, detailing the invasion from multiple points of view in multiple cities.**

Just follow the book. What makes the book great is the personal interactions, the epic feel of isolation and struggle. Nobody will care about CGI plants."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"That's odd, because the book makes it pretty ambiguous whether the Triffads are an invasion or man made. They were harvested for the good of mankind for years before the blinding.

But yeah, it has been adapted loads before. Doing a World War Z on it might be the way to go. Adapt the concept, because we have seen several adaptations of the story."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Once wasn't enough for you.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Same with The Midwich Cuckoos or Village of the Damned, if you'd rather."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Another great movie.

Fiend without a face is one from my childhood tgats wacky af."
Days We Stared at the Sun,And it was pretty good.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Twice
Days We Stared at the Sun,what this story about?
Days We Stared at the Sun,Both versions were very good. The last one was only about 10 years ago. Very 28 days later sort of vibe.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Could be pretty similar to The Last of Us with mobile plants instead of fungus zombies.  

Might be good to see what ideas he had."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Future reference things don’t happen on the same time line as they are announced.  He was probably attached to this a while ago and is just now announcing as PR because of the fired announcement (though he was let go weeks ago m) to counteract
Days We Stared at the Sun,Sounds like a reference to the *Butlerian Jihad*. I trust that clears up everything. :/
Days We Stared at the Sun,There really is a bot for everything.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Sure, until they grow up to jab you with poison so they can feed off your corpse when you die at the foot of their stalks. Username checks out, though."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Actually I did miss all those! Except for GoT and Dune because I'm uncultured.

The former doesn't get off scot-free just because the first 50% was good! Though that could equally have been faithful and still ended up crap just because the source material could end badly (not that anyone will ever know).

I liked Dune but I can barely remember the book details. General consensus is that it was accurate?

But you're right anyway, not *all* are destined to be bad but sci-fi these days does not have a great track-record imo."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Nope. It’s classic TV “cinema” and should be requires viewing for anyone getting elected to any governmental position anywhere in the world.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"There's also the movie from 1963  


The Day of The Triffids is just one of those things that keeps on getting remade because of its pretty easy-to-understand premise.  


It's essentially a zombie story but the zombies are plants."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Giant Venus fly traps eating people
Days We Stared at the Sun,"People will say it is about evil plants, but the actual high concept pitch is that after a meteor shower, everyone on the planet wakes up blind. The protagonist had eye surgery that night and the love interest was on a huge bender and slept through the meteor shower so they can still see.

Also in the background there are plants that can walk and want to eat everyone. They were around before, but they are a bigger problem now that most people are blind."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Imagine a zombie movie but the Zombies are plants
Days We Stared at the Sun,"I also commented on a post about Pennyworth: The Origins of Batman's Butler 

And honestly this comment made more sense when I thought it was a reply to something on that post"
Days We Stared at the Sun,We don't need a reboot. The original is enough for them
Days We Stared at the Sun,"I was being flippant. If you read the book you'd know [The Butlerian Jihad](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad).

The Butlerian Jihad is referenced in the first book as an historical event explaining the hatred and outlawing of AI. Found an [actual timeline](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_\(Expanded_Dune\))."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"> Rogen reacted strongly to the show’s unusual format in the first hour, presenting the male and female winners in key acting categories at the same time. For example, Giancarlo Esposito won supporting actor in a drama for his work in AMC’s “Better Call Saul” and Jennifer Coolidge got the nod for supporting actress for HBO’s “The White Lotus,” and both performers came up to the stage at the same time to give speeches one after the other


> When he went up to present, Rogen commented on the bizarre flow.


> “That was weird,” he told the industry crowd Sunday night at the Fairmont Century Plaza. “Why do they do that? Are we crunched for time? Get another hour — it can’t be that expensive,” Rogen said in between giggles.


> “You know how I know that? This show airs at 4 p.m. on the CW. That cannot be a pricey timeslot from my understanding of how this all works,” he said, referring to the fact that the live kudocast has to air in the late afternoon West Coast time in order to start at 7 p.m. in East Coast markets.


> “I’m not saying the CW is bad. What I will say is that it is the one network to receive zero Critics Choice nominations,” Rogen said. “You are saying it’s bad! We’re on your least favorite network. How did that happen?”"
Days We Stared at the Sun,"The CW as we know it will be gone by Fall 2023. Their Netflix deals are done, so most of their shows are not nearly as profitable. 

CBS and WB now sell their shows internally. They don’t need this collaborative effort, although it worked for 15 years, and really hit its stride in the 2010s. Scripted broadcast television is dying.

The CW has been mostly sold off to Nexstar, a regional news producer / owner of several affiliate stations.

CBS and WB now own 12.5% of the network each, and it’s rumored they’re only keeping one show from each of them. Those would be All American and Walker. Two of their best performers. Otherwise Riverdale and The Flash are ending regardless. Nexstar reportedly wants cheaper shows that target a larger age range.

Sad, they were kind of iconic. Not unlike The WB and UPN"
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Honnestly one thing you gotta respect with CW is that they let their shows renew and not cancel them abruptly too much.

They're were couple of years where  all the shows were renewed. Today the cancellation spree has gone to next level insanity."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"""You know how I know that? This show airs at 4 p.m. on the CW. That cannot be a pricey timeslot from my understanding of how this all works,"" 

Lmao that’s hilarious"
Days We Stared at the Sun,CW: Supernatural which is the greatest show …
Days We Stared at the Sun,Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is one of my all time favorite TV shows and is very Jewish.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I cannot stand any of the shows on The CW
Days We Stared at the Sun,"CW certainly gets the most attractive people though. They target the younger demographic. But... There was a time when CW or rather the WB had great shows. Buffy the vampire slayer was awesome. A lot of people like Veronica Mars. Gilmore girls, Felicity. I am a dude so I didn't like those shows but they did family dramas pretty well."
Days We Stared at the Sun,I call the CW the Can’t Watch network.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"The only CW show I ever watched was The 100. It was actually good up until the last two seasons where shit got too weird.

Honestly, I try not to judge people for what they watch, but how anybody could watch shit like the Flash, Arrow etc.. baffles me.

They look and feel like Hallmark tv shows."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Lol Cw.

I hope superman and lois gets to end properly. A 4th season for 2024. and then we get the Gunn movie in 2025"
Days We Stared at the Sun,[deleted]
Days We Stared at the Sun,"you know you´re done when you have to punch down, 

That santa inc disaster didnt help him much."
Days We Stared at the Sun,The last hood show CW had ended in 2015 with Supernatural. The arrow verse went too far and iZombie only had four seasons. They used to know what they were doing but all their good writers must have quit. Haven’t seen Winchester’s yet but that’s the only reason I’d watch CW at this point
Days We Stared at the Sun,"If the CW ends up being the reason Babylon 5 gets rebooted, I'll gain a lot of respect for it."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Have you seen the Gotham Knights trailer. It's that bad.
Days We Stared at the Sun,"If it's the least favorite network, he's right where he should be."
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Felicity Smoake and Kate Kane, seth there were two!"
Days We Stared at the Sun,Because Seth Rogen has produced or been in groundbreaking works.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Sorry that would be CBS. Because that’s all you C! BS!
Days We Stared at the Sun,Fucking seth rogen cant talk shit here. Bruh is even unfunier than most cw shows
Days We Stared at the Sun,Is Seth Rogen a pothead deuschbag or what? Even if I don't personally watch CW.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Their number one show is a Walker Texas Ranger rip off that has very little kicking that became a runny egg family show. It’s a weird network.
Days We Stared at the Sun,What the fuck is “the CW”?
Days We Stared at the Sun,"He's punching down, cancel this man."
Days We Stared at the Sun,Not a super difficult target to take down
Days We Stared at the Sun,"I got into the CW solely because of Arrow. Unfortunately, I came in just as the show was starting off the CW-ificiation of their 2010s slate of hero shows. Third season of Arrow, first season of the Flash...I was expecting some real quality television cause of how good they were.

But it definitely felt like a combination of A) streaming options, and B), diminishing show quality, led to me not feeling a sheer need to watch these shows at release. I still have half of Season 7 and all of Season 8 to watch of Arrow, am at Season 4 of Flash, gave up on Supergirl after its 3rd season, and planning to get thru Legends of Tomorrow as if it's on Gotham's level of ""watch it for the 'plot'"". All the other hero shows didn't really nab my attention.

I feel like it is a good spot for the CW-heroverse to just retire. I am all burned out on hero shows AND movies from the 2010s, and am looking for the next hot trend of shows. It just won't be on the CW.

Edit: Thought Superman & Lois was axed after second season. It wasn't, and is due to come back for Season 3 in March 2023. It's likely the only CW hero show left I'll still give a chance to."
Days We Stared at the Sun,😂 he’s not wrong.
Days We Stared at the Sun,I miss UPN…in a way it was a better alternative to BET
Days We Stared at the Sun,"Thank God HBO picked up The Vampire Diaries, I was not looking forward to trying to explain to my wife she can't watch it anymore"
Days We Stared at the Sun,The CW renewed everything because they signed a deal with netflix that pretty much made everything profitable. It's not a coincidence that it was dismantled immediately after that deal expired.
Days We Stared at the Sun,Yea Supernatural and Smallville would have ended much earlier had they been on another network.
Days We Stared at the Sun,CW renewed everything bc they never produced anything. Warner television bankrolled all the shows.

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Why do they deserve to be called out?  There’s nine thousand other sites that provide the same service. You like collider more because there aren’t so many Andor posts so you go to collider, maybe Slashfilm learns a lesson, maybe they don’t notice because they’re very successful with many other people because they’re writing the Andor posts that folks crave."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I mean, it is an amazing show and well crafted. People who write for those sites obviously have an interest in filmmaking so such a well made show would catch their interest and give them something to write about."

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Understandable. But what of the comparison to Collider who happens to publish way more articles daily than Slashfilm? Who devoted literally 1/5 of the content despite the larger website.

If I told you a respected movie blog posted 100 articles about Westworld in 2 days, wouldn’t you think something went a bit awry?

I’m saying Slashfilm needs to clean up their act. This numbers chasing thing has gone too far."

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Yellowjackets?
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Why?
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Ted Lasso anybody?
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Nordic shows are great
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,Man the first season is peak television
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Th Eena Meena Deeka Chase Comedy Show,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"

Trump: An American Dream,Awesome. “This doesn’t have enough representation so I’m gonna *make* something to give it some” is the exact philosophy more people need to start believing in. Too many people try to just *change* existing things instead.
Trump: An American Dream,"I wish I had this show growing up, representation in cartoons a few decades ago ranged from *make the main character have a brown best friend* to *pick random single colours for each character, but the main character is white.* (Fucking Doug...) Not to mention how bad a lot of portrayals of natives usually are, TV is probably the biggest reason some people still call us Indians. (That and centuries of Colonialism cementing the term Indian instead of Indigenous or Native, but regurgitating Indian on TV hasn't helped)

As a Métis I'm happy to see this show is a thing. I'm probably gonna recommend this show to relatives that are still young, or that just like cartoons."

Trump: An American Dream,I was just about to put this on for my baby
Trump: An American Dream,Cool. Victor and Valentino gets its story lines from Mexican and other Latin American folklore.  I actually bother to look them up after the show. Glad to see the indigenous North American representation as well.
Trump: An American Dream,"I would have absolutely loved this as a child! I lived on animals, myths and magic, this is just perfect and really makes me more optimistic on substantial kids shows for my own future children to see, I’m so tired of Peppa Pig, it seems downright lazy. I think these kinds of tales and entertainment are much healthier for kids."
Trump: An American Dream,This is my daughter’s new favorite show!!
Trump: An American Dream,I guess I got my Italian representation as a kid from Super Mario. One of the punch out games also had a character named Pizza Pasta so I guess I can’t complain
Trump: An American Dream,"My kids love this show. 

The theme tune is an absolute bop as well."
Trump: An American Dream,Why is her name not in the article title. I think it’s wrong to just call the producer “Native American woman
Trump: An American Dream,"What about Paw Paws?  That show used to be my jam in the early 90’s as a kid, as I recall it was basically Care Bears meets Voltron meets  Native American Totem Pole transformers and ir was amazong."
Trump: An American Dream,"ive heard about this, apparently one of the characters on the show is voiced by AEW Wrestler Nyla Rose, a transgender woman of African American and Native American descent [her wikipedia page says she is of Oneida descent]


and from what i hear, it sounds like it could easily become very popular among children, here's hoping it becomes a big success"
Trump: An American Dream,Brilliant
Trump: An American Dream,"My kids saw it, screamed MAGIC POWERS and then watched like 6 episodes in a row. Its no bluey but seemed decent"
Trump: An American Dream,My daughter had this on repeat last week. It’s a good show!
Trump: An American Dream,"My kids loved the show, they streamed it all morning!"
Trump: An American Dream,My son was watching this on his phone this morning and I absolutely started crying when I realized what it was. They were talking about the creator and then they transformed into their spirit animals and it was the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen. REPRESENTATION!
Trump: An American Dream,Feel the shift in the air as if the polarity of the north and south poles switched as a segment of people online change direction from “Why can’t you make your own thing and stop co-opting things from my childhood” to “Why are you forcing your woke culture down my kids throat”.
Trump: An American Dream,That Netflix by chance? Same color schemes and overall visual vibe as Super Monsters
Trump: An American Dream,What channel is this on?
Trump: An American Dream,"Wasn't the one kid from captain planet native American, and Elise Maza from Gargoyles? It fantastic she got her own show but can who ever rights these arrivals not conveniently omit the long history of representation that already exists in the media? There was the Paw paw bears or something that was before my time but its was a kids cartoon show so the msgs from it were still relevant, and pretty sure it took loose inspiration from native American lore. Not trying to belittle her achievement, I'm strictly speak to the notion of a lack of representation in children and young adult cartoons"
Trump: An American Dream,How could anyone ever enjoy a TV show without all the characters being a representation of themselves?!
Trump: An American Dream,Good on her! Instead of whining on others for change she actually made the change herself.
Trump: An American Dream,[removed]
Trump: An American Dream,Sends a different message when she’s standing in front of an ad for a show about Native Americans getting hunted by an Alien
Trump: An American Dream,Just watch Prey
Trump: An American Dream,"Great in intent but there are way to many major different cultures in the Americas to be lumped together. 

Representation impossible in the European culture without lumping together and blending the difference between tribes away. A sweet dream of a culture that never existed. 

It probably better for each tribe to create it’s own media to be consumed by the young. And tell the young over and over your a tiny minority in their culture there are way to many tribes to get a noticeable share with out slighting other tribes. We must be proud in ourselves and tell each other our things our self. Don’t buy into the lumping together the Europeans do. 

Pooling still shows Indian the most popular description.

But mostly European left advocates don’t care much about native population opinion attacking Redskin even though it had support of over 70 percent in polls then natives don’t know when to be offended pushed by at first small minority of aborigines wanting recognition pushing the utter lie that the Natives were peaceful and did not commit atrocities before the European came. 

I do object to lie European were civilized as in civil behavior and the lie the natives were not savages the truth everyone was evil by modern standards the Europeans just better at war and higher population. Some native groups more violent than others. And the many centuries of atrocities committed one group to another primary way Europeans win playing one tribe off against the others. 

Why Redskin ok. Probably same reason those of Norse decent are proud of term Viking.
Viking and Redskin mean roughly same thing Savage Warriors who rape pillage and burn. Something you metaphorically want for ones sport team. Also note whites being fine being Pirates who no group more depraved or evil in history. 
The fact that the objection pushed by the lie the natives were peaceful a bad thing. 

Final note be careful with using Latino many get offended being lumped together call them by their nationality.

Seams like cute show."
Trump: An American Dream,I was like super hyped. And than my hype crashed down. Like fuck native american stories and shit could be so cool. But to be very honest congratiolations to her
Trump: An American Dream,Based forced wokeism
Trump: An American Dream,It’s good tv!
Trump: An American Dream,My 5 year old is a big fan. Great show!
Trump: An American Dream,Mini mes really like this show
Trump: An American Dream,My kids love this show. Good stuff
Trump: An American Dream,We came across this on the weekend. My kid loves it better than Molly of Denali.
Trump: An American Dream,"Having a daughter soon, definitely bookmarking this for her to watch"
Trump: An American Dream,"My daughter and I love this show's plotlines. Need a drill to bore the theme song out of my head, tho"
Trump: An American Dream,"My kids are currently binging this show and love it, I was not aware it was anything more than your standard Netflix kids cartoon but I'll happily take a look into its creation now."
Trump: An American Dream,"Protests from evangelical Christians and MAGA world in three, two, one…"
Trump: An American Dream,WB will likely cancel it and destroy all her work for a tax write off
Trump: An American Dream,[Looks like a show my kid would enjoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSQiJwZiP94)
Trump: An American Dream,"Folks can check out Molly from Denali as a nice native kids show as well. On YouTube, etc."
Trump: An American Dream,Cyberspace was math and technology. It similar boats
Trump: An American Dream,I love when kids tv gets kids interested in real life topics.
Trump: An American Dream,"Our kids have found this in the last two weeks (school hols just finished). Yep they both like this sort of show, or at least it's one that I don't automatically tell them to turn off."
Trump: An American Dream,i cant believe kids think magic is real
Trump: An American Dream,"This is exactly how kids learn best, it's so wholesome!"
Trump: An American Dream,This is actually awesome
Trump: An American Dream,It's entertaining and seems to teach good life lessons and problem solving skills.
Trump: An American Dream,It’s 40% child appropriate
Trump: An American Dream,">Actually no, it will be very child appropriate

alright, no gambling then."
Trump: An American Dream,Excuse me they're called ESCORTS
Trump: An American Dream,Should've married a good Cherokee instead of a just OK one
Trump: An American Dream,"I just checked out the first episode. It's cute. Six year old me would have been all over this show because it's a nice mixture of fun, talking animals and folklore. I was a sucker for folklore as a kid and I still am. If you have kids who like things like fairies, Greek mythology and magic, this would be for them."
Trump: An American Dream,"Aside from the premise, which means the world they are in is very unique, the rest is very generic kids show from what I’ve seen. Not bad at all. Cool visual aesthetic too."
Trump: An American Dream,"Kids (4, 6, 8) binged it this weekend. That’s good enough for me."
Trump: An American Dream,"It's good, but it's also for preschoolers. Most adults without young kids likely won't enjoy it."
Trump: An American Dream,"It's good for small children, but it's not one of those children's shows that adults can enjoy too, like Bluey (which is one of my favorite TV shows.)"
Trump: An American Dream,"Agreed, but you also could have put her name in the comment instead of just complaining about the fact it's not posted. Be the change you want to see in the world. 

##Karissa Valencia"
Trump: An American Dream,"Blame Upworthy for that one. The title of this post is the headline of this article, word for word."
Trump: An American Dream,"Her name doesn’t really matter to the story being told, though. The fact that she’s a Native American woman does."
Trump: An American Dream,Yeah! Veggie Tales was awesome for that reason.
Trump: An American Dream,">*Power rangers with spirit animal patronuses*

So, [*Visionaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visionaries:_Knights_of_the_Magical_Light)?"
Trump: An American Dream,It’s funny because my 2yo calls it the Power Rangers. I don’t bother to correct him.
Trump: An American Dream,"APTN! It’s still around and I agree, it had some amazing indigenous kids programming back when I had it on cable!"
Trump: An American Dream,"Not making a native American centric show for the same of making one, but because there's a ton of cool shit to make a show out of."
Trump: An American Dream,"Exactly, and I’m saying this as a minority myself"
Trump: An American Dream,Guess what?  We're going to do both.  Can't imagine anyone would be so fragile that they'd have a problem with it.
Trump: An American Dream,"I remember being really into The Puzzle Place as a kid. The whole premise of the show was showcasing multicultural diversity and exploring the cast’s backgrounds.

Other than that, there wasn’t much on TV to open up that conversation for kids."
Trump: An American Dream,"> (That and centuries of Colonialism cementing the term Indian instead of Indigenous or Native, but regurgitating Indian on TV hasn't helped)

it’s because most Native American advocacy groups in the U.S. support the use of “Indian”."
Trump: An American Dream,"> TV is probably the biggest reason some people still call us Indians.

Statistically speaking, most American Indians prefer Indian to Native American, though they accept both. The Smithsonian got shit for it when they named The National Museum of the American Indian *that* but they surveyed a lot of people. The Census Bureau regularly looks into this. Indian is the preferred term. 

I think it’s different in Canada, but I’m not too sure. Canadians have also influenced Americans to replace Eskimo with Inuit. The problem is, this has lead Americans to use Inuit with non-Inuit people. People are using it as a synonym for all Arctic people. Like Yupik (Eskaleuts and Eskimo, sister branch of Inuit) and Tlingit (completely unrelated to Inuits, related to Navajo). This mistake actually originated with the Inuit Circumpolar Council who entered Barrow, Alaska in the ‘70s and authored a demand that Inuit become the standard term. Arctic people of Canada universally accept it. It’s significantly more divided in Alaska. The US avoids the issue by using the term *Alaska Native* instead. Though this is a legal term, not an ethnic one. An ethnic Inuit who moves to Alaska from Canada does not become an Alaska Native."
Trump: An American Dream,"Polling of the native population Indian the most supported term. Way more than one poll.

People are called by where they are from. In this case the West Indies. Calling you Americans would have made more logic in the battle over what name for the place stuck. When America stuck the name should have changed to that. That demand be logical. We don’t call Europeans or Asians natives or Indigenous. This whole naming issue your bringing up a modern creation. Expecting the people of the past to have ESP to know a future issue is silly 

I try to call by tribal  name and there are way to many differences between tribes to lump together. There are even different language groups meaning your no where close to one culture or ethnic group. 

The old starting to creep back to labeling a large diverse group by one name that got Oriental Banned is going at Asian now. Very false offense though no one was insulting anyone by calling them Oriental the whole objection was having stuff called Oriental studies. Orient means Asian just from a different language base. So objections to using Latino same way. 

Your demanding to be called the locals? If the Aztec Empire under more smart rule took the area you be named after their name for continent. A historical possibility they beat the conquistadors. Get in touch with Drake as he sails by get weapons to fight next Spanish attempt unlike other groups more North they and Incan understand large army formation fighting and could do culturally. 

You been sold on a False offense typical of rotating name changing to be offended by groups. Very off topic when a demand to be called by your tribe name and not lumped together better. 

You have been sold on only European bad and evil idea. When the Imperialism done there were many different sized local imperial groups and near constant warfare between tribes some more war like than others. The great I admire it Aztec Empire was sacrificing huge numbers of near by tribes. 
Jamestown first settlement faced the local imperial power who had recently finished conquest of local area. 

Basically European played by similar rules to everyone else did. Everyone savages. And without the European Enlightenment the Earth would still be in state of near constant struggle  between powers ruled by Kings and few would object to slavery. 

Historically around the world when ever a group focus on past injustice it fails to improve it self the claims of injustice used by those starting it to take power and normally rob the rest of population. 

And making local inhabitants invisible by campaign of always being offended is going to get your rights stripes over time."
Trump: An American Dream,My child said she needed a dream catcher so she can sleep better and treaty beads to keep promises… I can’t really argue
Trump: An American Dream,Soon.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"That wasn't a reboot of Reboot. The only thing from the original was Megabyte. And outside of looks, he wasn't nothing like the original. This is just Power Rangers in computers. They could have simply called it, ""The Guardian Code"" and no one would have been the wiser. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"There was no need to have live action characters in this. The whole point of the original was that it took place entirely inside of the computer and the computer world was put at stake. We saw the dangers of the things like ""The Net"" and ""The Games"" and the damage it could do to a system. It seems like all of that was thrown out for this one."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,[deleted]
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"It's.... the power rangers?

Ohhh, Netflix, no...."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This looks fucking atrocious and nothing like Reboot. Sure is nice to see Alex Krycek though.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Unless I'm grossly misremembering Reboot this shit is nothing like Reboot.  
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Holy fuck that looks like an awful waste of money.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad + Aigis from Persona 3. Got it. 
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This looks more like [Zixx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtwhiFHOPQs) than Reboot. Really wish they just brought back the original characters.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"So just to clarify, although I hope after having your eyes burn from watching this it was clear enough..... Not one of the original co-creators (Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell) have ANYTHING to do with this flaming pile of shit.

Rainmaker never asked them to come back. I mean obviously Rainmaker/Michael Hefferon wanted to twist the IP into some abomination so they never would.... but yeah.

You can likely guess how the three of them feel seeing this....**thing**."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Waited all this time so that they could make some shitty power-ranger rip off with a Megabyte that looks crappier than the one from 20 + years ago? 

The studio behind this should feel ashamed. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"...aaaand it's off to find the original Reboot, because that's the only way I'll be able to relive that 90's magic. This is a steaming pile of crap. Did these guys even bother to watch the original? Holy shit this is pretentious."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Every single part of this just feels lazy and somehow so much worse than the original. Sure, I get that I'm not the target demographic anymore but I can't imagine this doing well with most any demographic.

Megabyte looks so much worse and his voice just can't stack up to Tony Jay."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"What the actual fuck was that? Even just for what it was, it looks awful. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"This is a prank, bro!!  Right?"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,fuck this shit.. holy crap.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This looks terrible. Why couldn't they have just revived the original and gave it a proper conclusion?
Reboot: The Guardian Code,So....Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad?
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"""It's gonna blow""

Your not wrong about that."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Well that was a fucking roller coaster. A fucking Reboot remake? Fuck yeah. Oh god. Please, no."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,I don't like it
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Literally wtf is this shit?

I'd have no problem with this if it wasn't defiling Reboot. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Holy crap what a shit.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This... This should not have been made. It makes my heart cry.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This looks absolutely retarded
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Almost like Code Lyoko.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Well that ruined my day already.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Did they even watch the original? Fuck!
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Go home Netflix, you're drunk."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"X-Post from [/r/ReBoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReBoot/comments/7zayki/reboot_the_guardian_code_official_trailer/duokz2s)

For about a decade now, every once in a while I'd see people momentarily get hyped up over the latest vague rumor of a supposed *ReBoot* movie or *ReBoot*-reboot in the works. I was never excited by those rumors and neither should anyone else have been. Regardless of who owns the rights to the franchise, *ReBoot* was created and written by Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell and John Grace. I always assumed those rumors wouldn't actually come to anything, and that it was just Rainmaker periodically trying to score some cheap publicity. However, on the off-chance something actually got produced, my expectation was that it would be nothing more than a pale, pandering, lifeless imitation of *ReBoot*, conceived by some cynical, artless corporate hack at Rainmaker whose only goal was to make some quick cash by dusting off an old neglected IP and shamelessly pimp its name to those desperate for nostalgia.

That is to say, I always thought that if any of those teased revivals of the *ReBoot* franchise ever came to pass, I was already 99% certain the result would be terrible, so I never had any hope to lose nor hype to die. However, compared to the weak, tepid, shallow imitation of *ReBoot* I had expected might eventually come to be, **THIS STILL SOMEHOW MANAGED TO BE A MILLION FUCKING TIMES WORSE THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED.**

I thought that maybe we'd eventually get one of those terrible *Powerpuff Girls 2016* or *Teen Titans Go!* style reboots, but this... this is... this is just so far beyond appalling I don't even know where to begin.

I could go on about how it casually throws all the concepts of *ReBoot* out the window, or how it decides to abandon any flimsy pretense of imagination or originality by making some shameless *Tron*/*Code Lyoko*/*Every-Other-God-Damn-Show-Or-Movie-Where-People-Go-Inside-A-Computer-And-Fight-Like-Superheroes* ripoff awkwardly mashed together with some sad, bargain-brand Power Rangers knockoff. Users can hop into the computer-world. Not as a character they control within a game, but right there in cyberspace as their motherfucking selves. Oh, and Users are Guardians now. Let that sink in: Users. Are. Guardians.

I haven't looked into it yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if this thing was never even originally intended to be a ReBoot series; that early in production, they were just making some generic, crappy live-action sci-fi series when one day, some soulless lizard in a three-piece suit, smoking a cigar, suddenly thought to himself:

*""Hmm, '90s nostalgia and geek culture is big right now. Let's call this uninspired pile of shit ReBoot and call the teen protagonists whatever the fuck heroes were called in that dumb old cartoon. Shoehorn ReBoot imagery in everywhere. And alter the existing CGI models of the villains to look more like ReBoot villains. You know, that blue wolverine guy, Mugabot or whatever. We'll announce we're making a ReBoot series and BAM! 1000 times the publicity and attention we would have gotten for [Tron/Power Rangers Knockoff]. And even if they bitch and moan about it on the internet, I bet thousands of those pathetic 26-35-year-old losers will still watch this shit because it has ""ReBoot"" in the title.""*

I don't need to say anything more about that or anything else though. I don't need to explain why any particular thing is wrong. I know it's wrong. You know it's wrong. The continuous wrongness throughout this entire trailer is so blatant, so intense, so constant, and so self-evident, that it doesn't require description. There's no need to write out thousands of words, because I already know I have a mutual understanding with anyone else who has seen this trailer. The long essay cataloging every horrible thing need never be written, because its contents already exist in all our minds.

Oh, and while I'm on the subject of being annoyed at hints of *ReBoot* movies and *ReBoot* reboots, just the concept of that rubs me the wrong way, because if anyone in charge actually cared about *ReBoot*, their real priority wouldn't be hacking together a cheap, cash-grab re-make, but to, you know... **actually finish the original fucking show!**

I really wish there was some way Gavin Blair and Ian Pearson could get the rights/funding/etc that would allow them to do something like what Genndy Tartakovsky did with *Samurai Jack*. His situation was similar: his series was long-canceled and Mako, the guy who voiced the primary antagonist, had since died. Yet they found a passable Mako-soundalike and gave Genndy 10 episodes to wrap up his show. The results were far from perfect, but at least it was nice for the sake of closure and to have the actual author end his own story.

Guess that won't be happening for *ReBoot* though, not after this mess renders the entire franchise toxic."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,That looks worse than I could have possibly imagined 
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Holy shit, this is horrible. This is ReBoot in name only. Absolutely nothing besides Megabyte carried over from the original cartoon. Super dissapointed. Was hoping for some more CGI cartoons."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"this used to be my favorite show, loved all the tiny puns and jokes"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,man this sucks.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,This makes me miss Tony Jay even more.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Where the fuck is Matrix ! ???

This is not reboot "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Watching this brought back memories of a show from 2004 titled "" Zix:  level one""

Here's a link to the first episode. The first 40 seconds are essentially a trailer it seems.

https://youtu.be/NtwhiFHOPQs"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"I got really excited for a second!  I loved reboot. 
""Glitch...BFG""
"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"So take the Reboot properties and just remake Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad?

Will one of the kids leave, be replaced with another kid, and the explanation is the first kid went back to his home planet?  If ""yes"" then I approve of this abomination."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"I always had the idea that they should've made the Reboot reboot a live action movie that takes place between when Enzo loses Mortal Combat and when the series picks up again. Game time accelerated their growth, but there's obviously stuff that happened. There's probably a pretty reasonable character arc for them going from scared kids to effective mercenaries. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Boycott this garbage and send a message.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,it has to be a netflix april fools surely how did this even get released it would have been alright 25 years ago but now ? i litterally laughed out loud from watching this.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,They remade VR Troopers and called it Reboot....
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Without Tony Jay this is going to suuuuuuuck
(saying that as a fan of the series)"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Of course they couldn't get back Tony Jay, but there's no reason Megabyte doesn't even look half as cool as intimidating as in the old series. He looks like a chump here."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"> and ""The Games"" and the damage it could do to a system

Unless I'm missing something, didn't make sense why the User winning games would destroy his own system. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Didn't even finish the trailer. Hard pass.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,More like VR Troopers.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"I don't understand. Outside of the logo and a some creature that vaguely resembles Megabyte when you squint hard enough, this is literally a completely different show. How is this the result of 8 years of trying to put something together?"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Ghaaa you beat me to the samurai reference!

but for real, WHERE TF IS BOB ENZO AND DOT???

edit: AND FRISKET AND HEXADECIMAL AND FONG!?!?

edit II: AND HACK AND SLAAAASH!"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,IMO it's Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad with Reboot properties involved.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,but super human samurai was actually good
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Wow this looks EXACTLY like Zixx and I only watched the first 25 seconds of that video. WTF are they doing?
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Wasn't Zixx also made by Rainmaker Studios? 
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"This. This right here. 
!RedditSilver"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,[Gavin Blair's reaction on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRealMrSweary/status/966497518220492800)
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"> The studio behind this should feel ashamed.

Rainmaker feels no shame."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Seriously, I was looking forward to seeing all the old characters updated with today's CGI advancements. Megabyte, here, looks like something straight out of the 90's. The only thing about the CGI that hints at advancement is that the movements are more fluid. That's it. The rendering is so bad and dated. Who animated this? "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,I'm so glad I wasn't the only one that thought of Zix as well
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Which is annoying, considering we're already getting an animated remake of Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad later this year."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"> Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad

Oh shit! I was just thinking of this show the other day and wondering what it was called. Thank you. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"To be fair, even if the ReBoot original creators got to finish it their way, he'd still be dead. And that's all the defense I'll do about this  show."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,And a system restart magically fixes everything. Doesn't explain that too.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"It's like your mom said! Those games are giving your computer a virus!

And also, in My Two Bobs, it showed a quarantined virus receiving an upgrade and breaking free. If that happened in real life I'd be hosed."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Same. 

RIP Reboot. 

We still love you for what you were. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Don't forget Andrea, Enzo's girlfriend,  not sure how they spelled it."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"14 years of computational progress.  
Looks freaking identical. "
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Yeah, at least Season 2 and 3 were.

Probably just went with a Reboot revival over Zixx because it was more popular."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Yep, it's great. Gotta love Gavin. I speak with him and the other co-creators quite often."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Haha, really?  Wow."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"He comes back

Prepare yourselves....for the hunt"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,[deleted]
Reboot: The Guardian Code,I can't be killed because this trailer makes me feel dead inside already
Reboot: The Guardian Code,The references to time in reboot were all in either micro- or nano-. There even was an episode where Enzo turned 10 seconds old. 
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Which was actually only two seconds because his age was in binary.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Lol this clip is actually why I decided to not watch, even though i had been quite excited to see the reboot of, uh, reboot."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Too subtle.  If you're going to be a 1d exposition spouting character, go full Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending or go home.  Especially when paired with literal cartoons."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Terrible show.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"That's so terrible.  It was a great opportunity to drop some actual network security references and generally outline a hacker's goals.  But I guess you can't really expect many kids' programs to invest in making their content even slightly educational...  They could have been talking about ports, how anti-virus software identifies infected files, enabling a firewall, but no.   ""Cyber-locusts"".  Ugh."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Since the opening montage with the guy talking about how vulnerable the internet is was just footage of high school kids on their phones, I thought he'd do his hacker thing only to learn that Ashley has been talking shit about Jenna."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Hint of emporer Palpatine about him. Not just the hood, the voice as well."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"I've watched the first 10 episodes when they first came out. As a huge fan of the original show, episode 10 was the most insulting fucking episode I could have imagined. Legit just watch ReBoot again instead and pretend TGC never happened."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"ReBoot was one of my favorite shows as a kid. Now I ask, what the fuck is this shit?"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"the original series was much better, even if at times it could be pretty corny, but back then, being a 3d animated show even then was pretty expensive and looked good for the time and had good enough writing to keep people hooked....this show had none of that, it was effectively a power rangers/code lyoko fusion that just ripped off reboot, power rangers and code lyoko all at once and just sucked"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,[H A C K hack press enter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rQPdWwv3k8)
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"i feel your pain, believe me. i LOVED the original show, and watched it religiously. there's nothing worse than watching a reboot of something you loved and thinking 'it'll get better. it has to. they're just finding their footing. the cast hasn't pulled together yet, but they will...'

and then they never do."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Reboot ended *fourteen* years ago?  Now I really feel old.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Rainmaker! Finally! Okay.... The trilogy movie idea was awesome but I'll gladly settle for a show. Hopefully they fix that god damn cliff hanger most of us have been waiting on since childhood. At least some form of reference.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"""ReBoot: the Guardian Code transforms four teens into new Guardians whose mission is to save the world"".

Sounds like Superhuman Samurai Cyber Squad to me."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"VR Troopers premise was exactly Power rangers but with a ""computer"" twist. 
"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Or Code Lyoko mixed with VR Troopers.

And they cribbed the bad guys name from Discworld."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Gellar on Starring in a Buffy Reboot:

>""I am very proud of the show that we created and it doesn’t need to be done. We wrapped that up.”  

  
>“I am all for them continuing the story, because there’s the story of female empowerment. I love the way the show was left: ‘Every girl who has the power can have the power.’ It’s set up perfectly for someone else to have the power. But like I said, the metaphors of ‘Buffy’ were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young, but I am not an adolescent.”"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"It would have issues because of the cast alone.

Spike and Angel's actors simply can't play immortal vampires anymore. Nicholas Brendan is probably completely unemployable until he gets some long overdue help. They already killed off Anya and Cordelia.

That's before you get into how like half the cast wants nothing to do with Whedon anymore and that Whedon himself is a major no go right now.

SMG, Hannigan and Trachtenberg are probably the only 3 you could realistically keep running with. Maybe Anthony Head. 

It might be interesting if you could get Noxon, Fury, and Espenson back in the writers room but that's probably the only chance it has."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"The buffyverse is an incredibly fleshed out and brilliant universe with a lot of potential 

Pick another slayer in another era and tell a different story completely unconnected from Buffy 

A period piece would be brilliant.

I’m surprised no one has done this yet"
Reboot: The Guardian Code,Make a spinoff about the Hellmouth over Cleveland instead.
Reboot: The Guardian Code,God I respect her so much for this. Not everything needs to be rebooted. Try and get some new ideas
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"Agreed. It doesn't need to be done. 
This will unfortunately have absolutely zero bearing on whether it will in fact, be done."
Reboot: The Guardian Code,and that's why we love her
Reboot: The Guardian Code,"I mean she is 100% right.

Create a new show with a new slayer not named Buffy and not set in Sunnydale.

You get to have your own show and characters without pissing off the original fan base."

Kill Me Heal Me,"Whatever it’s flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, “How the fuck was I supposed to know that?”"
Kill Me Heal Me,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (“Oh shit, it’s the dude from Ozark!”).

Pete Davidson was kind of “eh”, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
Kill Me Heal Me,Jasons bird dance was incredible
Kill Me Heal Me,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
Kill Me Heal Me,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn’t add anything. I feel I could’ve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
Kill Me Heal Me,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
Kill Me Heal Me,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would’ve been awesome.
Kill Me Heal Me,Wasn’t the joke that because he was brought in last minute there’s no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway…
Kill Me Heal Me,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn’t they just roll with it and be like “oh, good job Pete. That did it I guess”"
Kill Me Heal Me,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
Kill Me Heal Me,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
Kill Me Heal Me,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There’s few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can’t win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don’t care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
Kill Me Heal Me,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn’t see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
Kill Me Heal Me,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
Kill Me Heal Me,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
Kill Me Heal Me,Agreed completely.
Kill Me Heal Me,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn’t even try to play along at all, didn’t say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
Kill Me Heal Me,Still can’t believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
Kill Me Heal Me,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
Kill Me Heal Me,It’s crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
Kill Me Heal Me,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn’t “ruin” anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain’t perfect but I think it’s obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
Kill Me Heal Me,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like “hey were filming this come join! It’s not like you need a script” or something similar. 

It didn’t seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that’s the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I’m going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn’t even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
Kill Me Heal Me,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
Kill Me Heal Me,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
Kill Me Heal Me,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
Kill Me Heal Me,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
Kill Me Heal Me,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Kill Me Heal Me,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the “ca-caw ca-caw” chicken dance from arrested development
Kill Me Heal Me,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
Kill Me Heal Me,I’m not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you’re coming into the end of the episode?
Kill Me Heal Me,"The kind of “cardinal rule” for improv is the “yes, and” approach. Pete didn’t say yes to any set ups; he didn’t play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn’t attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn’t have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It’s way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
Kill Me Heal Me,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn’t feel well put together.  It’s like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the “game” and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
Kill Me Heal Me,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
Kill Me Heal Me,I don’t blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn’t have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason’s nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
Kill Me Heal Me,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
Kill Me Heal Me,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Kill Me Heal Me,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
Kill Me Heal Me,I didn’t mind Pete Davidson. He didn’t add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
Kill Me Heal Me,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
Kill Me Heal Me,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn’t take it seriously.
Kill Me Heal Me,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
Kill Me Heal Me,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
Kill Me Heal Me,Agreed!
Kill Me Heal Me,I agree about Pete Davidson but I was laughing so hard even that couldn’t ruin it for me. I think Bateman is the perfect type of entertainer to do these things because he is so ridiculously deadpan with his comedy and he didn’t break no matter what absurd things they made him do. Leslie Nielsen would be proud.
Kill Me Heal Me,"honestly this episode was hilarious - the end was a bit annoying, but everything else was **great**"
Kill Me Heal Me,[deleted]
Kill Me Heal Me,"Or when Maya said, “50 Seconds, MacGruber!”"
Kill Me Heal Me,I love Jason but Maya was SO fucking funny
Kill Me Heal Me,"I laughed the most when that other officer came in when they're interviewing the assistant and Maya goes, ""now who the fuck is that?!"" This show is lots of fun, and I loved seeing Jason Bateman in it as well! Dug the little AD callback with his quick chicken impersonation. If you can even call it that...I'm not convinced he's ever seen one."
Kill Me Heal Me,"""I never met him!"""
Kill Me Heal Me,"Or when the lady cop showed up and Maya said ""who the fuck was that?"""
Kill Me Heal Me,"Oh god that was hilarious. I laughed a lot this episode - watching Jason having to go through all of the debasing stuff set up and talking about having time to plot his revenge.. Sean laughing, the naked guy."
Kill Me Heal Me,He was such a good sport not hesitating to go full in on playing a cat. But casually vocalizing that he would get Arnete back for it was gold.
Kill Me Heal Me,"When he tried to do mouth to mouth, I almost died"
Kill Me Heal Me,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

To be fair, that was the joke.  But yeah, he didn't go along with anything and that ruined the ending a bit."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I wasn't sure who ""Sean"" was or how Jason Bateman knew him lol"
Kill Me Heal Me,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

That was the joke."
Kill Me Heal Me,"The improv masters were great and all, but the completely natural reaction of ""Oh shit, it's the guy from Ozark."" has to be my favorite bit in the whole thing."
Kill Me Heal Me,"> but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

They need to send that one back to the drawing board"
Kill Me Heal Me,"""Who's the assistant?""

 ""That one.

 ""oh, she did it.""

And he STILL didn't pick her."
Kill Me Heal Me,I'd watch a full Pete episode for sure
Kill Me Heal Me,"""caw, caw"""
Kill Me Heal Me,it's from 'arrested development' where Will Arnett used to do this dance in front of Jason!
Kill Me Heal Me,"I didn’t even know who he was and assumed he was a DJ or something since he didn’t seem like he could act and wasn’t funny. Possibly an athlete, but like, for poker or something."
Kill Me Heal Me,"It was an easier case than the other episodes by a mile - my partner noticed right away that all the name tags were smudged because they were written by someone left-handed and then I picked out that the killer's name tag was not smudged because they were writing it themselves to replace the one they lost.

But the fact that nobody even guessed one of the suspects was a far better outcome than the prior episodes where they just flounder with a random guess. The Mayor, suicide, and Seattle were great picks."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I LOVE the fact that there are three suspects, three detectives, and no one picked any of them.  It feels like an instant, unspoken agreement of ""if we don't know, we won't pick.""  And Pete seemed to pick up on it, too."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Yes, they really needed someone with improv training. Imagine Amy Poehler or Will Ferrell or even Martin Short in that role."
Kill Me Heal Me,"I will say that this episode also seemed way harder to solve than the others.  I don't know if that was because of the multiple guest stars or what.  I didn't pick up on the mint drink at all.  The nametag smear was an obvious clue, but somehow I forgot all about it by the time we met Jim.  And I think the ""magic hands"" was a real stretch, though she was the only thing I go right and that was only because of how crazy she was and honestly I assumed her cat would have done the licking."
Kill Me Heal Me,"His hype will be done when he stops bagging the top ""newly available talent"" every six months.  It's a damn right of passage at this point.  

Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, Kaia Gerber, Phoebe Dynevor, Kim Kardashian, Margaret Qualley and now Emily Ratajkowski?  The guy's a machine."
Kill Me Heal Me,Right? I though the absurdity of it made it worth the joke
Kill Me Heal Me,"I *think* the plan was to have Maya and Jason try and explain the absolute absurdity they just witnessed and basically have him go on that. THey did it a little bit but I don't think they got what they wanted.

I didn't hate it as most of the others, here. I thought it was funny enough."
Kill Me Heal Me,"Where's that ""could of/could have"" bot?"
Kill Me Heal Me,"True. The absolute funniest scenes in the UK original are ones where everyone breaks character because they're laughing too much. This is my favourite:

https://youtu.be/kphVef2S2bI"
Kill Me Heal Me,"I agree because I've seen this opinion posted everywhere and I think people are taking this obviously silly and fun show way too seriously. ""No one picking a real suspect ruined it for me."" Really?! I was rolling laughing at that and so was the crew in the background, it was a great moment!"
Kill Me Heal Me,"I think you hate Pete Davidson a bit too much if him being there for five minutes ruined a hilarious episode with some insane performances.

I think the “Chad” sketches are dumb, and he’s not really my cup of tea, but I didn’t recoil (lol coil) when he walked out. It was more of an “Oh, that guy.”"
Kill Me Heal Me,He was really good in King of Staten Island
Kill Me Heal Me,Jason also did a bit of the chicken dance when he was singing his elf song.
Kill Me Heal Me,"Aww, now I'm going to be forever sad that it wasn't Michael Cera. His personality would've been great for this special."
Kill Me Heal Me,Sean also randomly appeared in a bit with Will on Lego Masters a few weeks ago.
Kill Me Heal Me,And it's amazing
Kill Me Heal Me,I lost it when he just pulled the wires on the bomb. I like Pete. I really don't understand why people hate him so much.
Kill Me Heal Me,"> He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect.

So did Jason and Maya"
Kill Me Heal Me,">He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect. 

Can you imagine if the other two had done that?!"
Kill Me Heal Me,"I do, he still didn’t go along with the scenes. He’s a talentless amateur."
Kill Me Heal Me,It rhymes with Sean Hayes and sounds like a bad ass athlete
Kill Me Heal Me,The actual name might be familiar if you’re a ghost rider fan
Kill Me Heal Me,I loved that part so much
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Fantastic set of specials

I also recently watched his Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999 special and it might be the funniest stand up special I've ever watched"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Is this the guy for that dream restaurant podcast?
James Acaster: Repertoire,The kneeling bit alone is one of the most clever standup moments I’ve ever seen.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"If you like James Acaster stand-ups then you'll love him on Taskmaster.  All of Taskmaster is great but the Series 7 episodes with James is the best series.  Although, series 5 is greatness too.

Taskmaster, Series 7, Episode 1
https://youtu.be/dudmIc5AWR0"
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Yes, James is one of the best comedians today!

If you enjoy Repertoire, I also highly recommend Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999, which is available for purchase on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/jamesacaster/videos). He even brings up his stint on the Great British Bake-off (and becoming a [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bon-appetite) in America). :)

Also, since you are clearly a fan of Bo Burnham, here is a wonderful [podcast](https://www.vulture.com/article/james-acaster-good-one-podcast.html) in which James mentions watching Make Happy for the first time during lockdown. Enjoy!"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Vulture has a pretty good podcast called Good One where they do in-depth interviews with comedians about their work.  [They recently did an interview with him](https://www.vulture.com/article/james-acaster-good-one-podcast.html) for *Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999* that was really good.  I highly recommend it; the special was well worth the $11 I paid on Vimeo for it.  It's like a lighter version of Bo Burnham's Inside.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I find he doesn't come across as well on UK panel shows as the shorter joke format almost makes him come across as a sulky child. 

His stand up, particularly Repertoire, is a step beyond that though and some of the cleverest use of the format. Comparing it's callbacks and references to Arrested Development is spot on"
James Acaster: Repertoire,The Arrested Development comparison is so perfect. I’m going to use that from now on when I’m recommending the specials.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"You should definitely listen to his audio book 'classic scrapes' or read the book, but his delivery makes the audio book even better. I try to out it on in bed but end up staying awake because it's so funny. It's a collection of situations he's gotten himself in to over the years"
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He has a show with Josh Widdicombe, Hypothetical, that’s very good. Two teams of two comedians have to say what they would do/how they did do something in a hypothetical situation, like start a cult and get the most people to join or if they were a Bond villain."
James Acaster: Repertoire,He was my entry into UK standup!
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He’s great as a guest on RHLSTP, one of my fave podcasts, he’s been on 4 or 5 times ans is going to be on again soon with ed gamble. 

I’d also suggest listening to him on comedians comedian podcast. He has episodes discussing the craft of making repertoire

Also distraction pieces podcast he talks a lot about repertoire but while still in the process of creating it, I think he’d only done 2 of the shows at that point"
James Acaster: Repertoire,I’d read this if you used paragraphs.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Someone on here recommended his 'old lasagna' special and it might be one of the worst comedy specials I've seen.

Only funny bit was him recounting his time on Bake Off.

I saw one reviewer describe it as  a YouTuber reading old Tumblr posts which I thought was a great way to summarize it."
James Acaster: Repertoire,I love this special. But I find him incredibly irritating everywhere else.
James Acaster: Repertoire,[deleted]
James Acaster: Repertoire,">It is one of the most clever specials I've ever seen.

>and I'm not someone who usually watches comedy specials

Not saying it's not good, but how tf do you actually know it's top of the pile if you've barely watched any other specials?"
James Acaster: Repertoire,This guy good I remember watching a bit he had about the museums
James Acaster: Repertoire,Death comes to us all.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I saw that show live and it was incredible! Cemented himself as my favorite current comedian by far. I think something notable about his comedy that isn’t often mentioned is that it’s almost always 100% clean. Not that I have a problem with explicit comedy but it’s certainly rare to find such high quality, clean stuff."
James Acaster: Repertoire,Where did you find this? I’ve been looking but can’t find it streaming anywhere.
James Acaster: Repertoire,PAPADUMS OR BREAD?
James Acaster: Repertoire,Indeed he’s the genie.
James Acaster: Repertoire,He’s got a podcast??
James Acaster: Repertoire,Both barrels
James Acaster: Repertoire,100%. That moment where James absolutely snaps on Rod during their final group task is one of my favorite tv moments
James Acaster: Repertoire,The amount of chaos between him and Rhod is amazing
James Acaster: Repertoire,He is great on Taskmaster and Would I Lie to You.
James Acaster: Repertoire,I saw him first on panel shows and Taskmaster and he was great.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He also has a book called [Perfect Sound Whatever](https://www.jamesacaster.com/perfect-sound-whatever/) that explains why 2016 was the best year for music. Both of these audiobooks are read by the author himself, and I highly recommend them!"
James Acaster: Repertoire,[deleted]
James Acaster: Repertoire,It was a short post. One was the correct number of paragraphs
James Acaster: Repertoire,"To be fair, that special is pretty inaccessible for people who don't know him. It relies heavily on the viewer knowing his shtick and the persona he puts on. Acaster has a brand of humor where he himself is the joke, as much as the actual joke itself. If you've seen him perform, you know - his delivery, his mannerisms and all the other stuff he puts on. It's also probably his most personal work ever, so that adds another layer of ""you need to be invested to get much out of it"".

But, Repertoire eases you into it. You get introduced to his weird and whimsical ways of thinking a bit more gradually, and it tends to grow on you like you wouldn't believe. It's also very original, and I'm surprised it hasn't been done before."
James Acaster: Repertoire,I thought it was brilliant.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I'd still recommend Repertoire. He completely changed his style for Cold Lasagne, it's just some true stories about his life. Whereas Repertoire was written back when he was an unknown and doesn't assume you know anything about him, its a genius mad series of specials."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I find him very hit or miss. What's funny is really funny, but when it isn't it tends to fall completely flat."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"That's true, he does have a persona and a way of speaking he puts on. I've noticed that with British comedians a lot - many them play characterized versions of themselves. I think he does it very well though and while I think seeing him do standup as himself would be interesting, I still really enjoy his schtik."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He’s pretty clean usually but, in Cold Lasagne, he goes quite blue on purpose (to offend the “Crizzos” who show up to his comedy gigs with their kids, thinking James will act the way he does on British panel shows). It’s hilarious!"
James Acaster: Repertoire,It's on vimeo with another short special of his for around $10
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He's got two!

Off-Menu with Ed Gamble and James Acaster, and James Acasters Perfect Sounds.

Both brilliant podcasts. The former is about food and is more comedy focused and the later is more serious and is an attempt to prove that 2016 is the greatest year for music of all time."
James Acaster: Repertoire,He's a major as far as I'm concerned.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Yeah I really don't like it. They take what naturally happens on other panel shows due to comedians just making of fun of things and going off of each other and try to force it with Hypothetical ..and it comes across very much forced and not funny most of the time. 

Although James Acaster is still fun to watch on it."
James Acaster: Repertoire,Actually it would be three paragraphs because you change ideas/subject 3 times.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I had seen some of his stuff before, doesn't change the fact that it wasn't a good special. It felt very open mic-ey."
James Acaster: Repertoire,I agree. His brand of humor is great. Love him in TaskMaster. Him refusing to say hi to Alex Horne was hilarious
James Acaster: Repertoire,There are a few clips of him before he found that shtick. [Here he is on the Russell Howard show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IsTngg6pU0).
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He felt a lot more genuine but still very funny on As Yet Untitled, which is one of the reasons I really like that show"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Great now I'm going to have the Kettering Town FC song stuck in my head
James Acaster: Repertoire,Ironically judging by the comments here so far this seems to have offended people.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"""Yeah, but you do know what your Patronus is, you're a fucking dork.""

As a 30-year-old who knows what their Patronus is, I feel very offended."
James Acaster: Repertoire,Something oddly *familiar* about this topic
James Acaster: Repertoire,I feel like this is going to be lost on a lot of people unfamiliar with James Acaster's usual vibe
James Acaster: Repertoire,I love how he calls Christians ‘Chrisos.’
James Acaster: Repertoire,"This whole special was one of the best I've seen, highly recommend. I know this particular clip is getting posted a lot right now (wonder why... /s) but it is so much funnier in context. The whole show is 2 hours, split into two halves, with Acaster exploring the ideas of personas and mental health while reminiscing about the best year of his life in hour one, and the worst year of his life in hour two.

It never feels like a sermon or a tedtalk like a lot of comedy shows which explore serious topics. Instead, the jokes build up, creating great callbacks with bigger and better payoffs as the show progresses. 

Also worth seeking out another comedy set he did called ""Make a New Tomorrow"". It released at the same time as Cold Lasagne and while it doesn't deal with the serious personal topics, it's a blazing 40 minute comedy set. 

Then his 4 Repertoire specials on Netflix which all link into each other, Season 7 of Taskmaster which he features on (then watch all of Taskmaster because its probably the most consistently funny show on television right now) and top it off by listening to Acaster's Classic Scrapes on YouTube. 

What do you mean I'm obsessed with James Acaster??"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Anyone go to the Leeds show of this tour? What a wild ride that was.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"If you watch this special (and you should, it's funny as shit), you should stop after the Bake Off introduction, then watch the actual bake off episode, then jump back to cold lasagne.

You need the context of that bakeoff disaster."
James Acaster: Repertoire,Yo!  This shit was lit. Haven't been into stand-up lately but this was actually pretty funny. I'd be interested in seeing more.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"This is hands down one of the best specials I've ever seen 

To me, I'd put the right alongside Inside as one of the best if not the best stand-up special in the last twenty years. 

If James was American, I have no doubt in my mind he'd be as popular as Bo Burnham in terms of US cultural relevance as he touches on so many issues with such eloquence."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Acaster is great in anything but especially live, he's hoping he comes back to my hometown."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"The picture and quote roped me in. I've never heard of Acaster, was not in the least bit disappointed. Love it."
James Acaster: Repertoire,[deleted]
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I agree with him on the subject matter, it's just a shame that he is painfully unfunny. He was on Big Fat Quiz of the year last year teaming with Stacey Soloman and she was the funnier one of the two."
James Acaster: Repertoire,So what queue do I stand in if I enjoy both Acaster and Chapelle?
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I've seen people say that the reason he keeps repeating himself is a commentary on edgy comedians and that is not true at all. 

If you watch the special, you'll notice he keeps repeating everything ad nauseam. He's just not that good of a comedian.

I think he said 'my girlfriend left me for Mr. Bean' somewhere around fifteen times in it.

The entire special was awful.

I watched it after someone recommended it on here, it was so bad. One of the worst comedy specials I've watched.

I thought I was crazy after watching it since it got so much praise on here so I looked up reviews on it.

One described it as a Youtuber reading Tumblr posts from 2013 and that's when it clicked why so many people on Reddit liked it."
James Acaster: Repertoire,Someone already posted this like a day ago.
James Acaster: Repertoire,I do not enjoy this.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Ohh look, Reddit's just going to spam Acaster and Frankie Boyle for a week because of Chappelle?"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Painfully unfunny
James Acaster: Repertoire,"The bit about edgy comedians was not very good, why does he repeat himself 3 time and his delivery becomes increasingly more annoying each time? The joke was perfectly fine when he said it once, not that it's much of a joke anyway. I get that it is topical now in light of Dave Chapelle's current mess but that does not make his delivery good or the joke hillarious."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Haha! Listen to my ageist rant! Old people are bigots! Har har har!

Then he goes on to rant about how badly trans people are treated by a certain comedian. 

It’s just hypocrisy all the way down. 

Comedians challenge us. Don’t like it? Don’t listen to them… it’s really that simple. 

After watching this bit, I realize this guy’s humour isn’t for me. So that’ll be the last time I watch him and that’s the end of that chapter."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"This special was decent, but it’s nowhere near the level of top comedians"
James Acaster: Repertoire,I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of UK 'comedy' until we can figure out what's going on.
James Acaster: Repertoire,You bastard
James Acaster: Repertoire,Isn't it fucking hilarious how that works?
James Acaster: Repertoire,Clearly they just don’t understand and don’t want to be challenged……….
James Acaster: Repertoire,I am thriving in the irony. It's quite challenging
James Acaster: Repertoire,All those undercover chrizzos trying to instigate shizzle. You know how those sneaky chrizzos are. 🙄
James Acaster: Repertoire,Hahaha honestly it worked so well I love it. These comments are like watching a weird natural experiment unfolding before our eyes.
James Acaster: Repertoire,Is he wrong?
James Acaster: Repertoire,I had to google it.  Thank fuck I didn'tknow.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"The struggle against the omnipotent trans cabal ruling the planet is, by nature, timeless! Our brave herolds and martyrs won't be silenced by the lethal oppression of the hit squads after them!! Once power has grown out of all bounds of sanity and decency like it has for the elite trans oligarchy, they can only be corrupt dictators strangling poor cis people in their cruel grip!!! But no, they will never silenc"
James Acaster: Repertoire,> What do you mean I'm obsessed with ~~James Acaster~~ Pat Springleaf??
James Acaster: Repertoire,"The Repertoire series on Netflix absolutely blew me away. I watch a lot of stand up, and it was the first time in a long time that I felt like I was watching some sort of genius."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I can’t stop thinking about his Walkman but and the long act out, utter genius. Also the framing device for the final story/not having time to tell both sides is just next level brilliant (no spoilers)

I’d recommend acaster’s podcast appearances too on the following: RHLSTP, comedians comedian podcast, distraction pieces, films to be buried with and good one. He might be the perfect podcast guest 

Absolutey agree that taskmaster is a must watch for anyone, honestly the most consistent show of any kind of the last five years"
James Acaster: Repertoire,does that worst year include mr bean stealing his girl
James Acaster: Repertoire,"> What do you mean I'm obsessed with James Acaster??

You did fail to mention Off Menu, though."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"He does really genius, thoughtful stuff. If someone would teach him to play keyboard, we could get rid of Bo Burnham altogether."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"What happened in Leeds? I went to see him twice in Newcastle and the first time was pretty much a train wreck and one of the most awkward shows I've been to. There was heckling and he kind of had a few swipes at the audience which wasn't appreciated by some, eventually ending up with him cutting most of the first half of the show out. And the second time a few months later (where I actually got to see the whole show) was great."
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I was there for the second night and just hearing him recount what happened the first night was bad enough, bloody hell."
James Acaster: Repertoire,[deleted]
James Acaster: Repertoire,"How offensive, here have a downvote ^(/s)"
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Personally, I agree. But to each their own.

It's more funny to me that this clip has been posted relentlessly the past week. Solely as a deflection and finally is getting some backlash around here.

The only thing that has been spammed more on the internet the past week are memes of Candice Owens by Conservatives."
James Acaster: Repertoire,I mean I enjoy chapelle too but his most recent special was just a hour long rant about trans people followed by “it’s ok I have a trans friend”. Like I kept waiting for him to move on to some of his funny material and it just never happened. Very disappointing.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"I remember your reply to my comment where i explained why he did the repetition in the edgy comedians bit. I was obviously only talking about the “too challenging for ya” line and why it was repeated in that specific context, but for some reason you took it mean that that’s why he does _all_ of his repetitions? That’s obviously not what I or the others were trying to say

For example in the mr bean bit he is trying to drive home how ridiculous it is that his partner left him for Rowan Atkinson, who I assume they both had grown up watching on tv. So the repetition in that case is more like “isn’t this fucking unbelievable?” and nothing to do with edgy comedians. You don’t have to like it but it’s done for a reason and not just randomly

Edit: this was the comment I was talking about https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/q3o50z/glaad_condemns_dave_chappelle_netflix_for/hftmj7p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3"
James Acaster: Repertoire,If your significant other left you for Mr. Bean how many times do you think you'd repeat it?
James Acaster: Repertoire,"What's the matter, too challenging for you?"
James Acaster: Repertoire,Coward
James Acaster: Repertoire,It’s the Dane cook technique.
James Acaster: Repertoire,"What's the matter, too challenging for you?"
James Acaster: Repertoire,"Bad luck! That's my job. I'm a Redditor. I'm meant to challenge people. If you don't like being challenged, don't click on my posts."
The Defiant Ones,"All the footage was awesome, and I love Dr. Dre. Never heard of Jimmy Iovine but it's a pretty amazing story. I was enthralled with the first three episodes. Then the final episode happened and it tells you how crazy he is about advertising Beats, and then you realize you're watching an hour long advertisement for Beats/Apple Music. Definitely still worth it though."
The Defiant Ones,I wish it was 5 episodes so they could have spent more time on the Eminem/50 cent era
The Defiant Ones,"That ten minute segment on the infamous Source Awards was maybe the most fun thing I've watched all year. God damn what a time that was.

I loved the whole doc. I like that it didn't flinch from their flaws, and Dre seemed genuinely humbled and remorseful for his past shiftiness"
The Defiant Ones,"I really  loved this doc, 10/10 but I was disappointed with how little we got on Eminem. After watching Hip-Hop Evolution last summer I was craving for some info on the 90 - mid 2000 era."
The Defiant Ones,"I thought it was very well edited and had a lot of interesting interviews and archival footage, and the first 3 episodes had me hooked, but for some reason it all fell apart by the end of the last episode, it felt like the whole thing was kind of pointless."
The Defiant Ones,"Just finished it last night. Honestly it blew me away. As an aspiring musician, seeing everything that goes into the biz, was inspiring, despressing, overwhelming, and eye opening. Watching Dre and Jimmys work ethic and how it affects those around them was emotional for me as trying to balance the wife and kid, with booking gigs and making moves i hope will get me ahead, really takes a toll on a person and those they care about. I watched it with my wife and we are stronger for it. The way it was articulated in the last episode about marrying a genius (not that i feel i am) and not a regular person and all that comes along with that really resonated with her and i think it helped my case a bit. I would highly recommend this to anyone, as it is one of the best docs i have ever seen"
The Defiant Ones,"I watched this on a whim with my friend, and several times every episode I recall saying out loud: ""Goddamn"". Just thinking how amazing this documentary is. They way they strung together the story lines, and throwing in the interviews. All the behind the scenes footage that they had. Really good shit. Iovine lived one crazy fucking life"
The Defiant Ones,"After it aired I was really surprised that there were no discussion thread, or anybody else mentioning it.

I loved it, one of the best docs I've seen, ever, I think. Did a great job to tell us where Dre and Iovine came from, how they did what they did ect ect.

I would recommend this to any hiphop, hell any music fan, to watch this.

10/10 in my book, absolutely amazing. "
The Defiant Ones,One of the top 3 music docu's I've ever watched honestly
The Defiant Ones,"It was truly awesome and a 9/10. it lost a point for alot of atmospheric padding when it could have tossed in some more content;  Eminem and NIN and Interscope could be a documentary by themselves. 

Loved the music music and the background music. Alot of NIN in there. "
The Defiant Ones,"watched the first episode and really like it so far
edit: ok finished it it's amazing but a bit too much beats content in ep4.. would have preferred more eminem/kenrick/2001 scenes though"
The Defiant Ones,"Watch the entire thing in one night and it's amazing, but I'm still not sure how to say Jimmy Iovine's name...."
The Defiant Ones,"I've never heard of this show, but the internet has trained me to assume that it's actually called *The Definite Ones*."
The Defiant Ones,"I was amazed at the footage they had. Those studio videos were better than anything I've seen in movies. Both Jimmy and Dre were destined to be successful, and they were destined to be partners. The amount of stars that Interscope signed looks unbelievable."
The Defiant Ones,Shame Scott Storch didn't get a mention
The Defiant Ones,I'm on episode 3. It's amazing.
The Defiant Ones,"Other than the fact that BEATS headphones are crap and defeat the purpose of what headphones are about, the series was awesome and really tied together for me events I knew nothing about. I didn't know Interscope had so many varied acts."
The Defiant Ones,Why the fuck is this not on HBO Nordic?
The Defiant Ones,"What is the song Dr. Dre is singing during episode 4? I know I've heard it somewhere.

""What's, what's peace? Peace is when you sleep with open windows on the beach. Peace is when you clear a 100 million tax free. Peace is when you fuckin' with me"" "
The Defiant Ones,"It's interesting, but it really feels like a very long commercial. "
The Defiant Ones,I am a fan of hip hop therefore I shall add this to my viewing list. 
The Defiant Ones,All caps or bolded titles are obnoxious conventions that need to die.
The Defiant Ones,"I admit this might be a stupid question but: Does this have anything at all to do with the 1958 classic film starring Sidney Poitier? Because that's been confusing me. If it isn't related, is there a reason for reusing a fairly distinct title?"
The Defiant Ones,What is this and should I be watching it? 
The Defiant Ones,I watched the first part and did not like it. It jumped around too much and the editing was too frantic for my tastes (for a documentary). I'll get around to watching the other parts. Maybe will have a different opinion then.
The Defiant Ones,"I put the first episode on for a laugh, it ended up being pretty interesting.  still turned it off after ten minutes or so but it held my attention better than the trailer would make it seem"
The Defiant Ones,"Ultimately though I found it pretty hilarious. Beats is a business success, but my impression of the actual brand (based on stuff I read online) is that the headphones are super overpriced and emphasize bass too much. Apple Music I don't know anything about and assume is not nearly as successful as Beats. 

Jimmy was all about the success of the business side of things, and clearly he pulled it off with beats regardless of the quality of the product. I didn't really see it as an advertisement, just one-sided story telling. Still a great series."
The Defiant Ones,"To be fair it was a rather thinly veiled ad for Beats from the first 3 minutes. The whole doc was about these guys coming from nothing and becoming billionaires. Beats by Dre were the catalyst for them going from millionaire music moguls to truly successful businessmen. 

One thing that really bugged me though was how everyone was praising Jimmy for marketing Beats like it was his idea to have celebrity/athlete endorsements. He's far from the first to give celebrities free samples to establish brand recognition. He just happened to do it while instagram was becoming popular. Other than that I loved the whole doc. "
The Defiant Ones,"I loved Em on this, ""Fuck this Beats thing"". And relating it to his I need a Doctor video which holds a soft spot in my heart but the product placement in it always makes me cringe. Glad to hear he was just as frustrated. "
The Defiant Ones,"> Jimmy Iovine

~~He was played by Paul Giamatti in the movie right?~~

Edit: Apparently not. Giamatti played Jerry Heller. Thanks u/StencilMunky42 for enlightening me. 
"
The Defiant Ones,"Same dude, they blew right past that. Then did 2 minutes on Gaga and 45 seconds on K.dot"
The Defiant Ones,"Yup, needed more 50 and The Game. I wonder if they didn't want to be a part of the doc for some reason because I don't remember them being interviewed at all."
The Defiant Ones,I laughed when it cut to the wu-tang guy in a ninja mask. 
The Defiant Ones,"Totally my feeling as well, and almost zero 50 cent, that was weird as well, for me they could have dropped a load of the beats-related stuff in ep 4 and focussed more on Em but oh well"
The Defiant Ones,"I also kind of felt like they glossed over Chronic 2001 - that album was huge at the time, at least I thought - it's still one of my all-time favorites."
The Defiant Ones,"The problem is that the whole thing turned out to just be a marketing scheme for Beats and Apple Music. At the beginning they handle the presence of their current business ventures as just a part of their story as self-made billionaires, but it doesn't end that way. Throughout the series they'll sprinkle in Beats headphones here or a conveniently placed speaker there, and by the end, about 90% of the final episode is dedicated to talking about Beats and Apple instead of the music.

It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth how these guys built themselves off the backs of artists like Eminem, NIN, 50 Cent, Kendrick, and whoever else, but push them all aside so they can trick the audience into watching a commercial for their product. It's like the last song off of GKMC, ""Compton,"" in which Dre feels the need to namedrop his headphones. Like, for fucks sake guy. It's so incredibly tacky to blemish art by injecting product placement like that, and so disrespectful to the consumer. For the years to come, one of the most important hip hop albums of the decade will always be marked with a stupid little plug for some headphones at the end on a song that doesn't even belong on the record.

That episode in particular, but really the documentary as a whole, and especially the product placement behavior, really just sends the message that these guys don't give a shit about the messages behind their music. It's just such a shame to watch a documentary about how ""Mr. Fuck The Police"" has turned into a man only out to rob his audience with poor quality headphones over the years."
The Defiant Ones,"The whole Beats by Dre section was a little off-putting, but it's part of their story. It definitely showcased the power of marketing. "
The Defiant Ones,[deleted]
The Defiant Ones,[deleted]
The Defiant Ones,eyeveen
The Defiant Ones,Yeah it was absolutely incredible besides the Beats by Dre section. It made Dre come across as disingenuous when he was giving the presentation on how technically good the headphones are. But it was interesting to see how strategic marketing can make a product wildly successful.
The Defiant Ones,Why do they defeat the purpose of headphones? Have you ever tried them?
The Defiant Ones,Easy
The Defiant Ones,"Came googling the same thing, what the fuck HBO..."
The Defiant Ones,I think it's supposed to be implied that it was a lyric from the Detox project before it was scrapped.
The Defiant Ones,It sounds familiar because it’s a rip off of B.I.G’s “What’s  Beef”
The Defiant Ones,"No. I don't think the title is that distinct. 

The title refers to the attitude of both Iovine and Dre when they were just starting out. Defying rules and ""safe"" plans/ideas, etc."
The Defiant Ones,"It's a 4 episode documentary series about Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. I thought it was fantastic, and would definitely suggest it. Especially if you're a fan of hip-hop at all."
The Defiant Ones,The stories meet up eventually
The Defiant Ones,You may have a mental disorder
The Defiant Ones,"They are overpriced for quality, but you are paying for the brand. Some people look for the latter."
The Defiant Ones,Well there's a reason Apple bought Beats. And Apple Music is plenty successful. It's just an extension of iTunes really and they'll be around pig after Spotify is gone. 
The Defiant Ones,"Or like when someone showed Iovine Napster and he said ""we're screwed"" to other record execs. Their response was ""He predicted it!"" ... No he saw worldwide sharing of music circumventing their entire revenue stream and said it was bad for their industry... Not really an earth shattering ""prediction""...

There were a fair amount of moments where I was rolling my eyes, but like I said, still a good watch, especially the earlier part of their stories and the rare footage from those days."
The Defiant Ones,Paul Giamatti played Easy E's Manager Jerry Heller.
The Defiant Ones,"50 is a producer and actor on a show on Starz. (A highly underrated show, by the way.)  Might be a conflict with appearing on an HBO show?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(TV_series)"
The Defiant Ones,"'I'm pretty sure Wu-Tang was prepared."" That was the best line in the whole doc, haha."
The Defiant Ones,"""I assume Wu-Tang"" was prepared. Hah"
The Defiant Ones,"Yeah, they glanced over 50 Cent's discovery completely. Not sure why, he's a huge part of Aftermath and was the biggest rapper on the planet for years."
The Defiant Ones,I agree. I wish the 4th episode focused a lot more on 50 cent and Eminem and less on the beats. But the first 3 episodes were amazing. 
The Defiant Ones,"Would have liked to see more 50cent too.... that is one smart dude when you actually hear him talk, some good insight to rap or just marketing and business in general. "
The Defiant Ones,I wonder if 50 didn't want to be involved for some reason because I was surprised how they glossed over his career. 
The Defiant Ones,"This. 2001 was the first album I ever bought. I really wish they would have gone super in-depth on the recording process/music videos/marketing. Regardless, I was blown away by the documentary."
The Defiant Ones,"Thank you!  I agree completely.  The production value of the video and editing was top notch, but read between the lines and the message was garbage.  These guys are shameless promoters and exploiters.  I got done watching and thought this is not a documentary, it just bounced around and didn't complete any thing.  I said to myself, that was just a commercial and I am sure we will see tours and albums dropping in the weeks to come by NIN, U2, Dre, etc.  And what have those ""artists"" referenced done lately?  Seriously, Ice Cube plays the stern dad on movies, 50 cent is selling water, Snoop Dog makes crappy cameos and I see him on cooking shows with Martha Stewart.
Beats headphones.  What a joke.  Do a search on the quality and everything tells you it's all just cheap plastic made for the masses with mediocre sound quality.
I thought the whole Defiant Ones was garbage and I saw a pattern or rich white guys puling the strings of promotion and exploitation.  Don't waste your time.
"
The Defiant Ones,Thanks man. Also thanks for the relevant user name.
The Defiant Ones,"Stick. Stick. Stick. 

As a big Bruce fan I found this hilarious and not at all surprising. "
The Defiant Ones,THank you. I swear some people being interviewed were saying LAVEEN
The Defiant Ones,A sad fact about modern day marketing.
The Defiant Ones,"As a professional musician for 40 years, I have also built and  worked in recording studios and tried every variety of headphones since I was 18. First rule of audio tech is you don't color the sound after it's been mastered by the artist and producer. To do so ruins the experience intended. Beats are bass heavy for the hip hop crowd. That's simply a no no. The sub harmonics are already in place on the recordings."
The Defiant Ones,[deleted]
The Defiant Ones,like someone replying to something from 5 months ago?
The Defiant Ones,Also why it's natural that Apple bought them 
The Defiant Ones,"Paying for the brand, plus it sort of depends what kind of music you listen to. If you listen to a lot of rap/hiphop, they are designed for that music. Otherwise, you don't really need them and there are other much better quality headphones if you're into other genres."
The Defiant Ones,"I think your post lacks a certain amount of judgement on the latter people you mention.  

People that buy Beatz™ think they *are* getting quality because of the brand.  They saw the commercial with the cool guy doing the thing. They are being duped.  Quality and Brand generally go hand in hand.  IE good car companies Brand is so valued because they make good cars.  

The mix of new age marketing and consumerism and people with too much money is a perfect mix for a company like Beatz™ to capitalize and sell *mediocre* products based on *good* brand.  But if you're dumb enough to fall for it I can't blame Dr. Dre.

Also, they're paying for the status (which is kind of laughable considering I don't think anyone thinks you look cool with your Beatz™ on).

What's the difference between a $5,000 watch and a $10,000 watch?  $5,000.

"
The Defiant Ones,"Exactly this. You gotta expect that the interviewees are gonna embellish a bit and the producers of the documentary are gonna be on Jimmy's nuts throughout but the constant applause for the obvious got old.

Jimmy is still a major influence on music as we've come to know it today. It was awesome seeing the side of the industry I don't know a thin about. But some of the praise was over the top. ""Jimmy thought, 'let's monetize music on the Internet' and everyone fell outta their chair like, 'why didn't I think if that!?'"""
The Defiant Ones,"Ah, thanks for the correction!"
The Defiant Ones,"You know what, I guess 50 and Iovine had a falling out and don't speak any more. I wasn't aware of that. http://www.bet.com/news/music/2014/04/28/50-cent-jimmy-iovine-said-he-doesn-t-like-me.html"
The Defiant Ones,That show sucks. Hard.
The Defiant Ones,"I know it's been 4 years since your comment but I just got The Defiant Ones on Blu Ray the other day and watched it.

It was great but I wished it could have been a truly definitive documentary, like 8-10 hours long and literally told the story of everything regarding Jimmy and Dre. Have a whole bunch of interviews lasting longer than a couple minutes with the artists who have intertwined with them and go more in depth about Manson, No Doubt/Gwen, Trent/NIN, and more. 

I understand that not everybody would have the time for an in-depth interview or there may have been some falling out with some people though.

I wish we got documentaries that are crazy long like 6+ hours, it was already episodic so why not go the extra 8 miles, you know?"
The Defiant Ones,"I don't know if I'd go that far. It was definitely an interesting documentary about the success of Dre and Iovine, but I just wish they were more up front about the purpose of the documentary. [Rewatch the teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HlKqILwbSg). It was clearly marketed as a documentary about the the controversial music and artistic statements they and the artists they've worked with have made over the course of their careers. It's even titled ""The Defiant Ones,"" as if we're going to get a story about how these guys fought the system and changed the world for the better. They draw you in with social issues only to tell you to your face about how they exploited controversy to make money off of you, whilst simultaneously shoving Beats product placement down your throat. I think Trent Reznor even at one point says something like ""did we know we were using shock value to get attention? Absolutely."" When they leave stuff like that in but don't really bother to address the messages behind their music and whether they've influenced the world for the better, it comes off to me like ""Fuck Tha Police"" was just a tagline to sell records.

If they just wanted to tell us their success story, I don't see why they couldn't have done that instead of acting like we were gonna get some other documentary about music's political role in the last thirty years."
The Defiant Ones,"Ah “rules”, beats are not marketed as studio monitors, they are not flat response mixing headphones, they are headphones that are meant to make people enjoy music more. Turns out people like bass, so they made a bass heavy headphone, and turns out people love that shit. 

Just like people love instagram filters rather than taking photos that are “true to what the image looked like in real life”. 

Your average person isn’t a photojournalist or recording engineer, they just want shit that looks good and sounds good, to them. "
The Defiant Ones,"Agreed. I singled out hip-hop because there was a larger focus on it, IMO. My favorite parts were the interviews with Trent Reznor, and pretty much everything about Jimmy working with Nine Inch Nails."
The Defiant Ones,I‘ve found that if I dont judge what people do with their disposable income I‘m happier and people are happier around me doing what they want.
The Defiant Ones,I disagree.
The Defiant Ones,"Just finished it this weekend and the NIN were some of my favourites too and also early NWA, and Source Awards 1995 (okay, pretty much everything except Beats by Dre ad of the final episode). I was hoping they would interview Marilyn Manson as he's pretty well spoken in interviews. Would be interesting to have heard him tell his story."
The Defiant Ones,Just not judging people in general unless they pose a threat or in your immediate vicinity is a good way to go
The Defiant Ones,To clear up confusion: this is on HBO in the US And Canada. It's on Netflix everywhere else. 
The Defiant Ones,"This is odd, this is HBO? They are in direct competition. 

I hope Netflix stops with this Netflix branding bullshit. Brand what you create not what you broadcast."
The Defiant Ones,How is this branded with the Netflix name when it's not actually Netflix?
The Defiant Ones,This is basically a 5 hour ego-stroking commercial for Beats headphones. Don't waste your time.
The Defiant Ones,I believe they brand “Netflix Original” for any content that they have exclusive distribution for in a given market. Perhaps a bit deceiving but I think much of television could be viewed the same way as most shows aren’t created in house completely. Many times the production side of a network or other will create a show and the broadcast side doesn’t want the show and it is sold to a competitor. I am by no means an expert on this but I think the first season of Kimmy Schmidt was an example of this. NBC created it and the broadcast division didn’t want it and it was sold to Netflix. Would love for someone more knowledgeable to chime in though.
The Defiant Ones,But it’s a trailer to watch it on Netflix. Why would they put ‘HBO’ on it? 
The Defiant Ones,Same way they do it with numerous other shows.
The Defiant Ones,"Because they own the exclusive broadcasting rights for the territories this trailer is aimed at. They do it with AMC's Better Call Saul here in Europe as well, for instance. "
The Defiant Ones," Naw. There’s some annoying Beats promo especially toward the end, but overall this is a well done, extremely fascinating doc about two giants in the music industry. "
The Defiant Ones,That's not true at all. The first 3 parts are actually interesting and informative. Only the last part is a commercial for Beats headphones.
The Defiant Ones,Found the Bose Marketing Team ;)
The Defiant Ones,"I think you’re right but I do wish they’d just call it Netflix Exclusive. Irritates me that people might think certain British shows (e.g Peaky Blinders, The End Of The Fucking World) are Netflix made.

I’d much rather know that I’m watching shows from various channels all over the world. And I'd rather the BBC/Channel 4 get the credit in people's minds."
The Defiant Ones,"Eh, there were some interesting parts about it, but the goal was to sell headphones."
The Defiant Ones,"No highs, no lows; must be Bose!"
The Defiant Ones,"Agreed. I thought the same thing about The Night Manager when it aired on AMC, people thought it was AMC created. I don’t know if this always went on before and Netflix has created an awareness of it or if it is in response to how NFX markets."
Alexa and Katie,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Alexa and Katie,"Neat. Thanks for this.

Space Force's stats are quite impressive for a show that only debuted a week ago."
Alexa and Katie,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.
Alexa and Katie,I’m surprised Ozark is that high

Alexa and Katie,Interesting to see containment show up.
Alexa and Katie,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Alexa and Katie,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Alexa and Katie,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Alexa and Katie,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Alexa and Katie,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Alexa and Katie,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Alexa and Katie,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Alexa and Katie,How about movies??
Alexa and Katie,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Alexa and Katie,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Alexa and Katie,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Alexa and Katie,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Alexa and Katie,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Alexa and Katie,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Alexa and Katie,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Alexa and Katie,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Alexa and Katie,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Alexa and Katie,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Alexa and Katie,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Alexa and Katie,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Alexa and Katie,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Alexa and Katie,[deleted]
Alexa and Katie,Pandemic boost
Alexa and Katie,He write it at the end of his post.
Alexa and Katie,Last 100 days
Alexa and Katie,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Alexa and Katie,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Alexa and Katie,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Alexa and Katie,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Alexa and Katie,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Alexa and Katie,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

I use this which considers all 3 to be exclusive international distribution deals.


Thank you for that other correction"
Alexa and Katie,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Alexa and Katie,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Alexa and Katie,That's why I thought you should know...
Alexa and Katie,[deleted]
Alexa and Katie,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."
Alexa and Katie,"Was kinda odd place to put it anyway.

Had to scroll all the way down to read what they meant then scroll up again.. :p"
Alexa and Katie,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Alexa and Katie,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Alexa and Katie,[deleted]
Alexa and Katie,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Alexa and Katie,"My god this is beautiful, thank you. 

Now we just need these services to allow us to create custom playlists so I can make a Thanksgiving episode playlist with all my favorite shows and shuffle through them."
Alexa and Katie,"Pretty sure I don't get enough time off for this list! 

Well done, OP."
Alexa and Katie,"Also for Frasier: “The Apparent Trap” (Season 7, Episode 9)"
Alexa and Katie,I’d like to nominate The League S3 E8 - Thanksgiving to be added to the list
Alexa and Katie,This is amazing! I tired to do something similar for Christmas last year with the shows on Hulu/Netflix. Like someone else mentioned I wish these services would let up build custom playlists.
Alexa and Katie,Give this OP a turkey.
Alexa and Katie,So is MST3K's Turkey Day just not a thing anymore?
Alexa and Katie,Get this guy a Pupper’s
Alexa and Katie,"Roseanne had some pretty classic Thanksgiving episodes (from the original run, before she lost her mind)"
Alexa and Katie,No Bob's burger's?
Alexa and Katie,Thank you for this and Happy Thanksgiving in advance!
Alexa and Katie,The Danish streaming service Viaplay just did exactly this for Halloween. I saw a custom playlist they made of all Halloween episodes of all TV shows they currently have.
Alexa and Katie,Or just get Plex
Alexa and Katie,I've just started watching Friaser for the first time and just got to this episode! What a show that still stands up!
Alexa and Katie,"They did one on Hulu this year for Halloween with Bobs burgers but it didn’t work correctly and just booted you back to the main menu for the show, then it disappeared right before Halloween! I was so bummed! We want holiday episodes streaming services! We want them all bundled so we can just hit play and drown in our holiday memories."
Alexa and Katie,It still is. They stream the marathon on their teotch channel now.
Alexa and Katie,I love the one where Bob has to keep buying a turkey because they end up in the toilet. His interactions with the guy at the store are hilarious.
Alexa and Katie,It's there between Jane the Virgin and Raymond
Alexa and Katie,Weird plex but okay.
Alexa and Katie,Oh you are so lucky to experience that for the first time! It’s easily my favorite show of all time!
Alexa and Katie,"I guess they meant why it's not included on *this* list. I suppose it's because these are Thanksgiving-themed episodes, and MST3K is a (albeit highly enjoyable) marathon of random episodes that's airing on Thanksgiving."
Alexa and Katie,Easier to read.
Alexa and Katie,WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALL CAPS
Alexa and Katie,I hate having to pause to try to make out somebody's text message in a show. They are doing the audience a favor.
Alexa and Katie,Yeah makes sense… it just feels so unnatural to see it like that
Alexa and Katie,"NOTHING, I‘M JUST A BIT SENSITIVE TO LOUD NOISE"
Alexa and Katie,Why? I have friends to text in full caps in real life.
Alexa and Katie,I think they're just yelling at you
Alexa and Katie,"Be careful, they can’t be trusted"
Alexa and Katie,That's Tiffani AMBER Thiessen thank you very much
Alexa and Katie,Kelly Kapowski is the most attractive person ever so I will tune in
Alexa and Katie,My childhood crush.
Alexa and Katie,Shaaaawing.
Alexa and Katie,I just learned she has a cooking show. That sounds like something I'd like to learn from.
Alexa and Katie,"multi-camera means laugh track right? Love Thiessen, though."
Alexa and Katie,"""Multi-camera""? As opposed to what?"
Alexa and Katie,"I don't know what multi camera comedy is, and I'm not sure I want to."
Alexa and Katie,Tiffani Thiessen has the roundest face in Hollywood.
Alexa and Katie,"was another show about ""quirky"" white girls necessary though?"
Alexa and Katie,"Actually sounds like she is playing the mom on a teen show.  People old enough to have seen her on Saved by the Bell, probably won't enjoy this one."
Alexa and Katie,[deleted]
Alexa and Katie,Whoa! Amber is the color of your energy.
Alexa and Katie,And what happened to her?? Surgery?
Alexa and Katie,[deleted]
Alexa and Katie,she chunked up tho
Alexa and Katie,Still is but she's entered milf mode now 
Alexa and Katie,She and the Pink Power Ranger were everyone's childhood crush. 
Alexa and Katie,"The list of guest ""stars"" on that show makes it worth watching if nothing else.  "
Alexa and Katie,She has had it for a few seasons. 
Alexa and Katie,"single camera

To expound a bit if you are interested, the multi camera set up was started by Desi Arnaz for the show I Love Lucy.  Since its inception its been widely used in television since the 1950's.  However many tv shows, mainly sitcoms, still used the single camera approach.(usually to save money on shooting a show).  Single camera TV shows has seen a resurgence since the 1990's even through the 2000's and 2010's.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_single-camera_situation_comedies) is a list of single camera situation comedies from the 1950's to 2017.  You can sort by years aired to find the most recent. "
Alexa and Katie,Is any show necessary lol what a silly comment. 
The Mechanism,from the makers of Narcos and Elite Squad? welp.. i know ill be watching this. 
The Mechanism,"Great trailer!
I'm sure that this series will be huge hit."
The Mechanism,Netflix’s new strategy: how many shows can we make about money laundering and drugs
The Mechanism,"That's a Brazilian production, unlike Narcos, so I wonder if they'll make a different edit with some characters speaking English for the interantional market, because in this trailer it was really the actor there speaking, Selton Mello. In the BR trailer he was speaking Portuguese. Or maybe he'll just dub himself for the English version, it's still very cool they got him to speak English for this trailer."
The Mechanism,Brazilian Robert Knepper
The Mechanism,very interesting.
The Mechanism,Netflix knows how to hit the right spot with these series 
The Mechanism,"this looks pretty cool and i love shows filmed in foreign big cities and seeing its from the creator of narcos, cant wait."
The Mechanism,/r/omecanismo :)
The Mechanism,"Looks good, but it seems like it's kind of following the same recipe as Narcos.  I hope it's just as good and not just another copy of it."
The Mechanism,Man I wished there was an elite squad 3
The Mechanism,"Except this one is real life, the biggest corruption network in world's history that affected, and still affects, millions of people."
The Mechanism,"He dubbed himself to speak English, but appears to be just him though."
The Mechanism,"Well, the Showrunner was Narcos' executive producer, and directed the first two episodes, so there will be similarities, since he set the tone for Narcos with his style."
The Mechanism,"The Mechanism is pretty much Elite Squad 3, from the looks of it. "
The Mechanism,Yeah I noticed it too. The result was pretty bad lol
The Mechanism,Fun fact: Wagner Moura (Pablo Escobar in Narcos) refused the lead role in this show because he supports some of the politicians who were caught in the corruption scandal. 
The Mechanism,"I really hope this show is good.. and for people not familiar with Padilha, you should really try his movies Elite Squad with Wagner Moura (Pablo Escobar)."
The Mechanism,Join us at /r/omecanismo
The Mechanism,So who’s playing Trump?
The Mechanism,Link is dead. Try [this different site](https://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/netflixs-new-show-perfect-middle-ground-narcos-ozark-613397)
The Mechanism,And then Netflix dissappears. 
The Mechanism,"I'm pretty sure it's more about the fact that the writer/director is very vocal about his opinions on the matter, that did not match wagners.

I really hope that's not the case but It feels like this show might be a bit biased towards the 'elite' side of things. That was probably what got him to say no.

Tbh i'm not sure myself about this show. Viewers should be cautious about actually taking things that happen in the show as facts. 

but If this is done right, ppl are in for one hell of a ride. Pls be neutral"
The Mechanism,"Well there's nothing Trump related here, but Obama is in the entertainment business now, so that's my vote. The only vote he gets from me.

Edit: wow downvoted by racists, who think a halfwhite man cant play a white man. Well I think Obama would do great, eat it racists"
The Mechanism,"With the good work that Padilha did with Tropa de Elite and Narcos, I am pretty confident that we will get a great show with an unbiased view.  Lots and lots of interesting stories to be told in a very delicate subject for Brazilians. I am very excited. "
The Mechanism,"The story is based on it though, it's not a direct adaptation. The president is a dude instead of a dilma, for example."
The Mechanism,"> I really hope that's not the case but It feels like this show might be a bit biased towards the 'elite' side of things. 

You are very wrong about it. The shows criticize all the parts. Take your time and watch it. "
The Mechanism,I heard he lost 63 pounds for the roll.
The Mechanism,/r/omecanismo
The Mechanism,"Damn, I'm pumped! Though I am a little concerned with the amount of English used in the trailer. Narcos did a great job of not having people use English when it made no sense within the story. I just hope its the same for this. Portuguese is a lot less common a language than Spanish so I could imagine an excuse coming from that point of view. "
The Mechanism,Can't tell if joke or didn't watch the trailer
The Mechanism,"I've found a value to convert:

- 63.0lb is equal to 28.58kg or 156.17 bananas"
The Mechanism,"Has a huge fan of ""Tropa de Elite"" / ""Narcos"" I'm so excited for this.

Cant wait :D"
The Mechanism,Wow. Never thought i would see the day where disney got control of pokemon. 
The Mechanism,Cartoon Network shoots itself in the foot again. They're obsessed with getting rid of any cartoon that could be seen as targeted towards boys
The Mechanism,"Wait, does that mean Disney XD will be the only kids channel to air two animes? "
The Mechanism,Having broadcast rights to Pokemon in America hardly means they have control over it.
The Mechanism,Disney had the rights to the older Pokemon movies (the Johto ones) back in the day.
The Mechanism,"Or heck, ANY action/anime content on their daytime schedule. 

I don't remember the last time I saw a promo promoting Saturday morning (or any morning). Does Bakugan still exist? "
The Mechanism,Incorrect.
The Mechanism,Unless something changed CN/Toonami has several. 
The Mechanism,"No, NickToons airs Yu-Gi-Oh and LBX."
The Mechanism,I know. I meant control over when and where it airs on television. I remember when pokemon was a saturday morning cartoon on channel 11. Then it moved to cartoon network. Now disney is its home. 
The Mechanism,[removed]
The Mechanism,They got the rights thru Miramax
The Mechanism,They did? 1-3 were the best ones. 
The Mechanism,"I looked it up recently. Turns out, after the first I think 2 seasons it was released straight to the US because in Japan the ratings tanked so bad. It had 4 seasons and was cancelled in 2012."
The Mechanism,What's the last specifically boys show that aired on the network?
The Mechanism,Pokemon barely even counts as it is.
The Mechanism,"Adult Swim technically, which owns Toonami, and not part of CN."
The Mechanism,How so?
The Mechanism,"I believe they had the rights starting from Pokemon 4Ever up to Destiny Deoxys, so I guess they had some of Johto and some of Hoenn."
The Mechanism,actually 4-7 from miramax a part of disney
The Mechanism,"Yikes! Well that series is now dead.

How about transformers? Or has that migrated to somewhere else? I know CN UK has it."
The Mechanism,"Ninjago?

Not the point though. Going with a broader appeal is just good business sense."
The Mechanism,Iirc The Hub has broadcasting rights to Transformers and other Hasbro IPs like MLP.
The Mechanism,Disney is managing to appeal to both boys and girls.
The Mechanism,Hasn't Cartoon Network been airing Transformers: RID?
The Mechanism,"To be honest, I'm not so sure. I remember watching all of Transformers Prime so I assumed it was the same for RiD."
The Mechanism,I watched it when it first came out and it was likable but the book is incredible and ties part of the story into the IT verse and another part into the dark tower book series.
The Mechanism,"I loved it. ""How do you think I get my meat this cheap?"" Was a great line."
The Mechanism,I liked the series quite a bit.
The Mechanism,I never finished the show because there were too many little changes that didn’t really hurt the plotline but annoy the fans of the book (I want goddamn Miss Mimi from the book!) but assuming it ends the same way as the book I hate hate hate the stupid time travel rules. It’s like Stephen King couldn’t think of a good enough reason that Kennedy surviving would make the world worse so he’s like “oh yeah also time travel breaks the world so any major change to the timeline will make the world worse regardless.”  Lame.
The Mechanism,"I really liked the show, just thought it didn't quite stick the ending. Great opener though."
The Mechanism,It is really solid. I suggested it to friends.
The Mechanism,"I enjoyed watching the show, and definitely have the book on my TBR list for whenever I get around to picking up a copy."
The Mechanism,"Excellent show, fresh idea, unique way it goes about things.

It could have been better e.g. ending etc. But still a very excellent show that I rewatch from time to time."
The Mechanism,"The book was amazing. The series, MEH. It’s so difficult to take a King product and put it in a different media without taking too many liberties. Green Mile, Shawshank, and Stand By Me all came from novellas so they were short enough originally to make that transition.  Plus they had perfect casting and direction."
The Mechanism,"Loved the audio book, HATED the Hulu show  D"
The Mechanism,You're being generous with that *okay*. Franco's mugging took me out of the show completely.
The Mechanism,"Loved the series but the book is great, specifically Jake and Sadie - in my opinion, so well written that I missed them when I finished."
The Mechanism,"Book blows it out of the water. 

It's frustrating because there are bits of the series that come *so* close, but then it wanders off again.

Plus, Franco. Oof. He does try but he's just not the right pick."
The Mechanism,I was hoping by 2063 they would able to write a date format correctly
The Mechanism,"I can't say I remember all the details because IMO it was pretty forgettable.

But from what I recall, I would not call it ""what if the past doesn't want to go down without a fight?"" I would call it ""what if you went back in time to save JFK but forgot what you were doing in the first place, and then got interested in a girl and sort of fumbled around at that for a while instead"".

Maybe I'll read the book, some people seem to like it."
The Mechanism,"The mistake they make is giving something like time (can’t remember what they called it here) a personality as well as God like powers. 

The story was great but the interference of the boogeyman is just silly."
The Mechanism,"I liked it a lot, watched it three times, it’s also a good love story too"
The Mechanism,"This show was the reason I signed up for Hulu and I didn’t even finish it. Can’t stand James Franco, didn’t like the changes they made."
The Mechanism,James Franco man what a bummer.
The Mechanism,"I loved the book and then decided to watch the series. After the first episode, I said 'fuck this' the first episode moves at such a break neck speed it becomes completely unrecognisable to the book and lost all of my interest."
The Mechanism,"It was beyond cringe bad, I couldn't even finish it. The acting was atrocious."
The Mechanism,"Was going to watch this.

Until I saw James Franco was in it."
The Mechanism,I like how they acknowledge that JFK was kind of a shitty president and everything went to hell in timelines where they saved him.
The Mechanism,"I enjoyed it, though I liked the book better. On a side note, another time travel story of King's I always liked was The Langoliers. (The movie was ok in a shlocky way, but the story I thought was a cool concept of the past just getting eaten up), King gets a lot of crap for his endings, but that man can write a character."
The Mechanism,The show’s last scene is almost identical to the book’s and I love it for that. Thinking about it makes me want to reread it lol
The Mechanism,"I don't think it ever aired in the UK, and since it's a Fox production, hopefully it pops up on Disney+."
The Mechanism,"This really was a great show. It's one of those time travel shows that even after a lot of time, I still think about."
The Mechanism,I read the book and couldn't stand the dumb pointless changes to the story
The Mechanism,I thought it was great until I read the book. Then I went back to give it a re-watch and found it unwatchable. You should absolutely read the book if you enjoyed the miniseries.
The Mechanism,how close is it to the book?
The Mechanism,"I didn't get past episode 2, maybe ill try again"
The Mechanism,"I had never seen that before. Pretty good story, and I watched it until the end. I like it when they don't turn in story-writing ability for the time-travel crutch. Thanks!"
The Mechanism,"it's excellent with a SUPER good ending (to avoid spoilers I'll just say ""dance"")"
The Mechanism,"I watched it and enjoyed it, but I think James Franco was badly miscast as the lead."
The Mechanism,It’s such a good show. I’m currently watching it!
The Mechanism,Wich is the platform that I can Watch that
The Mechanism,Had that '90s thriller feel to it. I really dug it.
The Mechanism,I really wish they included those parts. I get they wanted to streamline it and those parts of the book were the equivalent of a video game side mission but they were  great parts.
The Mechanism,The sex scene with him and Sadie is the cringiest thing I've ever read. No way King wrote that with a straight face.
The Mechanism,"> I watched it when it first came out and it was likable but the book is incredible and ties part of the story into the IT verse and another part into the dark tower book series.

According to King, all of his books take place in the same universe and can be tied together."
The Mechanism,"I wanted to say the exact same thing, the show was watchable but the book is so much better."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
SWORDGAI The Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Why is he Sonic
SWORDGAI The Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
SWORDGAI The Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
SWORDGAI The Animation,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
SWORDGAI The Animation,Never meet your heroes
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
SWORDGAI The Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
SWORDGAI The Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
SWORDGAI The Animation,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
SWORDGAI The Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
SWORDGAI The Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
SWORDGAI The Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
SWORDGAI The Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
SWORDGAI The Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
SWORDGAI The Animation,Never go full John K
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
SWORDGAI The Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
SWORDGAI The Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
SWORDGAI The Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
SWORDGAI The Animation,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
SWORDGAI The Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
SWORDGAI The Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
SWORDGAI The Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Ah geez 😳
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
SWORDGAI The Animation,100 years
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
SWORDGAI The Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
SWORDGAI The Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
SWORDGAI The Animation,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
SWORDGAI The Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
SWORDGAI The Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
SWORDGAI The Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
SWORDGAI The Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
SWORDGAI The Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
SWORDGAI The Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
SWORDGAI The Animation,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
SWORDGAI The Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
SWORDGAI The Animation,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
SWORDGAI The Animation,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
SWORDGAI The Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
SWORDGAI The Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
SWORDGAI The Animation,Yoga
SWORDGAI The Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
SWORDGAI The Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
SWORDGAI The Animation,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
SWORDGAI The Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
SWORDGAI The Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
SWORDGAI The Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
SWORDGAI The Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
SWORDGAI The Animation,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Requiem,"Disagree

Though Breaking Bad is easily one of my favorite shows, its main focus is on the production of drugs and not using them (though it does touch on this some)."
Requiem,Jennifer Connelly going ass-to-ass for drug money sure as shit sealed the deal on not doing drugs for me.
Requiem,"If anything, Breaking Bad is anti drug business, Requiem for a Dream is anti drug use."
Requiem,"TBH, if all my drug binges had ended in two hot ladies using a double dong, I'd still be using drugs."
Requiem,"requiem for a dream is too over the top to have any message for me.

it's a fun movie and very entertaining and stylish, but isn't particularly relatable from a drug use perspective IMO. they go from casual users to full blown selling your body and arms being sawn off. 

i found chrissy's journey in the sopranos and bubbles journey in the wire to be more accurate and relatable. 

shit, shane OD'ing on cocaine in eastbound and down hit me harder than requiem. traffic is pretty good too."
Requiem,"> its main focus is on the production of drugs

Its main focus is a man who decides to let his dark side run wild. The drugs are just his weapon."
Requiem,"You mean Requiem, the UK show? I don't recall that scene but I get why you're confused... it was a very confusing show."
Requiem,It was very confusing. Never even understood if it was cancelled or that was meant to be the real ending
Requiem,So confusing and ended on a cliffhanger.
Requiem,I remember hearing on Marketplace once that no indoor malls have been built in the U.S. since 2006.
Requiem,"As someone who graduated high school in 1986, the mall scenes brought back some fond memories."
Requiem,I thought they were giving a huge middle finger to the mall. They highlighted how it was ruining the small businesses and then reveal the Mayor put liens on businesses to help it get that space in the first place. And then it gets destroyed by a monster. It seemed like they were just shoveling dirt on the grave.
Requiem,"Have visited this mall many times, boy has it been fading away slowly. The mall has been dead forever and the butt of many jokes. One thing people are quick to mention here is that someone was literally murdered in a shut down resteraunt in this mall and they were simply ""missing"" for a while because no one ever went there and found a body."

Requiem,"Here's [a 1982 news special about a shopping mall in Kansas and the ""mall culture""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7zfJwQIsg) that brings out the nostalgia."
Requiem,"Near the end of this article, the writer starts to get sappy about the death of malls and how it's a sad loss because of the memories we could make. And the feeling of community.

Except, local downtowns are returning. And that's better. It's not like the feeling of belonging is disappearing. It's that it moved back to where it was before malls sprung up.

It's definitely interesting to see season 3 and be reminded of the 80's death of downtowns. But it's also a great reminder of how far we have come. The things about mall life, seen in Stranger Things, is something I now see when walking down main Street."

Requiem,"Well, to the extent a new mall hasn’t been opened since that piece was aired, [New Jersey](https://www.gq.com/story/five-billion-dollar-new-jersey-mega-mall-american-dream-meadowlands) is seemingly going to change that. 

Granted that’s an old article from 2015 and the project has seen its share of delay and controversy but as it’s pretty much in my hood, I can say that it’s been progressing faster in the last 6 months and maybe opening in the next year or so (some outdoor signage is already up for Saks)."
Requiem,Non-American here - why is it that way? Are malls dying in the US? I would say they are still very much alive in parts of Europe where I’ve been.
Requiem,"In New York, they just opened the 
brookfield place"
Requiem,"Orange Julius or bust!

There’s a great Dead Mall doc series on [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz4Un92pGNxQ9vNgmnCx7dwchPJGJ3IQ)

ETA this [blog ](https://gizmodo.com/11-photos-of-1980s-malls-that-will-like-totally-blow-yo-1461537182/amp) is also amazing. My friend shared this w me years ago. The mall I used to hang out in is in those pics."
Requiem,"Heck, as someone whose formative years were during the 1990s, the mall scenes bring back fond memories."
Requiem,"Shit, I graduated high school in the mid-2000s and the local mall was bustling with people.

They instituted a rule where teens couldn’t just hang out there and they started getting rid of seating areas and the mall just started to die."
Requiem,"I don't understand why they lost popularity to outdoor shopping centers (though online shopping has contributed to the decline of both). Maybe with global warming, indoor malls will make a comeback."
Requiem,[removed]
Requiem,I remember the glory days of Gwinnett Place Mall (where the filming took place). It area has changed dramatically since then!
Requiem,As a person born later than you I felt like the mall scenes were a cash grab because of course you can have airtime for many different brands
Requiem,it shows both the good and the bad malls brought brev
Requiem,"Spoiler Alert:







Stranger Things Season 4 will be set in a Walmart"
Requiem,"Haven’t they shown the good & bad? (I’m only on half of ep 5 pls no spoilers)

The focus on the mall is that it was built for the... R.... yano... though, so that’s why it might seem like the bad part wasn’t mentioned."
Requiem,That's just a backdrop to introduce Larry the Mayor.
Requiem,"Spoiler Alert [spoiler](#s ""Place gets destroyed by a monster"") I haven't watched that episode yet."
Requiem,Have no idea why you got downvoted for the truth. The Gwinnett mall is a hot mess.
Requiem,"it's crazy.  I remember when Gwinnett place was the Mall in North Atlanta, shinning and new.  Seeing Starcourt brought back some memories."
Requiem,"How is Mall of Georgia doing? When I moved here in 1999, it had just opened and was supposedly ah-may-zing. I went over on a Saturday, and it was ... just a mall."
Requiem,"*cough* if you're wondering where, it's where they have the the ""taco bell coming soon"" sign *cough*"
Requiem,"I live in a town with a mall that still does decently, and that's mostly because of teenagers."
Requiem,They loiter in Walmart and fast food parking lots near me.
Requiem,On their phones and computers playing Fortnight or browsing Instagram.
Requiem,"Holy shit, Oak Park! That mall is famous around KC. Still open I believe."
Requiem,"Stranger Things has always been about 80’s nostalgia. Malls definitely peaked in the 80’s, so it’s only fitting that they made it central to a season of the show."
Requiem,"Even so, this isn’t an ordinary indooor mall. This is a mall that’s suppose to also pose as a vacation destination. There are gonna be 2 theme parks I believe, an indoor snow mountain, theaters, and a bunch of high end businesses inside. Even though this mall will open, I don’t consider it a “mall” by any means"
Requiem,"Think the open date has been set for October. And that Marketplace article doesn’t take into account that many, many malls go through massive redevelopments."
Requiem,"Absolutely dying over here. They built a shitload of them in the 80s and 90s and over the years have deteriorated in popularity. Sure there's still some malls that are decently popular, but say a city used to have ten malls, only one or two of them are still relevant."
Requiem,"It really depends on the area and type of mall. The typical American mall is very cookie cutter, have the same stores and were anchored by large retail chains that are also dead or dying. Those malls keep losing more and more stores until they are just empty husks.

Near me, malls are thriving and expanding. The most notable mall just happens to be the largest one (by retail space). That mall just keeps growing and growing and is filled with a lot of high end retailers and unique stores. There is a more ""standard"" mall very close that also does fairly well. It doesn't survive because of its shopping experience, but because there are other interesting things to do there. There's an escape room type thing, lego land, lots of restaurants, etc. Then there are a few really large town center, outdoor malls that are just packed all of the time."
Requiem,"Not exactly dying. Just not as popular. The mall in my town is crazy busy and its a smaller town (appleton). But there just arent too many new ones and not as many, due to online shopping."
Requiem,"This is anecdotal but I live in a small town in Kentucky and we had a pretty large mall that thrived throughout my childhood. Now I’m 20 and I’d bet that 2 of every 5 storefronts are empty and most of the businesses have moved out because rent is way too high. I worked at a shoe store in that mall and we never got business, retail in general is struggling because of online shopping and the mall is reacting the wrong way by continuing to up the rent to make up for lost profit but it’s just pushing more stores out of the mall"
Requiem,Came here to plug Dan Bell. His videos are always great. Some are downright spine chilling.
Requiem,Outdoor malls are *a lot* cheaper to build and operate. So any mall in the last twenty years has been built as an outdoor mall. And newer malls usually do better.
Requiem,Because malls suck?
Requiem,"very moronic, johnny moronic. online retail will continue to kill malls"
Requiem,[deleted]
Requiem,Hurray for Michigan!!
Requiem,Maybe...a majority of the store fronts were from now defunct brands. So it really wasn’t a cash grad.
Requiem,"Yeah most of the scenes in the mall itself showed how fun malls are/were and how the kids would go there to just hang out and congregate. Even all the Russian conspiracy stuff sort of made the mall seem like a cool, interesting place where crazy things were happening.

Meanwhile, the stuff with the small businesses showed the historic  downsides of the mall, but I also sort of saw it as symbolic of current times, where malls are now dying and the internet is the place where kids hang out, people do all their shopping, and Russians plan to destroy the United States."
Requiem,And the big horror in Season 4 will be how low the prices are!
Requiem,It's also to let us know the pretzels aren't even that good.
Requiem,"Stranger things fans wanna believe this starcourt reality is out there I guess , and they can go check it out and see empty white walls and closed shops if they really wanna. I heard the Macy's shut down too and there are always wild rumors somethings gonna happen with the mall. Back like 4 or 5 years ago I remember people in school saying something crazy like they were gonna add a mini theme park or rides to it to bring back life to it lmao"
Requiem,"Well, it was always ""just a mall"" to me since I was a kid because I was too young to remember it's opening , but whenever I've gone it's been surprisingly busy and doing well for itself"
Requiem,"Mall of Georgia, Lenox, Phipps, and Perimeter are all doing fine. Not sure any others in the area are doing well. Probably Town Center is doing fine."
Requiem,"Or you know, at the park/beach/skate park/whatever. Despite people obsession with saying that teenagers only stays indoors behind a computer I still see plenty of kids roaming around in town like we used to."
Requiem,"And don’t forget a second food court that serves only kosher food. 

It’s really a one of a kind thing."
Requiem,But why? Have people decided they don’t like to do all their shopping in one place and go to several shops at  city center? Or is everybody just orders stuff online and there is little offline shopping left?
Requiem,"> Absolutely dying over here

everyone says that but everytime I got to the maill, the parking lot is packed and the inside if filled to the brim with people. i really don't see where malls are dying"
Requiem,[deleted]
Requiem,Almost creepier than  the Mind Flayer
Requiem,"They really do.  It also hasn't helped that every mall is devoid of any real character, they look and feel similar.  Main Street has made a comeback in many smaller cities and some towns because they are offering unique merchandise, and the shop and area have character."
Requiem,"I saw Walden Books and that hit me with nostalgia, I remembered standing in the one in the mall for ages looking at animorphs and goosebumps"
Requiem,"except ya know, the coke bit"
Requiem,"Damn, I just found out I work not even 5 minutes away from the mall. Guess it's not worth grabbing lunch over there?"
Requiem,"Definitely there's been a consolidation of shopping areas. Malls often survive in upscale locations where they have more luxury items and clothing people want to buy in person. But for the tons of malls in lower and working class areas, online shopping and big box stores (Walmart and Target) completed destroyed their purpose. The death of most department stores like Sears also helped speed malls decline since they were the primary tenants of indoor malls.

There's also the rise in [""lifestyle centers.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_center) The old enormous indoor mall has become uncool and bunkerlike, with long walks from parking if you want to visit just one store. So the lifestyle center reminds people of a vibrant walkable urban shopping district but with tons of parking. They are also more convenient for small trips because you can park right next to the store.

And just a personal note, online media completely killed malls for me. I used to go to the mall regularly to check out new movies, magazines, books, music, and video games. Now most of those are purchased digitally or streaming online. And for books its often easier to just use Amazon, though I still love checking out a Barnes and Noble on occasion."
Requiem,"It's a little of both. Obviously the convenience of the internet has significantly dented brick and mortar retail, so that's one reason malls have struggled. But malls were built to serve a suburban, car-oriented generation who largely moved outside of city centers. The younger generations tend to want to live in the city and walk to shops, so malls aren't as popular as they once were. Many neighborhoods in US cities were bulldozed and replaced with malls and giant thoroughfares in the 50s, only for those changes to be reversed and the street grid rebuilt more recently. It's an interesting trend."
Requiem,"Rent in the big malls is very expensive. With declining sales due to online shopping, most smaller companies can't afford it anymore."
Requiem,"The ""Main Street"" style of shipping mall has become the new thing.  At the very least, this is what I've seen and heard from others.

It's still a mall, but it's set up like a town center.  All the stores have their own building/space.  All the walking is it doors.  

It's basically a strip mall but reconfigured to better fit the space.

It has some anchor does, but also caters to small, local businesses.  

The old malls are filled primarily with clothing stores, so there really isn't a way to get all one's shipping done there."
Requiem,"You ignored the second part of my comment. I'm not saying every mall in the US is a ghost town, however a significant number of them have severely decreased in popularity for a number of reasons. Online shopping sure, but also the locations of the malls as well as the (mostly failing) business models of the anchor department stores play a huge role in the success of a mall.
[This article](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/26/why-these-malls-are-thriving-while-others-die.html) has some pretty good insight on the different factors at play."
Requiem,"lol, yeah, I remember seeing that one.  Still, the thing that he staged is nothing compared to the things people have noticed that Dan didn't seem to.  There was one location where he went both day and night that clearly had someone living there."
Requiem,"I dunno, some of the video where it's fairly evident that he's creeping around an abandoned structure someone is hiding out in makes me more nervous than the Mind Flayer.

&#x200B;

Edit: linked to where Dan becomes aware that it sounds like there are people living in the house.  He also went to this location during the day and didn't notice things around him that people call out in the comments.  Someone standing in a doorway when he is going up the stairs for example.

&#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/a8DdlxbrBV0?t=1087](https://youtu.be/a8DdlxbrBV0?t=1087)"
Requiem,"Same. My memories of the mall are from the late 80s and early 90s...was a kid around 9 or so. Walden Books, The Disney Store, Thomas Kinkaide, Mrs Fields Cookies, Auntie Ann’s Pretzels, KB Toys, B Dalton, Sam
Goody, Warehouse, Tower Records, Warner Brothers Store, EB Games, Discovery Store...the list goes on."
Requiem,Sam Goody got me.
Requiem,That’s pretty normal there. I wouldn’t say it was out of the ordinary. Product placement is all over the place. The mall in Season 3...not so much.
Requiem,The New Coke bit wasn't much different to the KFC bit in season 2 when Nancy and Steve go to Barb's parents' house.
Requiem,Which didn't take place in the mall.
Requiem,There's some cool places to eat in the surrounding areas but I think the food court itself is barren :(
Requiem,"I was there for another Netflix production. I'd say it's worth driving over if only to get a pic of the entrance, but the rest of the starcourt interior is blocked off. I think nearly dead malls are fascinating though so if you're curious, go for it. It's remarkably preserved."
Requiem,"I actually still have a growing Blu-ray collection so I love going to FYE or Best Buy to see what new releases or collectible steelbooks are available, but other than that or to buy records at FYE, I never go to the mall either 

Online shopping is so much easier for me because I can pretty much find anything I want"
Requiem,I went anyway. They have the whole food court blocked off and you can't really see anything. The mall is suuuuper run down though.
Requiem,"Interesting, my FYE now has a rack of about 10 vinyl albums and a small DVD/BR section and a bargain bin. The other 3/4 of the store is pop culture tshirts and other memorabilia."
Requiem,Food court might be blocked off due to circumstances with that murder thing I mentioned earlier. I think there's a mega mart next to the mall if you want dumplings or Asian snacks or something though !!!
Requiem,"Ours is full of those things too but the vinyl section is pretty huge and the store itself is structured around all of the used DVD’s and Blu-rays in rows that take up most of the space 

We don’t have any local record shops in my town unfortunately so I buy all my records here either online, at FYE, or at Books a Million

When I’m at college, there are a lot of great record shops in the area but that luxury doesn’t exist here"
Requiem,"> 'Dark Matter' is based on the novel by Blake Crouch, who is writing and showrunning the series.

First season of 'Wayward Pines', also based on a novel by Blake Crouch, was great, so I'm going to give 'Dark Matter' a shot. 

On a side note, this is the 3rd show on Apple TV+ that has a simialr title to an older TV show: Invasion, Surface, and Dark Matter."
Requiem,"Wish the other Dark Matter, never got canceled, such a shame"
Requiem,"> In this labyrinth

> Connelly 

I see what you (probably unintentionally) did there, Variety."
Requiem,Loved this book! Recursion was wild as well
Requiem,Nice. I am a big fan of Blake Crouch. I just finished his new book a few weeks back.
Requiem,Is this going to be filmed in Chicago?
Requiem,God I fucking love Joel Edgerton. Triple threat
Requiem,"Noted smokeshow, Jennifer Connelly"
Requiem,I highly recommended Crouch’s new book Upgrade for anyone who liked Dark Matter.
Requiem,That multiverse idea sounds like a really cool concept. Reminds me of Primer.
Requiem,I read the book which was really good. I always thought it would make a good movie or TV series. Glad to see Hollywood agreed.
Day and Night,"They used to put all their stuff online for free, people stopped watching and they found its cheaper just to air reruns on The Office and shit like that (many channels have switch to this format though, not just CC). Viacom mostly abandoned the channel in like mid-2010s except The Daily Show."
Day and Night,"Cheaper and easier to buy or rerun proven content, than develop new stuff."
Day and Night,History Channel is pretty much the same. Swamp People. American Pickers. Pawnshop.  Ancient Aliens.  With the occasional holiday special about WWII.
Day and Night,"What happened? People stopped watching the channel regularly. You, yourself, said you stopped watching years ago. So, the only people who are left love these blocks. They put them on as background noise. Everyone else has turned to streaming. Netflix has really grown as the place to have stand-up specials now."
Day and Night,"90s Comedy Central was so awesome. Dr Katz, Kids in the Hall, Strangers with Candy, constant stand up specials, and early South Park."
Day and Night,MTV plays nothing but Ridiculousness
Day and Night,Comedy Central has added Seinfeld to their rotation now.
Day and Night,"Same thing that happened to Mtv.  Cable networks that made their name catering to the teen/20-something set were hurt pretty hard when that demographic dropped pay cable tv.  They survive by cutting most of their original programming except for maybe a few shows that are dirt cheap to produce and then just running lots of reruns and movies.  It gets enough eyeballs to justify keeping them around and collecting the cable fees, but their brands have lost all cultural relevance."
Day and Night,TruTV is the Impractical Jokers and March Madness channel
Day and Night,I remember thinking they were too repetitive in the 90s when they constantly played National Lampoon's Vacation and Back to School. Little did I know those were the golden years.
Day and Night,"as ratings for networks started getting lower, so did the ad rates. and almost all cable networks started trimming fat and only airing shows they know people would watch reruns of excessively in a desperate attempt to get more viewers and ad revenue back. that's why comedy central depends on South Park, Seinfeld, and The Office, why MTV depends on basically ridiculousness alone (and new episodes of their other shows), and so on.

over the years, with the declining budgets and mergers, Comedy Central has also lost much of their original content. South Park has influenced them to make most of their originals animated content, including a revival of Ren and Stimpy and some meh Colbert stuff like Tooning Out the News and Fairview. and even then Paramount+ takes some of those shows for themselves, like the new Beavis and Butt-Head. they also decided making comedy movies is cheaper than making live action shows, and have committed to doing that recently. they're at least still committed to The Daily Show, even with Trevor Noah leaving and a concerning year where they moved to a tiny studio with no audience.

they seem to have some scripted live action shows still but not much. they willingly gave some, like The Other Two and South Side, to HBO Max where they seem to be doing a lot better. seem like Crank Yankers and Awkwafina's show are still around. rip detroiters."
Day and Night,"Viacom. Literally the worst.was always bad, but theast time I was in a hotel noticed MTV is just ridiculousness now 24x7"
Day and Night,"It's the same on all channels. I used to love Cartoon Network in the 90s and 00s. About 3 years ago I tuned in for the first time in years and it was just Teen Titans Go all day long. That is literally all they were playing.

Cable is in a very sad state nowadays. Not worth the hundreds of dollars it costs a month."
Day and Night,I think getting rid of all the Stand Up related material was a huge factor.
Day and Night,The show Corporate was actually REALLY good. They made that. Unfortunately it cancelled.
Day and Night,"Viacom killed it slowly. The channel used to have a lot of dedicated comedy people/programmers there, at its peak programming was pretty great IMO. Then mergers, that staff was stretched more and more across may channels (MTV, Spike, etc.) as the model of reruns/nostalgia took over. They got less and less into original programming and got run out on the stand-up specials from competitors. Netflix really went hard outbidding them for a lot (who would later themselves stop doing). 

Then, the axe was then dropped a couple years ago when a large chunk of remaining staff was let go. It's now like a lot of the other Viacom channels that have a more profitable business model in reruns. Any new/original programming that might've originally aired there now tends to go to Paramount+."
Day and Night,"Now now, they also have dildo commercials at 430am."
Day and Night,Remember when all the comedians used to get together and roast a celebrity? Lisa Lampanelli would joke about how she likes to bang black dudes.
Day and Night,A major chunk of my youth was spent watching stand up specials and reruns of kids in the hall and snl. I think it all went to shit after Chapelle left. John Stewart leaving was the nail in the coffin.
Day and Night,I notice this as well about twice a year when I happen to be in a hotel room. I always end up watching it too because I’d rather watch South Park or the office reruns then duck dynasty or whatever else is on.
Day and Night,"The death of cable. These channels will all be bought up soon and eventually die out with the popular remnants IP being kept. 
TVs will just become large internet connected monitors that play “apps” aka channels. Like peacock, YouTube, hbo, Disney/Hulu, Prime, etc. 
so all these cable networks will eventually get bought by the big “apps” and we will end up where we started when TV has like  7 “channels” that host all these programs / legacy channels"
Day and Night,"Remember when South Park was not allowed to air before 11 PM because it was 'too vulgar' for TV? I had to stay way past my bedtime to catch a glimpse of an episode. It was like a challenge to sneak up and watch it without parents noticing. I remember catching, like, half an episode and talking about it the next day at recess. It was like a TV phenomenon back in the day. That wacky vulgar cartoon that airs in the middle of the night.

Now it just airs in blocks during the afternoon. Times have changed."
Day and Night,And the ads last so much longer than I remember now too!
Day and Night,"Comedy Central is where I discovered the masterpiece that is *Idiocracy* (secret stash, uncensored)"
Day and Night,"Streaming. Binge watching. 

They're literally mimicking the viewing habits of a whole generation."
Day and Night,"Most channels do this now.

MTV = ridiculousness and catfish 

TruTV = impractical jokers 

USA network = law and order svu"
Day and Night,"""I watches cable for the first time in years today""  
  
 You answered it yourself. Streaming happened to it"
Day and Night,Reruns of The Office and South Park all day and night? Damn.... I might have to get cable again.
Day and Night,Why use many show when few show do trick?
Day and Night,"That's funny, Comedy Central *started* by showing Benny Hill and Monty Python all day. In between the random stand up and Penn Jillette doing all their voice work. Time is a flat circle."
Day and Night,"Viacom has been doing this for years with their networks (MTV, Comedy Central, etc.) They do it because it’s cheaper to air something already paid for, and because they get decent numbers, still, while airing the same old crap. They know cable is dying out so they’re spending the money on streaming services and content for streaming services."
Day and Night,That's not true! ^(sometimes they play an episode or two of Futurama and the Cleveland show)
Day and Night,Cable TV is surviving only because of live sports.  Once people find alternatives for those en mass expect cable to just straight up stop being something you can get except in certain markets that have limited internet access.
Day and Night,"If you think that’s bad, MTV plays Ridiculousness 24/7."
Day and Night,"I was recently watching Broad City and realized that although it felt like just yesterday,  all these original scripted comedies just kind of disappeared one day off cable TV"
Day and Night,"Video killed the radio star. Netflix killed the cable star. 

Netflix is the Walmart of streaming services. Come in cheap with some new ideas, drive everyone out of business, hike prices and churn out mostly crap but we just accept it."
Day and Night,"What happened is during the pandemic, they cut costs by immediately canceling all live-action content they were producing at the time, so now they're basically relying on scraps."
Day and Night,I wish there was a 24/7 Three Stooges channel
Day and Night,Wait til OP tries to watch music videos on MTV
Day and Night,Broadcast television sucks now.  I can’t tell you the last time I watched a new show or tuned in live to watch something (other than sports).
Day and Night,Out of all the channels on TV to complain about Comedy Central is one of the last ones. Always my go to Channel when there is nothing on
Day and Night,"It’s like the History Channel, it only airs Pawn Stars anymore"
Day and Night,"Why does the IFC (Independent Film Channel) show reruns of Everyone Loves Raymond, Two and a Half Men, etc…such a waste."
Day and Night,Let’s just say TLC isn’t The Learning Channel anymore and CMT doesn’t hardly ever play country music videos anymore
Day and Night,"It's the same thing happening to all cable channels. Last I checked, Cartoon Network was nothing but Teen Titans Go, Gumball, and maybe Craig of the Creek."
Day and Night,TV died.
Day and Night,"Went to the inlaws over xmas, the internet was so bad we were forced to watch cable TV. I've never had a worse headache in my life watching cable TV with non stop scam commercials and with very small segments of crappy TV shows pushed in-between them. I'm surprised cable TV even still exists"
Day and Night,"I KNOW!

I stopped watching much television several years ago, and earlier last year I happened to end up in a room with a television with nothing to do, so I turned in to Comedy Central, and was shocked to find that they just played nothing but blocks of the exact same show for like the whole day. It was like USA(which also used to have a bunch of variety).

I didn't even give Comedy Central another chance. It wasn't worth it."
Day and Night,"I’m still pissed they pulled Tosh.0 off the air. It was the only show I watched, and they claimed it was because they were moving towards animation, which is bullshit, because since then they’ve given Charlemagne and Stephen Colbert shows"
Day and Night,"Cable TV is just crap nowadays. Every channel has scaled back the variety to just one or 2 specific themes and just run the same shows all day, every day. Between that, and the apparent gutting of the major streaming services, the amount of good content has dropped dramatically in the last few years"
Day and Night,"Remember Dr. Katz? Viva Variety? The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn? It was such a unique channel, but it grew up fast. I miss the old days too."
Day and Night,"MTV is just Ridiculousness, like right now, turn it on, there it is, ridiculous."
Day and Night,MTV is even worse. Total waste of a 40 year cable flagship. All they play is ridiculousness for 14 hours a day with some catfish the show sprinkled in.
Day and Night,"If this is true, then I am exactly their target demographic"
Day and Night,All the good stuff has gone to streaming these days.
Day and Night,Cable is dead. Long live cable (streaming).
Day and Night,Wait until you find the Ridiculousness channel (MTV).
Day and Night,"same thing happened to most cable channels, they stopped creating new content because the reruns are getting viewers. The Daily Show hasn't been the same since Jon Stewart left so they quit rerunning it throughout the day and they never replaced Colbert so they have crappy shows that no one wants to see and reruns so they run the reruns. I admit, I still watch The Office on there and Seinfeld. I got sick of South Park reruns over the pandemic but people are still watching them all day long. Hopefully, they get a big hitter to take over The Daily Show and get new episodes of Drunk History and bring in a new sketch show or two. If you look at the other cable channels, it's even worse. The History Channel doesn't even show WWII shows anymore, it's nothing related to history, like MTV never showing anything related to music or what has happened to my beloved Science Channel which now shows about 10 hours of science a week and the rest of pseudo-science, conspiracy and paranormal. Hell, I used to love this channel called Bravo because it showed Operas and now all it shows are these ""Real Housewife"" trainwrecks and who remembers The Learning Channel that was a government cable channels about educating the people and now it's just ridiculous stupid ""Hey look at fatso"" shows and disgusting shows. Cable is dying because they let it. Streaming is getting old fast because there are too damn many of them. Some rich assed company like Apple should just buy Netflix, Amazon, Time Warner,  Paramount and Hulu and combine them into one service."
Day and Night,"Outside of Detroiters (which they only gave 2 seasons), I can't even remember the last great new original program for the channel."
Day and Night,Cable TV is dead.
Day and Night,"All cable television has become garbage. It is either reality shows (A&E, History, Discovery, etc) or just syndication rerun marathons.

There isnt enough money to be made in advertising anymore to fund real productions, especially for a channel like Comedy Central.

The focus has switched to streaming platforms. That is where the money is, which the channels can collect directly from user subscriptions instead of dealing with a cable company and advertisers. And that is where all the original programming has moved to."
Day and Night,"Wait until you watch MTV, they just air Ridiculousness over and over again until the end of time"
Day and Night,">What the heck happened to Comedy Central? **I watched cable for the first time in years today** and they were literally only playing The Office and South Park all day (and night) long.

Many people like you, not watching cable for years, is the answer. Viewership down = No money to make the things they used to make. Reruns are keeping the channel alive to continue to produce the few things they still can make. When the time comes that both South Park and The Daily Show come to an end, Comedy Central will have no function except to rerun old content. It will become a husk of its former self, just like MTV which now just runs Ridiculousness episodes over and over all day, every day and almost nothing else."
Day and Night,"The Office is the most streamed show on Netflix, making up 7% of its traffic, and Netflix consists of 15% of the total traffic on the Internet.  They simply realized that the only thing people really *want* to watch is The Office, so they ran with it."
Day and Night,It’s my fault. I leave the Office on in the background while I work.
Day and Night,"my girlfriends mother still has cable television and it is the most fascinating thing to me. All week leading up to NYE there was a west wing marathon that just never stopped. the thing is though there are commericals like every 30 seconds compared to just streaming it on HBO Max. i cant imagine all the time i wasted as a kid watching commericals, super depressing"
Day and Night,"I feel that is basically ever single cable channel these days. MTV is Ridiculousness all day. CC is the office all day. TLC is 1000 lb Best Friend/1000 lb Sisters/600 lb Life, IFC doesn't even show movies anymore, it's just syndicated network sitcoms for hours on end (Scrubs for 6 hours, Threes Company for 6 hours...). I don't even know who watches these channels like this anymore."
Day and Night,"They found that people ""watch"" more TV when they don't ""active watch"" but just leave it on in the background. They'll do this if there's something familiar and popular that's just playing repeat episodes for hours. This is why all of the cable channels do this now. I'm sure half of you have a girlfriend who just puts the channel on MTV or TBS or whatever for 4 hours while she does work in the background."
Day and Night,"Don't waste your time with TLC (the learning channel), you'll view nothing but trashy ""reality"" shows. Thousand pound sisters, Sister Wives, fake storage shows and too many more ridiculous drivel. In the olden days, one might LEARN something. Don't get me started on MTV."
Day and Night,"I watched Comedy Central nonstop from the mid to late 2000s. It sounds like nothing has changed.

They would play Office Space, Joe Dirt, and old, obscure comedies with actors that look really familiar but you're not sure from where like [Duplex](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266489/)."
Day and Night,They gave the people what they want.
Day and Night,"You taught them this, dad!

TBH, I watch it as background noise sometimes, but the house ads for RuPaul's drag race make me want to cancel my cable. 

Why the fuck am I getting like 10 house ads for the same thing on a channel that isn't the channel I'm watching. And the ads are geared towards people who might be interested, so they are disruptive and obnoxious as fuck (why the show is popular)."
Day and Night,"CC went downhill fast after Key & Peele was done. Viacom regrets letting Jordan Peele go, big time as they could have done more projects with him. Especially after the success of Get Out. Pretty sure that’s why they’re throwing a gazillion dollars at Taylor Sheridan. They don’t want to make that same mistake twice."
Day and Night,Tbf these are the best shows
Day and Night,"I mean, those are two hilarious shows"
Day and Night,"Back in the day TV would be the curation of a lot of taste and culture. Think how MTV brought us music and fashion. Comedy Central brought entertainment, standup, movies. Adult Swim brought our love of retro and weird/experimental cartoons. 

Now the internet and social media do all that stuff faster and cheaper. You can watch films and shorts and parodies and standup people spent years of their lives making and do so all for free one after another and never run out of new things to watch. But without the relevance and audience, they're not a packed bar every night. They're a dive bar people remember going to when they were younger and still check every now and then to see if it's open. So they're not going to invest in making a lot of original content. They're just Twitch live streams playing someone's Paramount + account. They're keeping the doors open so they can make The Daily Show."
Day and Night,"I have a wall mounted television constantly on in an outbuilding that used to be a pool house, now I use it as a greenhouse to stage my marijuana seedlings. I keep it on since I've misplaced the remote and I'm too lazy to get a ladder.

It's been tuned to Comedy Central for about 2 years now and you're absolutely right."
Day and Night,"Cable is dead also , its impossible for me to watch things with ads."
Day and Night,Carlos destroyed it. Haven't been back since rofl
Day and Night,"You answered your question when you said you stopped watching.

Everyone else did too."
Day and Night,"Tru TV plays practical jokers 24/7 while MTV plays ridiculousness 24/7, must be the modern day cable network."
Day and Night,"""Comedy Central is gone, I am what remains"""
Day and Night,cable television died
Day and Night,"Daily Show is the only thing keeping the lights on. Even then, they may need help finding a new host."
Day and Night,"Viacom thought they were the big dogs in negotiations with distributors when things went to the internet, and it became virtually impossible to stream in many areas or on my streamers for what seemed like a decade; South Park luckily was able to continue streaming on South Park studios and eventually Hulu. This also extended to even cutting off certain cable companies in major markets.

That hubris also extended to their brand being strong due to the daily show with Jon Stewart, South Park, chapelle show, and later tosh.0 amongst others lead to them investing less in production. 

A lot of the new talent and previous CC performers chased the money and exposure on streamers. Don’t forget that CC did chapelle dirty, and Zach Galafanakis was the first comedy special on Netflix, Bill Burr being early money too.

Eyes going to streamers dried up revenue, so they leaned on re-runs, low production cost shows (and even still took chances here and there such as spades show a few years back, though it was cut pretty quickly. Ironically his podcast was in the top 20 this year)

TLDR; They thought their brand was strong enough to be the HBO of comedy (ironic, since they kind of dethroned HBO as the “hour special comedy” channel but got out-businessed by other streamers, specifically Netflix who could pay high dollar for namesake comedians to establish themselves

Ironically, a lot of the “new class” of comedians are averting the streamers because the blank checks have dried up except for all but the top talent, ie paying chapelle $10s of mm per special. Comics with a name are now realizing the power of their own brand/social media following, ownership of IP and self publication, and overall control to not be “cancelled” and are either selling their specials/live podcasts through their website or just hosting them on YouTube."
Day and Night,Same that happened to Nickelodeon once it became The SpongeBob Channel.
Day and Night,I did this to you - OP
Day and Night,"Any time I've watched Comedy Central it's been terrible.

20 years ago, all they did was play Whose Line UK and Clue all day long.

10 years ago, all they did was play absolutely abysmal standup and roasts.

It's always been about finding cheap content to play all day long."
Day and Night,AS IT SHOULD BE
Day and Night,I never watch cable. When I stay at hotels I immediately change the channel to CC. Guaranteed South Park an office.
Day and Night,Idk but these are two of my top comfort shows. I hope it doesn’t change 😅
Day and Night,"Cable really is barren these days since streaming has gained the upper hand on viewership.

I think most of the strategy is playing on market share from people turning on programming randomly at a hotel/on vacation and hoping for something familiar, rather than any investment in new and creative content. 

Cartoon Network has also hit this same black hole of rerun suck, and it's such a dilemma for one of the channels that used to really challenge and innovate on content."
Day and Night,"I can’t watch either of these shows anymore because of this. I was in the hospital for 5 months in 2021 and Comedy Central was one of the 10 channels I got in my room. I watched The Office, South Park and Friends 24/7 because that was literally all that was on. I have PTSD just thinking about it."
Day and Night,"Uh, I literally have had this channel on for 5 hours, cam confirm. It's amazing."
Day and Night,"Rebrand it as, “Comedy Dumpster” or “Comedy Abyss.”"
Day and Night,"There’s been a handful of good, funny shows branded *Comedy Central* that I’ve streamed on Crave (or illegally,) like *South Side, Detroiters, The Other Two, Review, Broad City,* and obviously - *Nathan For You* but… 

Being owned by Paramount, I guess all their good shows are tied up in legally binding streaming rights?"
Day and Night,Watching workaholics with my friends after work will always be one of my fondest memories of Comedy Central. Netflix live action comedy can not compete period. MAYBE hbo but they're  kind of going out bad rn. All entertainment severely dropping in quality
Day and Night,They gave up on stand up then original programming cut down to just south park and the daily show.  They basically ended comedy central radio on Sirius XM too.  Netflix bought all the comedy basically.
Day and Night,Take me back to Craig Kilbourn and Viva variety
Day and Night,"Shoot, I might need to watch Comedy Central now."
Live,I’m not surprised when I saw how fast they had to turn around that Mario Kart sketch
Live,Health insurance isn’t THAT expensive for 12-20 people. Probably cheaper than the negative PR generated by a Variety article.
Live,But that's comedy's birthday!
Live,"One of the most recent post production sketch has an interesting tidbit. If you watched live, the mario sketch has different cgi then what they posted on YouTube later next morning. The biggest difference was the goombas, in live they had a more unique last of us look and the one on youtube has more pulled from the actual mario game look. So either they made two version and just decided to post a different version or they keep working on it late even after it aired."
Live,"Don't work on this show, but have done cable TV post production in the past. 

You have no idea how underpaid these roles can be, with also zero respect given to the craftsmen. IMO this is linked to the recent calls for the VFX industry to unionize. Technology and expectations combine to create a hostile work environment where people don't have benefits and are underpaid or contract employed with zero job security.

These are jobs that are seen as prestigious, so employers take advantage of the workers. They need a guild to look out for them. Support these efforts pls."
Live,Their editors are not local 700?!?!?
Live,"SNL doesn’t take care of their editor crew. They exploit being non union. Just like commercial advertising, yet they are the most demanding on turn around. Speaking from someone who recently did a 20 hr shift but you only get paid your day rate which is based on a 10hr day. Didn’t even offer to pay me for two days at regular time. They just say well “sorry that’s how it works out”…”we don’t pay overtime”, sucker! Not even to a contractor. Completely abusive."
Live,April fools!?
Live,I’m more intrigued at what they’re gonna do for an April 1st show.
Live,"It’s amazing that corporations, stockholders, and billionaires would still rather pinch their pennies instead of making their employees lives better. As if study after study hasn’t shown that a happy worker is a better and more effective worker.

Want more output? Pay workers more. Want better quality work? Ensure your employees have enough money and benefits so they can have a quality place to live and healthcare. This is all such simple shit, but yeah sure keep on pushing for short term gains.

Keeps worshiping at the altar of capitalism and continue your human sacrifices. We all know it’s a sustainable model."
Live,Good for them. I hope they get every single demand.
Live,"A little under a month should be plenty of time for NBCUniversal to squeeze their rather large heads out of their particularly tight asses. And if not, I hope the strike is disruptive and successful."
Live,"Editors are as significant creatively as DPs, writers, and I'd go so far as to suggest directors. Fuck NBCUniversal, or anyone else who tries to take advantage of them."
Live,"Typically the pre-recorded bits are the highlight of the episode, maybe this will force them to give it 100% for the live bits."
Live,Good for them. Fuck NBC.
Live,What about the rest of the unionized staff?  They’re going to cross the picket line to go to work?
Live,hell yeah! workers of the world unite!
Live,Best SNL news in years
Live,I thought it was live? How is there a post production team?
Live,Oh no does this mean SNL will be worse?
Live,"Couldnt go march 25 or april 8? Just ya know, to be taken seriously."
Live,This is gonna be one helluva April fools!!!
Live,I read this as they were going to strike the props after each sketch. I was so confused why that was significant
Live,I wish more people did this in all companies. Call out the company bullshit and go on strike but people are too afraid to lose their jobs than commit to change.
Live,"As a viewer, I plan to continue the strike I’ve upheld for the past 15 years."
Live,"… I’m confused… “post” means after. It’s a live show. What post production editing is there to do?

Edit: I had not considered that a lot of what happens on SN isn’t actually live. I rescind my question."
Live,I'm glad they're doing this but not sure they picked the best day to do so...
Live,"Truly an incredible amount of work goes on preparing and putting on the show. People literally sprinting in between segments and commercials setting things up… 

The hall leading to the studio has some wonderful pictures of old cast and guests… really cool."
Live,Doesn’t make sense most people in tv and film are union but fuck the vfx artists or motion graphics artists I guess
Live,SNL editors on April 1: “Great news!  We’ve reached a collective bargaining agreement and will resume work on the season.  April fools!”
Live,based
Live,Why hasn’t Lorne Michaels ever been called out on how gigantic a piece of shit he is?
Live,"They deserve a contract.  Its insane how long they have not gotten a contract.  They do incredible work.  As a proud member of local 700, NBC should be ashamed and needs to get them a contact asap."
Live,Shoulda done it without notice.
Live,"I think SNL is generational. My dad loved Akroyd, Chase, Belushi and Rita Rudner. I loved Sandler, Carvey, Norm, Rob Schneider and Kevin Nealon. My son loved Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri and Tina Fey. We all are convinced that our era is the best and the last “good” cast. (Secretly they both know that I’m right)"
Live,Best of luck to them. I hope they come to terms. I love them.
Live,And then they show up day if and go APRIL FOOLS
Live,Wasn’t it Tina Fey who said that the schedule was built for people on cocaine?
Live,"if you can't make a product without slave labor, we don't need that product"
Live,Post-production? I thought it was live.
Live,All 6 of SNL's viewers will be devastated
Live,"April 1st. So, fool me once shame on them, fool me twice, never get shamed again (bush)."
Live,April Fools?
Live,✊✊✊
Live,Who cares...
Live,Just cancel it already.
Live,[deleted]
Live,Just have Chat GBT write the sketches!? 😬
Live,I can't believe this show is still around.
Live,"Wait. Is this an April fools joke? Because it’s a live show, isn’t all production pre or live?"
Live,It's live. Why do they even have post production.
Live,"I genuinely can't tell if this is satire or not.

On the one hand, SNL is broadcast live.  That's the whole point.  Therefore, it doesn't have any ""post-production"" or post-production editors. And the fact that they're targeting a show on April 1 implies that this whole article is just an April Fool's day prank.

But on the other hand, most pranks are announced *on* April 1, not three weeks before.  And the article is so well-written, plausible, and doesn't seem to contain any other jokes.  What it does contain is references to things that people in this industry would realistically be striking over.

Also there are some pre-recorded cutaway scenes that do require some editing and post-production.  Is that what they're talking about?"
Live,This show should end
Live,SNL sucks…. Sorry but it’s been mediocre at best for the better part of a decade
Live,Doing us all a favor. Their annual 3 year slump started this season.
Live,How do you have post production on a live show?
Live,Meh.
Live,if their actions result in that piece of s**t show not airing then they should be rewarded.
Live,"The question is, will anybody notice?"
Live,Is this the end of comedy as we know it?
Live,Can’t believe people even still watch this crap
Live,[deleted]
Live,Who cares?
Live,"there is a post production team on a ""live"" show?"
Live,"They work 3-4 days a week with a team in 3 shifts, all part time, for 20 weeks a year.

This was covered on the SNL sub. 

NBC knows they can just wait this out. To commit to a long contract is not worth the business and not likely. I understand how it sounds but please be realistic. Compare the demands against the team at Disney, or South Park, or Fox Studios and its night and day. 

Hope they can come to an agreement but the more I see this the more I think they are just trying to get the media to put pressure on SNL with buzz words."
Live,Their is a Serious shot that Ortega doesn’t cross the picket line.
Live,"I drink beer with my neighbor on Saturday nights. 

He and his wife watch religiously. 

The show just isn’t any good anymore. If Trump dies, that show won’t have any material at all."
Live,SNL has post production? Aren't they live?
Live,"They could cut half the cast and the writer's.  SNL has not been funny for a while and needs to get an infusion of talent. Otherwise, it's going to tank."
Live,"Jokes on them... 

It's called Saturday Night Live! Not Saturday Night Edited. The show doesn't even need them."
Live,How does a live show have a post production crew?
Live,End SNL
Live,*Tumbleweeds*
Live,"Oh, how WILL we all go on?"
Live,Are they demanding more Trump skits?
Live,"I am sure it's an unpopular option but cool, couldd we go back to having SNLIVE be LIVE again? Yes yes, I know they used to make fake commercials that required post. However most of the time they did not include that week's guests to allow them to be made with more time. 
I personally hate all the pre-recorded skits. Know this got big with the Andy Sanburg. Whatever just it definitely steered the show away from its format of being live."
Live,Perfect picture to show how shitty SNL is. That Wednesday dance is retarded.
Live,"SNL has post production editors?

I would think this might be a job that would be cheaper if contracted our.  The show format means they shouldn't be doing much more than putting together promos and the occasional pre produced skit"
Live,Strike as in to not work or [strike in the theatrical sense?](https://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/environmental/program-resources/performing-arts/strike.html)
Live,Good. These ultra-polished cinematic productions take the real magic out of the show.
Live,All I read in that headline was “Some Americans are gullible af.”
Live,Editors are one of the most important components of filmmaking. NBCUniversal's abuse of these professionals is unconscionable.
Live,Ooooh is this the next advent of reality television??
Live,Does anyone watch this show anymore?
Live,"Good, it’s been shit for the past 2 decades"
Live,"OK, fine, SNLPOSTPRO has a fiverr account now. Problem solved..."
Live,Eew
Live,"I’ve been boycotting SNL my whole adult life. Uh, in solidarity."
Live,"Is this an out of season April Fools joke?

er wait a second.."
Live,"Oh so this isn't a gag, damn"
Live,"Oh no!


...anyways..."
Live,"I was wondering 'what the hell is post production in a live show' but yeah they have lots of pre-recorded bits these days. They've always had a few. And they probably are some of the strongest parts of the show these days, too."
Live,Cant be any worse. See ya!
Live,We will only barndoor transitions until our demands are met!
Live,That was incredible.  I figured they had to have been working on it for weeks.  Do uou think they really just churned it out turbo mode?
Live,"Here is a Behind the Scenes look at the Mario sketch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNNFUr4wDLM"
Live,"I wonder how the director, Mike Diva feels. He was in the VFX/motion graphics/editing world on YouTube before working as a director with SNL so I'm sure he knows how stressful crunch can be."
Live,"Often enough, when you see a sketch end, and you see a long shot showing the cast of the just-ended skit starting to leave the stage, you will see one person immediately come on stage and physically grab the guest host to get them offstage to change for the next skit.   While the cast members are used to the fast turnaround, and the same cast members are often not in the next skit, the guest host is not used to it, and so it is one person's job to get them moving right now."
Live,Thanks for mentioning it because [this shit is goddamn hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w)
Live,"That’s what SNL is though.  The sketch most likely didn’t exist before the Tuesday night writing session.  And if it did it was likely a very basic concept at that point.  It’s definitely a big ask for post to turn that around so quickly, but that’s the nature of the gig.  I don’t think anyone expects Hollywood grade cgi, just the best they can do on a weekly live show timeline.  They should absolutely be fairly compensated for those expectations and if that means striking then more power to them.  But that won’t change the job."
Wild Wild Country,"Now that you’ve seen WWC, you’ll really appreciate Batshit Valley from Documentary Now"
Wild Wild Country,Nah B that was a cult.
Wild Wild Country,"I came away feeling fairly conflicted, yeah. Minor... well... bioterrorism aside, the cult seemed much less objectionable to me than the jerk-ass townsfolks. And the discos looked lit?

It is very hard not to see something of a landgrab in the outcome, that’s a lot of property the cultists seemed to have put blood, sweat and tears into making work. Pretty convenient for the town how it shook out once they'd made it something viable."
Wild Wild Country,"The townspeople's opposition and hostility to the commune was originally based on the rumors that there would be a lot of sex and orgies at the ranch. That's it!

The documentary relies too much on the former local news reporter, as if he were an unbiased source. He isn't."
Wild Wild Country,"There have been many books written about peoples’ experiences with Osho/Bhagwan, from perspectives which range from poor to favorable. If you want real insight into the community, reading at least a couple will probably be the best way. The bottom line is, things like this tend to only be possible through the power of a singular, unique personality. I think that Osho’s power wasn’t that of commanding and organizing, but somehow bringing out the enormous potential from within the people who surrounded him. He had the ability to make people feel something that they thought they could not experience anywhere else. Whether you consider him to be enlightened, a charlatan, loving, selfish, or perhaps some strange mix of all of these, he certainly had ‘something’ that most people don’t. If you want to deepen your understanding of what and how everything happened, reading a wide range of sources and first hand accounts would be the best way."
Wild Wild Country,"Yeah, you probably don't want to start checking out groups like this.  You will sign over your house to them in about 6 weeks, I'm guessing."
Wild Wild Country,"Thats how I felt about it too. The townspeople were so mad that a religious group bought the ranch and weren't doing ""ranch things"" but they're fine now that a white Christian man owns it and is doing Christian stuff on the land? Make it make sense. I get that they did do a lot of nasty things, but the initial idea seemed fine and they didn't want to bother the townspeople, bit it escalated. I plan on reading up so much more about it because I was so mad about the people of that town and their clear bigotry racism and xenophobia."
Wild Wild Country,"Ha mild bioterrorism.  Murder.  Kidnapping homeless people.  Bombing.

Mild"
Wild Wild Country,"There is nothing positive about leaders that have so much power that their followers will go shoot and murder a person without blinking - just because their leaders tell them to. The only reason it was that particular woman who were asked to do it was that she was considered to be a good shot. I pretty sure a lot of the other people would be willing to do the same. And then we have the case of putting drugs in the beer of thousands of homeless people, and later on dropping them off in random cities.. Then it doesn't really matter what else good you might do in the world. I honestly cant see anything good coming out of it, even if the locals weren't fighting to get rid of them. After all, the reason they left India was because they were about to be arrested for a long list of crimes."
Wild Wild Country,"I don't think anything good would have come out of it, even if the locals weren't trying to get rid of them. The group left India to avoid being arrested. That should tell us something."
Wild Wild Country,"But weren't all of those things driven by Sheela? As in, they did not spring from the foundational beliefs of the group or possibly even its main leader (Bhagwan)."
Wild Wild Country,Dude there is always a sheela in those things.
Wild Wild Country,"I love how after 4 years of silence, he just comes out berating Sheela on TV. A spiritual leader? Nah, just a sassy gossiping bitch."
Wild Wild Country,The Lawyer for the Rajneesh was the most interesting character to me. He was super smart and independent yet totally believed Osho was the greatest man to have walked the Earth. 
Wild Wild Country,How has no one mentioned the beaver poisoning attempt? That was my favorite story growing up. It's totally bonkers! Blended Beavers? A very Rajneesh solution to that problem!
Wild Wild Country,"I think the craziest part about it is that I watched 6 hours of a carefully crafted documentary and I still don't really KNOW a lot of things. I think the portrayal was super interesting because there was no god-mode narrator telling me how to perceive the information and telling me how things turned out or what to think. It was just a bunch of people telling their side of the story, so really basic things (what was Osho's real motivation, what was Sheela's, who was really running the show in Rajneeshpuram, etc...) are unclear. At the end of the day we can have theories but not real answers.

The biggest mystery for me is: what even was the nature of the cult during its time in Oregon? They say it's about love and community and acceptance, the people of Antelope say they're an evil, satanic sex cult. And we never really find out what actual day-to-day life was like inside the cult. Everyone is an unreliable narrator: everyone associated with the cult either has an agenda for or against, and the people of Oregon were all super biased right away (including people in Antelope when the Rajneeshies were 19 miles away, doing their own thing on their own land.) You could easily pick and argue the legitimacy and rights of any group involved at any point in the documentary and you would be just as right as anybody else arguing any other side. Very interesting portrayal."
Wild Wild Country,"I’m still split between the two. Was sheela always nuts? Or did the money do it? And was Bhagwan always spiritual or did he get hooked on drugs by that doctor? 

Regardless it’s one of the best documentaries I’ve seen in a long time. "
Wild Wild Country,"SPOILERS
What shocked me the most was not even the biological attack, was the whole thing they did with the homeless. Those elections laws, the length they went, the treatment they gave. 

Crazier and crazier"
Wild Wild Country,Tough titties
Wild Wild Country,"Great documentary though! I watched a couple cult documentaries but I have never seen one masterfully woven like this

Edit: I wish I could talk about all of it, maybe we should get a discussion thread going??"
Wild Wild Country,"My dad has a buddy who was a sociology professor and he brought a group of students into their commune when this was happening to study their way of life. He was under extremely close supervision of the FBI and was offered sexual favors while amongst them in order to encourage him into writing favorable opinions about their cult. Needless to say he felt a bit left out when he wasn’t consulted on any of this before the documentary was released, he knows an absurd amount of information about these people 

**EDIT: If you guys have any questions about his experience then feel free to post them as a response to my comment, I’ll be giving him a call tonight and will answer as many as I can!**"
Wild Wild Country,"My grandma lived there for several years and I believe the documentary doesn’t mention it, but before Bhagwan arrived in Oregon he stayed in Montclair, New Jersey. She stayed there as well. I want to show her the series and see if she has an insights"
Wild Wild Country,“I have a rule.  I do not make love to secretary”
Wild Wild Country,"I think Sheela is a sociopath but I also think she was the perfect pitbull for Bhagwan. He knew that by having a spokesperson he would have plausible deniability. The spokesperson would know that to have all this power and responsibility they would still have to please Bhagwan. Look at the way he got rid of Sheela’s predecessor, I think Sheela knew her time was coming to an end and that she was as disposable to him as everyone else. I think there were probably things that Bhagwan didn’t know but I bet there is a lot of things that he did know but liked to pretend he was clueless about.

He also used power and control techniques. For example his way of going silent, for years he gave speeches and drew people who gave up their whole lives to live in India and hear him speak he then decides to go silent and that the followers should be happy to be in his presence. This weeds out the followers of those who won’t just basque in his glory. 

As India authorities were coming down on him, he just decides to up and leave without a care for his followers then when they needed someone to build the city, the followers were called to Oregon. 

The followers build this city and he lives off their hard work and the political battles they are doing while he gets to live like a king. He goes into silence again, although not in private. Then when his second in command betrays him he ends his public silence almost immediately and starts blabbing like there is no tomorrow. Why? Because he needed to for self-preservation.

He then decides to do the Monty Python routine of telling his followers that they are all individual people who can wear what they want and do what they want. Because apparently it was Sheela’s fault that the cult exists, never mind that it was in existence before Sheela’s rise and at any point if he was unhappy with the existence of the cult he could have said something and walked away. 

The Bhagwan wasn’t that old when he died but he presented himself as a frail man. I think he was a controlling leach.


The stuff he said in his teachings weren’t also mind blowingly new, it’s had all been said before he just packaged it up to appeal to the mass market of rich westerners.

His followers also came across as very arrogant because they were very well educated they thought they were smarter than everyone else. "
Wild Wild Country,"I watched this series this week and was blown away that I had never heard of this group of people. 

My wife and I always found it funny when Osho spoke...he always extended words that ended in S at the end of a sentence or sometimes in the middle of a sentence. He Made almost a whistle sound with it. We’ve been talking like that joking around with everyday sentences this whole week. "
Wild Wild Country,"My question is: how the fuck can sheela still venerate bhagwan even after he goes on tv and rats on her, calls her a bitch, blames her for things that I'm pretty sure he knew about and tells her to commit suicide? 

Also, the other people listening to that... wasn't he supposed to be enlightened and awaken, thus above all this pointing finger and name calling shit?  -.-

""Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking"" I guess in this case they were listening too much and not thinking at all!"
Wild Wild Country,"I loved the entire series, but I felt like they could have done more to show us who Osho was. I feel like you get a pretty solid understanding of every character involved, except for the Bhagwan. "
Wild Wild Country,"Netflix is the perfect medium for documentaries. No time constraints, just tell the story in however many episodes it ends up as after editing. We consume it at our leisure, or binge the crap out of it."
Wild Wild Country,"The total irony of this documentary blew my mind. As a First Nation person watching and hearing the reactions of the people of Antelope all sounded so familiar when they were against and afraid of the cult.

Shit is bad, but only when it happens to you.

Then having a Christian take over the land. It was okay as long as it's their religion.

But either way, it was fascinating to watch the whole thing grow throughout the series. "
Wild Wild Country,"I was there.

I lived on the ranch in 1985 when I was 4 with my Mom. I was only there for 2 months and she was there for 3, but it was a strange place for me. I remember asking my Mother where the toy stores were and her telling me that there weren’t any. For a child that grew up in New York City who loved to run around FAO Schwartz, this was unbelievable.  She said there was a disco, but when you’re 4 anywhere is a disco and it was little consolation. 

The strangest thing I remember was probably the funeral that they had. They burned the body in a glass enclosure, outdoors. The glass was tinted, but you could clearly see the body burning. All the adults were just lounging around outside, talking and sitting on the grass while the body burned. 

As a 4-year-old, I didn’t have the most solid understanding of death, but this felt wrong. This guy was burning!  Why wasn’t anyone helping?  However, you’ve got that hard-wired kid sense that if adults all think something is okay, it must be fine and you must be the one tripping.  Still, I couldn’t shake the anxiety and it was disturbing to see the flames burning the body down. "
Wild Wild Country,So good. Sheela is a psychopath. 
Wild Wild Country,"I'm utterly floored by the fact that I've never heard of this. Like, wtf.

Waco? Yes. Jonestown? Yes. I giant compound in the middle of nowhere called Rajneeshpuram? Nope. "
Wild Wild Country,i was born in the early 80s in Washington state. how did i never hear about this? 
Wild Wild Country,I hate how it degrades into a battle between shelia and the master. He breaks 4 years of not speaking to say she’s a crazy bitchbecause he never gave her dick and that he doesn’t sleep with secretaries. I thought you were about bringing classes and races together not separating  person because they work under you bro
Wild Wild Country,"I feel like maybe they could have titled this better. I saw this on my Netflix homescreen and made an immediate snap judgment that this was going to be some shit like Duck Dynasty, so I didn't give it a second glance.

You're telling me it's about a crazy sex cult? Well now I'm interested."
Wild Wild Country,"As a guy who’s lived in Oregon basically his whole life, I feel lied to knowing nothing about this. This shit was so fascinating, how did we not learn about this in school!!"
Wild Wild Country,"My question is why were there so many people involved, or surrendered so blissfully to the lifestyle?  What was the root intoxicant of it all? 
 When it's all stripped to the bone, was it really just one, big cathartic orgy commune.  

There are other questions I still have that go unanswered, like the guy who searched through the dump at their records. What became of them?  Why did they all wear red?  What's up with the outbreaks?  And so I guess the doctor survived, but how did he react?  

Also, I like how the documentary cuts out a vignette from the ribbon of that era and lets you see through the eyes of news and talk shows back then.  How was there so much coverage, yet it's seemingly so forgotten, and how was this guy so readily available for talk shows to talk openly about attempted murder?  How was there so much airtime?  Crazy.

edited for clarity"
Wild Wild Country,"I'm 41 and I have no clue how I had never heard of this whole ordeal until just now. How did this not always get talked about with other cults/followings like Jonestown, Branch Davidians etc?"
Wild Wild Country,"I love when the guy is explaining all the early construction going on. Just paraphrasing, but -

""We had A-frame houses. We had a massive prayer hall, and restaurants. We even had a boutique, although the color palettes were *--music cuts out--* limited.""

Then cut to people just rifling through a bunch of red shirts. "
Wild Wild Country,"Watched it in like 2 days. The thing I liked the most about this doc was how I bounced like a tennis ball back and forth between who’s side I was on. Until the end of course. The townspeople suspicions were rightfully confirmed, BUT I couldn’t help but think had the towns natives just left them alone that things could have maybe ended differently. Maybe not. It seems the whole war between them started by the townspeople being a bit bigoted to the Bagwhans hippie like philosophy. Some of the Rajneeshi ended up being corrupt and pretty evil though. I feel people like that lawyer really represented how good their ideals were. The whole thing kind of seemed like such a shame for everyone.

Edit: Don’t spell gud. "
Wild Wild Country,"Absolutely incredible documentary. I was very surprised at the Federal government's strategy at constantly transporting the man who will be called Osho via airplane to cities all over the states and telling him that the next stop was his second home in oregon when in reality it wasn't. 

This making him to be unsure as to what the truth is most certainly led to his mental and physical break down."
Wild Wild Country,">This is a documentary where, when someone says, “[they] poured the blended beavers into the water supply,” you barely blink.

This should be the tag line for the documentary."

Wild Wild Country,Haha fucking hilarious when the first time he speaks in years is to tell everyone Sheela is a bitch that was jealous about not getting any dick. 
Wild Wild Country,"Im amazed at anyone who is 'Team Sheela' because regardless of acting out the motives of the Baghwan, she decided to enact bioterrorism and in her place of power could have stopped it. She's a delusional sociopath who will only try to angle what she did to her benefit but refuses to admit any wrongdoing. 
Am I the only one who thinks the picking up of homeless people then dropping them off in Portland some time later is just wrong on so many f**king levels? And drugging them?!?!?"
Wild Wild Country,"Loved the documentary. For anyone interested, there's a Forensic Files episode that focuses on the salad bar incidents."
Wild Wild Country,"If you've been following the current goings-on in Scientology, you can't help but compare Sheela to David Miscavige. They each took over wacky funny cults and turned them into scary criminal cults."
Wild Wild Country,"It's amazing how split my opinion was. During the first couple episodes I actually empathize with the cultists and felt that despite their obvious issues, it was the townspeople who were in the wrong (thought I totally understood their position too). As the show progressed and everything kept getting worse I just couldn't believe all this really happened. 

Humanity is more insane than anything in fiction."
Wild Wild Country,"I can highly recommend Tim Guest's book *My Life In Orange* which describes his experiences in India and the US as part of Bhagwan's cult. Pretty eye-opening and heartbreaking stuff.

I'm a cult survivor, and much of what this documentary will show looks like experiences I had as a kid."
Wild Wild Country,"My grandparents were actually very committed members, they left their home in San Diego even to go to the ranch


I remember growing up and seeing so many painting of osho, so many Buddha's, and tons of Indian style decoration. (their originally from Nebraska)

and if I'm honest it actually does have beautiful meaning, for them atleast, always striving for love sharing and acceptance was nice. 


oh and my uncle was actually a trained guard who stood infront of where ever building Osho was at the time.


I swear I could not make that last bit up haha "

Wild Wild Country,"I drove through Antelope yesterday.

After tearing through Wild Wild Country last week, I was curious to see what became of the town, post-Rajneeshpuram. And I had a business trip to make from Portland to Bend and back, so I made a detour on my way home.

Antelope is a ghost town. The cafe is closed. There isn't a gas station or a store. The school is deserted. 

It is almost like nothing happened. Back to the sleepy small town it was before. Just like the locals wanted. 

Pretty country though. Spectacular. 

"
Wild Wild Country,The GQ website is a travesty. Couldn't finish reading a paragraph without some shitty video and/or ad popping up.

Wild Wild Country,I finally get The Simpson’s episode “The Leader” now. 
Wild Wild Country,"I thought this was going to be a 1-hour documentary.

Fast forward: I've done nothing else this weekend."
Wild Wild Country,"I don't have any experience with this cult first-hand, but I have been reading about them on and off for almost 10 years. As entertaining and compelling as this documentary was, I think it's really dangerous if it's your only perspective of the cult. For one, they're overly sympathetic to people accused of murder, don't ask them hard questions, all but ignore the victims and people they hurt, and basically just give the criminals a platform to shape the narrative.

They were a large criminal organization involved in drug trafficking, money laundering, and yes...brainwashing. I encourage everyone to read stories of survivors who were brainwashed. There are a lot of them online. Go to one of the many forums for cult survivors and you'll get a different impression. The main thing that they missed in this documentary is that it was not a hippie commune of freedom and free love. The members' agency was not respected and they were heavily controlled and manipulated.

They just favor the perspective of the criminals so heavily. They imply that the native Oregonians are these backwater bigots even though their fears were well-founded. They even seem to suggest that the natives drew first blood, and perhaps the actions of the cult members were a reaction to bigotry. Nope. This shit was dangerous from the start.

It started to sicken me as it just became a platform for unapologetic, unfeeling psychopaths to tell their story without any challenge. Bioterrorism, drug trafficking, poisoning homeless people, poisoning an entire water supply, and election rigging are not as heavily explored as they should be. Victims of the most serious crimes aren't interviewed. It's fine to watch it if you wonder how Sheila and the cult members justify this insane crap to themselves. It's definitely not fine to watch it if you're looking for an unbiased recollection of events.

None of the lower level cult members are really given the microphone or given a platform to tell the story. The only real footage you get from them is footage that was taken within the camp by fellow Rajneeshis. And we know that all mail and information going in and out of the camp was heavily controlled, so you have to keep that in mind when watching footage that came from within.

This reporter who covered the Rajneeshis in the past seemed to agree:

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cult-wild-wild-country-netflix_us_5ab2b37de4b054d118df49c1

That 20 part Oregonian series that's mentioned in the documentary is probably the best source of information online, and includes a lot of criminal behavior that's not mentioned in the documentary:

http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2018/03/read_the_oregonians_original_2.html

These people used propaganda, standard brainwashing techniques, separating people from their family and assets. And it was always like that...it wasn't a reaction to American bigotry.


By the way...this is anecdotal but I know of one cult member who still traffics club drugs. The cult was involved in the early days of spreading MDMA in places like Ibiza, and at least one follower is trafficking 2c-b. Here's a quote from part 5 of the series...one of many stories from the 1970s, before the move to America:

>“Drugs girl seduced by cult” and “Slave-girls scandal” trumpeted the headlines over stories about their trials. Lawyers and members of the women’s families made even more sensational copy when they lashed out at the Rajneesh movement. Ashton’s lawyer told the court that she had been brainwashed, subjected to several sessions in a warm-water isolation tank and then forced to smuggle drugs.


The 5-part follow up to the 20-part series is also well worth reading. It contains details like this:

>To strike at government authority, Rajneeshee leaders considered flying a bomb-laden plane into the county courthouse in The Dalles -- 16 years before al-Qaida used planes as weapons.

Wild Wild Country,"Being from India, it is safe to say that 'gurus' like OSHO have done more damage than good. They all have some eerie side to their 'benign' personalities that is just creepy. But I came here to ask if anyone knows the background score and where I can get it. (not the soundtracks, already got those) but the background instrumental music that goes from dark to emotional, beautifully. Will appreciate it! 

P.S.- Loved the documentary (totally binge watched it with my bf who is from Oregon, and I'm from India so that kinda made it the weirdest culture mash-up for us) "
Wild Wild Country,Sheela is like a real life Cercei Lannister
Wild Wild Country,"Tbh, both sides in the docu-series were at fault. The town residents were douchy, conservative assholes and the cult had serious corruption and greed and issues that led to its downfall. But people should watch it to get their own opinion. The fact that the founder of Nike was heavily involved in the conflict is interesting."
Wild Wild Country,"I wonder if Sheela has ever been evaluated by a psychologist ? Her behavior and the way in which she speaks (Self-righteousness, drama and grandiosity) is really weird. Would be interesting to find out if she is a sociopath or just an obtuse narcissistic power-craving fiend ? "
Wild Wild Country,This series is so good! Get off reddit and watch it now!
Wild Wild Country,Am I the only one who found both disgust as well sympathy to the cult?
Wild Wild Country,"In a docu-series brimming with crazy, the part where a lady from Antelope says ""There is no place for these people in America"" got me. America .....you mean the place that was founded because people wanted religious freedom. Some of those towns people were SO sanctimonious.
"
Wild Wild Country,"I was born in 84 and am from Portland, had no idea about this at all. 

When I was a kid my friends would go to Young Life summer camps. Basically a really fun outdoor camp with fishing, hiking, etc. Turns out, the cult’s property was converted into this camp! 

https://washingtonfamilyranch.younglife.org/Pages/default.aspx

I don’t mean to sound ignorant, but I can’t help but wonder if the cults actions of immigrating mass numbers of homeless people into Oregon aided in the beginnings of the current homeless issues in Portland. Just a thought I had while watching. "
Wild Wild Country,Blended beavers.
Wild Wild Country,"I liked the doc and was disappointed by it. The last episode was very rushed and left so many questions. The bombing, Sheelas life after getting out of jail (there was quite abit more), what happened to all of the characters after the fall, was there any investigation into Oshos death. Disappointing end after what was generally good doc series.
"
Wild Wild Country,"There's no way Osho didn't know what was going on in his cult.  The man was completely materialistic, drawn to wealth and ""shiny things"" as someone said it in the series.  He obviously knows how to connect with people and manipulate them to get such a massive following.  Sheela met with him every day to discuss management issues.  His first response to her disappearance is to attack her personally and blame everything on her.  Seriously, how can people blame everythign on her?  Yes, she's a psychopathic manipulator and enjoyed the power, as she admitted, but she was fiercely loyal to him.  And seems to remain so within the documentary, but I'm not convinced that wasn't conveniently edited.  

I really felt like the series was missing more information on what drew people to the cult in the first place.  What living conditions were like, daily life.  What it was like for children.  People who were forced into marriages and how that turned out.  It brushed over all of that and left me with a lot of questions.  I could not understand the appeal of Osho at all.  Looking at him speaking made me weirdly uncomfortable, I didn't even want to look directly at him.  "
Wild Wild Country,"It's very interesting that the filmakers decided not to reveal who actually did the bombing. I'm assuming it was done to add drama as it seems to have given a lot of people a warped view of the townspeople. Lots of people in here calling them bigoted, I might be misremembering details, but without the bombing I think it's fair to say they reacted completely reasonably to a cult moving into their town of 40 people. The vast majority of the cult was white and I don't remember hearing a single racist word about Indians, though obviously thier could have been more that wasn't in the show. Just not seeing how anyone could come out of that seeing the townspeople as the bad guys. "
Wild Wild Country,"The second time I went to India, I asked my roommate before she went on her honeymoon for recommendations on local monasteries and temples to see.  At the time I was really interested in world religion, and especially in India's diversity of religion.  Anyway, the only one she knew of was in Pune, so I bought a bus ticket northbound to the Osho Ashram, which I'd never heard of.

When I arrived, it was pretty obvious that something was off immediately, as entry didn't just require a fee, it *required an AIDS test*.  She'd inadvertently sent me to a sex cult.

The experience was interesting, to say the least.  I hadn't heard of this documentary, but I can't wait to see it."
Wild Wild Country,[deleted]
Wild Wild Country,"Putting aside all the horrible shit that happened there. I find it pretty funny that, while everything slowly starts turning into chaos, osho's still like: ""moar Rolls Royces"""
Wild Wild Country,"I find Sheela way more interesting than Osho. She was true and committed, the guy just seemed like another Maharishi taking advantage of people feeling desolated. But she’s a definitive psycho, the last words she says on the documentary feel as if she was just telling an average story of when she was young … smart crazy people are very dangerous and interesting."
Wild Wild Country,"Minor spoiler:


Did anyone else find it funny that at the cults begging it was a bunch of white college kids leaving the capitalist west and going to India to work in sweatshops and not get paid?"
Wild Wild Country,"Its pretty apologetic to bagwan though which i thought was stupid,like he didn't know what was going on in his own cult."
Wild Wild Country,The first couple of episodes make the locals look more aggressive and violent than the cult.
Wild Wild Country,"For a humorous take on it, listen to episode 22 of the Dollop podcast."
Wild Wild Country,[deleted]
Wild Wild Country,"If what you like this, and listen to podcasts, check out The Heaven's Gate podcast. It's done by the guy who does Snap Judgement. It's really good if you're into to seeing how crazy people can get."
Wild Wild Country,There are few things I like more than a good cult documentary 
Wild Wild Country,"Growing up, I had a scholarship to a boarding school 7-12 grade. My room mate for a year when I was 13-14 was a guy who grew up in the movement. His mother picked up and left the commune in 1984 (bioterror attack era). He was pretty much brainwashed, and it was hard for him to integrate. His sexual experience from about age 11 was the stuff of crazy stories. I think I was the only one who believed him, primarily because he was entirely sexually adept and confident and was ridiculously sexually active and obsessed the entire time I knew him. He did not return the following year. I never saw him again. His descriptions of other aspects of life there were equally bizarre. 

I met another person who was there at roughly the same time who independently confirmed the outlines of most of what my ex-room mate told me, and specifically confirmed several of the more bizarre sexual claims made as a kid growing up there, even though he claimed to have not participated directly, and that the incidents were not looked at positively by very many of the other adults or kids for the most part."
Wild Wild Country,"I'm on episode 3, shit is intense, best doc I have ever seen absolutely riveting."
Wild Wild Country,"I think Bhagwan unleashed his interesting vision on the world then took his ""silence"" to let it play out. Unfortunately Sheela was what he really unleashed. These cults are just more proof that centralized power always leads to bad things. The Holocaust, Stalin, Mao. This just played out in microcosm. "
Wild Wild Country,"Crazy is right (SPOILERS AHEAD). These people drove themselves crazy, then they drove a town crazy, a whole state crazy, and finally the federal government. The fascinating part were the compromises all these entities made with their own values to undermine their opponents. The cult abandons its ""love and understanding"" bit for guns and fascist behavior. The town tries to dissolve itself just to defy the cult. The state denies its citizens the right to vote just to thwart the cult. And finally, the federal government essentially tortures this guru guy with a sort of proto extraordinary rendition just to get him to give up and leave the country. A lotta crazy.     "
Wild Wild Country,"Craziest part to me is that there is still a cult like this operating in the US  and no one knows about it. I was there by accident about a decade ago and left after a year. They operate a huge business in NYC and recruit homeless teens from around the country to work for them under the guise of spiritual awakening. They too have an enlightened leader with big beard and all the garb. Turns out he owns a massive beachfront property in Florida while his followers live in squalor. Look it up, its called The Church of Bible Understanding and its very very real and very disturbing."
Wild Wild Country,"I liked but found it to be too sympathetic to the cult ppl, Sheela is one crazy bitch till this day and Bhagwan a total pimp. "
Wild Wild Country,"When I was in Pune, India back in 2005, I came across a beautiful walled garden in the center of town where streams of western men and women in red robes were coming and going all day. I asked someone what it was, and they told me it was “Osho’s Garden” as if that should explain it. The locals told me not to bother, and that it was a sex-cult.

I’m guessing this documentary will help me understand the background a little.

I can’t wait to watch (assuming it’s not something my kids can watch so haven’t started)."
Wild Wild Country,"I was in high school when that shit went down. You remember your school doing ""Spirit Days"" where everyone dressed up?

Yeah, we honest to God had ""Rajneeshie Day"". Not even kidding."
Wild Wild Country,"I grew up in India hearing about Rajneesh and Ma Anand Sheela. I knew about the Rolls-Royces and the weird sex stories, but never knew about the political intrigue. What I found interesting was that people were calling him Bhagwan, which means God. Strangely I was reminded of the Scientology documentary on HBO. A great watch nonetheless. "
Wild Wild Country,What kind of peopl would let sheela take care of their elderly even this far later?
Wild Wild Country,How is ma Anand Sheela not in jail?
Wild Wild Country,"Wild Wild Country is one of the best documentary series i have ever seen and helped me to understand more about my own experiences in Central Oregon.  

I was a student at a boarding school in the late 80s less than 100 miles from Antelope.  It was founded a few years after the commune shut down.  I had been told the school had to jump over a ton of hurdles because locals were very weary of a repeat of ""that Rolls Royce guy"".

At the time we were not fully aware of the entirety of this story, but could not help feel the eyes of locals when we went into town.  Seeing this documentary over the weekend shed a ton of light on that time period and the atmosphere in Central Oregon.  I do not blame the Citezens of Bend/Pineville for their caution.  Pretty certain they have salad bars in those towns too."
Wild Wild Country,"My friend went to Portland Bible College. They own some of the land the cultists used to own. One of his professors teaches classes there, he used to be apart of that cult. He now teaches on the histories and formations of cults in the same place he joined one."
Wild Wild Country,[deleted]
Wild Wild Country,Anyone else find the music to be jarring and way out of place sometimes? They'll do like adrenaline music for way too long while people are slowly talking etc
Wild Wild Country,Can confirm. Read this post about 7 hours ago and have just finished binge watching the whole thing. Would strongly recommend. 
Wild Wild Country,"It’s the one documentary where I don’t like any of the parties involved. The townspeople were Xenophobic assholes, the bhagwanis took their revenge way too far....I just didn’t know who to root for, so I ended up disliking most of the people involved (except for maybe the bhagwani lawyer and the one chubby townsperson)

It was brilliant. "
On My Block,Hope these actors are better than the last ones. The actors for Monse and Caesar were so bad
On My Block,"I'm excited to see Bry in a more dramatic role!

Edit: just realized that I called her Bry instead of Bryana. I have been following her for like 10 years on social media, so I guess I have one of those weird parasocial relationships..."
On My Block,"They suuuuuuuuuuuuuucked at acting. And it would be clearer to notice when they would be in scenes with the rest of the cast. 

No wonder they don't get more roles or more momentum than the rest."
On My Block,"I really thought this ended due to last season's final minutes lol

Yay I guess, more Jasmine"
On My Block,"Huh, I thought last season ending was pretty final. I don't get how this gets renewed when I'm not okay with this or teenage bounty hunters aren't."
On My Block,Those are massive salaries. I didn’t think the show was that popular.
On My Block,This makes more money
On My Block,this show was one of the most popular on Netflix. I think it beat out 13rw
On My Block,I wish I could give you 1k upvotes. Im not okay with this a TBH were stand out shows for me.
On My Block,What??? Teenage bounty hunters was so good
On My Block,This is somehow one of Netflix's most successful originals.
On My Block,I'm not denying that and I enjoyed this series (maybe the third season not as much) but in my mind that series ended whereas the others haven't. They will have to write around the series finale and it's just dumb.
On My Block,cool
On My Block,This just in: Netflix has cancelled On My Block.
On My Block,"They want to have their salaries on a level close to the kids from Stranger Things, sounds kinda crazy. No way their show is as big as Stranger Things"
On My Block,"Well season three will be the final season if they get the raises they want.  Netflix is only offering a $10,000 per episode raise and that's based off of viewing stats most likely...my guess is the show becomes unprofitable at the raises they're asking for...."
On My Block,Guess they're also expecting it to be cancelled at S03 lol
On My Block,Damn well Netflix might say to bad and the show is canceled!
On My Block,"They make $20,000 an episode and that's not enough? They want $218,000 per episode making it $1.7 million for just 8 episodes. If I remember correctly these are short 30 min episodes. This is insane. Netflix should hard-pass on another season. Why people think they're worth that much money and they're not even saving lives is beyond me. All that is wrong with hollywood."
On My Block,Never heard of it.
On My Block,"Actually, the article says they're looking more in line with 13 Reasons why."
On My Block,Yeah I agree I like On My Block but no way is it as big as Stranger Things plus the level of acting isn't as good.
On My Block,"Definitely not, but it's a moderate hit in the US and I recall hearing it's an even bigger hit overseas. Still, I get that it may seem unfair to them but that's the way the game is. Bigger the hit, bigger the salary. The cast of OMB seems to be getting a little cocky by playing with bargaining chips that they don't even actually have."
On My Block,It's Netflix. Season 3 was always going to be their last season. Might as well get paid as much as possible for it.
On My Block,"well you have now. On My Block, go check it out. great stuff."
On My Block,"Yeah, you're right. They want $218,000 and the kids from Stranger Things have 250k. There's a bit of different but still kinda close. And Stranger Things must be a lot bigger right?

And the 13 Reasons Why cast wanted higher salaries when they heard of the salaries the kids from Stranger Things got. 

>It is standard practice for the cast of a breakout series to seek salary bumps after season two. The *13 Reasons Why* stars were emboldened to seek raises after learning of the rich new *Stranger Things* cast deals. It's also worth noting that *13 Reasons Why* produces 13 episodes per season compared with eight for *Stranger Things*. **Representatives for the On My Block stars are not expecting Stranger Things money but are seeking raises comparable to those of the supporting cast of 13 Reasons Why.**  

Not that big of diffrence between 218k and 250k when you consider how big Stranger Things is"
On My Block,"The actress that plays monse is the worse, and somehow she actually worse in season 2 than season 1, wtf."
On My Block,"THIS! There’s only 2 good actors on the show, Jamal and ruby."
On My Block,Well true haha
On My Block,It is a chicken or the egg issue though.  Are shows ending because Netflix doesn't want to pay for many seasons or are the ending because of the pay raise associated with longer running shows?
On My Block,Over a 13 episode season that would be more than 400 thousand dollars per actor. That's a sizable difference.
On My Block,"Of course, (anecdotally) I've watched Stranger Things, heard of 13 Reasons Why,  just found out a show called On My Block exists."
On My Block,I saw this coming. Now is the show that valuable to netflix to warrant the pay raise or not? I say it is since the show got more popular than what I think anyone was expecting.
On My Block,"$20,000 an episode to $250,000 seems like a huge jump.  How can Netflix calculate the value of shows, when they have such a huge catalog of shows? Are people subscribing to Netflix JUST for this show?  I ask this has a new fan of the show, just curious about how original programming can be valued."
On My Block,This is getting cancelled
On My Block,They are insane if they think they can get that money considering they didn't make improvements acting wise this season. Good thing they are asking for more but damn that's an insane jump.
On My Block,I think this is partly a result of Netflix not releasing any actual ratings. There's no tangible way for the cast and crew to know how much their work on a certain show is worth so they want to be paid similarly to those on other shows like Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why.
On My Block,"They should cancel it then. If another network wants to save it and pay that per cast member, let them."
On My Block,LOL they're asking for stranger things money.  Good luck!  If they do get those raises it'll be a season full of new coke ads and such.
On My Block,I can agree they should get some kind of raise but asking for ST level money seems way too much. I think something similar or little lower than 13 reasons why would be reasonable
On My Block,"I love this show and don’t want them to cancel it.  They definitely should get a raise though, it’s not 13rw and stranger things money but it’s quite a popular show. Seems like they should make s bit more."
On My Block,I mean this is the same company that cancelled their Marvel Netflix shows and a multitude of other shows this year. These contract negotiations are only giving them a reason.
On My Block,"I think it’s a well kept secret by them ha. Most metrics we see are third party data aggregate groups, not Netflix actually releasing their statistics."
On My Block,This is one of Netflix most popular originals according to statistics.
On My Block,You're quite right I think
On My Block,Yeah. Otherwise they're setting a dangerous precedence for their other shows who might get ideas if the On My Block people get what they ask for.
On My Block,"There’s no way this show is on the same level of notoriety as Stranger Things. I understand that the show turned out a bit more popular than people were expecting but I just can’t see it getting the same views as ST. I obviously don’t have the numbers but just in general looking at how imbedded ST is into pop culture nowadays, this show can’t compete. The kids obviously want in on the same earnings but I feel like they’re not anywhere near getting it. Either they’ll take what’s being offered to them or Netflix will cancel it which they have done before. No hesitation."
On My Block,"You do understand that they were more or less forced to stop the Marvel shows because of Disney, right?"
On My Block,Then it makes sense considering two big players are leaving this year.
On My Block,From what I've read it was Netflix's descion. Even so they've canceled a multitude of shows this year.
On My Block,There is no way Netflix would have cancelled Daredevil if there weren't outside pressure to do so.
On My Block,We dont know what that was about. Maybe it was too expensive to make for whatever reason.
On My Block,"Oh cool, I would've hated if the show ended in that cliffhanger

_cries in santa clarita diet_"
On My Block,"Amazing, I go on this sub every day and use Netflix almost every day but have never heard of this show."
On My Block,this show is dead after season 3
On My Block,I'm glad it worked out for them. Did this delay the start date for filming? Weren't they like a week out from shooting when this drama started?
On My Block,"Can anyone explain how something like this happens? It was my understanding that usually tv shows have their stars locked by a 6/7 season contract (the pay scales each year but it’s all agreed beforehand) and only after that it’s when the massive paydays come, because the actor is now a “free agent”.

So why this after only two seasons?"
On My Block,"Of course this only applies to the women not the men.

They still get the old pay rate."
On My Block,[deleted]
On My Block,"I’ve been seeing a lot of people being pessimistic about this show after this next season. Do people think that because of this situation of the actors wanting more money, Netflix wants to get just get rid of it?"
On My Block,Have you seen the recent trend with Netflix canceling shows after 2 or 3 seasons so they do not have to pay more for season to go on.
On My Block,[deleted]
On My Block,[deleted]
On My Block,"No, it's because a lot of popular Netflix shows were canceled after season 3."
On My Block,"Yes, but all of those are previously know: Netflix is aware that the actors/creatives will get an X% bump. This feels more like the negotiations that happen after the 7 season mark. For example, Kumail Nanjiani recently said that one of the main reasons why Silicon Valley was ending was due to their contracts finalizing.

Have tv contracts changed lately and now it’s not usual to make them that long from the start?"
On My Block,"But you don’t pay for it, right? If a show gets cancelled at first season doesn’t mean that the actor gets the 6 other seasons pay. It’s just a holding deal."
On My Block,[deleted]
On My Block,"This makes sense. Thanks a lot, much more clearer now!"
On My Block,Such a sweet show that doesn't shy away from the realities of life in South Central LA. 
On My Block,On my block season 1 was so overlooked on Reddit. It's a good show and there's particularly a character who I'm sure they will like.
On My Block,It's refreshing to see a show about inner-city minority kids instead of the usual white kids in suburbia. 
On My Block,Love this show so much!  Deserves all the props.
On My Block,Really enjoyed S1 and I'm excited to dive into this new season. 
On My Block,Rubens actor is 22
On My Block,It has been trending on twitter for last 2 days
On My Block,My wife just started watching it because her students all watch it.
On My Block,"Saw the high ratings on RT and people talking about it online and gave it a shot.

&#x200B;

far out, the writing and acting is just SO BAD.  no idea at why its rated so high.  it legitimately feels like it was written, directed, cast and produced as a high school project."
On My Block,Jasmine's actress is 32.
On My Block,Main cast is all around that age
On My Block,It says it’s about young adults. What’s your point?
On My Block,That's cool. Do you use tailored trends or local trends?
On My Block,Give me examples of similar shows (about latino teens) that in your opinion have good writing and acting.
On My Block,"she has been playing the character of ""overly attached high school girl with a crush that is eventually reciprocated"" consistently since 2013"
On My Block,Holy shit 
On My Block,"relax i just thought its insane cause he looks way younger, i looked it up when one of the older characters made out with him. why are people getting offended lol..."
On My Block,Trending in usa
On My Block,Jasmine is basically a much hyper and gangsta version of Willow lol
On My Block,"Very happy with this news, one of my favourite shows on Netflix.......... but with how they've been rolling this will probably be the last season so I hope the writers plan for that"
On My Block,(And final)
On My Block,"Not on reddit but this show is huge worldwide especially amongst teens. The season 3 curse is real but if it maintains popularity it can go on further seasons for sure. I personally really like its balance of teen comedy and drama, and the added south LA gang tension to its coming of age nature is what makes it stands out from the pack"
On My Block,I hope the writers can wrap it up if need be.
On My Block,Yes! With the recent Santa Clarita cancellation I was so worried about this show getting the ax too.
On My Block,"Netflix will greenlight anything and still find a way to disappoint its fanbase leaving them on an unsatisfactory final season.

Enjoy it while it's around, folks."
On My Block,Its a great show. Hopefully it can continue after season three but I think they would have to amp up the pace a but. Lots of things we didn't get to see. Until then I'm  writing some fan fics check it out if interested.  [https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/184749801-on-my-block-fanfiction](https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/184749801-on-my-block-fanfiction)
On My Block,I’m starting to lose my trust in Netflix so I won’t keep high hopes of this going further than 3 seasons...
On My Block,Who likes this trash?
On My Block,This kind of shows gets seasons but not Santa Clarita?! I have ended my subscription with netflix bc I’m tired of financing their other crappy shows
On My Block,"nah, i'm expecting like 5 seasons of this. quite popular, very well liked, and the viewership numbers are consistently big from what i've heard."
On My Block,I feel a lot of people don't realize just how popular this show is and how popular Santa Clarita Diet wasn't.
On My Block,I honestly don't know how anyone older than 16 watches this show. My girlfriend had it on the other day and holy shit. The writing is terrible and the acting is somehow worse. Why do they give the kid who looks like a Hispanic Gary Coleman so many BS monologues about how unfair the streets are? And what's up with that other Latino dude who had to join his family's gang? That actor has zero range. Anytime he's supposed to show emotion he looks constipated.
Edha,looks random af
Edha,"I always felt Zoey was the weakest of the children actors on Blackish, was surprised they gave her a spin off. Like you said it would benefit from other characters getting more time."
Edha,"The show is super boring. Zoey is the weakest character, what made them give her a spin-off. Not surprising to see it flopping. "
Edha,"I just binged it and overall it's a perfectly fine show. It's not particularly funny, but it's enjoyable."
Edha,"""Modern"""
Edha,Oh weird was just thinking of checking this out since one of the writers was on Harmontown last week. I wish I had some flip-up sunglasses like Dwayne Wayne.
Edha,Or they should have made the spinoff about Eustace 
Edha,Ruby and pops prequel series
Tabula Rasa,"Loved it! Really well acted with many surprising layers. Have you watched Hotel Beau Sejour, another fantastic Belgian series? It’s very good."
Tabula Rasa,"yeah i keep telling people on here to watch that show. 

[just two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/afl4k7/can_we_get_a_best_of_netflix_thread_going/ee0vl8b/)"
Tabula Rasa,"Is this the show that was on TV last year, or completely different? I remember being interested in that but missed it."
Tabula Rasa,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, managed to surprise me on more than one occasion.

I thought I knew where it was going with it's mystery, and then it threw another layer on top of the whole shebang.  The horror aspects were supremely creepy, to top it off."
Tabula Rasa,Op thanks for this post. I also watched this show and thought it was very good 
Tabula Rasa,"I really want to watch and enjoy foreign language films but I sadly just cant. I have tried so many times but ready subtitles takes so much away for me, I just can't get into it."
Tabula Rasa,"no, is it on netflix? if so i will check it out 

the twist in ep 8 when we discover who ______ really is was something else eh? holy shit "
Tabula Rasa,maybe? no idea
Tabula Rasa,"Yes, HBS on Netflix. Really cool premise.
Yes, the twist was amazing in Tabula Rosa. Hell, all the twists were!"
Tabula Rasa,Anyone know if it's good?
Tabula Rasa,"Finishing the last episode now.  

This was **definitely** worth watching. "
Tabula Rasa,Mmhm fc de kampioenen still better
Tabula Rasa,/r/TabulaRasaTV
Tabula Rasa,I got really excited for a minute there that this had something to do with the book Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits as its the name of the city the book takes place in. This still looks cool tho
Tabula Rasa,I thought it was very good
Tabula Rasa,"Since it was financed using German compulsory TV fees, it will probably be an overpriced sucker."
Tabula Rasa,Nice I'm glad you liked it :) and now watch hotel beau sejour!
Tabula Rasa,Do you have down syndrome?
Tabula Rasa,Any sort of other show or movie you would compare it to?
Tabula Rasa,"Not sure if German TV is generally bad, but that doesn't seem relevant anyway since this is a Belgian show..."
Tabula Rasa,"What do you mean by that?

I don't really know much about how German TV works. "
Tabula Rasa,It is a Belgian show that first aired on a Belgian television network. 
Tabula Rasa,Please explain why you say that. I'm curious. 
Tabula Rasa,One of my favorite shows ever. It’s wonderful to see someone else with my taste in shows!
Tabula Rasa,Vooral balthazar boma 'mijn gedacht' hehe
Tabula Rasa,"I'm on episode three and thoroughly enjoying it.

The closest thing I could compare it to is Memento.  Main character has a memory disorder, but she's the last person to see a missing dude so the police put her in a mental ward until she remembers.

There's also a slight horror vibe I'm getting.  

There's been a couple of scenes where I was genuinely creeped the fuck out. (There was literally a scene that just freaked me out as I was typing that.)  Her husband says her imagination fills in gaps, so I dunno if there's some supernatural shit going on or if it's just her fucked up memory.  When these scenes play out they use some pretty good looking special effects, too.

I have to say, Netflix has really widened my world view with the amount of foreign television shows I've watched.  Dark (Germany) and La Casa de Papel (Spain) are two of the best things I've seen on Netflix and now we got Belgium kicking ass with this show.
"
Tabula Rasa,"I'd say that if you like this you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Dark"" on Netflix.  It's a German supernatural/thriller/mystery.

"
Tabula Rasa,"And if any country is known for its quality television, it's Belgia!"
Tabula Rasa,trut
Tabula Rasa,You should watch Hotel Beau Sejour aswell. Its another Belgian TV show that is kinda like true detective and Twin Peaks. [Stephen King likes it!](https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/852344954915520516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.standaard.be%2Fcnt%2Fdmf20170413_02832540&tfw_site=destandaard)
Tabula Rasa,"That sounds pretty cool.

I'll give it a shot and thanks a bunch for your impressions.

Btw, next you should try the wide world of film if you haven't already. Lots and lots of awesome non-American stuff out there. "
Tabula Rasa,"I'd switch the order as that's the order I watched them in and I liked Tabula Rasa a bit more, but either way I'd definitely associate them as well. "
Tabula Rasa,You had me at Stephen King liking it.
Tabula Rasa,"You had me at True Detective and Twin Peaks.  I don't suppose anyone knows of any good Chinese or German shows (other than Dark)?

I've been learning both languages and would love to be able to get some practice in.  I watched Sense8 with Mandarin subtitles for all of season two."
Tabula Rasa,"You had me at ""another Belgian"". Tabula Rasa was my first time hearing flemish and I really enjoyed that aspect of it specifically. Have you seen the Spanish show Ministry of Time Travel (or something like that)? I'm also thinking about starting that one."
Tabula Rasa,the sister in tabula rasa is the dead girl in hotel beau
Tabula Rasa,"I watch a lot of foreign stuff, just never television shows (other than anime here and there).  There's one movie that I keep putting off even though I downloaded it a while ago and I saw it on Netflix last time I went browsing.

Memories of Murder from Korea.  

It's supposed to be one of the best murder mystery/thriller movies ever.  I'll probably give it a whirl when I'm done with Tabula Rasa."
Tabula Rasa,I have only heard of la casa del papel
Tabula Rasa,Lynn van Royen yes
Tabula Rasa,">I watch a lot of foreign stuff

Ah. My bad for presuming.

>It's supposed to be one of the best murder mystery/thriller movies ever

I don't know if I would go that far, but it's definitely a great film. I've actually been meaning to give it a rewatch so thanks for the reminder. I also really like the director's English language films, though I know they are polarizing. 

The guy has a knack for chase scenes that's for sure. 

"
Tabula Rasa,"I've watched a couple of episodes and I agree, it's great. The atmosphere is really great and the lead actress is really good"
Tabula Rasa,Whats it about?
Tabula Rasa,"thnx

I will check this out "
Tabula Rasa,"Chick has a fucked up memory and is put in a mental hospital when she ends up being the last person to see some dude that's gone missing.

There's a lotta really horror-esque, spooky scenes in the first bunch of episodes, but the mystery of it all takes over the last couple.  One of the more complete experiences I've had on Netflix so far."
Tabula Rasa,"already watched it, it was great! mind recommending something similar?"
Tabula Rasa,"I love how Netflix gives these European shows a platform. Occupied, Hotel Beau Sejour, Babylon Berlin, Suburra and La Casa de Papel are all fantastic, but please, indeed watch it in the original language with subtitles..."
Tabula Rasa,"It's on my list, probably third or fourth in line. (Finally watching Seven Seconds atm) But is it supernatural or does it simply have weird visuals? The trailer makes it look like either/or. "
Tabula Rasa,I'm going to watch this series tonight---been meaning to since the other day when someone who loved Dark as much as me said I would love this.  IMDB reviews are all sp convincing..you're the first person I've seen mention it other then the other day.  Thanks
Tabula Rasa,"From the Netflix preview, I don’t really get what it’s about. Is there a paranormal element? "
Tabula Rasa,"Yes, I watched it, it's a great mystery, but some people won't like the ending."
Tabula Rasa,"Yes very good show. Gets more intriguing as the series moves along. 

I like the international options on Netflix lately. Variety is good."
Tabula Rasa,Nice utopia flair one of my favs!!!!
Tabula Rasa,"Just finished 7 seconds and loved it!  Not as simplistic as naturally described it to be.  It's obviously written from Sudd her fingerprints are all over it.  You'll be surprised that regina king doesnt steal this series, but the other actors are just incredible and well casted!"
Tabula Rasa,I loved Dark. I recommend it all of the time. 
Tabula Rasa,"That rock scene, fucking hell."
Tabula Rasa,I really hope season 2 going to happen
Tabula Rasa,Ya it's good.
Tabula Rasa,"Dark is phenomenal. Genuinely one of the only shows I've seen involving [spoiler](#s ""time travel"") that didn't create huge plot holes from it. "
Tabula Rasa,"Yep, I really liked it. It has some absolutely stunning cinematography and music. My only slight worry for the second season is how they'll handle the scenes set in 2052. There have been so many post-apocalyptic futures seen in TV and film that I hope Dark does something a bit different with it; the last thing we need is another Mad Max-esque world."
Tabula Rasa,"I wanted to watch it, but it fell off my radar, hearing you compare it to the OA is kind of a surprise. Guess I've got to watch it now."
Tabula Rasa,"I’m excited as heck for the new season. So many great scenes and the soundtrack was perfect. When the police chief looks through the old newspaper, when her partner uses that rock, and when Jonas is face to face with the Stranger in the last episode. So much memorable shit."
Tabula Rasa,"If you like that kind of stuff, I definitely recommend Castle Rock"
Tabula Rasa,"The English dub was terrible, the voice actors didn’t really act just kind of read they’re lines"
Tabula Rasa,Ya it rocked my world during a time I was doing a lot of lsd. Have fun memories of watching it at 2 in the morning and absentmindedly feeding my dog meatballs. 
Tabula Rasa,"Dude why do they do nothing about  this fucking cave?

Kids disappear... you think they'd at least check it and say ""yeah we need to put a grate over this""."
Tabula Rasa,I describe it to friends as Stranger Things with time traveling Germans 
Tabula Rasa,"I think I'm one of the few people that actually really enjoyed the OA. I was very captivated throughout the whole series, and I can't wait for the new season. I know a lot of people hated it, but I loved the mystery and the weirdness and the ambiguous ending. Hearing you compare Dark to that makes me want to give it a watch."
Tabula Rasa,Yep amazing show 
Tabula Rasa,"[When I Was Done Dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7OYTF1kJMQ)

the animation... the lyrics..."
Tabula Rasa,I really hope S2 comes out sometime this summer. 
Tabula Rasa,Much better than the OA.
Tabula Rasa,Loved both Dark and Tabula Rasa.    Haven’t started the OA yet though.  Can’t wait for second season of dark either 
Tabula Rasa,I love that show. I need to rewatch again because there is so much to take in. 
Tabula Rasa,"I really enjoyed Dark and the OA. My fear, as with other 2nd seasons, is that they’ll not be able to continue the show without removing too much of the mystery and the elements that make these shows great. "
Tabula Rasa,Yep. I've been meaning to rewatch it for a while. Definitely will have to do it before getting into season 2 lol.
Tabula Rasa,It's such a deep and interesting show. It starts off a little slow but when you get a few episodes in it gets addicting. I can't wait for the new season. There's still so much shit I don't understand 
Tabula Rasa,Dark was awesome!
Tabula Rasa,Great show. I really like the intro (and matching up those kaleidoscope images with scenes later. I'm kinda nervous about season 2. Not sure that they will be able to maintain the quality. Still. I have to know. Particularly: what's up with the guy with the eyepatch?
Tabula Rasa,"I loved it. Yeah I didn't watch it dubbed, (dub in general is a crime against art)

Can't wait for the sequel."
Tabula Rasa,It's solid. Makes you think about some of their bigger concepts of the show. Not sure if I'll watch season 2 right away.
Tabula Rasa,Yeah this was hugely popular on here when it was released. 
Tabula Rasa,I loved it! Me and my friends watched it last year and it’s sooo fun theory crafting wtf is happening. We’re actually gonna rewatch soon cause we have now matched the timeline now that it’s 2019 haha. 
Tabula Rasa,"Ja, 'Dark' ist schon"
Tabula Rasa,Loved it! I’m so glad to hear there’s a season 2. 
Tabula Rasa,"One of my top 3 Netflix shows along with Castlevania and Black mirror. All of them I know about because my college roommate randomly put them on. He had a knack for finding diamonds in the rough, or just watched too much TV.

I sell it to friends as stranger things with less camp and a deeper mystery."
Tabula Rasa,I loved this show and I fully agree with your comment regarding watching German vs. dubbing. The English dubbing is TERRIBLE. 
Tabula Rasa,"I loved Dark. Watched the whole season in a day, I didn’t want to take my eyes off the TV. I’m very eagerly waiting for season 2.  "
Tabula Rasa,There is a quote in episode 10 when one of the characters angrily explains how convoluted everyone's relationship is to one another in his life that I just started laughing. The show is great.
Tabula Rasa,I loved it
Tabula Rasa,"Yes, and can't wait for season 2."
Tabula Rasa,Best thriller show ever
Tabula Rasa,"I plan to watch this, but I need to be in the right mind set to watch subtitles (I don't watch dubs, which completely destroy the original actors' performance and replace it with corny, sub-par voice acting)."
Tabula Rasa,"Loved it, except for the play scene which felt way too edgy"
Tabula Rasa,"Liked it.  Should have been one season, but I liked it, guess I'll watch S2.

"
Tabula Rasa,I enjoyed it a lot but would not re-watch. 
Tabula Rasa,Yep. Really enjoyed it. We were a bit disappointed they didn’t just wrap up in one season though. Not convinced on a future timeline as well 
Tabula Rasa,"It was alright, I kind of didnt care for it. While at the same time liked the pacing and calm, coldness it gave me. Always this unpredictability and mystery it carried that made me watch all of it. "
Tabula Rasa,The dubbed acting is amazingly bad.…reminiscent of dubbed Godzilla movies bad. Must be watched in original German with English subs.
Tabula Rasa,can some one give me a link to download dark ? If there is 480p video quality downloads that would be great.
Tabula Rasa,[deleted]
Juni Taisen: Zodiac War,Must be a shock to the system going from almost nothing happening for 90-minutes to non stop drama.
Juni Taisen: Zodiac War,"I just came out of a YouTube rabbit-hole about cops getting busted for DUIs, pedophilia, and racial profiling. In most cases (that I watched), 'busted' was usually some sort of paid vacation. Wrongdoing is rarely admitted.

Although I root for Mackey when I'm watching, I see a gross level of 'ultra-realism' in Mackey/Aceveda's corruption as well.

Had an interesting watch last night with ""The Confession Killer"", featuring a DA who gets arrested after accusing the Rangers of misconduct, only to beat that charge, resign as DA, and go on to be the defense lawyer for the 'Killer'. He tried to sue 'the system', but some parts/people have(had?) immunity like Vic.  
Rangers closed \~200 murder cases, and \~20 of them have been proven (over the decades since his arrest) to have been different murderers. Killers on the street, just for what, some better crime statistics?

I didn't think that these shows would compare that well, but you did a good job. As ridiculous as The Shield can be, I guess I think it's a bit too real as well."
Secret of the Nile,Stress can't age you if you're literally never stressed.
Secret of the Nile,"Eating Greens, that funny bastard."
Secret of the Nile,"**Let’s talk about Daemon. I’m still not sure if I’m supposed to think of him as a full-on sociopath or a lovable rogue. He’s keeping me guessing, in a good way. How do you see him?**  


>SMITH: Exactly as just described. It depends on what side of the bed he gets out on. I think he’s just an agent of chaos in many respects. One of my favorite books is “The Master and Margarita.” It’s magical realism — I like that. This character Woland comes back to, essentially, cause chaos. And it reminds me a bit of that. I was trying not to be too black and white about him.

**Right before he chops off Vaemond’s head, Daemon has a tender moment where he helps his ailing brother up the steps. That was Paddy Considine’s last episode. Tell me about filming that.**  


>I was just there admiring Paddy. I think you can see there’s a lot of stuff added that wasn’t really in the script. Over the course of the season, because we’ve worked so closely together and developed a relationship with one another, we were able to be spontaneous in certain moments.  


**Daemon does not seem to age. What’s his secret?**  


>He’s always eating his greens. Gets lots of sleep. And doesn’t give a flying f—."
Secret of the Nile,and what about Ser Criston who also doesn't seem to age at all lol
Secret of the Nile,Bless Matt Smith. The man is a champ
Secret of the Nile,"I was clowning him on those pre-release pics of him in that wig, but man... He's really won me over."
Secret of the Nile,Aging is caused by stress. And stressed is caused by problems in your life. And you can't have problems in your life when you're the problem.
Secret of the Nile,"Daemon looking 40 when he was supposed to be 23 also helped. Now that he's 40 and looks 40, it checks out. Also, I had no idea Olivia Cooke was only 28, she doesn't look older at all, but her performance as the Queen/mother carries such a mature quality I don't even see the age issue."
Secret of the Nile,"""Eats his greens""

*laughs in CDI Zelda*"
Secret of the Nile,"Also, a Timelord."
Secret of the Nile,He’s the Paul Rudd of Westeros
Secret of the Nile,"> He's always eating his greens

I want to believe that's a pun."
Secret of the Nile,Matt Smith'S portrayal of Daemon is going to be legendary in TV history by the time its over
Secret of the Nile,"Characters now have the same appearance they will have until the show ends, so by the time the next seasons release we will forget how some characters didn't seem to age.

Also, not counting the 2 minutes of prologue, ""only"" 17 years have passed since the show started until now (112 AC to 129 AC). People are behaving like everyone should look 30 years older.

In conclusion, don't think too much about it because it won't be a problem anymore."
Secret of the Nile,The real reason is that he’s from Gallifrey.  It’s a secret from everyone.
Secret of the Nile,"Or. To put it simply.

They casted Matt Smith to play Daemon during the Dance and decided to not hire another actor to play Young Daemon."
Secret of the Nile,"Yeah, but he still hasn’t uncovered the secret to growing eyebrows."
Secret of the Nile,"He also forget the most important part  


""-He's a timelord"""
Secret of the Nile,"He also poops his pants, have sex, Ekse"
Secret of the Nile,"Kinda wondering what Greens means in this context, could be veggies could be................"
Secret of the Nile,I thought it was because he was the doctor lol
Secret of the Nile,So this is what the Doctor does nowadays
Secret of the Nile,"Also he's a Time Lord, that's definitely a strong point. :-D"
Secret of the Nile,Is this the man from the hit movie morbius
Secret of the Nile,He looks like he’s in his 50s and doesn’t get enough sunlight..
Secret of the Nile,"They really did a bad job with aging some of the cast. There's that one guy in the closed council that's also stayed the same age for like 20 years, and he was old in the first episode too."
Secret of the Nile,I want that hair back
Secret of the Nile,"He would be a great curator, he'd be great at curating what with all that sleep and not giving a f***."
Secret of the Nile,Matt Smith trolling at every turn like the absolute lad he is
Secret of the Nile,MATT DAEMON
Secret of the Nile,"The answer is Daemon is rich 

When you're rich, you have the luxury of not giving a flying f***

You can afford to eat healthy and get lots of sleep"
Secret of the Nile,">Daemon

Brother get the flamer. 

The heavy flamer."
Secret of the Nile,EATING HIS GREENS
Secret of the Nile,Such a goofy looking guy.
Secret of the Nile,And being a Timelord helps alot
Secret of the Nile,"But he fucks, right? He doesn’t give a fuck but he still manages to find time to fuck?"
Secret of the Nile,Not enough mentioning of rheanys. She’s been the same age longer than daemon
Secret of the Nile,"To be fair, he doesn't seem to have aged since he was in Doctor Who"
Secret of the Nile,Daemon sure eats his fair share of greens ;)
Secret of the Nile,Plus the occasional jammy dodger.
Secret of the Nile,That's actually good advice
Secret of the Nile,And fucks like a dragon.
Secret of the Nile,Aged? The guy is still maturing
Secret of the Nile,I think Viserys isn’t supposed to actually be old. He has leprosy which makes him deteriorate much faster. He’s probably only 50 something when he dies even though he looks like he’s 100
Secret of the Nile,"This is an excellent answer. Very ""Just repeat to yourself 'It's just a show/I should really just relax'"" energy."
Secret of the Nile,Matt Smith was a bad choice for this role.
Secret of the Nile,I’m tempted to watch this show because Matt Smith is a good actor. But I don’t think I’ll ever trust another GoT related show.
Secret of the Nile,"Matt Smith is a UK treasure and if the Brits aren’t careful, we’ll snipe him as one of ours"
Secret of the Nile,This dude looks like if Malfoy and Doogie Howser had a kid
Secret of the Nile,The inconsistent aging in this series is ridiculous
Secret of the Nile,LOL so quirky and random. He's literally me guys XD
Secret of the Nile,The subtle art of not giving a fck - Daemon Targaryen - ^(Mark manson)
Secret of the Nile,Astroturfing much?
Secret of the Nile,I love this man. (Choose your own adventure if you think it’s the actor or the character I’m talking about here 😏)
Secret of the Nile,"Good genetics,  my mother is 71 and barley looks 50. Has never wore makeup, its just how it is."
Secret of the Nile,"The aging on this show is so fucking stupid. The disparity between who ages and who doesn’t is so implausible, that I had to take a break from the show as it was starting to frustrate me."
Secret of the Nile,Obviously he gives a fuck about eating greens and getting sleep…
Secret of the Nile,I feel like this could have been a more defining moment for him as a feminist…
Secret of the Nile,I read the title as 'Maggie Smith'. I'm slightly disappointed.
Secret of the Nile,"Lmao it’s literally incredible how everything about this production is so much more enjoyable than ROP. 

like the actors in HOTD are more entertaining than the characters in ROP"
Secret of the Nile,[deleted]
Secret of the Nile,"hes got a point, hes probably the least stressed person from the royal family"
Secret of the Nile,"And there goes my theory that he was the one who did something to Viserys that somehow made Viserys sick, sapping his lifeline to boost Daemon’s life & health.

Ok no, I’m still maintaining that theory."
Secret of the Nile,Not true. There's no way he hasn't fucked while flying on a dragon
Secret of the Nile,"When you’re born with a shock of white hair, you just don’t care."
Secret of the Nile,He looks like a grown up Joffrey.
Secret of the Nile,Daemon also does a lot of fucking. It’s good for the soul.
Secret of the Nile,I mean sir Christensen too
Secret of the Nile,The Paul Rudd Diet
Secret of the Nile,"Sleep is the most important/ overlooked aspect of maintaining your health. Eating healthy is great but getting enough sleep is far more important. Personally  I have met 40-50 years old who look like 300 year old wendigos all from gettin 1-3 hours of
sleep for the last 20 years."
Secret of the Nile,Flying Fuck should be the name of his dragon.
Secret of the Nile,Matt Smith has the best facial expressions. His eyes rule me
Secret of the Nile,They should cast David tennant as a lanester or something…
Secret of the Nile,Eating. Flying. Hmmm
Secret of the Nile,If Daemon grows old I pray to any and all gods he is played by Peter Capaldi. Please let this be a thing.
Secret of the Nile,He’s an alien 👽
Secret of the Nile,What greens?  They seem to get around one sunny day per year.
Secret of the Nile,And he’s also a time traveller
Secret of the Nile,"I always wondered what possibly could they feed those massive dragons with?

Now it makes sense, they give all the animals to dragons, and all that is left is some vegetables for humans."
Secret of the Nile,"Off topic but I read a twit that went something like this : Criston Cole is a salty man and salt is a  preservative,that's why he still looks young after all these years"
Secret of the Nile,Something about his lack of eyebrows freaks me out
Secret of the Nile,"Daemon has been my favorite since ep 1, I was the only one out of 10 people who liked him, and now they all love him lmaoo"
Secret of the Nile,woah man epic!
Secret of the Nile,I love it when actors become their characters 🤣
Secret of the Nile,I just see a hotter Gordon Ramsay
Secret of the Nile,I wonder if Matt Smith knew he was signing up to be a sex symbol when he took on this role.
Secret of the Nile,What a pointless question to ask the actor and what an even more pointless article to write.
Secret of the Nile,He seemed to really age in this last episode
Secret of the Nile,Am I the only one who thinks this guy looks like he escaped from some government run weaponized albinism program?
Secret of the Nile,he's hot as hell
Secret of the Nile,Can confirm these things don’t help much.
Secret of the Nile,Oh bahahahahahahahhaha it’s a joke quote. So funny I love funny thing and funny quotes so this is totally up my ally. Grandma you always post the best stuff.
Secret of the Nile,Impressive. Lets see Ser Cristons  secret.
Secret of the Nile,"I never really thought about how he has the same actor, while certain characters have three. At least he keeps changing his hairstyle unlike that fuckhead Cole."
Secret of the Nile,I think a lot of people are comparing him with Viserys. Who went from thirty to ninety over the course of the series. On the other hand Daemon went from his late twenties to his late forties. Which is much more reasonable.
Secret of the Nile,He leans too much to carry any stress. He passes it onto all the walls he comes across.
Secret of the Nile,"And eat your greens. Maybe stress-eat some greens, kill two crows with one stone."
Secret of the Nile,literally all 3 of his suggestions are predicated on you having enough money to get all of them
Secret of the Nile,"I don't know, the battle in the step stones might have been stressful. I'm sure he had ""fun"" with it, being kinda crazy, but it seemed like he was really desperate for a win. Had to mess with him some way. 

But when the king offered help, that's when he went all or nothing by 1v1000 the triarchy. When he won, he had fun. If he lost, he would die.

We are past that now. But I think he is more stressed about this than we know"
Secret of the Nile,And insanely rich. You know he’s got maesters whipping up next gen night creams
Collateral,At least once a month I get stuck in a YouTube hole of Craig and Geoff clips.
Collateral,"Looks like Craig Ferguson will be starting a podcast so that might be worth checking out. 

Late-night is dying and I don't think Ferguson's ""legacy"" is hurt by the guy who came after him running the show into the ground."
Collateral,"Shirley Manson, the singer from the band Garbage, was on the show 6 times. They are both Scottish and sometimes they just talk about Scotland and stuff no one else has any clue. It’s hilarious

https://youtu.be/1FuPXcsYa3Q"
Collateral,"My God, when was the last time I read a Cracked article for any reason?"
Collateral,"""I enjoy ze simple pleasures of Daffy Dook."""
Collateral,“Has there been a muuuuurder!”
Collateral,His show is a big reason why I'm in love with Kristen Bell.
Collateral,His Britney monolog is legendary
Collateral,OMG that brought back deliriously happy memories. I almost never watched any of the late night shows because I’d fall asleep (had to be up super early) but for some reason I watched Craig once and fell instantly in love with the entire show. So I started recording every show and watched the next day.  Craig was so gifted and delightful that I felt like I was part of the live audience — and alone in my living room I’d participate as if I were actually in the audience. And like Craig in this clip I would often laugh ‘til I cried. I’d even get up and dance like an idiot when “Secretariat” came out. To have James Corden replace Craig was truly a sublime to ridiculous situation. I still miss him! Looks like I’m going to have a YouTube weekend.
Collateral,"Careful, Icarus!"
Collateral,"""No salsa, but if you have to have salsa... spicy."""
Collateral,"i just never got into the show but his book, ""American on Purpose"" is an excellent read."
Collateral,"Craig always kept it so real. His takes were always thoughtful, and you could just tell the man had seen and been through a lot and was trying to communicate, not just entertain. And he never punched down! Mad respect."
Collateral,"Greatest late night show host of all time. Craig imo as the leader of the show was the perfect blend of circus ringleader, relatable Everyman, and off the wall charming weirdo that kept you laughing and never got too deep."
Collateral,"Since the moment they decided Corden was taking over it was not a fucking great day for America. Ferguson, Geoff and Secretariat were the real alternative for late night among the blandness of Fallon or the ""I'm old and the young internet people are dumb"" Kimmel mindset. Thanks you round unfunny beige void of humanity Corden. I'm gonna go swap logs with someone this Valentine's in honor to the Late Late Show. Assmöde for everyone."
Collateral,"It’s interesting how late night shows are such a staple of US television and the formats are nearly identical. You could easily lose about 5 of these shows and still have options lol.

I get their purpose back in the day was to give the public a way to access beautiful and charming movie stars or whatever, so it made sense to have a circuit every night that people could go on to promote their wares. At the end of the day it’s cheap television to produce and only requires a stream of new stars and musical acts to keep going.

I suppose booking a slot on one was also a major goal for comedians through the years and acted like a stepping stone from working clubs to appearing in films or sitcoms.

The internet and social media has changed it all though. You can follow your favourite sexy actor on Twitter/Instagram or watch interviews in far fresher formats on YouTube e.g. Hot Ones.

Comedians have also found a great outlet in podcasting and are often much funnier when given time rather than a short 5 min slot.

Imagine how screwed your are when you have an actual turd (Corden) as your host. Between him and Jimmy Fallon (esp the whole monkey NFT episode) the genre has truly reached its nadir. It’s definitely time to try something new.

Craig Ferguson was great though. He sort of realised all these flaws and messed around with the format enough to make it feel fun. He was actually a genius in a weird way."
Collateral,He is the BEST late night show host by faaar
Collateral,Only Ferguson could make raunchy something your grandmother would find endearing.
Collateral,Craig Ferguson was way better than every James and Jimmy ever were or could be.
Collateral,Do we have a picture of Paul McCartney?
Collateral,"Corden following on from Craig makes me believe the Illuminati runs Hollywood stuff you hear, because how the fuck else could be have been chosen?

Craig is real and watching the Late Show was like hanging out with a good mate.

It was never pointless drivel, one sided politics or PR promote my show hokiness.

One of the rawest, realest moments was when he spoke about his mum passing away.

Watch from 7:20 to see why people trusted him. He was real, honest, entertaining.
https://youtu.be/Scpo9hvXitE"
Collateral,Craig remains THE best late night talk show host since Carson. Personally he is my favourite of all time
Collateral,The Late Late show finished when he did
Collateral,His story about when he was going to commit suicide on Christmas Day in London by jumping off tower bridge was the most real and sincere thing I’ve ever seen on any show full stop.
Collateral,"I never connected Corden and Craig TBH...when Craig left I just stopped watching, and everything I heard about James Corden made me not want to watch anyway. I'd forgotten he was his successor. 

We loved Craig Ferguson in college. We'd say ""It's Craigy Ferg time!"" and watch almost every night. It was just wholesome and weird and fun and I enjoyed it so much, I was so sad when it was over."
Collateral,"So many amazing moments, but this accidental one from Craig while talking to ScarJo is my favorite. https://youtu.be/6DJNqcsbddo"
Collateral,"""you're a racist man!"" Oh God i miss him"
Collateral,James Corden really ruins everything
Collateral,Easily my favorite late night talk host.
Collateral,I can’t see Geoff without thinking about his creator Grant from myth busters. Rip.
Collateral,CBS or Worldwide Pants (Letterman) or whoever owns the rights should make his entire run available for streaming somewhere.
Collateral,Do we have a picture of me and my ferrets?
Collateral,"No its not!  This is a man that, for the 1000th show, did the entire episode using puppets!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpStl77s158"
Collateral,">If @midnight succeeds at CBS, Corden may be seen in retrospect as the connective tissue that transitioned the late-night format into an internet-friendly extravaganza...

Ha! If @midnight succeeds, it will be *in spite* of Corden, not *because* of.

Also, this article does nothing to convince me that Ferguson's legacy is ""collateral damage""."
Collateral,"The sillier he got the better it got. There was almost a giddy boyish fun to it all. And the stunning women he had on there didn't hurt, either. His interviews with Robin Williams are legendary IMHO."
Collateral,"His run on The Late Late Show was a very special time.  I was an insomniac during his run, there was no YouTube, and staying up to watch Craig felt like hanging out with a friend.  He was so naturally funny and as much as I love Conan, Craig seemed so effortlessly funny and could talk with anyone."
Collateral,"I look-up to Letterman, meh on Leno, bored by Colbert, respect and love Conan, eh on Kimmel and Fallon but absolutely adored Craig and his show. 

Does he have a podcast or has he done anything recently? I bet Geoff is unfortunately the IP of the network but I'd love to see him in something else"
Collateral,It's not Craig's fault Corbin sucks.
Collateral,Craig Ferguson legitimately made me stop changing the channel when he was on
Collateral,I just recently realized that Craig Ferguson was the one  playing Lister’s confidence in Red Dwarfs “Confidence and Paranoia” episode.    Blew my mind that I never picked up on that.
Collateral,You could also say: Craig Ferguson’s Legacy is Collateral Damage in ‘The Late Late Show’ being hosted by Corden for all these years.
Collateral,"I don't get it. The show needs to continue endlessly for his legacy to be preserved? The man is a legend and the show ending takes nothing away from that.

If anything, this is further proof of what a great host he was. His successor couldn't compete to the point of the show ending.

""This isn't the same without Ferguson. Let's call it a day"""
Collateral,"I vaguely remember watching ""I've got a place down there"" live... Geoff+Craig are some of my favorite comedy shit ever. Pure genius of off the cuff absurdism."
Collateral,It’s funny how most of the coverage of Corden leaving the Late Late Show seems to digress into “remember how funny Ferguson was?”
Collateral,Craig Ferguson will always be my favourite host of any show ever.
Collateral,"A bad take on cracked.com.... what a surprise.

Fucking bozos. James Corden ran it into the ground by being a pos.

Craig was a legend."
Collateral,Craig is my favorite late night host… by a lot. He’s not for everyone but I really like his interactions with guests the most out of the late show hosts.
Collateral,""" I JUST SAW MYSELF IN THE MONITOR!""

&#x200B;

"" ANYONE WANNA GET A HOAGIE OR SOMETHING.. BOPBIPEEBOPBIDDYBOPBO"""
Collateral,"It’s funny to me, I didn’t even think of Craig’s version and Corden’s version as the same show in my head."
Collateral,He should have gotten Fallon’s slot.
Collateral,"Craig was funny and fun… he brought the best out of his guests, never at their expense. He was the very best since Johnny. 

Johnny was the goat to end goats."
Collateral,It’s a great day for America.
Collateral,"Craig Ferguson will always be the king of Late Night to me.

I’m a huge Letterman fan as well, but Craig’s style was so fresh I have to put him at the top."
Collateral,"I was lucky enough to get to go to a taping of Ferguson's Late Late Show in the final season. It was absolutely hilarious. I miss Craig. And Geoff, too.

One of the episodes I was in the audience for. 
https://youtu.be/ioXVgYKC_SQ"
Collateral,"Not really, he will **always** be fondly remembered."
Collateral,Craig Ferguson is the only talkshow host that had actual conversations with guests.
Collateral,That show was for stoners. I loved every second.
Collateral,Lauren Cohen: I told Jeff Goldblum that I had a dream about him singing karaoke and he cried.
Collateral,"I mean... Feguson is a real person, Corden is as fake as they come."
Collateral,I miss Geoff
Collateral,Stopped watching after Craig left.
Collateral,"""We are looking for something more youtube friendly""

Meanwhile, clips of Craig Ferguson are highly viewed and adored by youtube.

TV execs seem to actively hate their own business."
Collateral,Fucking legend. Him and Geoff Petersen and Secretariat.
Collateral,"Ah, when late night television was fun and not all about politics.

Genuinely miss Ferguson and his take on late night. It was such an amazing run."
Collateral,Craig is the best. Love him. Love how he refused to poke fun at Britney at her worst. He had major empathy for her.
Collateral,Balls.
Collateral,Damn I’m glad I grew up on Craig F and Craig K’s hosted versions of The Late Late show and not James Corden
Collateral,Wouldn’t be the first time the English ruined something the Scottish made.
Collateral,Another favorite Craigy Ferg show was the night he and Jeffrey Dean Morgan discovered the joys of facemasks and swearing. https://youtu.be/CjtvhcQcn3A
Collateral,Awkward pause ?
Collateral,WHO’S THAT AT THE DOOR? IT’S SECRETARIAT!
Collateral,"Kind of an over-inflated opinion piece. The 18-34 demographic and even older adult demographics are just not into the traditional late-night talk show anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they start to transition the Late Show, the Tonight show and even Kimmel to a new format in the next few years because of the trend. I know Conan and Ferguson will probably never go back to a TV talk show."
Collateral,"Chlamydia, your dad's here!"
Collateral,"Craig Ferguson was the best of all Late Shows, most of those shows look and feel so fake that are boring but with him the interactions always felt so natural. People felt like glad to be there talking about the smallest things, after he left I only watched Conan and after that no one."
Collateral,Episode with him and Robin Williams talking about chlamydia. They played off each others manic energy so well
Collateral,"He was such a great talk show host, truly funny and kind as well. Honestly he’s who we need right now."
Collateral,Miss his banter with Betty White.
Collateral,"It doesn't really do any damage in my mind. I've never seen Cordon's show, thankfully, so for me the Late Late Show will always be with Craig Ferguson, with a touch of Tom Snyder and Craig Kilborn in the early years"
Collateral,Craigs Autobiogrpahy is pure gold fyi
Collateral,Goddamn I miss Craig Ferguson hosting the Late Late Show. I was wondering why I was thinking about Geoff the robot.
Collateral,"The hustler was great! Watch his films, he’s a screenwriter too!"
Collateral,The Seabiscuit bit had me in tears every time.
Collateral,Craig Ferguson has surpassed late night TV.
Collateral,Love him
Collateral,One ding and we are German. 2 dings and what Geoff?
Collateral,How exactly? His run was great. The show wasn't great before him and wasn't great after. Cancelling doesn't impact that.
Collateral,"What I truly loved about Fergy Craig was that he valued silliness. Man, it’s the end of the day, and if I’m watching Craig Ferguson, it’s past my bedtime. Don’t throw calculated schlock that you taped in advance at me. Be like Craig and Geoff: just goof around and be silly. My brain needs it.  
  
Nowadays, Seth Meyer is the best of the late, late slot. And even so, it’s a lot of outrage and sarcasm. Not what I want while I’m relaxing in bed, not sleeping. Ring a bell, Seth! We are German now!"
Collateral,No its not. The same way Corden killing the show didn't damage Tom Snyder's legacy
Collateral,"Well, I kinda doubt a fucking @midnight reboot lasts in that slot."
Collateral,I don't think it has anything to do with him.  He already moved on from it.  His legacy was secure.
Collateral,RIP CBS Conan…
Collateral,Is cracked still a thing.
Collateral,"I used to record Ferguson because he was so funny, but well past my bedtime."
Collateral,[Thank God I found this!](https://twitter.com/CraigyFerg/status/1623727751344562178?t=Bkwl-C_pyP0w9d0a7MRdug&s=09)
Collateral,"Cheese and rice, I saw this headline & my first thought was ""oh no, did he flippin die or something??"""
Collateral,I loved this show so so so much!
Collateral,The absolute BEST host of the Late Late Show.
Collateral,Does anyone remember Craig Kilborn?
Collateral,Best late night show ever. Hands down.
Collateral,I used to love Cracked magazine in the 80s!
A.I.C.O.,Season 4 was my personal favourite. Autumn Reeser really stepped up.
A.I.C.O.,"Seth Cohen was the best character. Dad goals. 

I loved the show, watched it live when I was 22 or so. I still get happy whenever I see Adam Brody in a movie or show, he was my favorite actor on the show."
A.I.C.O.,[deleted]
A.I.C.O.,mmmmmm watch'a saaaaaay
A.I.C.O.,"My favorite relationship throughout The OC's run isn't a romantic one. It's actually a parental one, and not the one you might think.

The bond between Kirsten and Ryan was so unique and by the end I would argue that they had the most loving relationship of all the characters on the show. In S1 and 2 Kirsten resents the hell out of Ryan. She never wanted this kid from the wrong side of the tracks to enter her perfect life. Then Ryan ends up dating her half-sister- remember that plotline? The intervention for Kirsten's drinking happens at the end of S2. Ryan tells Kirsten that he's concerned for her, and Kirsten replies that Ryan has no room to talk- his mother had drinking and substance issues of her own. Ryan then replies with the most heartbreaking line of the show. ""I know. That's why you took me in.""

Kirsten then breaks down and the scene ends. 

When Kirsten comes back in S3 from rehab, she's written in such a way where the audience can tell she's good with Ryan and accepted him as part of the family. It culminates at the beginning of S4 when Kirsten rides back with Ryan from Mexico. In an earlier season, that would be a Sandy moment, but by that point, it's clear that Kirsten views Ryan as her child just as much as she does Seth, and she's arguably closer with Ryan. It's a really heartwarming turn of events from just two years earlier. 

I will disagree on your rankings OP- S2 is teen soap perfection (Olivia goddamned Wilde, Mmm whatcha say) and S4 is weird in all the right ways between Chris Pratt, Kevin Sorbo, and the GOAT Ryan/Taylor pairing. Ryan was in a fight club!

Meanwhile, I hated S3. The ""move Marissa to a different school"" plotline didn't work because Mischa Barton was the weakest of all the actors in the cast and really could not be the center of a plotline where she had to do the heavy lifting. Johnny is the worst. Jeri Ryan never fits because she was forced on by the network- the Fox execs wanted another female adult character and she was the result."
A.I.C.O.,I love The OC. I’m a huge fan of teen dramas and it’s my favorite rewatch.
A.I.C.O.,"I love the OC, but disagree with you HARD on season 3.  Season 2 was way better imo. Anytime i do a rewatch i just watch the first 2 seasons. I think most people i know do not regard season 3 very well."
A.I.C.O.,"my wife made me watch this when we were dating

I love this show now. Great soundtracks, love the Chrismukkah episodes, Seth and Sandy Cohen are the best"
A.I.C.O.,I shot Rooney a couple years ago and they played ‘I’m Shakin’’...felt like I was at the Bait Shop in an absolute time warp. The music in The OC was *so* good.
A.I.C.O.,Check out outer banks
A.I.C.O.,One of my favorite theme songs of all time!
A.I.C.O.,[deleted]
A.I.C.O.,[removed]
A.I.C.O.,"It was my favorite teen drama when I was younger. I loved the characters, music, friendships, family dynamics... I did however absolutely hate Marissa. Starting S01 really, with the Oliver plot. S04 is my favorite season, for obvious reasons... Despite not being a fan, the S03 finale and the first few episodes of S04 still made me cry all the time. 

Aaand now I want to rewatch it so I don’t thank you."
A.I.C.O.,"I do believe it's on DVD box set in my attic. I remember ripping episodes of it for my GF. After Dawson's creek it filled somewhat of a void. 

Ryan's last big fuck up should have been drunkenly sleeping woth Marissa's mess of a mother."
A.I.C.O.,"100% agree on the final 10 minutes.
Perfect series ending"
A.I.C.O.,"I read this as ""The OA"" and thought it was a shitpost about it getting cancelled early."
A.I.C.O.,Don't call it that.
A.I.C.O.,"The first season is great.  After that it got really soap opera-y.  


They did have some great Indy/alternative music tho"
A.I.C.O.,"Teen Wolf is like the supernatural version of this show. It's almost as if they took the character traits of Ryan, Seth, Marissa and Summer and plopped them into a small town setting with horror elements and werewolves."
A.I.C.O.,Does it have an actual ending or is it a cliffhanger?
A.I.C.O.,"Also, I had this realization when discussing S2 with someone. The show repeats junior year in S2 for Ryan  and the rest of the cast. There is no way they are sophmores in S1. It's just kind of waved over because they wanted to spend three years in the high school setting."
A.I.C.O.,"Great show.  When it was on, I used to relate myself more to the kids but when it's on now I find myself relating more to the parents.  It was super funny for the time and very self-aware toward the end."
A.I.C.O.,"The OA was great too.
So was Oz."
A.I.C.O.,Fun teen show but i liked gossip girl and one tree hill more.
A.I.C.O.,[deleted]
A.I.C.O.,She’s amazing I was a huge Taylor/Ryan fan
A.I.C.O.,"I also liked really Willa Holland. Though I thought she was the worst in Gossip Girl, but after watching this show made me less the hate for her in GG lol."
A.I.C.O.,"Knowing that they were getting cancelled allowed that show to take some cool risks with Chris Pratt, Summer getting political, emo Ryan, Taylor and her ridiculousness, the dream, the earthquake, and the wedding."
A.I.C.O.,"Have you seen Ready or Not (2019)? Adam Brody is playing in his second turn as a satanist, if you remember him in Jennifer's Body (2009) lol. He rocked in it, and is still even handsome."
A.I.C.O.,He’s the reason I still wear Original Penguin shirts to this day.
A.I.C.O.,And chuck.
A.I.C.O.,"Became one of my favorite snl skits

https://youtu.be/vmd1qMN5Yo0"
A.I.C.O.,Came here for this
A.I.C.O.,"Ryan and Sandy is actually mine. It takes forever for Kirsten to accept Ryan, but Sandy is willing to give him a chance, knowing that he can turn his life around and no matter what, he will be there for him. But yes, the bond between Kirsten and Ryan is fantastic as well."
A.I.C.O.,I agree with you entirely. Kirsten crying after Ryan convinces her to go to rehab gets me every time. Same with when Ryan leaves at the end of Season 1.
A.I.C.O.,"I was like a 1, 2 or 4, and then 3. Johnny sucked and Marissa seemed so removed."
A.I.C.O.,"All seasons were good for me though. But Lindsay (Caleb's third daughter) was so boring and so her storyline was too, also the Seth/Zach storyline where they are fighting for Summer was OK, but when Ryan's brother appeared in, all that since was interesting and getting better. I also really liked Marissa/Alex storyline, it made me think Alex could make Marissa more mature person IMO."
A.I.C.O.,I really didn’t like the characters from Marissas new school
A.I.C.O.,"Agree. The correct order is 1, 2, 4, 3."
A.I.C.O.,You didn’t know that Jason Schwartzman used to be the drummer for phantom planet.
A.I.C.O.,"Thank Alexandra Patsavas, the music supervisor for the entire series and she was the reason why the idea of indie music came to be and also the boom that followed. I just skimmed over the Wikipedia for the music and at the peak of the show, they were getting 400-500 CDs a week. I always say that if it wasn't for The OC, I would never know who Death Cab for Cutie or Spoon are."
A.I.C.O.,"I watched it all, but it was just okay imo. The character development was really weird. The 2 characters who fall in love happens in literally 1 episode. Also the whole rich vs poor thing feels played out in these types of shows. I do think some of the characters and arcs were really good though (JJ and his dad, Pope and kiera/ his school, topper's redemption)"
A.I.C.O.,"Ooh, this looks good. Thanks!"
A.I.C.O.,Phantom Planet
A.I.C.O.,?
A.I.C.O.,You'd be surprised. It holds up. I think you have to remind yourself it's a teen melodrama but it's still really sharply written and was kind of groundbreaking in comparison to other teen soaps at that time.
A.I.C.O.,"Woah, back in 2003?! I remember I watched a couple episodes when it was only on TV as a kid and I quite liked it. Kirsten's car accident was last thing to watch on TV and I've waited like a year for another season lol, so I forgot about that. Now I finally watched all episodes from the start to end and I loved it. This show made me wish I were born earlier, I feel bad knowing it's old 17 years old, now they're all like 40 years old lol."
A.I.C.O.,Marissa's mother was the most attractive woman than any from the show IMO. Her green eyes are stunning.
A.I.C.O.,I’ve heard about that too. Is this a good show?
A.I.C.O.,It has a satisfying ending. Don't worry on that front. Writers knew they weren't getting renewed and wrap everything up.
A.I.C.O.,It's a really emotional ending and so much better ending than joke-ending of Gossip Girl.
A.I.C.O.,I have zero clue how Ryan/Taylor worked as well as it did but by the end it was my favorite romantic pairing throughout the show's entire run. Absolute dynamite chemistry- wish they had hit on it in S3.
A.I.C.O.,She did a great job of going from oddball stalking girl to Ryan’s ideal lady friend.
A.I.C.O.,"I've watched The OC, Gossip Girl and Arrow, and out of all of those shows her best performance was on The OC by far. She was 16 years old and going toe-to-toe with actors 10, 20, even 30 years her senior.

Seems like she's not really fond of acting these days, which is a shame, because she is talented. She ditched her series regular role on Arrow a few years ago (after requesting reduced appearances for two years before her departure). She came back to guest star a few times since then, but for the most part she's out of the acting game and publicly shows no desire to jump back in it."
A.I.C.O.,She also voices Aqua in Kingdom Hearts and was of course on Arrow for a long time. I'll always defend her.
A.I.C.O.,"The dream/alt-reality episode was one of my favourites of the whole show. 

Current day watchers of the show might cringe when they see Chris Brown appear in S4 but back then he was completely scandal free."
A.I.C.O.,"I haven't, it's on my watch list. I was surprised and actually cheered when he appeared in Shazam!"
A.I.C.O.,He's SO beautiful and funny and i adored his character so much! Made that movie worth recommending alone
A.I.C.O.,"Heh, that's why I started my comment with ""not the one you might think"". Sandy and Ryan's bond is probably the second thing most people think of when discussing The OC, and for good reason. Peter Gallagher is a great actor and the definitive TV dad for millennials of a certain age. 

But Kirsten is just as good of a character and doesn't get the acclaim she deserves because of how cold she is towards Ryan in the first two seasons. If you care about these characters, that intervention scene hits like a truck, particularly since you've been watching Kirsten be self-destructive all season. 

What sets The OC apart from other teen soaps is at the core of the show, there are four people who genuinely care about one another and will never be torn apart. That is so rare in this genre (I watch too many of these stupid things), and what's even rarer is a healthy, loving mother/son relationship."
A.I.C.O.,"A lot of it felt forced and also remember in The OC, which I do see a lot of influence from, Marissa and Ryan fell for each other right away, but the class differences kept them from getting together at first too. Also, I'm guessing that creators were ready in case it didn't get renewed, so they had to rush something."
A.I.C.O.,Funny thing is no one asked your opinion
A.I.C.O.,Man it was FANTASTIC. Wife and I binged it in 2 days.
A.I.C.O.,"As someone who vacationed in the area for years, the only thing that really threw me off was the fact that there were palm trees, but other than that, it really felt like the Outer Banks. The creators did a good job of creating it's own local lore, something that the island is know for, and also paying homage to the real place as well."
A.I.C.O.,there theme song
A.I.C.O.,Summer Roberts in the Wonder Woman outfit......
A.I.C.O.,She’s in Nikita as one of the main characters
A.I.C.O.,And a bitch
A.I.C.O.,"Season 1 is pretty low budget because it was back when MTV was slowly dipping their toes into scripted drama. The CGI is horrid. You can tell they were afraid to funnel too much money into it.

Once the show became their ratings hit, MTV boosted the budget. Every season after 2 has good production value, comparable to what the CW shows look like. 

I'd recommend the show to anyone that likes teen dramas. Some shows struggle with getting their audience to connect with the characters, but on Teen Wolf it's easy to fall in love with the core cast."
A.I.C.O.,"Same, they're just so fun together. I think it worked so well because she pulled out of Ryan things nobody else did/could have. He starts making more jokes, becomes a thoughtful romantic; he's visibly happier than with any of his other girlfriends throughout the show.

I just finished my rewatch this morning so finding this post is kinda freaky, but nice way to let out my thoughts, I've been thinking about how much I love it all day."
A.I.C.O.,One of the better actors on arrow for sure which is impressive considering she was one of the youngest
A.I.C.O.,"Best moment is when you think, maybe, just maybe, they got Mischa Barton back but nope, Willa Holland steps off the plane. Great stuff."
A.I.C.O.,"They were attracted to each other right away, but it took a few episodes before she admitted that she liked him and then even more before they got together. Outer Banks went from John being pissed at Sarah to making out with her in an episode. The other issue is that the chapel Hill episode felt very forced. John b was so gung ho about finding his dad, but then all of a sudden was chilling with Sara in a light-hearted fashion show. It just felt off tonally. Granted ,that's a small gripe of the show, and i can understand why they did it since it's a 10 episode season and wasn't the main focus"
A.I.C.O.,rofl that came out of nowhere
A.I.C.O.,But a bad ass sexy one though.
A.I.C.O.,"The heat that's always on display when they're together is just insane. It makes sense. These are two stupidly attractive people. It should feel like they should want to tear each other's clothes off at any given moment.

I watched Veronica Mars for the first time last summer and Veronica/Logan reminded me quite a bit of Ryan/Taylor in terms of the passion between them."
A.I.C.O.,I also liked the idea that Ryan gave Marrisa some extra years of life because she would’ve died in Tijuana without him.
A.I.C.O.,"I agree with the Chapel Hill episode, it just felt like filler or the writers just ran out of ideas because there's no ferry that runs to that area. The closest ferry is three hours away in Swan Quarter."
A.I.C.O.,Lmaoooo
A.I.C.O.,"Another one is Lois and Clark in Smallville. The chemistry is so great it feels like they fall in love from the moment they meet, and it just takes them multiple seasons to realise."
A.I.C.O.,"One of the producers has been trying to get something going for a 4-5 years now but with very little luck. He's active on the Stargate reddits and gives us updates every so often.

If you want to try to get it made then send an email to Amazon Studios and tell them your thoughts about Stargate."
A.I.C.O.,"At a guess, it's stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Do you cater to the existing audience, who is likely very small and limited in room the grow, but who are desperate for more Stargate content. But this means 15 odd years of show lore for newcomers to wrap their head around, and a universe where a lot of the massive issues had already been dealt with.

Or a reboot, which would cater more to new and casual fans, but could upset the originals' fans because it can never live up to the legacy as it exists in their heads."
A.I.C.O.,"So Amazon bought MGM and all the rights to the IP as far as I know.

Someone who was heavily involved in the making of the three series (I think Brad Wright) did an AMA recently and said he was asked to write a pilot or some ideas for a new series but it wasn’t picked up.

I think whatever they do with the IP they want it to be a big franchise similar to Marvel etc (more comparable to Star Trek on TV I guess) so they’re probably biding their time to make sure they get it right."
A.I.C.O.,Indeed.
A.I.C.O.,"I just finished a rematch of SG1 and Atlantis a few days ago, dying for a new show now.

I looked it up ad apparently the potential project that was being discussed isn't going forward, but Amazon might still be doing something with the IP

I really hope it ends up being a continuation and not a full on reboot. I'd like to see something set in the same universe but during the 2020s (so moved on in real time)"
A.I.C.O.,"The fun of stargate is its kinda campy/goofy.  It would be hard to make a sci fi big budget show like that today.

I would say the tone would have to by like Guardians of the Galaxy.  Fun, action, jokes. With the visuals of the expanse."
A.I.C.O.,"Well, I love Stargate, but I’m kinda glad there isn’t anything new. A lot of these new versions of older series are kinda meh or not in the spirit of the older series."
A.I.C.O.,Cost and a limited fan base.
A.I.C.O.,Because Stargate: Origins was a bomb and barely anyone signed up for Stargate: Command.
A.I.C.O.,"Part of the issue is that a lot of these properties end up being seen as property in the real estate sense, so putting them out of commission effectively allows them to do fancy accounting to make money from doing nothing. This is the kind of limbo that a lot of HBO stuff is falling into right now, but it has been fairly common across Sci-fi and Fantasy that this kind of thing happens.

That said, it would be tough to re-visit the series without doing a lot of heavy-lifting writing wise because there are a lot of things that were left un-questioned, un-explored that frankly can't be. (The military has a secret space navy and is performing interstellar diplomacy/colonialism without civilian/public oversight, the Russians are involved and we've been giving them sci-fi power plants/weapons, etc.)"
A.I.C.O.,"If Universe hadn't gone the grim/dour path of shows around that time, and kept the adventure and fun, we'd probably have a new Stargate show by now. I watched the first season, it had some good ideas, but I disliked just about everyone on the show. I just lost interest by the time the second rolled around. It just wasn't fun to watch people being miserable and angry with each other on a constant basis, and I tuned out. 

I'm hoping for a continuation and not a reboot. There's so much lore, characters and interesting stuff in the SG1 universe, it shouldn't be dumped for a new entry."
A.I.C.O.,"I don’t know. I just recently started watching Stargate. I stared with the movie, loved it! Then started the series and couldn’t get past how corny the costumes were in comparison. 

I plan to go back to it again because the first few episodes were not horrible, but they didn’t keep my interest like the movie. 

I feel like I fucked up watching the movie first and expecting the effects out of the series."
A.I.C.O.,"I think the question is: do you want a bad Stargate series or none at all?

I'm still annoyed at Star Trek lol"
A.I.C.O.,"I love SG-1, one of my favorite shows of all time.  And I liked Atlantis and Universe.  I would absolutely be excited for more Stargate.  But also, it's not that old.  Universe went off the air in 2011.  I'm good with giving it another 5-10 years before a reboot."
A.I.C.O.,">how even the costumes are better than even something released two decades later ""Witcher cough Netflix crap""

You need review the episodes of both. Sorry but no. Its NOT true. Not at all."
A.I.C.O.,[deleted]
A.I.C.O.,"If they would just pick up where Stargate Universe left off I'd be happy. It takes care of most of the issues people mention. Star ships, powerful earth etc. They are literally lost in space."
A.I.C.O.,I ask myself this all the time! Here's to making my username relevant again
A.I.C.O.,"I want more stargate, but I know I am in the minority as I loved universe. It was much more dark & centered then the other series & they could bring it back at any point. Just mechanical failures crossing the void space making it take longer with crew dying off. Could even have another gate opened to the ship with new cast introduced for those who wouldn't return."
A.I.C.O.,All I know is I want it set in the world that they already created. A reboot holds absolutely no interest for me.

Borderliner,My husband pointed out that it's a bunch of chucklefucks blundering their way through a D&D campaign and it's really helped me appreciate it.
Borderliner,"I just think the show lacks good characters and the storytelling and tone are inconsistent. The movie was fun but this almost feels like it’s trying *too* hard to be fun… but then it also has scenes where silly, quirky forest ladies in denim are introduced then immediately butchered."
Borderliner,Its sequel to a movie where the baby makes “Jim faces” at the camera from time to time reacting to whats going on. Didn’t these people watch it first?
Borderliner,I love the film. The show just isn’t clicking with me though. I watched the first 4 episodes and that’s enough for me. A scene that stands out for me is when Willow and Sorsha were sitting at a table and talking about Elora and some future danger. I thought the acting from Warwick there was just awful.
Borderliner," It's consistent with the film. People expecting it to be serious high fantasy are in for a disappointment. The original film is almost nonstop forward motion from one bumbling situation to another. Mad Martigan was a good swordsman but in four sequential events has a baby stolen from him, pretends to be a woman, falls in love with his enemy due to a love potion, and becomes a human snowball as he falls head over heels down a cliff."
Borderliner,"I am a huge fan of the original film. The new show lacks a certain reverence for its own fantasy setting that is a bit jarring. People were less aloof and the magic was more substantial. As a fan of the original, I was disappointed with Episode 1 as it missed the potential completely.

However; what they did make is fun to watch. The characters are even dumber than in the original film, and there is more fantasy shenanigans than before.

I don’t like that every character has a rich backstory that they are weaving into the main plot. Everything is too explicitly connected and the outcomes too conveniently line up with the storytelling goals. Jade is a Bone Reaver? Well that whole situation is a bit of a ribbon.

Anyway— it’s fantasy and pretty fun. It’s missing the heart and mystery of the original that made it work. I’m a watch it though."
Borderliner,"Sorry. It's not in tone with the movie. Just because the movie had some comedy doesn't mean it was a slapstick, bad acting, poor writing, sitcom.

People were dirty and desperate. There was an attempt in the movie to still be in a fantasy medieval universe. 

No one expects LOTR or GOT. Willow is to those projects what Star Wars is to 2001. There's humor in Star Wars and Willow but it isn't goofy and wink at the camera shit."
Borderliner,My turnoff is the modern day music covers in a fantasy show. Takes me out of it.
Borderliner,"Its CW fantasy. Which is like ""YA"" but turned up a notch."
Borderliner,The Willow NES game was good.
Borderliner,"I vaguely liked Willow the movie, and its frustrating that the show sometimes seems to have a glimmer of the movie but then its gone. The show is both leaning too heavily on references to the movie, and yet also feels like a pointless sequel at the same exact time!

It doesn't have the light hearted playful feel of the movie, instead we have DUMB MCU quips style humour and Elora acting like an airhead.

The pop song covers feel totally out of place, Black Hole Sun? REALLY? Damn do an orchestral score.

I think what the show is missing most is the earnest feel the original had, there was not a hint of meta or irony in the movie."
Borderliner,I was shocked at how bad Warwick Davis's acting was. I wonder what went wrong. I half expected a Gervais laugh and for the camera to pan around.
Borderliner,"I made a previous comment in another thread that I will past below. I do want to address certain points.

&#x200B;

>I thought useful to remind (or warn) that Willow does not aim to compete with House of Dragons, Rings of Power or the Witcher.

I am not sure who was thinking this? The original movie was a campy adventure. The TV show (I am a few episodes behind) have not been campy. The episodes I have seen lack the heart and the magic of the original. The dialogue has been atrocious and much of the acting has simply not been that good. Warwick has been fine (even though I don't like the direction of his character so far, but he has acted the hell out of it).  It seems like everyone else is written with too modern vernacular and use words and phrases that don't fit in a fantasy universe. It also doesn't help that every actor has pristine clothes and make up/hair from the episodes I've seen.

&#x200B;

>Not in budget

I don't know the show's budget, but this is not a low budget show.

&#x200B;

>The show we got is an anachronistic pastiche of fantasy, where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent

Who in the original were frauds or borderline incompetent?

&#x200B;

* Willow wants to be a sorcerer, but has had no prior training. He clearly struggles to perform magic and relies on parlor tricks, but that's not being a fraud or incompetent, that's just where his character is in the movie.
* Madmartigan is legit an amazing swordsmen. Maybe not the greatest as he claims, but he is established as a reputable fighter. The fact that he is a rogue/scoundrel that makes poor decisions does not make him a fraud or incompetent. Willow knew it was a bad idea to leave Elora with him, but did so against his better judgment so he could get home.
* Fin Raziel and Bavmorda were both powerful sorceresses with Bavmorda just being more powerful.
* The Brownies were comic relief, but I wouldn't consider them frauds or incompetent.
* Kael, Sorsha, Airk, etc. all serve their roles relatively well too.

&#x200B;

Previous comment:

I am two episodes behind so my opinion might change depending on those episodes.  
  
I love Willow. I had the VHS (I didn't have many), and it was something that I watched a lot. I probably rewatch it about once a year too. In my mind, Willow was a grand epic fantasy. The special effects were not great and definitely dated, but General Kael had the coolest helmet, Airk's sword was badass, and Madmartigan was the greatest swordsmen who ever lived. It had everything (obviously I am exaggerating, and I agree its world building is lacking). That being said, I thought the acting was all solid to great (in the context of this kind of movie), and the dialogue worked.  
  
I like Willow the TV show, but I wanted to love it. I am just not there. The dialogue is really bad and the performances are stiff. Kit, Airk, and Elora are all particularly not well acted. Their dialogue relies on too many modern or colloquial phrases that take you out of the fantasy. Those performances feel like bad actors at a renaissance fair.  
  
I don't feel like the TV show has any of the camp of the original. What the TV show lacks is heart. Willow was an unlikely hero that left his family behind for a baby he just met. Madmartigan is a scoundrel of sorts, but you knew he meant well. I don't think any character has displayed any of this kind of heart so far."
Borderliner,My only real issue with willow is the odd modern music choices. Otherwise I feel it’s been a better show than wheel of time and rings of power.
Borderliner,I started watching the first episode but became disinterested in it about half way through. I'm going to wait until the first season is done and give it another go though. The movie was one of my favorites growing up.
Borderliner,"My wife and I like it. As fantasy fans, it fills that hole between seasons of other shows and, in my opinion, is not as terrible as others pitch it to be. Like someone mentioned before, it's kinda like watching an actual D&D adventure where they are terrible and competent enough to avoid a TPK. *shrugs* Different strokes for different folks."
Borderliner,"The show and characters are written badly. But the biggest issue I have is the strange use of modern music covers in it. It's completely out of tone with the movie and really even the show.

Hearing the musical tones of the original Willow movie in the trailer for the new show got me really excited, the movie music really ""made"" the adventure. But what they chose to do for the show, it's just awful."
Borderliner,I watched the 1st episode and wtf is this? I loved the movie where's the charm? It felt like a CW show
Borderliner,"It reminds me of the fun fantasy shows I watched as a kid, like Xena and Hercules (but younger). It’s a fun, silly show."
Borderliner,Willow? Classic. Boorman? Great comedic relief. Elora Danan? Quickly becoming the star. Graydon? Annoying but mysterious. Jade? A badass. But holy shit I cringe every time Kit talks.
Borderliner,"There's a different between silly but coherent and, every character is written poorly, the plot is written poorly and is a contrived mess, and the fight choreography is also trash. You're honestly doing a disservice to the fantasy genre as a whole if you just accept trash and run cover for it."
Borderliner,"I loved the movie when it came out, I was a teenager at the time. But you know, sometimes I like leaving the past in the past. I'm passing on the series."
Borderliner,Yeah all that. But it's still shit though.
Borderliner,It seems like you're arguing against a straw man here. No one cares that it's intended to be silly. They care that it isn't very good even at that.
Borderliner,"It is wild to me how many people I'm seeing complain it's somehow disrespectful of the movie *and* that it's not serious and deep enough. 

It sure sounds like a lot of people who've never actually watched the movie are complaining it ain't faithful to it, because boy have I news for you about the tone and style of the movie Willow."
Borderliner,Nah Willow the movie was one of my favorite childhood movies and I don't need this series to exist. This is a case of ignorance being bliss.
Borderliner,I loved the original movie.  I've seen it dozens of times.  Even named my cat Madmartigan.  The problem with Willow is awful writing and acting.  Especially Ellie Bamber.
Borderliner,Warwick Davis is likely the worst actor that I have ever seen act.
Borderliner,"I loved the movie and it was one of my favorites of all time.

As i didnt ever think any show or new movie will be made i was surprised.

I kept my expectations low so i dont get disappointed, and i liked the show. But i didnt love it as the movie. But im still glad it was made."
Borderliner,"Except the TV show is not at all similar to the movie - that's the main problem. The movie is endearing, charming, the TV series is genzfied shite with modern music."
Borderliner,"Nah, I was very hopeful going into this.  i can safely say this time the critics have it right.  The only good thing about this show was the music in the credits at the end of the first 4 episodes, I'd say more but I stopped watching it.  Its just not good.  Set design is very poor quality and the monsters would have been better off as muppets instead of plastic action figures on sticks.  This show spent alot of money on actors and musical scores but completely checked out in CGI."
Borderliner,"> where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent, unable to live up to the expectations, and yet, against all odds, manage to pull through.

The writers are writing what they know. Terrible at their job yet somehow failed upwards to a high profile project."
Borderliner,"It's because it is YA fantasy.
Movie came out in 1988, us fans of the original Willow are 35 y/o or more but Disney chose to do a show for teenagers.
I feel weird watching it. Teenagers drama, silly and stupid adults, lame villains, etc. 

Not really for me..."
Borderliner,"I love the movie, and I also love this show."
Borderliner,"I'd never seen the original movie, but attempted the show. I only made it about 5 minutes in. The beginning sword match on the cliff felt like watching Liam Neeson [climb a fence](https://youtu.be/gCKhktcbfQM). As the first ""action"" scene, it gave me no hope for future choreography.

 Then in the first 2 dialogs, one person is speaking in an English accent, and the other in an American accent, which threw me off and made it feel poorly acted. Not knowing the back story of whether or not that was movie accurate for some reason, made me nope out of the show. 

Maybe it wasn't for me, maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but Disney+ is extremly hit or miss on quality. Willow did not give me hit vibes."
Borderliner,"Have you seen the original film?

It's everything you've just described."
Borderliner,It doesn't succeed at all! The fantasy world they created it doesn't make sense and it seems they even didn't know how it is. The characters seem from another reality. They changed the movie ending and give a twist that doesn't work. I don't like anything about it.
Borderliner,I made it 15 minutes into episode one. Not my speed.
Borderliner,"Finally an understanding review of this show. It's intentionally using lingo from our time but set in a medieval style time period. I like how they blatantly mix American English and British English and have a little bit of a sitcom response to a lot of stuff. I think people that watch it need to rewatch willow and remember just how slapstick it really was at times...
  ""Not a woman?...not a woman!?"" 
""Gentlemen.        Meet Lug."" 

And ""I love you sorsha? I don't love that woman she tried to kill me."""
Borderliner,"I'm so sick of modern fan based. Nothing is good enough for them. Even if Lord of the Rings trilogy came out today they would tear it apart for the dialog and failure to hold true to Tolkien in his entirety. Nostalgia for old movies has ruined fan bases ability to enjoy new chapters or attempts.

Willow the series is right in line with the original film and is as enjoyable. The one gripe I have is the lack of Val Kilmer cameo which I'm holding hope for on season two or end credits of the season finale."
Borderliner,"Why do people just not watch it. So much other content in the digital world.. 

Watching it with my son and he is enjoying it. Maybe it’s not written/aimed at you. Maybe it’s not meant to be like that show you really like. 

I’ve had lots of shows I’ve enjoyed but they were cancelled and I’ve had shows I hated that have went on for years. 

Try it don’t like it move on. Can apply that to life and the world will rotate all the same."
Borderliner,"I was the right age to see the original in theatres and LOVED IT. So I'm good with the series,Im just happy to be back and not even irked by some terrible plot decisions. And c'mon, where are the book readers? I was thrilled to find out there was a second book, and they slaughter all my favorite people? In the first chapter?! So yep, happy to have my silly TV show..."
Borderliner,I keep thinking did they watch the 1st film?
Borderliner,"It's entertaining. I can't take it seriously, but other than the random pop songs, I've enjoyed watching it."
Borderliner,"I genuinely don't understand why Hollywood takes beloved franchises with an established fanbase, gives it to people who despise the franchise and fanbase, and then let them use the name as a marketing gimmick for their own original story that would have never been greenlit as an original piece..."
Borderliner,"Willow is a fun and entertaining show.  It is the best fantasy I've seen since the LotR movies.  The only thing that comes close is Vox Machina.

It is not the grim and ponderous fantasy that so many other shows and movies produce."
Borderliner,"Which part of the original movie was silly? The killing kids part? The constant attacks on innocent villages? The man who wears a skull as a mask?

Oh wait, that one scene of Val Killer in drag. The one where he nearly gets raped. Got it.

The new show doesn't even make sense as a sequel to the film. It's a fine CW show though."
Borderliner,"Willow is hot garbage. It has nothing to do with not trying to be house of dragons. I love the film. Costumes are junk and it feels like they are trying to force it down gen z's throat.

You say willow is supposed to be silly and I agree. It loses that when the characters take them selves so seriously."
Borderliner,"Honestly I like Willow more than House of the Dragon. Willow isn’t going to win any awards, but it’s classic fantasy and we’ve seen a lot of character progression so far. The more good fantasy on tv the better."
Borderliner,"I'll admit to being a bit disappointed. I like the cast, I like the cinematography, and I can even accept the denim as just more world building, but they're all over the place with tone. The little rock song at the end of each episode is ok, but when they use one for a action scene during the show it cheapens the world a bit and the characters feel a little less grounded in their world. (which means I care less about them) I'm also really confused about the pacing. The first season is almost over and they're supposed to be on this super long quest that will take them all over their world but it seems like they are still in the forest surrounding their Kingdom 6 episodes in. Plus, this is the third or fourth time an episode has ended with someone being abducted."
Borderliner,"The problem is how they're making a joke of the source material(in angsty unfunny ways) and hamhocking every boring modern teenage drama trope into every boring fantasy trope 

This is corporate willow."
Borderliner,">But it you're going to watch it, I'd suggest to wait and binge it, or to watch it very casually with an open mind. Or you know, put it aside if it's not your thing. That's ok too.

Why can't we watch it and criticize its shortcomings and bad writing?

Art subjected to the public for scrutiny (and money) doesn't mean it shouldn't have its faults pointed out just because you don't like people saying it."
Borderliner,"The hate for Willow seems obvious.   This version has POC and LBGTQ characters.   There's a group online that's always going to downvote that.  Pretty sad way to go through life.    


Personally I find it fun, light entertainment, and that's fine.   There's been a couple of really great callbacks, some interesting twists on the characters, and the action is solid."
Borderliner,It's better than rings of power. And thats a lot more than I would have expected about a Willow show filled with angsty teens
Borderliner,"People just have ridiculous standards for genre shows nowadays. I'm absolutely loving all the fantasy stuff coming out, Rings of Power, Wheel of Time, and Willow have all been good watches. Having watched House of the Dragon yet cause I got burnt out hard on Game of Thrones, books and TV series, and just want to read the last few books and be done with it. But I'll probably eventually check it out. 

If people held genre shows in the 90s to the same standards they hold modern shows to, they'd hate every single one. Not in terms of special effects or cinematography, standards for those in TV have obviously gone up, but more timeless things like acting and writing. Shows like DS9 and TNG and Babylon 5 were all very good, but they all had some bad episodes, they all had bland beginnings, they all had corny dialog and 2d/inconsistent characters sometimes. And the next tier down in quality, like Voyager and Stargate and Xena and Hercules? All that stuff was way more common.

People want every show to be a mix of a top budget blockbuster movie cinematography and effects and action sequences and the Sopranos level writing and that just isn't gonna happen that often. Generally things with a really big budget have to try for a lot of mainstream appeal so they're gonna seem pretty bland and not have such complex and interesting characters as something like the Wire or Breaking Bad. Creating characters like that and not having them fall flat is very hard, and the people with the talent to do it are usually more interested in creating their own original stuff, not adapting a fantasy novel from 30 years ago or making a sequel series to a film from 35 years ago.

It's astounding for me that people bitch about fantasy shows now, having grown up with Xena and Hercules being pretty much the only fantasy on TV. People bitching seem to rather there would be no fantasy shows rather than accept that not every show is gonna have literature-level writing and Academy Award level acting. You don't need those things to make an enjoyable show, and if your personal standards are that high you need to accept most shit is not going to be to your liking. And if you want magic and elves and monsters and chosen ones in your shows AND top level acting and writing, you are generally gonna be disappointed because most of the super talented writers are not big on reusing such worn tropes."
Borderliner,"I dunno, I think it's neat xD"
Borderliner,I thought willow was fun to watch but I'm pretty easy going 🤷🏼
Borderliner,Is it meant to be dogshit?
Borderliner,Willow is a movie that was ruined for many when they rewatched it at middle age. It's not fantastic but it is a fun romp for a child.
Borderliner,But it's not silly. It's cynical. It's trite.
Borderliner,"Yeah, I think the problem is that many people are like me and never saw the original ... so they just expect it to be like every other fantasy thing out these days. From RoP to TWoT to The Witcher ... we have a lot of shows trying (and mostly failing) to be big budget big deal serious shows. This is goofy and campy and not meant to be super serious ... I noticed this when they kept flashing back to the story of Willow and showing how silly the story was.

&#x200B;

I personally enjoy Willow for what it is, if only because I could watch Erin Kellyman play something as mindmelting as CoD on Twitch for 2.5hrs as long as she has a face cam. It's a fun lil show, not much else to say about it."
Borderliner,I'm enjoying it. Not all fantasy has to be high brow and serious. This is fun.
Borderliner,"I wish people would stop making excuses for trash.

If you like the trash, then have you're guilty pleasure.

Don't try to feed me shit and tell me it's chocolate"
Borderliner,"Yeah, no. It’s pure trash. It’s like they dropped a group of teenagers from 2022 on set, dressed them up and just called it a day. They speak like someone from 2022, they behave like someone from 2022, the cringe pop music… And let’s not forget Kit. Her character is enough for anyone to drop watching the show."
Borderliner,"I don't think people remember fantasy in the pre-Game of Thrones era.  Fantasy usually doesn't have that kind of wide range appeal. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are more the exception than the rule.

But with GoT being such a hit a lot of fantasy projects are being greenlit and, surprise, people are all comparing it to GoT and if it isn't at that level it's being considered garbage.

Personally I'm enjoying it. I enjoy lighthearted fantasy and I don't need shakespearean actors going on long monologues or speeches to get into it. Or nudity or gore or grimdark stuff. That's fun and all but it's just one type of fantasy.

The great thing about fantasy is it's fantasy. It doesn't have to try and be a period piece. It's on an alternate world. Willow wears denim. They say ""shit"". Whatever"
Borderliner,Willow is great
Borderliner,"I'm actually really enjoying the Willow series, and I think it's native ""campiness"" and anachronism is a huge part of that."
Borderliner,"I had never seen the movie before but based on reviews I was seeing of the show, I thought it must be some really serious and epic fantasy story. I then watched the movie before starting the series and it was not at all what I was expecting. Definitely very silly, very corny, and has that weird '80s thing where the plot somehow moves forward and characters know what they're supposed to do even though there is little dialogue and what dialogue there is makes little sense. I think many folks are looking at the movie with rose colored glasses from their childhood. I actually like the show better than the movie, though I don't love the Kit character."
Borderliner,It’s a kids bland fantasy show. Ruined the original vision of willows world. Now it’s just the hills with bow and arrows
Borderliner,"I actually adore this show having not been born when the first came out and being around the same age as the current young cast! I feel like I may be one of the only ones who do enjoy it at this point though reading through tweets and comments. It very much gives me that same child like wonderment as Narnia did for me when I was a kid, but with some levelled up humour. It’s silly, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. I can put it on and relax unlike GOT but I still get whisked away to another world. I watch a lot of very serious stuff and I’m not a huge comedy person but this just hits the spot! It’s also nice to see a girly person like Elora be featured because I can see myself in her! Just my 2 cents"
Borderliner,"It’s literally the same tone as the film, I grew up watching Willow and while the show isn’t as good as Willow it still tries to capture that same goofy spirit it always had.

I introduced my girlfriend and her daughter to Willow last week and they watched the movie for the first time then went straight into the show and love it, it’s a silly goofy story with moments of intense terror and drama and always has been"
Borderliner,"I have only watched two episodes, but my problem with it pretty much started at the beginning. I don’t like how they used the most cliched trope for Elora Danan by having to hide her as a kitchen maid and having her and the fukboi prince being “in love”. Like please. Plus making her a blonde was unnecessary too. She’s supposed to be the “savior” of the realm or whatever and they made her a love sick ninny. I’m not mad, just disappointed."
Borderliner,"You can do cheap, you can do pastiche, you can do whatever, but you'll fail when you are an incompetent writer and underestimate the ability of your consumers to use at least the most basic of logic thinking."
Borderliner,"It's a mockery of storytelling, acting, direction and production.

The Critical Drinker explains it thoroughly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLRHR2Nou8A"
Borderliner,"I don't understand the negative impressions, either.   The characters make me care about them, the actors have some nice charisma and chemistry, and the energy and music work well.  Willow's incompetence really sells it for me, it feels refreshing and new.

The other three you mentioned all fail to get my attention.   HoD has RR's lack of a protagonist, RoP has not a single character I wouldn't mind seeing killed (go Orcs!), and Witcher doesn't even try to be consistent or sensical.

But I watch Willow asap, and have ended each episode with energy each time.  The song Crimson and Clover had me singing along."
Borderliner,[deleted]
Borderliner,"I love it.

Except the music. The absolute modernity of the music is just weirdly clashing for me. Everything else though, I'm loving it."
Borderliner,"I've indirectly rewatched the movie and the new show through YT reactions with ""Heroes Reforged"" and the show definitely seems fun.

I have been finding a lot of the jokes surprisingly funny but it's probably because I like sarcasm / dry humor, like they aren't quite MCU-level quips which can get annoying when done so much.

It definitely doesn't take itself too seriously which is a good thing. I'm obviously not sitting through entire episodes at length and only getting bits and pieces but what I have seen seems enjoyable."
Borderliner,I thoroughly enjoyed the series.
Borderliner,"The movie sucked. I remember being so horribly disappointed by it. That disappointment faded quickly, though, as I could easily forget about the movie. 

I was quite surprised to read about Willow reappearing. Also annoyed at being reminded of its existence. Won't be punishing myself by watching it."
Borderliner,"Downvoted for “anachronistic pastiche”. We get it dude, you read"
Borderliner,You Highness doesn’t aim to compete with those shows either but it works as a fantasy movie and doesn’t have the same critiques as this show.
Borderliner,"There are people who like soft fantasy too. Me, for one."
Borderliner,I just want a good HBO adaptation of The First Law series is that so much to ask? God damn it.
Borderliner,"> where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent, unable to live up to the expectations, and yet, against all odds, manage to pull through. 

Is that an uncommon thing in fantasy? Because I feel like there are a lot of good stories with that sort of plot. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Amigos, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life, etc."
Borderliner,"What’s hilarious to me is when they realized they messed up by keeping Elora’s hair color blonde, and had to make it “magically” turn red in the most recent episodes. Who’s running this show and why? 😂😂"
Borderliner,"i love the show SO MUCH. i’ve been waiting for this type of fantasy genre to return since my childhood days and i couldn’t be happier to finally get a diverse cast, actually funny dialogue (most of the time lol), and less actiony fantasy. not every fantasy story needs intense stressful action scenes for the majority of the plot to be good (i personally can’t stand those types). if you like goofy and magical fantasy stories, you’ll love Willow."
Borderliner,"I just finished the season finale, and I will say, I really loved this series.  It wasn't fully in the same sense as the original movie was, but it hit enough points of it that it hit my nostalgia.  It put a lot of odd modern day social sayings it it, which threw me off, but in the end I became very invested in watching it.  The way they ended each episode also was weird, but enjoyable.  My only gripe so far is that the cinematographers have no idea how to do low light scenes.  


I want to say more, but I'm trying to avoid any form of a spoiler."
Borderliner,"> a bunch of chucklefucks blundering their way through a D&D campaign

So basically a DnD campaign."
Borderliner,Please let the DnD movie be good...
Borderliner,Yeah exactly. The show’s just a fun time.
Borderliner,"I’ve enjoyed Willow. I like how they’ve interwoven the movie and show. I thought episode 3 & 4 were pretty good. 

Is it Shakespeare? No."
Borderliner,"Exactly this. The prodigy couldn't do magic for two whole episodes. Boreman has snaked his way out of so much bullshit, he can't keep it straight anymore. Pure D & D shenanigans."
Borderliner,This is also basically the plot of The Legend of Vox Machina.
Borderliner,"Legend of the Seeker did this, only LOS was fucking outrageously good. Better than it should have bee,"
Borderliner,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSynJyq2RRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSynJyq2RRo)  Chucklefucks playing Dnd
Borderliner,This is the best way to describe the show haha
Borderliner,It really was.  Each character felt like someone playing around a table.  I think that's another thing that kept me invested.
Borderliner,"This - all the characters are unlikable - Disney has once again taken an old hero , made him tired and broken and lost their light in order to prop up new characters .  I honestly though they learned their lesson with SW that you don't need to shit on the past to make a new promising future. 

All the new characters are really unlikable except maybe the curly haired girl and the criminal Axe guy .

The subura forester lesbians were probably the best characters so far even if they were COMPLETELY out of place like random time travels in the woods .   I knew they were dead the second i was like O hey they are interesting ."
B: The Beginning,I am intrigued 
B: The Beginning,But we already know [Killer B.] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/6/63/Killer_B.png)
B: The Beginning,this seems to be interesting. for many years i haven't watched anime...maybe it's time to start again. i'm putting this on my list
B: The Beginning,"I like Production IG but this feels like a clash of styles. Some of the characters look like they belong in something like FMA, while characters like Keith look like someone Shinichiro Watanabe would design."
B: The Beginning,#[KIRA B](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Light_from_Death_Note.jpg)
B: The Beginning,"I was re-watching Ghost in the Shell this week and found out the same producers were coming out with this on Friday. I'm pretty excited, lets hope Netflix' original anime series go well enough for them to be a major player eventually"
B: The Beginning,[removed]
B: The Beginning,Jesus this is an unnecessary dark and gritty prequel to Bee Movie.
B: The Beginning,"Interesting but then the 70 part monster anime really blue balled me at the end. So much time investment, such a terrible ending "

B: The Beginning,[removed]
B: The Beginning,Method directing
B: The Beginning,"A lot of people in these comments are straight up making things up about what is happening behind the scenes, and not only about this show for some reason."
B: The Beginning,This seems cruel to do to cast/crew.
B: The Beginning,"The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if  he says otherwise. I'm suspecting that some disagreements with HBO will come to light sooner or later."
B: The Beginning,I mean if they were told before they could be searching other jobs for after the show ended. I would be pissed.
B: The Beginning,"I wonder if this could wind up being a case like where the Closer became Major Crimes after a change of leads, and nothing else."
B: The Beginning,Boar on the floor.
B: The Beginning,Cant make a finale without breaking a few Shivs
B: The Beginning,"Either the people involved with this show have just been constantly working us, or it seems like one of the more toxic workplaces out there haha. God damn."
B: The Beginning,Someone pointed out that it's probably not a good sign that the main stars couldn't tell that it was a finale' after reading the script........
B: The Beginning,There had been rumors before that the show will continue without Cox and it kind of explains why he is happy it's over. It feels like this how Logan would've ended things too.
B: The Beginning,"I don't understand how anyone can watch season 3 and think ""surely there can be a season 5"", they rehashed so much stuff from season 2, Kendall's depression, his flirting with suicide, they undid so much of season 2 for season 3 to even have a plot and they upped Logan's plot armor to a ridiculous degree. They built up that FBI investigation like it was going to be hell for the company and then it was nothing, it served only as a tease to prolong the season and accomplished absolutely nothing. And the Skarsgaard plot point is nonsense one episode they want to buy his company, the next he can buy them... somehow."
B: The Beginning,The cast should have been notified way before the finale to prepare.  I know I would want to know if my job was ending.
B: The Beginning,"On one hand you get to enjoy working on the season without the feeling of dread knowing it's going to end.

On the other hand, this is cruel for those who need to constantly audition for new jobs and could've missed out on a new gig."
B: The Beginning,"The only reason I'm against them doing this to actors, is they should be given a heads up so they can start looking for their next jobs. I'm sure she will be fine in the long run, but she's not a household name so it will take some work to get the next big thing."
B: The Beginning,I can't get past the first part of that finale table read quote without GOT PTSD.
B: The Beginning,How can you keep successing
B: The Beginning,"I mean it’s been known for awhile that this is the last season.


Does she not read the news?"
B: The Beginning,Here is the thing that puzzles me if the cast themselves dont know until the final table read that show wasnt ending it points to me maybe that ending was not really satisfying and deserved
B: The Beginning,Must be painful to be snookered like that.
B: The Beginning,She doesn’t watch the show if she thought it needed to continue.
B: The Beginning,"Um, I knew it before they began filming. It was announced."
B: The Beginning,At least she's got animal crossing
B: The Beginning,"Well Sarah, keeping you in the dark kept your performance authentic. It’s a lot easier to act like you have no idea, when you truly have no idea."
B: The Beginning,I am going to miss that juicy butt to be honest
B: The Beginning,you’ll live
B: The Beginning,Why did the post such a terrible photo? The angle and it’s out of focus. They literally picked the worst one they could find. She’s awesome and I’m sure has some high quality ones they coulda used.
B: The Beginning,TIL:   Succession is a TV show that exists. And Sarah Snook is a n actress that also exists.
B: The Beginning,"Trust me, I don’t know how they didn’t know! I was in a pivotal scene and I knew it was the end, just being an extra."
B: The Beginning,Is it just me or do her facial expressions weird anyone else out.  It’s like she’s always actively trying to show different emotions with her eyes than she is with her mouth.
B: The Beginning,"Is this the ""Snuck a Snook up my snizz"" person?"
B: The Beginning,Good riddance.
B: The Beginning,"She’s the worst of the show though so I don’t feel bad, next is the dude that plays connor tbh… dude is mid as heck"
B: The Beginning,Boohoo. Ffs
B: The Beginning,So no one else knew either or did they all just decide she will be the one left out?
B: The Beginning,Nobody mentioned it on set?
B: The Beginning,Good god that site is cancer on mobile
B: The Beginning,Emotions aside what if you turned another job down during the season?
B: The Beginning,Snoo snoo
B: The Beginning,no more Succession?  who's gonna win all the emmys now?
B: The Beginning,And a pretty big loss of $$$$$$$ as well
B: The Beginning,I love her sm
B: The Beginning,Rooting for you!
B: The Beginning,What?! It feels like there could be 2 seasons left in it. It was just really heating up (as far as popularity).
B: The Beginning,so when is the spin off staring sarah snook?
B: The Beginning,"I mean sure, but also wasn’t this clear right after last season aired that the coming season would be the last? Or was that only my impression and no one else’s?"
B: The Beginning,"As a fellow Redditor I can provide some insight about what’s happening behind the scenes. 

If we look at her eyes in that random Getty photo the journalist used, we can see that she is sad that she will not earn a million dollar payday next year.

If we move down to her smile we can see that there was a sense of jealousy that her on-screen husband was Mr Darcy. 

If we look at her cheek, we can further understand that the dynamic on set was strictly business."
B: The Beginning,"reddit loves pushing their narrative. some guy saying ""some people in the witcher writing room didn't care for the source material"" got spun into ""everyone involved in witchers production except for my boyfriend henry cavill hated the source material"""
B: The Beginning,Haven't been to this sub before?
B: The Beginning,"Weird phenomenon all over Reddit, first noted it in the videogame subs.  The conversation drifts a million miles away from discussing the actual subject matter and in to circlejerk narratives about business decisions/behind the scenes stuff.  The most popular version of the moment is ""I didn't like adaptation X so I'm going to say that the creators must hate the subject matter and they wanted to tell an original story but just tacked the IP on to it.  They think they're too good for the IP."
B: The Beginning,90% of the shit said on Reddit is made up.
B: The Beginning,They may not have known at the beginning of the season.
B: The Beginning,"Maybe it will be fitting with the character’s narrative arcs. Have them stroll through the show with swagger and the confidence that it’ll go on forever, only to have the rug pulled out at the last moment. 

These characters are detestable and I hope their story has an equally upsetting conclusion for them.

Edit: from the comments, I think many of you underestimate the lengths a director or show runner will go to help coax the desired performance out of their cast."
B: The Beginning,"Right? Cruel not just from a story standpoint but now their paychecks are going to stop (correct me if I’m wrong, idk how it works getting paid in tv) or not having a new project lined ip"
B: The Beginning,I’m sure any working actor you asked would not be surprised by this. Pretty standard Hollywood industry BS
B: The Beginning,This is by far the cruelest act of cruelty I have ever heard of. Humanity is done for.
B: The Beginning,Is there a GoFundMe somewhere to help alleviate their suffering?
B: The Beginning,"Armstrong has been indicating that the show would likely end by the fourth season for some time now, IIRC."
B: The Beginning,Or just a budget thing since HBO is cutting left and right.
B: The Beginning,Abrupt?  It's been rumored forever.
B: The Beginning,Yes disagreements because hbo would slaughter their cash cow. What you are saying makes no sense
B: The Beginning,"> The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if he says otherwise.

Sounds like you know the truth and nothing will change your mind, then. Must be nice"
B: The Beginning,Yea I’d be pretty peeved if I was left in the dark and I could of been searching for other roles.
B: The Beginning,"Reminds me of managers who let go workers and tell them to clean out their desk the same day. In France by law, bosses have to give two weeks notice if they are letting someone go."
B: The Beginning,Or the Good Wife became the Good Fight
B: The Beginning,"That's what it feels like to me. I would've thought actors and their agents would be aware of the near future plans of a show, so they could schedule other projects around it."
B: The Beginning,"“Emotionally, all of us weren’t necessarily ready to be done with the show because we love each other so much,” she said.

How are you getting toxic workplace from this article? Did you even read it?"
B: The Beginning,Now they have the material to make a Succession style show *about* Succession!
B: The Beginning,I really don’t think the decision for this to be the last season was planned like people are saying and probably came about due to the fallout of actors Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong
B: The Beginning,[deleted]
B: The Beginning,It says she found out at the table read right? So she found out the first time she read the finale script is how I’m reading this
B: The Beginning,That’s not what the article says though.
B: The Beginning,"I’m afraid it’s going to end literally where we began with health issues, everyone fighting and nothing changed."
B: The Beginning,"Yup, honestly I’m concerned that the finale may be rushed and not really feel like a finale at all. 

That’d be beyond disappointing for such a good show, but everything is on the table now with HBO given WBD’s terrible management."
B: The Beginning,It wouldnt be but that isn't what it said. Maybe read.
B: The Beginning,What are the odds discovery dropped the ax and made them wrap it up after the merger? I swear I “knew” this was supposed to be a five season show. Didn’t the creator say that back in the beginning?
B: The Beginning,"The weird thing is the same thing is happening with Barry, it looks like it’s the last season but there’s been no announcement of it being the last season and the cast aren’t allowed to comment on it."
B: The Beginning,"I mean yes and no. 

It’s building up to something I’m sure they just didn’t realize it was the end end. 

they easily could squeeze one more season of whoever inherits the company and it’s downfall with out Logan."
B: The Beginning,"Honestly my completely unsubstantiated conjecture is that this season will end with both Logan and Kendall destroying each other / dying as the series resolution. This removes what sound like the two most problematic and volatile personalities behind the scenes, then the show can continue on with other characters in a rebranded show. Possibly Tom/Shiv/Roman/Greg leading the supporting cast. Since for some reason the powers that be talk about spin-offs and the way this show ended abruptly.. it just seems like they’ll finish the show to let everyone out of contract and then renegotiate for a spin-off that is more or less a continuation."
B: The Beginning,"Half the plots in Succession are sitcom style where they return to the status quo after the plot is resolved. Even though they sell shares, lose power, are the most publicly turbulent company ever, nothing ever really changes for the characters. Logan still seems to control absolutely everything. The one that sticks out to me was with the dick pics thing and how suddenly they put all this pressure on Gerri seemingly to try and force her out, and then next episode it's not brought up, no one seems to have it out for Gerri and no one cares at all."
B: The Beginning,"Fair point. Even the trailer hints at another rehash of the plot of season 3. Basically the kids actually team up this time. 

Which I enjoy but definitely would have liked to see it play out a season earlier."
B: The Beginning,Agreed with this. I loved Succession so much but season 3 just ain’t it. They flanderized Logan too with all the swearing for no reason. Nothing really happens all season.
B: The Beginning,"also if i knew it was the last season maybe i savor it

not rushing home at call time but maybe hanging on set etc"
B: The Beginning,I mean whatever next move would have been planned. They don't shoot the season back to back they take like 6 month hiatuses or something so if she was going to start a new film franchise or tv show she would have already scheduled that for the hiatus.
B: The Beginning,And then she cleaned up her trailer because she is totally OCD
Ghost Wars,It's too bad. I feel like syfy is really trying and releasing some decent content recently but the channel has been shit for so long nobody knows to check anything on the channel out. 
Ghost Wars,That sucks.  It was actually a decent show.  With a dumb ass name.
Ghost Wars,"Is this another ""Selfie"" type deal? A good show with a crap title that turns people off from watching."
Ghost Wars,"Luckily atleast the story gets wrapped up and ends pretty definitely for just one season instead on a cliffhanger. Definitely recommend to watch it if you enjoy horror.

Sucks it won't get a season 2, the horrible name was such a put off and killed it."
Ghost Wars,"The stupid name killed it. It was actually an enjoyable, silly low-budget show."
Ghost Wars,Good
Ghost Wars,Ghosts aren't in at the moment.  Try Bigfoot or zombies maybe.  
Ghost Wars,Plus I suspect the Venn diagram of people who watch SyFy shows and people that know how to torrent is a near perfect circle.
Ghost Wars,"Here's hoping Expanse will change people's perception of Syfy.  Magicians is pretty damn entertaining too.

They've also been putting together some ambitious tv movies between Childhood's End last year and the upcoming George RR Martin thing.

"
Ghost Wars,"That’s true I start watching krypton when it started and damn is ir a good show, too bad they have been known for years as the B movie channel showing some of the worst films I have ever seen, hell they made a film with one of Emilia Clarke’s first movie ever which was TRiassic Attack. "
Ghost Wars,"There's plenty of good content that SyFy has been releasing and getting a lot of views for. 

12 Monkeys, The Magicians, Channel Zero, Wynonna Earp, Killjoys and the Expanse. 

In particular The Magicians, Wynonna Earp and the Expanse are both extremely popular and get a lot of coverage, the Magicians especially."
Ghost Wars,"It was okay. Way better than I initially expected. But nothing excellent either. It is like a strange, low budget indie horror film, and it was far from perfect but it was a nice surprise when it came to certain characters and relationships. There are some fun twists along the way as well.

I'd never actually recommend it to anyone but at least it isn't Sharknado. "
Ghost Wars,I thought it was a reality show like Ghosthunters.   Selfie was sooo good.
Ghost Wars,"Based on the title, I thought this was a reality show were people bid on haunted storage units."
Ghost Wars,I am definitely one of those people... which is why I partially blame myself for Dark Matter's cancellation. And Eureka's. 😭
Ghost Wars,"Oh man, Childhood's End was great on Sky1 a few years ago.

I mean, Syfy also has The Exorcist, 12 Monkeys and The Runaways, at least in my country, so there's that going for them, too."
Ghost Wars,"If they can pull off the Hyperion Cantos, then I will give them *$25*... and a large dose of foamy adoration. 

That will be a very difficult series of novels to adapt, and will take throwing some serious cash at some skilled effects people. Really nailing the Shrike is going to be a major task.

For those 3 novels there's easily 5-6 seasons there, at 12 episodes each."
Ghost Wars,"It didn't hold my interest week to week but I binged when it was over and it was slightly more interesting that way.

But what did they expect casting Vincent D’Onofrio and Meatloaf in the same show? I can barely tell them apart these days."
Ghost Wars,And how many ghosts have they found so far?
Ghost Wars,Did we win the Ghost Wars?
Ghost Wars,"I liked it. It was low budget and a bit of a hack job in places, but it was different. SyFy never gave it any real backing. Also, the dumb name really killed it before it had any real chance."
Ghost Wars," despite having a cheesy name, GHOST WARS was actually pretty decent for the first 4 or 5 eps but around the middle of the season it started to get kind of bad and by the last 2 or 3 eps it was really bad imo. "
Ghost Wars,Does it end on a cliffhanger?
Ghost Wars,"Rob Owen is a great TV writer, in a business where many local newspapers no longer have one. His Q&As (like this one) are always valuable, though there's always questions at the bottom about whether a Pittsburgh news anchor is sick or pregnant since they missed a newscast."
Ghost Wars,Would be kind of a shame for me. I liked the pilot but havent found time to watch the rest of it yet
Ghost Wars,It's a drama.
Ghost Wars,"Eventually we'll all be ghosts, so no. "
Ghost Wars,I never got past the pilot but was interested in more. If it is truly cancelled would you say it's at least worth finishing?
Ghost Wars,"Shit, I just assumed it was another one of those doofy ghost hunter shows and never checked it out.

"
Ghost Wars,"Not really.  It more or less concluded its story, though with a bit of a teaser at the end.  I think it works fine as a standalone."
Ghost Wars,So like five?
Ghost Wars,Oh. The suffix -Wars suggested one of the many over the top paranormal hunting shows that surprisingly never result in anything because finding a good evidence of X would be a good/important news story and not something to waste on a reality show. My apologies. 
Ghost Wars,Hooray! We lose *and* win!
Ghost Wars,"genchris, i wish i could recommend finishing the show/season but yeah, around the middle-ish of the season the show just gets bad (writing-wise).  the production company for GHOST WARS also makes the shows VAN HELSING, CONTINUUM, etc. and i love VAN HELSING (and enjoyed the first season of CONTINUUM) but i think budget cuts(?) for GHOST WARS may be partly responsible for the noticeable drop in writing mid-season.  around ep, 7, the ghosts and the overall decimation of the townspeople is supposed to be increasing yet (the way the show is presenting it) there's NO ghosts for like 3 eps (in a 13 ep show, that's too many) and stupid things like a young girl, who everyone in town knows is probably possessed by one of the spirits and has done bad things to the townsfolk (since her possession) is allowed to come and go as she pleases despite only being 11 or 12 years old, etc. etc.  
LOL. "
Ghost Wars,"Thanks, it just got released as a Netflix Original in my country and looked forward to binge in. "
Ghost Wars,Roughly five.
Ghost Wars,Dark Matter died for this?
Ghost Wars,im interested but dark matter :(
Ghost Wars,"Sounds like you have something against games. Bioshock and Red Dead Redemption would make for great shows. 

Of course I´d also want some book adaptations like Aubrey–Maturin, First Law, Shogun, Lies of Locke Lamora, Malazan, Hyperion etc."
Ghost Wars,"> but I think it's worth remembering that these stories are not the same as novels written by authors as they were primarily supposed to be games and not stories

> Ghost of tsushima, god of war etc many people already know how these play out. What is the point? You're cannibalizing your own product by repeating the same story twice.  

Isn't this a contradiction? First you say videogames are not meant to be stories, unlike the novels, then your main point is that they are repeating the same story twice. So, basically, just like a novel's adaption that repeats the same story?

> There are so many authors with excellent ideas that are more suitable for television adaptations, why double down on a game that most people already are familiar with?

So, what you mean is that you want to see different games adapted instead of those that are being adapted rather than being against the idea of adapting video games?

Anyway, the thing is: adaptions are always a risk. Books adaptions aren't safer than videogames adaptions. 
Books are just as hard to adapt as videogames because movies and TV shows are mostly about what happens outside of an individual or how their actions reflect who they are inside, while books focus much more on what happens inside, on the character's internal monologues, which are something that you can't replicate on TV. It's a little easier when it comes to fantasy and scifi books because they have a strong plot to adapt, but try adapting any Herman Hesse's novel and you'll see how difficult it becomes.

Videogames aren't any different, especially modern videogames that have lots and lots of cutscenes (like the last of us), and a more linear plot, are easier to adapt, so obviously Hollywood will want to try it. I don't see what's the problem. If you don't want to see the same story twice just don't watch it; but not everyone has played all those games, and not everyone is interested in gaming, so it's a good thing that they'll get to experience those stories too."
Ghost Wars,There are lots of people who have not played the games or would be interested in how they could be adapted away from the game.
Ghost Wars,">Ghost of tsushima, god of war etc many people already know how these play out. What is the point? You're cannibalizing your own product by repeating the same story twice.

I suppose you feel the same about novels being adapted into movies too right? LOTR movies suck because people know how it will turn out?"
Ghost Wars,"It depends on how well the game is adapted and honestly I think a large pop of people may not be well versed with every game. Just like the Superhero boom, you’ll have poor adaptations and toxic fans but I think it’ll still worth it to expose the general public to these stories. I’ll never play Last of Us, GoW, or most other action so TVs all I got"
Ghost Wars,Then don’t watch it. Problem solved.
Ghost Wars,"The main target of these shows are non gamers, with the hope of getting some free publicity from the game fans. And i'd wager the plot and story of gow and and got are interesting enough for first time viewers."
Ghost Wars,"I hate the gameplay in Last of Us so much.  To me it’s just a gajillion hours of scuttling slowly around conveniently placed waist high barriers to bash someone in the head with a brick. So boring. So I’m never going to see the plot line by playing the game.  And while I personally enjoy playing God of War and Ghost of Tsushima I bet there are plenty of people who hate their gameplay as much as I hate the Last of Us gameplay.  In this weird where video games spend more and more time focused on the narrative it makes perfect sense that people will want a way to access the narrative without actually playing the game part.

Now I could see the argument of “why are we spending all this time and money to reshoot the whole thing in live action when we already have a perfectly good version?” They’re going to go out and find someone who *kind of* looks like Kratos and *kind of* looks like Atreus and they’re going to fight cruddy looking tv budget cg monsters, even though we already have hours of footage of Kratos and Atreus looking exactly like they’re supposed to fighting monsters that look exactly like they’re supposed to that’s never going to be used because audiences won’t put up with animation, so everything must be redone in live action even if it looks worse."
Ghost Wars,"hate Bethesda all you want but they adopted Nintendo's ironclad ip protection because they know a shit adaptation is gonna hurt them in the long run. In the hands of another company we'd have seven failed ES shows already

(I want an ES show so much, but not in this timeline)"
Ghost Wars,I instantly reassess my regard for someone upon learning that their favorite show is based off of a video game.
Ghost Wars,"It might end up the rare situation where they basically take the story of the game like Last of Us (even with this there were changes).

More often I think they’ll put together an original story using the game’s setting. Like they did with Castlevania."
Ghost Wars,I'm looking forward to Borderlands.
Ghost Wars,I saw a post from [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11pdi9h/oc_the_last_of_us_running_total_of_copies_sold/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)that showed the game sales over time and it seems like it’s been a pretty successful strategy. Got very high viewership and really increased game sales. Why wouldn’t others try to replicate that??
Ghost Wars,"For better (TLOU) and worse (Halo), I think it's the natural next thing in entertainment now that super heroes are on the downswing. They got in a built in fan base and has already done the world building."
Ghost Wars,"They are only now figuring them out, so I got some bad news for you"
Ghost Wars,"Look some of the stories that come out of video games are masterpieces. Same is true with many novels. Are there many great ideas floating around yet to be adopted? Maybe, but show runners want to assure that product is good and the viewership of the show is good as well. Now with an established fan base they have an assurity to do so. Secondly, your point that lack of originalty catches up, I don’t think many people who are fans of that video game/novel mind that, they just want to know how true the show is to the story of original thing and how well have the actors acted in that story. Now this has been the theme of anime/manga industry for years and looking at the numbers it has sustained rather than waiver off. So I think that if a show is well adapted it will be well received as well as will not become prosaic over time"
Ghost Wars,"I feel like a huge part of Bioshock’s twist would be lost if it weren’t a game and without that aspect it doesn’t have much going for it beyond Rapture.

Like the whole “would you kindly” aspect plays off of a video game design trope of just blindly following people that give you orders. Sure they could do it in a television show but without the context of the gameplay it seems kinda lame."
Ghost Wars,"> Malazan

And this is a perfect example of a book (ten books actually) that is harder to adapt than any of the games OP mentioned."
Ghost Wars,I agree with  bioshock and rdr2. But not for ghost of tsushima and god of war. Which is why I say they need to chill out with all these announcements.
Ghost Wars,No. Lotr is an actual story not a game it's not about one guy going on a murderous rampage
Ghost Wars,Underrated solution. There is so many shows out there...
Ghost Wars,Amazon is doing a Fallout show right now.  Stars Walton Goggins.
Ghost Wars,And being so stupid and judgmental has made everyone think less of you. Good fucking job.
Ghost Wars,Im looking forward to Jack Black as Claptrap in Borderlands.  I have no idea what the rest of that movie will end up being but I know Black will fucking kill it.
Ghost Wars,"I mean you could do the story about the rise and fall of rapture, as players arrive really late and find out about what has happened before.

You also have the sequels that are great."
Ghost Wars,"I disagree.

The author deliberately writes in a way to confuse the reader. It would only serve better in a visual medium with so many characters and he jumps between them randomly, sometime not even mentioning their name. In a visual medium thats not a problem. The first book was even written as a screenplay first and it shows. Actors could elevate and bring to life the stiff characters and dialogue. You could cut the parts when the author starts info dumping or philosophizing for pages that bogs down the pacing. Stormlight archieve is another series with great worldbuilding and story that could be really be tightened up with an editor and elevate the flat characters by talented actors.

Book of The New Sun is something I love but would never want adapted, it would only be worse. Everything about it is in the prose and mystery that could never be replicated visually. Or Realm of the Elderling which has great prose and characters but the lack of plot and pacing would never work visually. Would be super boring to watch Fitz navelgaze for 3  episodes."
Ghost Wars,"Then I get where you´re coming from, not every game needs to be a show like GoW, but some of them have strong narratives and characters like Mass Effect, RDR and Bioshock."
Ghost Wars,"
Both are stories about people going on large adventures across lots of land, encountering obstacles and enemies along the way lol"
Ghost Wars,Agreed. I don't see how they will pull it off but at least we have Jack Black as Jacktrap 🫡
Ghost Wars,"It's too much of a risk, in my opinion. It would need at least the same budget as Rings of Power, if not more. But the point is that Rings of Power comes from LOTR, which has already a huge fanbase, while, in comparison, the fanbase of Malazan is rather small; so it would be a huge investment for something that might not gather enough viewership. 

The change of cast that often happens between the books could also be jarring when translated in seasons: >!imagine viewers falling for the characters in the first season, just to find out that they won't come back in season 2 and that they have to wait two more years to see what happens next to those characters. I guess they could also mix Deadhouse Gates and Memories of Ice for the second season, and maybe add bits of Midnight Tides in the first two seasons, but it would require a talented screenwriter to condense those stories together while keeping the writing smooth enough to not turn viewers off!<

Don't get me wrong, Malazan being adapted would be epic for me. I would love it, but I don't think it's that easy; especially when a big streaming service like Prime Video failed in adapting The Wheel of Time, which shouldn't be that difficult to adapt (especially the first books). 

Maybe I'm just being pessimistic because, aside from Got and HotD, the tv shows adapted from fantasy books have been underwhelming."
Ghost Wars,"Oh I agree. High fantasy like Malazan, Wheel of Time and Stormlight can't be adapted into live action without MCU budget. Has to be animation with all the crazy shit that happens, otherwise it would look goofy. ASOIAF works live-action because the characters and drama is grounded and the main cast doesn't have superpowers. Low fantasy and historical fiction with great characters like Aubrey-Maturin, First Law, Shogun, Lies of Locke Lamora etc are perfect for live action."
Ghost Wars,"I'd like to think that after the series finale James and Miles travelled from small town to small town hunting ghosts, conning cons, and buddy-copping their way to success.

Call it ""Bonjour LaFleur""."
Ghost Wars,"Damn. I would have watched that in a heartbeat. Miles and Sawyer were some of my favorite characters in the show. 

And Leung is so underrated as an actor."
Ghost Wars,"I'll see you in another life, brothah."
Ghost Wars,His character’s argument with Hurley about time travel was my favourite part of the whole series.
Ghost Wars,"I’m honestly a little shocked that they left that franchise alone. No spin-offs, no prequels, no sequels. Just one classic series standing on its own."
Ghost Wars,"I would have watched the shit out of that. 


Still would"
Ghost Wars,"It amazes me that even to this day, every LOST thread will have people claiming ""they were dead and in purgatory"" the whole time. Not only do people say this, but they say it with such confidence.

It's not even like it's a matter of whether or not you understand the ending. This idea was directly refuted with a line of dialogue in the finale...in the most important scene! I guess these people just weren't paying attention...to the most important scene of the finale?!?!?!

Seriously, WTF people?"
Ghost Wars,Always remember him from Rush Hour
Ghost Wars,This reminds me of the comedy drama about two retired spies/assassins that we almost got starring Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson. Still wish that could've been a thing

Ghost Wars,I haven't watched this show in 10 years and have a really bad memory. Can someone remind me what connection their 2 characters had?
Ghost Wars,"It's probably not as impactful now, with so much foreign TV at our fingertips on streaming.  But back in 2004 it was pretty wild to have a main character on an major American TV show who didn't speak any English."
Ghost Wars,"I am re-watching the Mission Impossible franchise, and when I got to Ghost Protocol, I'd totally forgotten that the film opens up with Josh Holloway as an IMF agent that gets killed. It made me want to see more of that character and of Josh Holloway in good roles.

Also, I really enjoyed Ken Leung in Person of Interest."
Ghost Wars,"Nobody can replicate true detective

Ghost Wars,"In the book Under The Dome Stephen King writes about the characters watching a l

Ghost Wars,Would love. That guy was so entertaining in the sopranos
Ghost Wars,They should have made it even if it wasnt connected to lost
Ghost Wars,That would have been awesome. Dudes a great actor who deserves more chances.
Ghost Wars,Just make a true detective season 3 name them sawyer and miles and just never acknowledge it.
Ghost Wars,Been awhile since I've seen such a toxic comment section.  Do people really feel the need to hurl personal insults and belittle people they don't even know?  Are people really so insecure that someone not liking a TV show they like is an excuse to be so bitter?
Ghost Wars,"My wife and I are about to finish a rewatch of the series and when that episode of Sawyer and Miles came on I made a crack similar to this article. While a spin off wouldn’t work, I think a show with those two would of been interesting to watch. Ken and Josh have good chemistry and it fit very well in police drama setting.

Along with those two I would of loved to see Terry O’Quinn (Locke) and Michael Emerson (Ben) in another show together. They also had amazing chemistry and seemed to bring the best out of each other on screen."
Ghost Wars,I would've watched it. Miles had one of the best storylines for being a secondary character.
Ghost Wars,"His character is probably one of my favorite lowkey LOST characters.  He never really seems to break into the main LOST stars, but he's got such a full character history and it's interesting with his ties to Dharma and the island and the superpower he has.

He's also pretty unique as a character because you usually have characters that are smartasses (like Sawyer) or comic relief (like Hurley) or serious/tragic (like a lot of them), and his character is impossible to pin down as a particular thing.  He's likeable and good but also unlikeable and bad at the same time.  It makes him one of the more realistic characters on the show too (despite talking to the dead)."
Ghost Wars,I can't imagine Damon Lindelof involved with a series that actually *solves* mysteries

She's from a well off area. I also knew one of the girls training who I used to work with.  Its pretty realistic from what I've been told.  One guy I knew told me he was one of like 2 patrolman for the entire city one night and another time that they had to install monitors to see how quickly police responded to calls *purposely slow for paper work he said*. He was always the first one to respond even if he was across town."
Flint Town,I felt the show itself was interesting and well made. I would of watched more if available.
Flint Town,">They talk about all the crime such as shootings, armed robberies, breaking and enterings, etc. And they out there harassing store owners and shutting down stores for selling single cigerettes. Arresting people for fishing without a license, or for loitering after standing in front of a store too long. Its such bullshit.

Well, those things are illegal so I don't see why that's bullshit. 

I'm guessing if there was a robbery going on at the same time as one of those things that it would take precedence."
Flint Town,"It has been a very long time since I saw the documentary. The two things I remember most about it was thinking, why the fuck would anyone be a cop in that town, and why would anyone live there?

If memory serves their was a 50-90 hour queue for responding to calls.

Also wasn't there a part about a tax levy that the citizens had to vote on to fund the police and fire departments.  So of course anyone would vote to pay that levy, except the last time it was voted on the city council redirected the funds to elsewhere.  

This time it was passed and guess what, the city council redirected the funds again.

Why the fuck would anyone stay in Flint?

>  Cops are fucking terrifying man. Some of the attitudes these guys exude are just ridiculous. They walk around 24/7 like they are at war with civilians and straight up say that they need to be ""even more militarized to protect the community"".

I don't remember that part. I guess I will have to re-watch it.   

>  They talk about all the crime such as shootings, armed robberies, breaking and enterings, etc. And they out there harassing store owners and shutting down stores for selling single cigerettes.

That is not bullshit. I agree that they have to prioritize their work, but cops have to address all criminal activity and violations."

Unfortunately yes, sometimes they have to. 

> Do EMTs get to say, ""im scared of blood, let this guy die""? Fucking no. No they dont.

No but they may not go into an area where they feel their life is at stake.

Officer Reed/Reid I know ends up killing a service dog for no reason. If anyone didn't see that this man wasn't fit to be an officer their blind. 

The comments in episode 3 as the police look at a dead man over a little weed pushed me over the edge.

This show is a great representation of American police and everything wrong with them."

Flint Town,"There might be something to be said for this diplomatic attitude, but I think you're being a little obtuse to seem ""enlightened.""

It takes far more work than this to explain why officers saying they ""feared for their lives"" should be excusable in instances where we have evidence showing they were in no danger. Looking at the instances of police violence - knowing that almost no officers have ever been properly held to account for their actions - and trying to defend their ""fear"" excuses takes some real mental gymnastics. People who are that afraid and whose first response to supposed fear shouldn't be allowed to have deadly weapons, let alone allowed to be cops.

Firefighters don't make the choice to not enter into certain burning buildings because they are ""afraid of fire."" There isn't a good analogy for this because no other job has this kind of disastrous behavior that contradicts their (supposed) entire reason for existing."
Flint Town,">> Do firefighters get to say ""im afraid of fire, let that family burn""
>
>Unfortunately yes, sometimes they have to.

The police equivalent for a firefighter would be showing up at a relatively small stove fire, throwing a molotov in each of the other rooms, letting the house burn down and family die, and then saying ""the fire was too big I was scared""."
Flint Town,"It's important to note the difference between good cops and nice cops. Some cops are nice, but none are good."
Flint Town,"> and trying to defend their ""fear"" excuses takes some real mental gymnastics.

First person: 1+1=3

Me: No that is not correct.

Reddit: Downvote this motherfucker!

You: It takes some real mental gymnastics not to understand that some addition problems add up to 3. 

Did anyone bother to read my post or is it all virtue signaling from here on out?"
Flint Town,"That's a different discussion, but claiming that firefighters never back away from a fire where people's lives are at stake is simply factually incorrect."
Flint Town,"Sondheim got it right in Into the Woods, ""Nice is different from good."""
Flint Town,"Despite your bizarre characterization of the nature of this thread, I responded to your actual words. As apparent as it might be to you, I can promise you that your initial response didn't contain anything self-evident or particularly redeeming, let alone something as clear as ""1+1=3.""

The first post wasn't wrong, you are. That much is clear. Writing off a response as virtue signaling without replying to its content means nothing. Either you have no idea what you've actually said or you are really, really blinded ignorant confidence."
Flint Town,"So when the first poster said ""*I was scared"" is not a valid excuse for 90% of other jobs,*"" you believe this to be true? Not just for some contexts but as a blanket rule? 

When the first poster said ""*Do firefighters get to say ""im afraid of fire, let that family burn*"" you agree with him and think firefighters do not have discretion and are always obligated to charge into any burning building, no matter how hopeless or how perilous to themselves? I can cite examples that show this is not the case but I was hoping it would indeed be self-evident. You seem to claim that it is not, but I'm still wondering if you even read and understood what I said.  

The above is specifically what I said. If you want to talk about the police and their fear, that is a different aspect of this discussion. All I said is that ""*saying other professions don't have discretion regarding fear isn't right.*"" **I am factually correct and can prove it** but reddit hates the police and if you say anything that might be interpreted as even a mild defense of them (it wasn't) you get downvoted. Which is funny because again, that wasn't what my post was about. Even you replied with:

""*It takes far more work than this to explain why officers saying they ""feared for their lives"" should be excusable in instances where we have evidence showing they were in no danger. Looking at the instances of police violence - knowing that almost no officers have ever been properly held to account for their actions - and trying to defend their ""fear"" excuses takes some real mental gymnastics. People who are that afraid and whose first response to supposed fear shouldn't be allowed to have deadly weapons, let alone allowed to be cops.*""

What the fuck does that have to do with what I posted?!? Answer: Nothing. We can have that discussion if you want, but all I fucking said is that other professions do have discretion when it comes to fear."
Flint Town,"Okay, so ""blinded by ignorance"" is the answer.

You cannot prove that its considered okay for people to use their own supposed fear to not do their job and let people die. You can't prove it because it's not true. Firefighters cannot and do not refuse to take action - or, perhaps more accurately, take action that endangers someone - because they claim to be afraid. That's not a thing that happens. If a team of firefighters showed up to a fire and did nothing - or, again more accurately, did something actively destructive like knock out support beams to trap people in the fire so they would die - and afterwards just went to court and said they were afraid, I feel confident they wouldn't be sent on their merry way. But of course, this doesn't really happen, and it even feels silly writing it out because finding a similar situation to a police officer murdering someone sitting still in their and then saying they felt their life was threatened is difficult.

Fear isn't really the thing driving decisions in these other jobs. The fact that they operate in scary situations doesn't mean that actions in work like firefighting are made by an individual's fears and not other more demonstrable factors.

Somehow you've convinced yourself that there is some real, more important conversation about whether or not people in jobs ever feel afraid. That's literally not the conversation, and I think you know it. A pharmacist, for instance, could feel threatened at work and call the cops. But could the pharmacist knowingly give someone pills that would kill them and then say they did it because of some unprovable, unverified, unfounded ""fear"" they have? No, they couldn't. Would they be defended in public and face no punishment if they did? Would people create bumper stickers to defend that pharmacist and slander the person they killed?

Honestly, come up with analogies you find to comparable to police shooting people who pose no actual threat to them and then claiming they were just afraid in the context of other jobs. It's hard to do because it doesn't happen, and if it did, it would be less accepted and face greater (or any) blowback. 

Ignoring the fact that we know officers use this as an excuse and in fact don't fear for their lives in many cases where they murder citizens with no repercussions, you're still suggesting that fear is something that would legitimately defend similarly catastrophic failures or deliberate destruction in other situations. Despite your claims of evidence to support it, I suspect you actually know that's not really true.

Lastly, your implication that my comment has nothing to do with yours ignores the context of the OP's statement and this entire conversation. The original poster was saying that police use fear as an excuse and face no repercussions for doing so. If you want to cherry pick his statement about fear and pretend the conversation is really about using discretion in work, I'd say that's a strange and dishonest choice, and I'd also say you're still clearly wrong."
Flint Town,"> You cannot prove that its considered okay for people to use their own supposed fear to not do their job and let people die.

Flint Town,"Tried to go volunteer there a few years ago with the water crisis. Called a fire department to see how I could help.Was told not to bother since national guard was on there way, and getting car jacked would be a possibiliy, he said especially because of my Ontario plates. Drove through the city last year just to see, quite sad really. My friend actually almost cried driving through, she was wondering how people live like that. We don't really have cities like that in Canada, but some of our native reserves are in very bad shape, no running water/electricity etc.

Flint Town,"Perspective is interesting. I've been working with the people of Flint for a while too, and I felt this doc has so far left out much of the plight of the people and focused on ""cops aren't always the bad guys"" tropes. I have only seen a few episodes, but so far I'm not impressed. "
Flint Town,"That was interesting, the more I think on it, it seems like a good idea really. It provides some more funding to a police department that needs it, takes guns from unlawful owners and puts them into the hands of lawful owners all while having the added bonus that these weapons are in the system now, should they ever be used for a crime they will have the data to identify the weapon easily.

Flint Town,"I feel like Episode 3 was blatantly, entirely about the opposite of what you're saying...it was about a militarised police squad just harrassing poor black neighbourhoods because the police chief wanted to be ""proactive"" and seek out crime before it happens. All it did was antagonise, as all of the interviews with citizens in the episode showed. Furthermore, the discussion by the cops of the police shooting in Minnesota shows how apathetic they are to what the woman experienced. It was basically ""yeah the cop shot her, but months from now we might find out there was a good reason for it.""

How did this episode not portray the plight of the people to you?"

Flint Town,"Looks very interesting, more exposure for Flint is also a good thing"
Flint Town,I didn't think it was possible for a documentary to look this gorgeous. How can they possibly get such beautiful cinematography?!
Flint Town,"I know a decent amount of people in/around Flint, and there's a very mixed reaction to much of the media coverage of the city. 

While there are undoubtedly a ton of problems in the city, there's often a certain level of frustration of the ""barren wasteland"" way in which Flint is portrayed. 

Hopefully this series will be a bit more balanced, though I'm not necessarily convinced of that by this trailer. 

Also, Flint's violent crime numbers have dropped considerably in the last few years. It doesn't mean it's not still a serious problem, of course. But it's been on the right track recently. 

Also, to the people who'll inevitably talk about how they wish they could help Flint, the best way to help is to go there and spend your money. Go see something at the Whiting theater; go to 501 and get the best flatbread you've ever had; go to the art museum for an indie flick on weekends; go to the giant farmers market for some Michigan brewed beer and the biggest, best, most homestyle cinnamon role in the country. 

That'll do much more than sharing something on Instagram about ""It's been _____ months and Flint still doesn't have clean water."""

Flint Town,"I’m not sure how I feel about this. The doc seems to be covering the police in Flint, but I feel like covering the perspective of the people who were affected by the water crisis and fucked over by the city is what should’ve been highlighted in a documentary series. "
Flint Town,looking forward to watching this
Flint Town,"My first observation is they really focused on the attractive female officer toward the end of the trailer. 

Looks interesting enough to check out. The cinematography looks incredible too. "
Flint Town,I read somewhere that those kids that were exposed to the contaminated water will grow up with underdeveloped brains that could lead to and increase in crime. It’s pretty sad to know that they may never really have a positive future.
Flint Town,"drones really increased the way people can capture and produce content, no more needing a helicopter for overhead shots, just start up the drone and anyone mildly capable can do it."
Flint Town,"I think telling the story of Flint through the eyes of first responders is an interesting take. In a crisis/emergency, first responders are the ones cleaning up the mess. I imagine the police were the only government officials many citizens of Flint ever came in contact with.

While the water crisis was not the police’s fault, viewing the situation through their perspective shows the turmoil in the city from the frontlines. "

Flint Town,"It is a very good documentary! I was blown away by how insane it all is. Flint is a town of over 100,000 people and the police force has 98 cops. It should have over 300. The cops are so over worked they get to BREAKING AND ENTERING calls 50+ hours after the call comes into 911. Very little ""cop action drama"" happens in the documentary and that is probably because of the time lags and that the focus of the doc is on the department as a whole. 

Flint is a complete disaster. No only are there no jobs or opportunities, the drinking water is toxic. There are neighborhoods where huge numbers of houses are empty and abandoned. 

The most insane part of the documentary was how they had a city wide vote to continue a tax that would increase the police department's budget. The citizens voted to continue the tax and the city council used the money for other things. So after two years the department had less funding then when the doc started.

If I lived in Flint I would get in my car and start driving and never go back. There is no way Flint will ever get better. Who in their right mind would move to Flint? What business would ever set up in Flint. The water is toxic and it is not getting better. "

Flint Town,It's pretty ignorant to judge everyone in the world based off of one documentary about one issue in one very small part of one country.
Flint Town,">defend cops

No it illustrates the reality the cops have to deal with. "
Flint Town,"no. you just see a precinct deal with low resources in one of the highest crime cities in the US. But it was all filmed through 2016 so you you see how they reacted to the shooting in dallas and the shootings that happened when cops were getting shot in there patrol cars while parked. 
its filmed really well, which doesn't really matter i suppose. but its like a non filtered look at what these people deal with on a daily basis, and the black lives matter movement stuff they deal with in a primarily black community.  "
Flint Town,People judge cops because of a handful of Facebook videos though. And by judge I mean a man hunt and cold blood murder. 
Lucky Romance,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"

Lucky Romance,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"

Lucky Romance,You're welcome. 😊
Lucky Romance,">it achieves a kindness and humanity that is rare among the dark dramas and horrible-but-hilarious-people comedies that rule the current television landscape.

This show gives me a toothache with how hard it's trying to be sweet. It surpasses ""kindness and humanity"" and becomes an exercise in watching Aziz be the ideal model of millennials. Rejected by a girl? He's casual and respectful. Isn't paying his parents enough attention? He puts together a dinner to honor them. He lacks any financial burden and is so down to earth. The Uber X vs. Uber Black question felt like it would fit in perfectly in _Girls_ yet _Master of None_ seems to hold its characters in higher esteem than _Girls_ does.

I really like that Aziz's show seems to be embracing a healthy outlook on gender and race, but instead of incorporating it seamlessly into the show, it always feels like the episode becomes ""look at how deftly this topic is being handled!"" 

It can be humorous--H. Jon Benjamin's character was probably my favorite but most other characters had their moments too--but more often than not I was bored by a show that felt like it didn't want to challenge its target audience but flatter them.

I don't think this is a bad show, at all, but I don't think it's anything more than mediocre either. The only thing that's really above average is the production value, which is fantastic."
Lucky Romance,"Does it improve after the first episode? I really wanted to like it. I've seen Aziz do stand up before and it was one of the funniest shows I have ever been too. The first episode of the show felt like a lame self-congratulatory attempt at ""Louie"". Some of the acting felt really bad too but I think it came down to bad writing more than anything. They have Eric Wareheim for God's sake! How do you write an unfunny Eric Wareheim?!?"

Lucky Romance,"Watched the whole series, was OK.   Maybe too much of an idealised hipster new york life.

No problems that arent just solved by being himself, no real conflict.  Its not really a comedy, so I would normally give a sitcom a pass at that, but it deals too much in the drama of his life.

Its very much just a hipster Louie, which is fine, but  not great."
Lucky Romance,"I don't think the show lived up to the initial hype it received by critics and the internet for me. Still good just not the ""outstanding! 5 stars!"" I saw everywhere.

Dev can be a real immature shit at the worst times, but I guess that's very real  (using humor to break tension), I didn't really care for his tall  skeevy friend (it seems like every single show has a friend that just fucks around and gets laid, etc all the time), but overall I'd like to see more"

Lucky Romance,"I see your point about Dev being a protagonist without a flaw. That's a valid point. Although it does try too hard a lot of the time, I think I enjoyed it because it's a breathe of fresh air from the darker comedies that are popular right now. Nothing against them, because my favorite comedies are Rick and Morty, Always Sunny, and You're the Worst. It's just nice to have the other side of the coin as well. 

PS I really appreciate you reading and taking the time to write such a thought out and well put together response! It's why I write stuff like this. "

The writing and production are really good and it has that netflix brightness but I honestly didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I also didn't learn any lessons through the main character, as he's more an observer than anything for a lot of the drama."

Master of None was a cool enough show, Aziz might now be for you though "
Lucky Romance,Because he makes me laugh
Lucky Romance,"I would even have trouble calling it a comedy. I would say that it was humorous, it'll make you smile, but I don't remember a single laugh out loud moment (yes yes, I know humor is subjective). Also, did anyone else have a problem with the acting? Aziz's mom was pretty terrible, but I'll give her a pass because she's not an actor. His dad was surprisingly good, not great, but good, and again, not an actor. My big problem was with Brian (Kelvin Yu). Man, that guy is a really bad actor. His delivery is just so forced and unnatural. Like he's reading off a teleprompter. I was surprised to see he's acted quite a bit. I was actually cringing during the Parents episode because of his performance. Aziz's dad has never acted before, and even he did a much better job."
Lucky Romance,">sounds like you're faulting him for being a good fuckin dude (his character at least). maybe the most absurd criticism i've ever heard lol.

You do know the difference between liking a character and liking a living human being, right? Yes, Dev seems like someone I'd enjoy being friends with but no, I don't think he's an interesting protagonist.

If you ever check out _Breaking Bad_, it's kind of the opposite to how people think Walter White is a good character, but they wouldn't want him to be their brother-in-law."
Lucky Romance,"He got called in to play a cab driver. The character had two lines, neither of which had anything to do with his ethnicity. There was no reason at all the character needed to have an accent."
Lucky Romance,The dialogue is so contrived!  It's too painfully unnatural to watch.  
Lucky Romance,"Plain and simple, I feel Aziz is trying to hard to prove he's not a one note celebrity and that's all he really is."
Lucky Romance,"Yeah but Reddit be circle jerking, the show is clearly a rip off of Louie."
Lucky Romance,Because it was all bullshit. The statistics are so misleading it just perpetuates the gender pay gap lie. Also that in the field of work dev is in men are far more likely to get paid less to begin with. 
Lucky Romance,"You must have the worst sense of humour, poor you."
Lucky Romance,I laughed pretty hard at the end of the minorities in entertainment episode with the Mindy Kaling joke. The show skews more towards dramedy for sure though. I thought the acting was fine for the most part. Brian's whole character was pretty upbeat yuppie so I think his dialogue sounded like he was pitching a product from a commercial but that seemed to be in line with his peppy persona. 
Lucky Romance,"Brian/Yu's acting really stuck out for me too. The character is pretty funny when Aziz is reading his texts, but the actor really kills his actual presence."
Lucky Romance,If it had nothing to do with ethnicity why were there only other Indian actors there? It was clear they were looking for someone who had immigrated from India and still had an accent. 
Lucky Romance,So I wrote this ^ ^ when I'd only seen the first two episodes.  I'm now six eps in and take it back - it's a good show.  
Lucky Romance,I did mention in the piece that the dialogue often feels like bits ripped straight from stand up comedy so I would have to agree with you in some parts.
Lucky Romance,I can see how that would annoy you but I don't quite understand how that's a criticism of the show so much. I mean if I had the opportunity to make a show I would take it over doing bit acting parts. Can't blame him.

I would strongly disagree with that. It was blatantly bad. Go back and watch the Parents episode with that in mind. It's just bad. Your description actually fits Aziz's acting, which was both good, and consistent."
Lucky Romance,Brian sounds like every other chinese american who cant speak chinese who tries really hard to fit in.  So he seemed pretty natural to me.  
Lucky Romance,Why did the character need an accent?
Lucky Romance,"look at that username, it's a rick and morty fan. trust me. no chance in hell you'll get an intelligent conversation outta that one"

Lucky Romance,Because the role was a cab driver in NYC. Most of them have accents. 
Lucky Romance,Read my comment again.  I basically said he sounds natural. Where was the hate?  As an Asian American i think i have an how we talk.  Brian basically sounds like me when I am at the office.  
Lucky Romance,And lots of them don't. Thats the point Aziz was making.

Kims Convenience,"Man, this show is like the opposite of Schitt's Creek press. It's a great show people found out about much later in its run, but the cast constantly shit talks it."
Kims Convenience,"Watching the last season on Netflix and this feels like a different show than the first two seasons. Half or more than is at Handy, Janet and Jung feel like immature assholes while Shannon and Kim-chi feel more mature, and feel like they are being made more sympathetic for the spin off. Infact they seemed to have become dumber and stopped growing at all over time. No wonder the actors were annoyed. The writing has been pretty weak for the last two seasons, but here is its approaching basic Fox sitcom territory."

>Season 5 of Kim's Convenience comes out on Netflix today, and I'm feeling a host of emotions right now. It is, of course, our last season, thanks to a decision by our producers not to continue the show after the departure of two showrunners. There's been a lot of talk and speculation about what happened, and I want to do my best to give accurate information, so I'll itemize my thoughts below:  
>  
>The show can't be ""saved"". It was not ""cancelled"" in a traditional manner, i.e. by a network after poor ratings. Our producers (who also own the Kim's Convenience IP) are the ones who chose not to continue. Neither CBC nor Netflix own the rights to Kim's Convenience, they merely license it. However, the producers of the show are indeed spinning off a new show from the Shannon character. It's been difficult for me. I love and am proud of Nicole, and I want the show to succeed for her... but I remain resentful of all of the circumstances that led to the one non-Asian character getting her own show. And not that they would ever ask, but I will adamantly refuse to reprise my role in any capacity.  
>  
>I wanted to be a part of the sixth season. I've heard a lot of speculation surrounding myself - specifically, about how getting a Marvel role meant I was suddenly too ""Hollywood"" for Canadian TV. This could not be further from the truth. I love this show and everything it stood for. I saw firsthand how profoundly it impacted families and brought people together. It's truly SO RARE for a show today to have such an impact on people, and I wanted very badly to make the schedules work.  
>  
>I WAS, however, growing increasingly frustrated with the way my character was being portrayed and, somewhat related, was also increasingly frustrated with the way I was being treated. I think this is a natural part of a collaborative undertaking like making a TV show; everyone is going to have different ideas on where each character ought to go, what stories ought to be told. But it was always my understanding that the lead actors were the stewards of character, and would grow to have more creative insight as the show went on. This was not the case on our show, which was doubly confusing because our producers were overwhelmingly white and we were a cast of Asian Canadians who had a plethora of lived experiences to draw from and offer to writers. But we were often told of the next seasons' plans mere days before we were set to start shooting... there was deliberately not a lot of leeway given to us. Imagine my disappointment year after year knowing that Jung was just stuck at Handy and in absolutely no hurry to improve himself in any way. More importantly, the characters never seemed to grow. I can appreciate that the show is still a hit and is enjoyed by many people... but I remain fixated on the missed opportunities to show Asian characters with real depth and the ability to grow and evolve.  
>  
>We didn't always get along with each other. This part really breaks me because I think we all individually were SO committed to the success of the show and SO aware of how fortunate we all were. We just all had different ideas on how to get there. Speaking for myself personally, I often felt like the odd man out or a problem child. This one is hard because I recognize that a lot of it reflected my own insecurities at the time, but it was buoyed by things that happened in real life; nomination snubs, decreasing screen time, and losing out on opportunities that were given to other cast members. This is a reality of show business, there is only so much to go around. LA became the new territory for me, and I pursued it with so much drive and vigor partially because I knew that I could not rely on Kim's to take my career where it needed to go, nor could the cast be the type of family that I had imagined. I had no mentor during this whole process and nobody from the producing team of the show ever even remotely reached out. So... I probably said and did things that were stupid and not helpful. That being said... I was always so careful in presenting a united front to the press. I think we've all individually done a lot of work over the years and there will always be be a mutual love and respect, as well as a recognition of the bond forged from this totally unique experience of being on a hit show that changed the world.  
>  
>For how successful the show actually became, we were paid an absolute horsepoop rate. The whole process has really opened my eyes to the relationship between those with power and those without. In the beginning, we were no-name actors who had ZERO leverage. So of course we were going to take anything we could. After one season, after the show debuted to sky-high ratings, we received a little bump-up that also extended the duration of our contracts by two years. Compared to shows like Schitt's Creek, who had 'brand-name talent' with American agents, but whose ratings were not as high as ours, we were making NOTHING. Basically we were locked in for the foreseeable future at a super-low rate... an absolute DREAM if you are a producer. But we also never banded together and demanded more - probably because we were told to be grateful to even be there, and because we were so scared to rock the boat. Maybe also because we were too busy infighting to understand that we were deliberately being pitted against each other. Meanwhile, we had to become the de facto mouthpieces for the show (our showrunners were EPICALLY reclusive), working tirelessly to promote it while never truly feeling like we had a seat at its table.  
>  
>Our writer's room lacked both East Asian and female representation, and also lacked a pipeline to introduce diverse talents. Aside from Ins, there were no other Korean voices in the room. And personally I do not think he did enough to be a champion for those voices (including ours). When he left (without so much as a goodbye note to the cast), he left no protege, no padawan learner, no Korean talent that could have replaced him. I tried so hard to be that person; I sent him spec scripts I was working on, early cuts of short films I had produced... I voiced my interest in shadowing a director or writer's room... my prior experience had taught me that if I just put myself out there enough, people would be naturally inclined to help. And boy was I wrong here. I wasn't the only one who tried. Many of us in the cast were trained screenwriters with thoughts and ideas that only grew more seasoned with time. But those doors were never opened to us in any meaningful way.  
>  
>I’m adding this in late BUT I reallly need to mention that our actual day-to-day crew... were PHENOMENAL. You couldn’t ask for a better group of people or a better working environment. From our props to our grips and gaffers to sound and set dec, everyone contributed to a positive work environment. In the end... I'm so incredibly saddened that we will never get to watch these characters grow. That we will never see Jung and Appa reuniting. That we will never watch the Kim's deal with Umma's MS, or Janet's journey of her own self-discovery. But I am still touched by the volume and the voracity of our fans (Kimbits...still hands-down the best fandom name EVER), and I still believe in what the show once stood for; a shining example of what can happen when the gates come down and minorities are given a chance to shine. I'll answer some questions if you have them... otherwise, check us out on Netflix!"
Kims Convenience,"I'm convinced that the series takes place in purgatory where it's summer all the time and none of the main characters ever overcome their personal challenges in order to move on.  It's like ""The Good Place,"" but without the reveals and supernatural wackiness, and everyone in the cast is miserable by the end."
Kims Convenience,It is really unfortunate that the show had so many problems behind the scenes. I finished season 5 this weekend and you could tell that it was ended abruptly and the writers didn’t put a lot of thought into some of the storylines.
Kims Convenience,"The author comes off as such a dick in his op ed to Simu Liu. Really reeks of ""you shouldn't bother yourself worrying about racial issues, just work harder and you'll make more money."""
Kims Convenience,"Okay, as an Asian American, is no one else horrified and disgusted by the fact that this article........is just regurgitating a person's tweets?   Godamn buzzfeed, what a shit show."
Kims Convenience,Save giving Buzzfeed clicks. Her tweets can be seen starting [here](https://twitter.com/jean_yoon/status/1401633371495796738).
Kims Convenience,"It's also the same show where the only Korean person who wrote any of the 65 episodes was Ins Choi. (the creator of play/co-creator of show)

Pretty much tell you all how great behind-the-scenes is going. /s"
Kims Convenience,I actually unsubscribed to the globe and mail over this article. It was pretty surreal to read someone attacking Simu and calling his actions childish.
Kims Convenience,"Sad to hear that, I really like the show"
Kims Convenience,"My Asian American partner was super excited when this show first came out. She literally lived that life. Her parents were immigrants from Korea, came over with pocket change, worked their asses off, ran many small business (dry cleaners, produce stands...) and provided the best of educations for her and her brother possible. 

She watched two episodes and said, “this shit isn’t Korean.” So disappointed. 

Choi was clearly only involved because of the source material. They teamed him up with an “experienced” show runner. Which is a practical business decision as that job is literally running not just the writers room, but the whole production and post of the show. Sounds like they hired a total douche who didn’t really give a shit about the culture or history of the people of the show."
Kims Convenience,">You are 5x more likely to get a blood clot from the AZ vaccine than you are to get MS if you're Korean. The producers: ""But why does it matter?""And ""Jean doesn't understand comedy.""

Wait, that was supposed to be for laughs? I thought it was character growth but apparently I'm supposed to find someone getting a horrible disease hilarious."
Kims Convenience,I could kind of tell that the jokes and plot points weren’t really written much by a Korean person. A lot of the humor felt like an outsiders perspective. Plus the shows name just kinda gave that away as well
Kims Convenience,"Goddammit, I really liked this show! I was even gonna go back and start over again because I wasn’t sure where I left off (it’s been a while since I binged it). I guess it’s canceled now"
Kims Convenience,I still don't understand where the fuck the MS bit came from. Almost stopped watching. I felt this last season was super disconnected. Yikes
Kims Convenience,Oh Christ.  This is sad to hear.  I just discovered the on Friday and I got through season 1.  I’ve loved it so far.
Kims Convenience,"That's what happens when you have an entire writing crew that is white, writing for a Korean Canadian sitcom... Smh."
Kims Convenience,"I really wanted to like this show but it did feel pretty forced and “caricatured”. Nora From Queens, as ridiculous as the plotlines were, felt a lot more genuine and relatable somehow."
Kims Convenience,I'm confused on how the leggings scene she mentioned was offensive.  The show is supposed to be a comedy; you are going to have scenes where characters act dumb.
Kims Convenience,I love the show. But that example she gave of nude color leggings doesn't seem offensive at all.
Kims Convenience,I tried to like this show but couldn't stand the stereotypical trope and low hang gags about Asians. Sad my initial take is validated by the crew.
Kims Convenience,What article is Yoon responding to?  When I click the link in the article it only takes me to the Globe and Mail main page.
Kims Convenience,That's nuts. I watch features and everyone seems to get along great. Looks like I was being fed bullshit.
Kims Convenience,I'm bummed to hear all this negative stuff. I really enjoyed watching this show up to this season.
Kims Convenience,"I loved this show and totally fell in love with this cute family running a small convenience store. I hate that their was real pain and heartache bts making it. 

Also had the same feelings when I heard all the horrible things that happened behind the curtains of “StarTrek Voyager”"
Kims Convenience,This show is awful.  I couldn’t watch after seeing 1 episode. The whole thing seemed like one big boring stereotype show.
Kims Convenience,"Just last week there were a bunch of articles about how great this show is, how it avoid stereotypes, etc."
Kims Convenience,Not surprised
Kims Convenience,damn she dropped a bomb.
Kims Convenience,"Is the entire premise of the show not ""overtly racist""?"
Kims Convenience,Why is buttfeed getting upvotes
Kims Convenience,"I don’t get the frustration with the lack of character development because news articles like this

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/dining/kims-convenience.html

Hail the show for being an ordinary sitcom but with an Asian cast. And ordinary sitcoms don’t have character development."
Kims Convenience,"The example she gives wasn't racist at all though.

It was a joke about her character being stupid, but not racist."
Kims Convenience,"I work in television in Toronto, and I'm appalled.

Toronto is an incredibly multicultural city.  It's not a 'melting pot' we don't expect everyone to turn out the same. It's 'multicultural' which means - in its noblest sense - each culture can be who they are.

There are a ton of really good people trying very hard to make great, meaningful television in this country. Television that reflects who we are as Canadians.  As a white man, my first job in any large role in a show like Kim's would be to staff the writers' room with Koreans first, Asians second and immigrants third.  If you can't find enough great writers with those backgrounds, you need to start grooming them in season 1.  As Jean said, they have a perspective that is forehead-slappingly obvious you'd need in the writers' room in order to tell their story.

The fact that the executive staff felt they could tell a show about Korean immigrants with a room full of white people is just garbage.

The fact that the cast loved their characters and were asking to shadow to learn more about the business is great.  Whenever I've been in a position of power, I've always tried to leave the door as open as possible for those on their way up the ladder.  Want to shadow? Sure. Want me to read a spec? You bet.  Time permitting. If time doesn't permit, I try to reschedule them for a time I can get to it. A member of the cast would be gold to train up as a writer, or at least to have as a sounding board for story arcs.

There are two sides to every story, and I""m leaving it open to the possibility that maybe the cast were a headache to the creative and executive team, such that they were not involved in the process for fear of derailing or holding things up.  But, on the surface, this whole thing smacks of people wanting to take credit for representing ""Multiculturalism"" without one iota of desire to actually reflect multiculturalism.

Edit: Downvotes?  Why?"
Kims Convenience,No one talked about this show until it ended… I never heard about it until it ended either.
Kims Convenience,Amanda Brugel is actually played by esteemed character actress and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale. Talk about range!
Kims Convenience,Wasn’t there an article a couple of days ago talking about how progressive this show was? The winds sure change fast.
Kims Convenience,That’s a shame. I almost feel bad for enjoying it. I just really fell in love with the cast and characters.
Kims Convenience,The CBC does not want any of its productions to succeed and produce a profit for the network; the board was installed by Stephen Harper to destroy the network so Rogers can buy its resources for pennies on the dollar. Schitt's Creek would have been killed after 4 years but for its success on Netflix and ridiculously low budgets. This show was killed just like Little Mosque on the Prairie with lots of help from above.
Kims Convenience,"They complain about a lack of asians and women in the writers room.  I just looked up a list of the writers.  Of the top by (by episode count) 7 are women, lead is Asian male.  Not everyone has pics so I'd have to do research to know total number of asians"
Kims Convenience,And yet…took that dollar…
Kims Convenience,"It’s an OK show… The dialogue and script is pretty damn obvious in every episode.

It also feels like they’re completely white-washing Korean culture. Maybe I’m wrong, but I doubt it."
Kims Convenience,"Yeahhhh as soon as I found out that Mr. Kim's accent was an affectation, I was like I'm fucking out of this nonsense."
Kims Convenience,I struggled to understand the so called article because of the awful format. I got to the part where she said about the joke about nude pants was removed. Can someone please explain to me why that joke is racist?
Kims Convenience,"Nah, you think? Normalize hiring Asian amaericans with no accents. Hire actual Asians with accents to play roles with accents. But faking the accent is cringeworthy to me. It’s mocking Asians who know how to speak English perfectly, for one"
Kims Convenience,Buzzfeed? Grain of salt.
Kims Convenience,Why even do the show then?
Kims Convenience,"I couldn’t watch it, it was extremely racist in my opinion and it was using every Asian stereotype. I don’t doubt the cast is not happy about how it was but still needing to have the work."
Kims Convenience,No wonder the later seasons sucked. Written by ypipo with not enough Asian representation in the writer's room.
Kims Convenience,Wasn't that the point?
Kims Convenience,It must suck to be a writer on a TV show who is automatically deemed racist because the cast didn't like your writing.
Kims Convenience,"When everything is racist, nothing is racist. These people need to get over themselves"
Kims Convenience,"What a time to be alive that a CBC show was to racist. 

First it was MrD then Schitz/working moms and now Kim’s, broadening public television. 

Thank you Canadian government."
Kims Convenience,"is called comedy..they blew out and exaggerated every stereotype possible..I really liked this  show, great cast, at times it did bother me the stereotypes..but hey stereotypes come from some sort of reality…

this is what Hollywood does with every minority group..we see it with the Colombian/Hispanic  trophy wife in modern family…instead of complaining and yelling racist..Vergara has used this on her favor becoming one of the best paid actors in TV….

I’m glad there was space for a show like this and I hope it opens doors for asian actors luckily without the stereotypes.."
Kims Convenience,Wow. That’s an epic bummer. We’re on season 3… maybe we won’t finish it. I’m not interested in watching another racist stereotype sitcom.
Kims Convenience,How appropriate that this is actually the White person's fault.
Kims Convenience,"My partner and I tried watching this show. felt like joe rogan was the head writer so we stopped a little ways into the the second episode. Took a lot of grace to get that far too. Being a minority myself, I can’t imagine who thought it was a good idea to so deeply caricaturize every single character to appeal to a 14 year old passive racist. Just my personal take."
Kims Convenience,This is a lot of hyper analyzing for a comedy show.
Kims Convenience,[removed]
Kims Convenience,"I find it unsurprising that the primary (white) showrunner in question is named Kevin WHITE (lol) and then has the AUDACITY to go and write a fucking op-ed. Just learn to shut your fucking mouth, dude. But hey, you chose to open yourself up to further warranted public criticism, so I guess for that I am grateful."
Kims Convenience,Somebody is trying to stay in the limelight by drumming up controversy
Kims Convenience,Good riddance
Kims Convenience,Forced labor?
Kims Convenience,I'm pretty sure Leonardo Dicaprio didn't like being a racist slave owner in Django Unchained either.
Kims Convenience,A good show destroyed by the cast going woke.
Kims Convenience,"idk about ""Overtly Racist"" but I tried to watch this show out of solidarity and found the first few minutes of the first episode so incredibly cringe I couldn't stand it and dropped it.

More like Alan Tudyk's Con Man than Galaxy Quest.

Maybe because I watched and liked LA Arirang when it ran in the 90's despite it being ""off"" on the US culture. It felt very inspired by The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, but at least it was by Koreans?"
Kims Convenience,I have no idea what to think now. The cast is upset the show was cancelled. The cast is upset because the show was ....racist or something too? It was hellish to work on. Still upset it was cancelled though..... I don't get it.
Kims Convenience,She sounds like a nightmare.  And a racist.
Kims Convenience,"There was only one Asian producer, and without them I'm guessing they felt they had to end it. I don't agree with it, but moving forward it makes sense that they don't feel like they can make it about Asians without coming across as offensive. 

It kind of shows how effed up society is. Things can't just be funny, they have to get a stamp of approval from someone in that minority group, then it can be funny."
Kims Convenience,"Sounds like it kinda sucked to work on, but I can't help thinking that this is mostly just an article about people complaining about their jobs. Welcome to life."
Kims Convenience,"For those of you who are fans, what season should I stop watching?"
Kims Convenience,"My girlfriend watched this and I just listened to it, and from what I heard it was an awful not funny show, maybe if I was Asian I would get some more of the jokes  or maybe if I actually watched it. But what I heard was laaaaame."
Kims Convenience,[deleted]
Kims Convenience,"Yeah, the show was bound to be racist. In fact, that's how I viewed it from the very first episode. But if Koreans are ok with, I don't care. But it gave me a vibe of Apu from Simpsons. If they made a movie on Apu, it wouldn't be as cartoonish, but it would still be very racist."
Kims Convenience,Yet he took that money and now is biting the hand that fed him. This guy seems like a virtue signaling weenie.
Kims Convenience,"If the cast really or Jean Yoon really cared, she could have threatened to quit and maybe things may have changed for the better.  She was an important part of the show and that would have gained attention."
Kims Convenience,"Damn it sucks when your employer treats you in a way you don’t like. 

Anyway…"
Kims Convenience,"> ""Overtly Racist""  

Netflix needs to pull this show today."
Kims Convenience,"Loved all 5 season, loved the actors and arcs.
Hate that they didn't enjoy that final season, that guy who took over Showeunning is an ass."
Kims Convenience,I just really wanted a Kim Che spin-off there is so much background info that would make a really interesting story.
Kims Convenience,Buzz-feed is the sad news department all it’s news articles are depressing.
Kims Convenience,Hearing so much negative press about the show lately. Really don’t want to watch season 5 now sadly
Kims Convenience,"Let me start by saying I’ve never watched this show so I clearly won’t say anything about her views of what was going on behind the scenes and am in no way saying what I’m about to say is the most important part of what she expressed but I do have to question why she’d become upset that her character was or is getting MS?  She did not give a fact that Koreans are immune to it, only that it’s not common.  Ok well then you’re character is getting a very uncommon disease, a disease anyone can get and maybe it would help others who have it showing someone they can relate to dealing with it.  A character being given a rare disease isn’t an insult, it’s a chance to possibly help someone. Though I do have to question the response she got of, “Jean doesn’t understand comedy”.  Getting MS isn’t funny.  And I say all of this because someone I know has MS so yea I don’t take too kindly to someone saying their character getting it was somehow insulting or racist.  Her issues, though still need to be heard."
Kims Convenience,"It's never going to be diverse enough I guess. You can have an Asian cast, Asian creator, a bunch of Asian writers.. But people will still find a way to bitch.

Most of the crew was white you say? Wow what a fucking shock.. They hire locally and this was shot in Canada not Asia."
Kims Convenience,Asian Game of Thrones.
Kims Convenience,"Of course a bunch of people in these comments don’t see the problem. Of course. 

We should just be happy we get representation right?"
Kims Convenience,Didnt mind cashing those checks at the time though
Kims Convenience,This is really sad.  Who were the 2 showrunners ?
Kims Convenience,Just watched the first episode and I’m not surprised that overly racist storylines come into play at some point. The writing seems ham fisted and cringe as hell when it comes to issues of race and sexuality. And having Canadians putting on terrible Korean accents doesn’t help the cringe factor at all. Not very funny either imo.
Kims Convenience,That's exactly what I was going to say. I started watching Kim's because of the comparisons to SC and really enjoyed the first season so far. Sad to see that there will never be a proper conclusion - and not only that but to know all of the main cast feel betrayed by showrunners is disappointing.
Kims Convenience,"With Schitt's Creek 3/4 of the main cast had control over scripts, directing, producing and day to day running of the show.  If they had a problem with the direction of the show, or plot points or whatever, they could just bring it up and writers would work to change it.

2/4 of the main cast were revered large names in both Hollywood and Canada and so they had the pull power to leave the show and do something else.

All of the actors in Kim's Convenience were relative unknowns who likely didn't have any influence until that final season."
Kims Convenience,"They probably felt the need to expose the sham because they saw all the recent MSM praise for the show as groundbreaking in showing the asian immigrant experience, when in reality it was not the case."
Kims Convenience,"From what the cast has written so far, sounds like it deserves to be ""shit talked"" though. Or I think ""called out"" is probably more appropriate here bc shit talk implies it's just unwarranted trashing.

I mean, Simu said the cast didn't actually get along that well behind the scenes (sth like how they were basically being pitted against each other at various points) and yet they seem to be united in being pretty mad about the lack of diverse writers and input/creative power the cast have despite being the faces of the show, for one."
Kims Convenience,"I'm one of those people who discovered it after the first announcement of Simi Liu's casting in Shang Chi.  Lots of fan love and support in the comments and tweets, so I picked up the show and flew through S1.  Now I'm in the midst of S3 and these tell-alls from the actors are dampening the expert.  Although I'm noticing a large increase in the awkward mixup cringe style story beats"
Kims Convenience,"I have to say, I don’t know any Asian adults that actually like this show. I think a lot of gave it a chance and found it really cringy, with bad accents and stock characters. The only people I know who really like this show are white. I mean, clearly there are Asian people that like KC, but I do not know one single one in real life, I just read the comments online."
Kims Convenience,Her response is just begging for white countries to not include Asians or make Asian-centric shows because they will get shit on by Asians for it
Kims Convenience,Schitt talks it*
Kims Convenience,Janet became consistently more annoying as the show went on to the point of just acting like a toddler.
Kims Convenience,"All the focus on Shannon really makes sense now that I know they are trying to make a spinoff about her. I like Shannon as a character, but the show isn't supposed to focus on her."
Timeline,"> The problems were myriad from the start. **After Mark Patch (a veteran visual-effects technician with a long list of credits including Tenet, 2016’s Ghostbusters, and Starz’s American Gods) was offered a short-term position working on VFX for a Marvel series on Disney+, he says the studio balked at paying him his going rate — demanding to first see a pay stub from his work on Tenet proving his market value, then undershooting Patch’s quote by several hundred dollars a week**. Then came the nondisclosure instructions he says were issued by Marvel’s VFX and postproduction president Victoria Alonso and staff VFX producer Jen Underdahl in a telephone meeting, requiring that Patch keep his employment at the company a secret and avoid any social-media posts that might indicate he was affiliated with a Marvel Cinematic Universe project. “I was like, ‘Okay, I can’t even tell my family where I am?’” he recalls. “What is this — the Manhattan Project?!”

> Then there was the job itself. **While an average feature-length superhero or sci-fi movie might have 1,600 visual effects, he says this ten-hour show** (which he cannot specifically name per a nondisclosure agreement he signed) **would require around 3,000 VFX shots to be completed on a much shorter timeline. Nonetheless, feature-quality work was expected**, which could include anything from replacing actors’ faces to rendering entire CG sequences from scratch. **Confronted with the prospect of what he was told would be 18-hour days, seven days a week, for three months straight, Patch walked away from the contract. “They said, ‘Okay, well, do you want a job on our next show?’ And I said, ‘No.’”** (Marvel Studios declined to comment on Patch’s story and declined to make Alonso and Underdahl available to speak.)

> **Talk to any VFX artist or tech working in modern Hollywood and certain complaints come up over and over: the punishing deadlines, grueling work hours, too few workers charged with too much work, underpayment and systematic “pixel-fucking” — an industry phrase used to describe the behavior of nitpicking clients who lack the VFX knowledge to communicate their needs.** Ben Speight, an organizer at the Animation Guild and the VFX-IATSE, a rapidly growing wing of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (of which Patch is a member) that first formed in 2012, says the industry has grown “exponentially” since the late ’90s and early 2000s, when it consisted of several hundred visual-effects workers. According to the effects and gaming directory site Studio Hog, there are now 582 visual-effects houses worldwide and somewhere between 31,000 and 117,000 workers plying their trade at any given time. **VFX industry watchdogs estimate that across TV and film, there is currently about three times the amount of work as there are visual-effects professionals to execute it.**"
Timeline,VFX artists absolutely need to be unionized. The rest of the film industry has strong unions and they need to be included 100%
Timeline,"Good. These artists deserve a union who will, frankly, hold incessant release schedule to ransom to get them acceptable working conditions. Feige et al are obsessed with the progression and growth and don’t give a shit how they get there as long as something else gets set up on the way."
Timeline,"""Animation is expensive, time consuming and needs specialized skills"", said the Animator. 

""Aaaaaaarrrrgh"", screamed the Hollywood exec, ""how dare you confront me with reality, I've spent years developing a drug habit to avoid that!"""
Timeline,"Disney shows are looking like shit these days, because they are asking too much of VFX artists in a short amount of time. 

The quality is seriously all over the place. Sometimes it looks great, other times it looks like Black Widow (oh man that movie's VFX were awful, maybe the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie). If I were a VFX artist, I'd walk away too. Disney needs to treat these people better, pay them better, and give them more time. When Disney gets into crank-a-bunch-of-projects-out mode the final product usually looks awful."
Timeline,"With the current boom-era going with Television and the focus in both movie and film on VFX, how is it that VFX houses are not able to receive a premium for their work simply based on negotiation? I don’t see how a Marvel or Disney production could be effectively made right now without VFX so why aren’t VFX folks more in command of their pay? Generally this is the effect of a market so something else has to be missing."
Timeline,"Since Fiege is the head of Marvel, this is his fault. They should be able to afford to pay these people what they are due.

*my bad Fiege This appears to be Victoria Alonso's fault, but you are also somewhat responsible."
Timeline,"Well that sucks. I formerly worked in that industry (I do similar work in games,  now). They’ve been trying to form that union for a while now (it was being discussed in 2009/10 at the latest). 

“Back in my day,” there were similar issues, but that level of abuse was only associated with specific studios.  You learned to avoid them (some of them were run by absolute scum). But none were as big as Marvel, and there were other options. 

Gotta say, I was in the Animation Guild for a bit, and they had absolutely no teeth. Hope the VFX version does a little better!"
Timeline,"I want to add that I hope, along with artists, that VFX Production Coordinators and Managers get allowed into a union as well just like some on set production positions are.

I’ve worked as a VFX coord close to six years now for a lot of shows, and we pull just as much hours if not more as artists, as we usually have to stay even later to deliver for clients if we work vendor side OR we’re pulling stupid hours awaiting those deliveries at night or waking up at the crack of Dawn to set up reviews the next days for dailies in the AM. This is especially brutal during pilots. And we don’t get paid nearly as much as artists do.

We’re suffering from this nonsense too. Please don’t forget about us."
Timeline,Maybe they will let the Catering Dept unionize next. As it stands only one of usually 5 team members are allowed to be teamsters. They force the other 4 to work 14-18 hour shifts with under 8 hours of turn around.
Timeline,"It seems to me that one repeating issue with these stories is the nature of the contract between the movie company and the VFX company - fixed price with a seemly unlimited scope for changes.

The idea of being able to do this with any other form of work seems unreal.  Imagine you're watching a house being built and the client goes to the building company with a list of alterations.  The builder isn't going to do that stuff for free.  Without incentives and disincentives to planning their work properly, the movie studios will keep abusing VFX houses."
Timeline,"I used to dismiss vfx work as simple stuff till I stumbled upon the corridor crew channel. Gave me real insight of how much work goes in. 

Big companies don't respect workers and its why unions are important"
Timeline,"It's past time for VFX artists to unionize, studios have treated them like slaves for years now (remember what happened with *Life of Pi*?), demanding top notch work to for peanuts and faster than possible. Modern blockbusters would straight up die without VFX yet their job is terribly undervalued."
Timeline,"I wonder if they could negotiate to join SAG-AFTRA.  This seems like a pretty easy marriage, you have creatives being put over the barrel by studios the same way actors have previously been abused.  SAG-AFTRA has dealt with this from production crew up to writers, they negotiate with the same people.  Etc"
Timeline,"Curious: why are these companies allowed to treat the artists so poorly?  Is there a glut of them and so if they don't like the working conditions they can be easily replaced?  I didn't think that was the case.

Is it just that too many artists have allowed themselves to be walked over for too long, making exploitation the norm similar to how you sometimes see in the IT industry with people expected to be on call 24/7/365?"
Timeline,"It's about time someone in the VFX biz told Marvel Studios to fuck off. Whatever you think about their movies, the demands they place on vendors are unreasonable."
Timeline,Sounds like Armor Wars.
Timeline,"As a Marvel fan for 35 years, I absolutely endorse better pay and conditions for the people that bring me the content I enjoy.

I'd much rather there be no more MCU than there be these shitty conditions Disney keeps imposing on their employees/contractors."
Timeline,Im sorry but blame ring of power all you want but the vfx were flawless. And that's because anazon hired enough studio to get it done. Disney is scaling the size of projects but not the amount of studio working on it.
Timeline,Good. The VFX people have too much on their plate. I may enjoy marvel movies but I don't want people behind the scenes getting overworked for this.
Timeline,"Marvel Studios is that hot girl in high school that everyone wants to fuck but in reality she's very shallow, will cost you a ton of time and money and there are probably more rewarding things to do than be with her."
Timeline,I work in film. There's gonna be Patch patches worn on sets soon. We're rather droll so it'll probably just be a black patch that says Mark Patch in white block letters. Maybe even just Patch. The producers will pretend they can't see them.
Timeline,"This is the problem in both tv/movies and game development; the time frames have shrunk insanely, along with the budgets, because ""time is money""  and they have to keep pumping out new material to sell every year."
Timeline,"So, that Marvel show has to have been She-Hulk right? For half the runtime it had (at least) one full CG character and you could tell that the VFX artists didn't have the time to make it look good in a lot of the shots."
Timeline,How haven't the VFX artists not go on strike by now? These working conditions are ludicrous.
Timeline,">“With the right strategy led by VFX workers themselves,” says Speight, “in the next year, there could be an opportunity for a group to move forward, be successful, and establish their first union.”

Hell in some places they straight up CAN’T unionise because certain companies playing politics rather than paying fairly. (Search up the hobbit laws for a wide ride)

Fuck you Warner cunts."
Timeline,"that is what greed does to you. 

i recently saw a documentary kingdom of dreams. and they use creative people to booster their own money, no care for their health as long as they deliver on the deadlines, while these company owners made billions of dollars. it is a disgusting world. same for VFX guys. they love their work so much, they shorten their lives because of it and the people in power know it. so they profit from them."
Timeline,They will just outsource even more than they already do.
Timeline,this is not new and it is happening on all  visual tech industry for decades
Timeline,"Curious to see the struggles of VFX artists and how similar they are to IT developers, and IT personnel in general. It seems that there is a generalised lack of respect for people who work with computers, from both management and customers."
Timeline,They need it done in 2 weeks so they can shelve it for 3 years. Hurry up!
Timeline,"Yea... disney ruining Stan Lee's company reputation..

Can't say I didn't see this one coming."

Timeline,It’s almost like Disney is a terrible company. Who would have thought that.

It honestly seems like they are cashing Marvel out at this point which I didn't think was going to happen under Fiege"

Timeline,"Unions are great, yes to unions, but in this case didn't the free market do its job? The potential employer was shitty, the potential employee refused the work. Happens all the time in every industry."
Timeline,"Dude offered job, it’s too much for him, dude says no. Big deal?"
Timeline,"What is this ludicrous parody illustration accompanying the article that describes nothing about visual effects. Also I’m suspicious of people saying de-aging on a marvel film has more clout than in a Scorsese film. Everyone knows marvel is cheesy AF. If this is real, then it just emphasizes that the industry needs to rid itself of the fanboy mentality.

Edit: too many fanboys in the thread downvoting who evidently have no industry experience. I say this to the workers on current marvel films: How the fuck did you get to the point where you think there is prestige doing Victoria Alonzo’s bidding. Grow the fuck up and tell them to go fuck themselves."
Timeline,Greenmans savin u right now bro
Timeline,"Not that I don’t want VFX artists to be treated fairly, but the moment they unionize all of their jobs will be outsourced overseas for much less money than they are currently makingZ

Edit:  why are people downvoting this? I’m not saying I want that to happen. I’m saying it *will* happen. VFX jobs are already being outsourced. It’ll just get worse with unionization."
Timeline,this sound similar to the peewee herman netflix movie.

Timeline,Good luck. This is exactly what Information Tech when through when overheating in the early 2000’s. Studio response?…replace them with smart mexicans from india. Same thing will happen here.
Timeline,"I'm tired of seeing VFX people being burned out of the industry, or firms collapsing despite getting paid because they're not getting paid enough to deal with the OT.

Marvel and Disney in general fucking suck for this from what I've been hearing. they'll film some actors in a greenscreen, then demand to do and redo and redo things until they figure out what angle they wanted, or in some cases, have alternate scenes like they are completely ass-unable to storyboard BEFORE filming their movies so it's a Choose Your Own Adventure basically until enough coked up executives agree it'll get max return on investment"
Timeline,As someone who works in VFX this all sounds super accurate. And it’s actually frame fucking… usually it doesn’t get down to the pixel.

Timeline,I saw an article yesterday that said Marvel pays 20% below the industry standard for VFX
Timeline,Aren't these guys highly skilled and sought after specialists? Why are they accepting shit jobs?
Timeline,"We’ve heard of VFX artists being exploited for a long time now. I’m surprised they haven’t managed to set and enforce their most important demands for working conditions and pay. 

I imagine if a significant portion of artists refuse to work for what a studio is offering, then what is the studio gonna do? Getting worse artists isn’t a great idea because the audience doesn’t react kindly to bad/cheap visuals. Paying some non-unionized artists would probably be very expensive because they could choose other projects to work on. 

I realize that when working in that field, by yourself you’re just one guy and don’t have any power. But collectively they would have a lot of leverage"
Timeline,"I’m 90 percent anti union having managed one at one point and even I’m pro union in this situation. 7 days, 16-18 hrs? , impossible deadline, unfair pay - that’s idiotic for an employer to demand and they should be punished as such. The vfx workers largest obstacle is that there is 3x more work than workers which means Disney can be like “whatever, we’ll find a mofo that will do it”  which there always is. But the customer gets an ass product in the end."
Timeline,"> Disney shows are looking like shit these days

the biggest problem is that it all looks and feels the same, there is no difference if I watch Dr. Strange MoM or Hawkeye"
Timeline,"Honestly: there was nothing wrong with Black Widow's VFX. There are shots which could be better, but they're all perfectly serviceable. VFX doesn't necessarily make or break most films *provided the audience is invested in the film*.

Black Widow's problem is the story the VFX tells makes no fucking sense at all. It's like someone got a brief for ""animate these Marvel superhero movie scenes"" and then was later told ""drop in this Scarlett Johansson 3D scan and send me the renders"".

The best VFX in the world won't make *Black Widow*'s effects look *good*, because narratively it all reads as nonsense based on what we know about the character and her capabilities."
Timeline,"I loved the writing and acting on She Hulk, but the CGI was so distracting. I was kinda wishing the whole time that they had just painted Tatiana Maslany green and put her on a stool. :P"
Timeline,"> other times it looks like Black Widow (oh man that movie's VFX were awful, maybe the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie). 

You haven’t seen Ghost Rider, have you?"
Timeline,The same has been happening to Disney animators for decades. The Mouse is a cruel taskmaster.
Timeline,"It's so self-defeating, too. I know they're trying to goose earnings numbers and capture the superhero zeitgeist, but they've totally oversaturated the genre and burned a bunch of people out. 

Avengers Endgame was the perfect time to slow it down, go for quality, and find a new reason for existing. Instead they hit the gas and pumped out a ton of hit-or-miss stuff that increasingly demands you watch *everything* to understand it. I've tuned out."
Timeline,The boom is very much over now. See HBO and Netflix cancelling stuff after they've ordered it.
Timeline,"Its the same as video games: making movie magic is a dream for a lot of people so taking a stand probably just gets you replaced. 

A union is what they need because like video games the company can make bank and still have the artists work crazy hours for profit that doesn't reach them. 

But forming a union is hard, a bunch of people have to risk their livelihoods on it and have to have enough of an impact to not just be replaced, like would any of us notice if 5 of the 20+ VFX firms listed in the back end of a movie credits roll changed?"
Timeline,"It seems from the article that Kevin Feige is very involved in the VFX approval process as well.
 

> Patch — who most recently worked as an associate visual-effects producer on the Jordan Peele horror-comedy Nope — **says he was surprised to discover that Alonso and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige insisted on personally approving shots that require visual-effects work.** “You wake up, and the first review would be set for 7:30 on a Sunday, because you’re dealing with Kevin’s schedule, you’re dealing with vendors all over the world: London, Bangalore, Australia, China,” he says. “Then everyone has to adjust based on the needs of whoever’s reviewing the shot: the director, the showrunner, the producers. **Everybody’s giving their opinion, and sometimes they’re giving multiple notes on the same frames. You’re like, ‘What direction do I go with this?’” (Marvel declined to comment on Feige’s involvement.** An insider close to the company, however, says that Feige does not approve every VFX shot.)"
Timeline,You mean Marvel?  The company that provided a “hot meal” to the crew at a press junket that consisted of half a 12” subway sandwich and water?  And no seconds?  For a movie that made hundreds of millions?  That Marvel?

Timeline,"I've had two friends straight up quit VFX after working Marvel shows.

One is now doing Tech Art for a video game studio, the other works in automotive simulations. They are both way happier and better paid."
Timeline,"I work in gamedev too - I'm always surprised at how much moviemaking experience is on our tech art team.

One of our tech artists was in charge of lighting the VFX shots for Return of the King. He went on to go work at ILM on the Star Wars prequels, before going to DreamWorks as one of their CG supervisors for _years_.

Then one day he decided he was sick of it and went into gamedev. It was so wild hearing the stories he told and the projects he worked on."

Timeline,"Typically the catering crew arrives 4 hours before ""crew call"" and stays 2-4 hours after 2nd meal is served. If the filming crew wraps early for the day, let's say an hour or two after second meal. The catering crew still has to be back to serve breakfast in less than 8 hours. Falling asleep at the wheel driving a box truck or refrigerated catering truck is a common occurrence in the film industry. The major production house side step this by hiring catering as a vendor and not having to pay or abide by union rules/ wages."

Timeline,"It would be IATSE along with everyone else that isn't considered Above the Line (Actors, writers, directors)"
Timeline,Wouldn't the Animation Guild be a more natural fit?
Timeline,"It’s a few different angles: vfx is a desirable industry and many people are willing to work for peanuts just to get into it so they are easily replaceable and expected to do it for the passion.  Second, many studios see a marvel contract as gold and will undercut a bid to get it.  Third, it’s a small industry and where I am (Vancouver) threat to unionize is sort of an instant black listing.  Studios also do shitty things like pay weekly rates instead of hourly because they know all the crazy hours required and they often underscope how long a shot will take.  It goes on and on…"
Timeline,"Seems like the natural fit in American Capitalism, every company tries to undercut each other, offering more work for less money. 
A lot of the other groups involved in making films are strongly unionised, so getting a VFX one up and running should be a huge priority for them."

Timeline,I mean the dumb thing is they don't even have to rush. They can take their sweet time making content and people will consume it like crazy. Avatar 2 came out after a decade and a half and people still flocked to watch it
Timeline,"it helps that Amazon don't have the insane release schedule that Disney now has. I hope if the VFX people do get strong unions, we start to see this bubble burst and come down to one or two marvel projects a year 

or - better yet - not rely on CGI for everything, especially the shows 

like, what if they actually had to be creative about telling these stories? cos it seems like right now they're burning out a whole industry for... shareholders"
Timeline,I'd also assume that like when they took over The Expanse they provided the VFX houses free access to AWS for rendering. That's a massive time saver for production.
Seven Seconds,Why is Netflix so hell-bent on not promoting shows with their Godawful UI? I Looked for around 5 minutes before I gave up and searched it. If not for reddit I wouldn't even know this existed.
Seven Seconds,"Spoiler:

I am really pissed at the ending because i just wanted some sweet justice for boy and specially for the girl. The way she cried at her last scene broke me into pieces.

Seven Seconds,"The establishing shots are ridiculously good looking.

Props to whomever are responsible."
Seven Seconds,"Finished four episodes. Really love it. Regina King is even better utilized here than she ever was on American Crime. 

Looking forward to finish the rest. Highly recommended."
Seven Seconds,I watched the first episode and enjoyed it. Surprised I’m not seeing much buzz about this one.

As an attorney, a lot of the points the show tried to score with the courtroom scenes were glaring and disappointing mischaracterizations of reality. Sure, the on-duty over night prosecutor would be expected to handle certain preliminary steps but high level murder prosecutions are then turned over to prosecutors with experience in those areas, not the shoplifting girl. Also, just a ton of examples of evidence being introduced during the trial without a proper foundation. Sentencing is never done moments after the jury verdict is read. There needs to be a more substantial records regarding the sentence for appeal purposes (e.g. if that happened in real life, defense counsel would likely be able to appeal the sentence and Jablonski would be free for a year or more while that worked its way through the system). Jablonski offered at one point to submit a written statement implicating the other officers, there was no reason to have him not do so even if they wanted him to testify since then they could use it to impeach his testimony during trial with his signed statement- it wouldn't even be hearsay since he was the party making the statement. Also, if the four cops were arrested, as a matter of course, a search warrant for evidence of their residences would have been issued...it wasn't otherwise they would have found the grill at Wilcox's or at Jablonski's before Nadine was killed. Speaking of Nadine- she tweets the photo of her with the dog taken days before she's taken to the home in Jersey City (was on Long Island with Fish's ex) and DiAngelo et al find it on the same day she returns to adopt Whiskey - that's some serious Deus ex Machina since they clearly grabbed her- on Long Island- during the day-  and had no way to know she was there since the only reason she was there (and her parents weren't notified after Jersey came to get her from Long Island, a different fucking state) was because she escaped. Meaning- Di Angelo and his crew take a day to take a chance she returns to the shelter and catch her a mere hour or so after she arrives there- kill her (in New Jersey since Fish and KJ respond to the scene with JCPD investigating the body).   
  
I didn't hate the series but shows like this contribute to a misunderstanding of the justice system and the Court. "
Seven Seconds,"Watched the series over the past few days. Great show but some episodes drag on. The acting was fantastic and the tail end of the show is where it really picks up. Basically when they get to the courtroom. Theres a few things that needed fleshing out. Mainly the motivation for the captain and his interest, felt like it was tossed in there needlessly. The message of the show is a bit dark but it does highlight flaws in the US legal system, politicians, and the behavior of many police agencies. The ""Justice is not the truth but what you can prove in court"" message is a real bitch."
Seven Seconds,"Just finished the season. Glued to my screen the whole way through, but *brutally* disappointed by the ending. "

Seven Seconds,"Finished it, enjoyed it.
The finale left a few questions about the message of the film or if it had a message..
Also, I somehow still don't know ehy its calles ""Sevrn Seconds"", must have missed that explanation."
Seven Seconds,"Just finished watching the first 2 episodes, I really like it so far. Also nice seeing something take place so close to home (from NJ, pretty close to Jersey City)."
Seven Seconds,After sitting through half of the first season I wish everyone would just watch the movie that it's based on. The remake is a much tamer reimagining of a similar story that drags on for hours.
Seven Seconds,"I'm four episodes in and it's been fantastic so far. A bit on the slow side, but the characters are well established and developed, the central conflict is being set up extremely well, and the acting is seriously top notch. Additionally the cinematography is gorgeous and the framing shots are incredible and add so much depth to each character without any dialog. This has been really good so far."
Seven Seconds,"The lead prosecutor is gorgeous. Really love looking at her face. Love that she is a drink loser who goes to karaoke. From a well off family and not measuring up to get her father's standards. And she is a shit lawyer, and finds a way to fight thru it all. 

Best story is hers. 

Everything else is totally cliche been done better bullshit. All the casting is just too on the nose. Everyone looks like what they are. The events all play out like some second rate train of The Shield. It's a complete rip off of vic Mackey and his strike team, on down to his relationship with the neighborhood gang and even how he gets rid of him. 

The show was also all over the place. Daddy issues for everyone. And we never got a compelling reason why they covered it up from the beginning anyway. At least say it has something to do with not wanting attention on the team or something. 

If anyone wants a great show about a rogue strike team unit, go watch the shield right now. Top five show of all time."
Seven Seconds,"I’ve only watched episode one, so don’t ruin anything for me in this thread...

My takeaways - 

It’s shot beautifully and the acting has been quite good so far. 

I am having a hard time buying the premise though. Exploiting Ferguson and BLM/BlueLM over something like what happened to be an extreme stretch. He didn’t gun the kid down. He wasn’t even on duty. He was essentially texting and driving and being negligent. 

Further—its only 3-5 years for the crime!? Yet, this new narc cop is falling apart and his overly mob-like unit leader acts like he’s going to do life and bring down the whole unit with him. 

I feel like I’m missing something...

Those issues really brought me out of an otherwise well-told story. I’m digging the broken, drunk prosecutor and Jablonsky as characters. 

Otherwise, I’m hesitant that I’ll be able to dig into this show with my issues with the premise."
Seven Seconds,"Supposedly it's based off a Russian movie, but the location makes me think it was based off this NYC incident:

besides the cliches and stereotypes.. the law stuff is very bad written. 

SO MANY THINGS MAKE NO SENSE. low thinking everywhere. "
Seven Seconds,"Very late to the party but want to write something in case someone else comes from google looking for discussions. 

I don't understand why they couldn't make the proper investigation for Nadine's death. Wasn't the whole point that the white and rich are treated differently? Looks like they are not. There is not even an investigation just cause she was an addict. In the end no one seemed to care enough about Nadine, even when they knew who killed her! Couldn't they go tell the parents they think she was killed, so that they pressed for a bigger investigation? Did they even examine her body for any blood under nails? Could they look for any footage near the dog shelter and try to track cops' phones around that place? There was even another junkie witness around. Oh and she did tell them DiAngelo had her friend's phone, they could look up records to see whose phone it was and find the said friend. It all feels a little bit like the ""things left for season 2"", but that got cancelled..."
Seven Seconds,Isn't it released everywhere? It's not on Netflix Mexico.
Seven Seconds,Really really bad courtroom scenes that have no basis in reality.  Counsel for both sides were making statements to the jury throughout while presumably asking witnesses questions. I really am disappointed that the contrived outrage of this series wound up completely overshadowing how real criminal investigations and trials wind up taking place. 
Seven Seconds,"Late to the party here.

I'm only halfway through the first episode. Spoilers ahead. I wanted to turn it off a few minutes in because I'm tired of plots that don't need to happen I guess you could say. Of course the people in the hospital can't give a little more information. Of course he's so distracted he shouldn't be driving. Of course the guy has to be on the phone. Of course he has to call his buddies instead of 911. Of course they have to cover it up. Of course they don't bother checking that the kid is still alive. This seems pretty draining to watch. Maybe I will only do half episodes at a time or watch the movie as someone here suggested."
Seven Seconds,"oh man I just watched this and felt INCREDIBLY disappointed with the ending LOL.

If it feels this bad for me just watching I can't imagine what it must feel like for the people who've gone through something like this in real life. soul crushing nothingness."
Seven Seconds,"

All has been said. I just need to vent.  As this is a show about a crime it is no spoiler there is a courtroom scene.  I have watched real trials on TV that were more interesting and the lawyers did not speak in flat monotones.   I was able to watch up to to this point by skipping over the dull sad parts. I may not make it through"
Seven Seconds,I’m watching the 1st epsiode rn and i feel like i’m gonna stop watching the whole show before this episode ends 
Seven Seconds,"3 episodes in and the characters are all caricatures. We have the corrupt cop, the gangsters who hate cops, the bad detective and her asshole partner. It's so wacky and relatable! /s. 

Drags on. I see where it is going a mile away and after reading some spoilers it turns out nothing is learned from any of the characters. 

Glad it was canceled. "
Seven Seconds,"Before I start watching: did they fix the horrible sound editing from the trailer? Could barely hear anything they said.

If there's one thing worse than poorly-lit shows, it's poor audio."

I think this show is incredibly predictable and unrealistic. Won’t be continuing."

Seven Seconds,It came up on the frontpage last night.   Finally watching it now.  WOW so far.
Seven Seconds,I couldn't find it just scrolling through yesterday and now today it has showed up under New Releases. They really do need to fix it. 
Seven Seconds,"I concur. I just finished the series. I waited for the cathartic finish that never came. Disappointing. But I guess that's the realism or cultural commentary that they're going for. 
I hope there's a second season and the chick murder comes back and bites them back. "
Seven Seconds,Hey since you finished the series... can I ask why you think J decided to reneg on what he said he’d do after his wife shared what she learned in the bathroom? (I didn’t wanna spell out ppl’s names because it’s a spoiler)

Seven Seconds,Regina King is fucking great in everything really.

Seven Seconds,"Not surprised considering who the creator is (veena sud of The Killing fame) In fact, I was going to watch this earlier but as soon as a saw her name I kind of rolled my eyes and immediately put this show on the backburner. 
The killing had a magnificent chilling tone but it has to be one of the slowest most poorly plotted shows I've ever seen. Really want to give it a chance but judging from the review I've seen this likely suffers from the same issues The Killing had. Gonna wait till I clear up some more important stuff in my queue before I give this a shot. "
Seven Seconds,"Also a lawyer, I learned long ago to let the ridiculousness of courtroom scenes go or a majority of law-related media is impossible to watch. I get the frustration, but I just assumed they get similar things wrong about every other profession and it's easier to deal with lol. The evidence stuff wasn't that bad, laying a foundation makes for boring TV, I was more annoyed by them arguing to the jury mid-questioning a witness, and several blatant Golden Rule violations"
Seven Seconds,"> Jablonski offered at one point to submit a written statement implicating the other officers, there was no reason to have him not do so even if they wanted him to testify since then they could use it to impeach his testimony during trial with his signed statement

This is one thing that got me. Get that in writing even if you've got a verbal agreement to say it on the stand. "
Seven Seconds,"As a New Zealander, it baffled me how the police were so unbothered by one of their officers committing a crime. Is this the general attitude in America? And are there really special legal protections for police officers? Because I would have thought that those who are sworn to uphold the law as their job would be punished more harshly than civilians but apparently not.
Also the blue lives matter thing is so weird, you aren't born a cop ??"
Seven Seconds,Is it true that Nadine’s statement couldn’t be read in court because the defendants have the right to face their accuser? Isn’t the point of a statement (or possibly deposition) to preserve testimony? 
Seven Seconds,"This is so funny and true. How about when Brenton’s father just randomly decides he’s going to be a witness during a break. Then he’s immediately on the stand right away. Then, the Defense has Child Protectove Services record to grill him on. Why’d they have that if they didn’t even know he’d be on the stand? "
Seven Seconds,You really start to tell for the cup that caused this whole thing too. It puts a lot into perspective. Everyone's motivations are all very clear and as such it allows the slow pace to not feel like a massive drag. I four episodes in and I already like a ton has happened.
Seven Seconds,It's seven seconds because that's how long he stood at the top of the ditch and looked down at the body before walking away. I love that you have no idea why the show is called that till the very last episode. 
Seven Seconds,There was mention of it in the second court room scene in the final episode 
Seven Seconds,I haven't seen it yet but I'm guessing it's because the event took place in seven seconds. It says it's an anthology series's so that will probably be the case for future seasons as well
Seven Seconds,Probably about how a couple of seconds can change peoples lives so much
Seven Seconds,I guess the message was that Justice system doesn't always work even when everyone knows a person is a bad guy.
Seven Seconds,">The show was also all over the place. Daddy issues for everyone. And we never got a compelling reason why they covered it up from the beginning anyway. At least say it has something to do with not wanting attention on the team or something. 

**Spoilers**

It seemed to me that they chose that route because they thought the kid was dead. D has an interesting relationship with Jablonski (sp?) and didn't want him to get in trouble and not be there for his new son (hence the subplot of the daddy issues stuff). They felt (incorrectly) that covering it up when the damage was already done was the best option at the time, and it was DeAngelo calling the shots because the other two didn't want to go along with it at first. 

That's probably the most realistic reason. Stuff like this happens in real-life where people make a mistake, have an accident, don't think clearly, and end up making really poor decisions that cascade out of control. So what would have been a small issue becomes a major issue."
Seven Seconds,"What'd you think of Jablonski's wife? Honestly, to me, she was the 'prettiest'. I kind of had a thing for KJ harper as well, but Jablonksi's wife Marie wins it for me. Gorgeous latina or whatever she is."

There's a reason DiAngelo acted the way he did. Won't spoil too much but it has to do with ties to the gang"
Seven Seconds,"While the comparisons to BLM stuff are not as overtly applicable as they could be, to an extent the way the series goes justifies the links a bit more if that makes sense.

"
Seven Seconds,"This show is a very slow burn, it takes it's time getting to plot points. If that's something you feel like won t work for you then that's fine. Not e veryrhing appeals to everyone."
Seven Seconds,"100% agree with you. The acting is weak, the plot is predictable and slow, and the criminal and judicial procedures are incredible unrealistic. "
Seven Seconds,[deleted]
Seven Seconds,It was much more powerful the way it ended.  The hopeful cathartic ending would have left us feeling good but in this world it wouldnt have felt real.
Seven Seconds,Netflix isn’t making a second season.
Seven Seconds,"I thought it was cause he accepted responsibility for what he did. I don't think in the premiere we see him ever leave his car but at the end we figure out that he did. [spoiler](#s ""We as the viewer thought he was scared and just following the orders of his boss because the kid was already dead. When he reality he saw the kid and saw that he wasn't dead but still chose to walk away. In the end it was still his choice."")"
Seven Seconds,I thought it was more from fear for the safety of his child if he did go after him. 
Seven Seconds,"I have the same question.

I *think* it's supposed to him with daddy issues trying to prove what a good cop, team player he is as a big screw you. There's even the ""that's how you like them"" line in the halls earlier. 

But it doesn't really make sense why learning what he does triggers that reaction. "
Seven Seconds,"I have no idea, he probably was scared or loyality bullshit. It wasn't really clear to me why."
Seven Seconds,Because he didn’t want to be like his father. 
Seven Seconds,"Her controlled, shocked, grief over the loss of her son in the third episode wasa legitimately incredible piece of acting "
Seven Seconds,I have seen 3 billboards in my city for it. Our population is less than 300k so it’s weird to see a promotional campaign here. 
Seven Seconds,It's Power all over again lol. Although I'm a brown guy from Australia so probably the show wasn't made for my demographic lol.
Seven Seconds,Yeah us Reddit users are uncultured swine 
Seven Seconds,"It's definitely the same with other industries (ER, House come to mind).  Am a classical musician and this certainly applies to Mozart in the Jungle.  It has evolved in some good ways but most musicians are turned off from how certain things are portrayed and executed to make the series more palatable to the masses."
Seven Seconds,It's like watching anything on TV that has to do with IT for me. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
Seven Seconds,Your username 😁
Seven Seconds,Word. 
Seven Seconds,"I mean, I'd say it is accurate enough as long as you use some common sense. Obviously it is a drama and they are not going to portray the typical situation but the one that gets at the heart of the matter. No, US police officers are not all murderers or people who would look the other way. I believe the vast majority are fair and decent. Are there still problems? Yeah. I think the problems are more with the systems in place rather than the individuals.

Even within the show, there was a police officer that was passionate about finding justice regardless of whether the suspect wore a badge. I'm betting in the real world you'll find both types."
Seven Seconds,"Pretty much spot on. The difference is the availability of the witness. If Jablonski is on the stand (physically there to answer questions) and he changes his testimony from what he previously said in a written statement, the statement can then be quoted to impeach his testimony (Yesterday, you said X, now its Y, what changed?). With an unavailable witness, the statement cannot be cross examined since the witness cannot answer any questions."
Seven Seconds,"I thought it was a great touch, I even went back to the first episode to check and Diangelo only stood there for 7 seconds. "
Seven Seconds,"The ending flashes back to Jablonski walking in the ditch and seeing Brenton, taking only 'seven seconds' to do so, but if you go back and watch the Pilot (EP1), he never goes to the ditch, he sees the bike and then is rushed in his car by DiAngelo and then drives away. That was confusing."
Seven Seconds,Do you mean the count down in the closing argument?
Seven Seconds,"Right, I understand what their loose reasoning was, but for me it did not seem compelling enough to build the show around. 

However.....Maybe that was the point, that cops casually do stuff like this the same way we may casually order take out. "
Seven Seconds,"i thought she was a bit odd looking, mainly her nose

and the voice didn't help"
Seven Seconds,I think she looked a little like princess Megan 
Seven Seconds,"I considered it might be going that way, but in the first episode it seemed overblown for the info we were given. I’m definitely going to keep watching."
Seven Seconds,Also imdb is usually never indicative of anything’s quality. 
Seven Seconds,"Awww, that's too bad, oh well. Plenty of other bingeworthy shows. "
Seven Seconds,I'm late to the party (just finished about 30 minutes ago) but I think you are right. He went and looked and saw what he did before DiAngelo even came. He knew what he had done and still allowed DiAngelo to cover it up. He drove away knowing that he had hurt someone.
Seven Seconds,"I've heard other theories that after his wife told him that DiAngelo was going to have him killed, he feared that if he snitched, DiAngelo would go after his wife and child
"
Seven Seconds,She's a snake. I assumed she twisted what she was told into a threat against the baby. 
Seven Seconds,"I think it was his way of hurting DiAngelo, because DiAngelo loves (either romantically or fatherly) Jablonski, and the risk of him going to prison for 20 years was Jablonski’s revenge through self-sabotage."
Seven Seconds,"Yeah, I guess fear makes the most sense because he's realizing what D is capable of. I wish the show would have made it more clear."
Seven Seconds,Can I ask which city you’re in?
Seven Seconds,[deleted]
Seven Seconds,It just bugs me with legal shows since the Court system affects everyone and distortions have real world consequences such as juries having unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence due to CSI:'s popularity. Another show I just watched had some problematic issues as well: Goliath as to civil law.

Ugly Delicious,"David Chang can definitely be annoying and/or a hypocrite, but damnit, I just love this show and the atmosphere, the food they show, the stories they tell."
Ugly Delicious,"David Chang does not have enough insightful things to say to make me wanna watch another season of his try-hard trugery. He wants so badly to be the philosopher-evangelist on the power of food and it's role in culture, but has none of the depth, nuance, warmth or intelligence of superior hosts on similar shows.

He's a chef-cum-entrepeneur that has made a lot of money and clearly thinks his success means he knows it all, but he sadly doesn't actually back it up with anything even remotely thought provoking. Which wouldn't be as annoying if he didn't so clearly think he was on the level of people like Bourdain, who are far more elegant and interesting with their commentary.

Sadly the best thing about David Chang's shows are the fleeting moments where other people get to talk."
Ugly Delicious,Oh I love this show. Seeing delicious food that I could actually afford + learning about food history. The episode on MSG and Asian food was eye-opening. Edit: Just saw my go-to restaurant in the trailer!
Ugly Delicious,"Anyone know what happened with David and Peter Meehan? I assume Peter is not involved in this season of UD, but I've never really read anything that laid out why the two fell out. I really enjoyed their interactions in s1 of UD."
Ugly Delicious,"I especially appreciate this show for giving Toronto some love. Totally surprised when that happened.

edit: why the fuck was this downvoted?"
Ugly Delicious,"As a 1st generation Taiwanese-American, this show absolutely hit the mark for me. ""Fried Rice"" in particular hits on something that I've ruminated about internally for a long time but could never put into words - it touches on racism experienced by Asian-americans, and how part of that manifests in our food culture. In short: a lot of ""asian"" cuisines in America (Panda, PF Changs) aren't really true to their roots because they were developed as a response to racism in the United States, because Americans were too narrow-minded to broaden their horizons and try authentic things, or in the case of nascent Chinese-American cuisine, because racist policies prevented the arrival of immigrants skilled in cooking in the first place.

That's why it's so painful to have someone like Andrew Zimmern open a ""Chinese restaurant"" in the midwest, or have someone declare in a restaurant review that Chinese restaurants in NYC Chinatown are ""gross and dirty"" and that it takes a Chinese restaurant with a white chef to do it right. 

Given this context, it's really hard for white people to ""put their own spin on asian cuisine"" without sparking racial tensions. 

[Unfortunately, it's clear reading some of the comments in this thread that this point is lost on a lot of people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/f9b4s3/ugly_delicious_2_official_trailer_march_6_2020/fiqtf6w/)"
Ugly Delicious,"Super excited for this

I went to one of the pizza places in Tokyo featured in season 1 and got a few different pizzas. It was the best pizza I've ever had. The raw tuna pizza was so much better than I thought it was going to be"
Ugly Delicious,Why do I know that guy? Was he on Chef Show? I'm down for more Netflix culinary shows though.
Ugly Delicious,"fuck yeah, best food show on netflix easily"
Ugly Delicious,I need to get around to finishing season 1! I think I got to the last episode or two but got sidetracked by life.
Ugly Delicious,"Unless it gets significantly better time, I tried watching the first episode and gave up halfway through. They didn't do a good job of introducing the hosts or even what the show is supposed to be, other than it being some kinda cooking/culture show. If you put on any given episode of an Anthony Bourdain show, you will know within ten seconds who Anthony is and what the show is about. Ugly Delicious just felt sloppy and lazy and more in line with Netflix's shovel programming rather than Parts Unknown. I don't know how this crap got a second season."
Ugly Delicious,"Yay David Choe is back!


DVDASA for life"
Ugly Delicious,"How to make a travel food show:

1. Get snarky host who teaches cooking by talking about how it’s an art form or something

2. Go to fancy location nobody can afford or cannot be invited to like a 3 star Michelin restaurant or a monestary miles from civilization

3. Have the host talk up their accomplishments regularly

4. Slow mo shots of things being poured or processed

5. Awkward chit chat with guest chefs who couldn’t care less about the show and fake laugh at their jokes"
Ugly Delicious,"> a hypocrite

why do you say this?"
Ugly Delicious,Agreed. I just started watching it and there is this scene about him delivering domino’s pizza and he just tells the crew that he doesn’t wanna fucking deliver pizza’s anymore while earlier he said that he doesn’t like snobs and how they react.
Ugly Delicious,"I definitely had a similar impression and was a little worried about going in, but I think the new season brings a lot more people who are closer to the cultures or foods he's exploring and lets them speak."
Ugly Delicious,I’m watching season 2 and he comes off as such an ignorant douche.  He pretty much displays his ignorance directly to people’s cultures in ways that I find downright embarrassing almost every episode.  It’s such a bad look.
Ugly Delicious,"This is the first I'm hearing of their fallout and Ive got to say I'm pretty bummed. I really enjoyed the segments Peter was a part of, more so than when David was on screen, and had been looking forward to more from him."
Ugly Delicious,Are you talking about the Toronto show with Seth? That wasn't an UD episode but another David Chang show on Netflix.
Ugly Delicious,"Oh, we went to that pizza place on our honeymoon and it was great."
Ugly Delicious,Yeah. He's in jon favreau's food show. He's also done a couple of food documentaries for netflix also.
Ugly Delicious,"He's a very successful chef and restaurateur

He was on The Chef Show, Chef's Table, and The Mind of a Chef"
Ugly Delicious,Of S1? It gets better that's the worst episode.
Ugly Delicious,"I'm not the OP, but if you watch Season 1 of Ugly Delicious, in my opinion his message gets muddled because he doesn't practice what he preaches when it comes to Asian cuisine.

He makes it very clear from the beginning that basically the thesis for the show is that he has a problem with the concept of ""authenticity."" In his opinion, so he states from the outset, just because something is authentic doesn't mean it is good. Further, he believes authenticity acts as a roadblock for other people who don't come from the traditional background associated with a particular cuisine from experimenting and potentially improving upon classic dishes by fusing it with new flavors.

You see this in episodes like the pizza episode or the crawfish episode. He basically makes fun of the stodgy people from Naples who only consider certain types of pizza made with certain ingredients certifiably neapolitan. Chang goes so far as to defend Domino's as a legitimately good take on pizza. The crawfish episode is much of the same - Chang portrays people in New Orleans who prepare crawfish in the traditional manner as out of touch and behind in the times compared to Asian chefs who offer a new take on it. The message is essentially that people should be allowed to experiment and challenge the traditional ways of preparing dishes.

That's all well and good, and something I can get on board with. The problem is that Chang then does NOT feel the same way about people experimenting with Asian food.

For instance he then goes on to say in the fried chicken episode: ""I see a lot of white guys making Korean food, and I’ll be honest, it pisses the shit out of me, because it’s everywhere now: kimchi this, kimchi that. I’m like, ‘You weren’t ostracized in elementary school because everyone thought, when they visited your house, it smelled like garbage.’ They didn’t have to endure emotional hardship, and now it’s cool.""

The fried chicken episode, he talks a lot about how the roots of the cuisine is in African American culture, but then is critical of how white people took it from its roots and bastardized it. However, he then pivots again to talk about Korean fried chicken and how that take on fried chicken is new and invigorating.

When he talks about Chinese food, he goes on and on about how ""American"" Chinese food is not ""real"" Chinese food, and how white people bastardized it. And how if you go to a Chinese restaurant you should badger the waiter for the ""real"" menu. He's then put in his place somewhat when he actually visits China, tries ""real"" Chinese food, and basically straight up hates it. 

I don't think this is in the show, but for some added color, he's openly stated he for instance despises Panda Express as a bastardization of Asian food. Well, it would be very easy to say that the way he feels about Panda Express, is the way those Napoli pizza guys feel about Domino's. He went to the mat to defend a non-traditional, fast food version of pizza, but he'll never do the same thing for a fast food version of Asian food.

So basically, he doesn't stick to what he preaches - that authenticity is BS and gets in the way of people experimenting with food. He is all about experimentation and a new way of doing things if it is for instance taking a classically ""white"" dish and putting an Asian twist on it. If the people who cook those dishes the traditional way are white - like the Napoli pizza people or the Louisiana crawfish people - he handwaves their concerns as being out of touch and a slave to authenticity. However, he is equally vocally critical about white chefs ""experimenting"" with dishes outside of their race or ethnicity - he openly admits it ""pisses him off"" and the show essentially portrays any white chef cooking a traditional Asian or African American dish as a cultural imperialist erasing history.

If white people put their spin on it, it's bastardization of a proud ethnic tradition. If a PoC does it, it is a fresh new take on something that was stuck in the past.

I am not saying David Chang is a bad guy or anything, the show is entertaining and he would probably cop to some of these biases. But basically, he is the type of guy who is urging people to ""challenge traditions"" - except if those traditions are his own."
Ugly Delicious,"First thing that comes to mind, is, how he is always annoyed by people, that don't try food and judge it beforehand ... and then basically fake-pukes because there's a dish with donkey meat. He's a huge drama queen in that scene."
Ugly Delicious,"I’m watching the second season now and he comes off as extremely ignorant almost every episode, from his discussion on curry to calling Lebanese/Syrian food Arabian food.  He’s very unlikable in my opinion."
Ugly Delicious,"I think there’s a difference though, I don’t think he comes off as I’m right you’re wrong. I think he’s just openly ignorant for the shadow and he knows it. Like in the indian episode he is open about how diverse Indian cuisine is and how he was completely ignorant to that fact."
Ugly Delicious,Called it.
Ugly Delicious,"No, I'm talking about the ""Fried Rice"" episode of UD."
Ugly Delicious,Seth Rogan? That was Vancouver BC. Different show.
Ugly Delicious,"> He's then put in his place somewhat when he actually visits China, tries ""real"" Chinese food, and basically straight up hates it. 

I could not believe he rudely spit up the food he didn't like in front of the people who served him."
Ugly Delicious,"David Chang openly describes himself as a hypocrite, I’m pretty sure. He’s an incendiary person. I find him interesting to listen to for sure and I’m happy he’s trying to put high end Korean food on the map, but yeah, he is ... difficult."
Ugly Delicious,"Interesting write up, this is pretty dead on. I mentioned something vaguely similar in another reply (of about 2 sentences though, lol).

You went much more in depth into it and reminded me of having similar thoughts while watching those episodes. In particular what you mentioned about pizza and him hating the real Chinese food, I had the exact same take when I watched it.

At least he is pretty up front about it, I've heard him say many times on shows or podcasts something along the lines of being self aware of this type of behavior, calling himself an asshole, wrong, etc."
Ugly Delicious,"> The problem is that Chang then does NOT feel the same way about people experimenting with Asian food.
> 
> For instance he then goes on to say in the fried chicken episode: ""I see a lot of white guys making Korean food, and I’ll be honest, it pisses the shit out of me, because it’s everywhere now: kimchi this, kimchi that.

Is it that he's not cool with people experimenting with asian cuisine, or is it that he's not cool with people who *aren't* asian experimenting with asian cuisine? It's been a while since I watched season 1, but I thought he was commenting on cultural appropriation by people who don't understand the essence of ethnic food.

[Edit]
The more I read this, the more I realize how much historical and racial context is lost in the argument made by /u/jmarFTL. Take Korean fried chicken for example. [Fried chicken was introduced to Koreans by Americans after the Korean War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_fried_chicken). Koreans then tinkered with the recipe to suit their own palates. Why does Chang think that's OK vs the colonel's take on friend chicken? Probably because the Koreans *weren't being exploitative when they did it*.

What about American-Chinese food? First and foremost, it's not Chinese food because these dishes don't exist in China. Second, it wasn't a bastardization by white people; it was a bastardization *for them* to appeal to their palates. Third, actual bastardization by white people is a contemporary phenomenon where [white people open ""clean Chinese restaurants""](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/nyregion/lucky-lees-nyc-chinese-food.html), contrasting with the racist trope that Chinese restaurants can be dirty, unsanitary, gross, and bad for you ""because of the MSG""."
Ugly Delicious,">If white people put their spin on it, it's bastardization of a proud ethnic tradition. If a PoC does it, it is a fresh new take on something that was stuck in the past.

Regarding this sentiment, you should rewatch the ""Blindspots"" bit at the 34:55 mark of the ""Fried Rice"" episodes. They address this - white people putting their spin on it isn't a bastardization because it's a white person doing it, it's that in America there's a lot of racist notions about Chinese food. White people ""putting their spin on it"" to fix perceived problems with asian cuisine is problematic because it's racist."
Ugly Delicious,"I’ll never forget seeing him make fun of a Domino’s pizza driver who was taking his job seriously in Season 1. 

So condescending and dickish. Haven’t watched anything since"
Ugly Delicious,"hmm that is true, he does seem to be picky/judgemental about certain foods. not a good look given his whole ""brigade"" against people who discriminate msg/smelly asian food/etc."
Ugly Delicious,"I think that’s absolutely fine though because most people are ignorant to these types of food, I will say 80-90% of the world is ignorant to foods outside their own bubble and it’s good to see a show that highlights the differences. He isn’t saying he is right or that other people are wrong he is openly admitting his biases and honestly that isn’t wrong."
Ugly Delicious,"Yeah, I don't think he is a bad guy and I think he is aware of it. I kind of wish that some of the people he talks with who know him well would challenge him a bit more on the show. It feels like it could be really interesting if say Peter Meehan was a counterpoint to him more. I least like Ugly Delicious when David makes some bold statement without a whole lot of thought behind it and then all of the people who are with him agree with everything he says over and over - I don't find that all that interesting (I always find the food interesting though, so I'll watch most any kind of travel/food show).

I most like Ugly Delicious when David takes a step back and examines why he feels a certain way about certain things. Things like trying the Chinese food and disliking it were great, and props to him for leaving that in the show and letting people see it. I hope there is more of that in Season 2."
Ugly Delicious,But David can mess with the perceived problems of the white chefs without being racist? That's a double standard buddy.
Ugly Delicious,"Can I also say from that scene how awesome that guy was at his job? ""You always want to run to the door, because you never know if someone is watching or not and you want to give the impression that you are rushing to provide them with fresh pizza."" Hats off dude."
Ugly Delicious,Yeah the entitled part of him came out in full-force in that scene. He could have at least waited until the dude was out of earshot.
Ugly Delicious,Exactly. That's what I meant by 'hypocrite'.
Ugly Delicious,"I don't think he has a fully formed point of view. It feels like they gave him a show so he had to come up with a thesis, but he didn't really examine it to see if it was really true to himself.

I still like the show."
Ugly Delicious,">But David can mess with the perceived problems of the white chefs without being racist?

Does he actually do this or did you just come up with a strawman argument? And if he does, are the perceived problems racist notions about food made by white chefs?"
Ugly Delicious,Read the huge post the guy wrote again. He lists examples. You can keep being a victim if that's your prerogative though. See ya.
Ugly Delicious,"He doesn't list anything that I'm talking about - there are no examples of Chang fixing problems with white chef's food *based on racist preconceptions*. Learn to read, will ya?*

[Edit]
*I'm trying to have an honest conversation while you're all:

>You can keep being a victim if that's your prerogative though. See ya.

Way to converse like an adult."
Ugly Delicious,The episode about Chinese food was very interesting. I liked how Chang mentions that people look down on it and how some of that stems from the Chinese Exclusion Act and yellow peril. The best part was when he had a group of people who claimed that they disliked Chinese food because of the MSG but were fine eating junk food that had tons of it.
Ugly Delicious,"I'm only one episode in but I'm enjoying it for the most part.  I really liked how they branched the pizza episode in two polar opposite directions (Chang interning at Dominos, Food Writer/Pizza Chef go to Napoli) although I kind of found the food writer and pizza chef to be a little bit insufferable (i.e. anything beyond cheese, sauce, crust and maybe meat is NOT pizza).  I just don't see a point to the whole snobbery facet of food culture aside from making yourself feel superior to someone else.  If you enjoy something, who gives a shit what it is?  "
Ugly Delicious,"I love this series! Ugly Delicious does a great job showing the cultural interpretations of food and how it has really inspired people to experiment with tradition and authenticity. They show many sides of how a certain food is prepared. ie. Sushi on a pizza!? Is that still considered pizza?

There's a great moment in the BBQ episode where Chang is so moved by a well made yakitori meal that he goes behind the counter to hug the Japanese chef. Both cultures (Korean & Japanese) generally do not show a lot of affection, but it is clear that both were touched (both in near tears) by each other's appreciation and care for the food. 

Really dig Chang's non-elitism to food. It's a bit of an anti-Chef's Table, which I still loved, but Chang's food is more approachable.
"
Ugly Delicious,"Okay so, I'm on episode 3 where he's shopping with his mom.

The next scene he'srecounting how his mom would cook sirloin steak from frozen in the toaster oven and she says

""ahh..you remember too much"" shaking her head closing her eyes

korean as hell"
Ugly Delicious,"I love the stereotypical ‘trashy’ food porn TV shows - think ‘Man v Food’, ‘Cheap Eats’, ‘Diners, Driveins & Dives’, competition shows like ‘Masterchef’, ‘Beat Bobby Flay’ or just plain cook-along type shows.

I’ve never found an instance of the kind of show you’re talking about that doesn’t bore the crap out of me. Personal opinion only, but food programming & documentary style programming just don’t mix.

Maybe my brain (& that of the ‘more people you referenced) is conflicted when combining the 2 styles?"
Ugly Delicious,"I like it, and will watch more.  I also recommend ""Fuck, That's Delicious"" with Action Bronson on YouTube."
Ugly Delicious,"I thought the Pizza episode was just a boring version of Vice's ""Pizza Show."" I'll have to give the other episodes a try."
Ugly Delicious,really really good. pleasantly surprised
Ugly Delicious,Yes! Thank you. Chang has been highly criticized for his brashness but he's looking at food from the everyman perspective instead of the elitist food snob who believes something is wonderful just bc it costs a fortune.  
Ugly Delicious,Chefs table is legit
Ugly Delicious,"Even if it isn’t quite binge-worthy, I think A Chef’s Life works. It’s far less boring than “Diners...” anyway. "
Ugly Delicious,"I love both styles. I'm a huge Master Chef fan, but I just EAT UP all these Netflix cooking shows."
Ugly Delicious,"Next episode on Tacos is the best episode so far. I've watched 6th episode last night, Fried Chicken, and it pushes the envelope on food and multiculturalism."
Ugly Delicious,"Especially since it had a lot of the same people/locations in it. 

I also thought the dominos section was a bit /r/hailcorporate, especially when you compare it to Pizza shows little caesars section.

Like I get that they need to explore the corporate pizza environment, but did they need to get Chang in a customer service role out of the kitchen? Like I don't felt that really explored dominos and how they make pizza.

And the whole taste testing corporate pizza scene is a complete copy of a scene from the pizza show, down to Mark not enjoying it"
Ugly Delicious,"That video is a really weird pick for a first peek....

For a series that goes ""around the globe looking at what we eat as the bridge between cultures"" hosted by David Chang, who's a super interesting and inventive chef, it seems odd to introduce that with a clip of people chatting casually about Yelp and service at American Vietnamese restaurants. "
Ugly Delicious,"Yeah, agreed. I hope they release a proper soonish."

Ugly Delicious,pine gap was pretty good and only 6 episodes
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I played most RE games. They shine in the atmosphere and gameplay departments, not in plots and relationships. The story each game offers is at best entertaining without an emotional depth. 

Creating an amazing RE show will require you to create an amazing plot from scratch."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"There's more nuance here than what you imply. Last of Us was practically tailor-made to be adapted to live action. The thing is steeped in cinematic techniques. Some even criticize that aspect of it, saying games like that are too much like playable movies. It's something Hollywood can easily wrap its head around. As such it's no surprise that it made for a good (or at least faithful) adaptation."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"My brother in Umbrella Corp, are you really comparing the narrative source material of TLOU to Resident Evil?"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,I think the Last of Us proves that a video game should only follow the source material when the source material already plays like a movie.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,">  If anything, The Last of Us show has disproved any doubt that a video game adaptation needs to follow the SOURCE MATERIAL.

Not at all... there is plenty of shit source material that should NOT be translated to TV. 

Last of Us was already a good story that had to be adapted. Some games absolutely do not need to be remade shot for shot lol, especially half the resident evil games which had plots closer to a  bingo board.

If anything we need to ditch source material and just create new stories in established worlds. I already played the games, i know what happens - show us something new with new characters."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"This stems from 

A. Last of us has a practical Oscar winning script in a fucking game.

B. Resident evil has a literal by the books barely there storyline that has been shit on so many times and retconned alot of plot points later on.

Having said that I DO love the show but I have more complaints than I would like to have with the adaptation, but it IS comparatively better than any Resident evil movie adaptation by a long shot.

The cast of the show is great and can all act, but certain plot devices/story moments are taken in a different (not always good) direction imo.

Definitely a 9/10 tho for sure"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,[deleted]
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Last of Us video games are already extremely well written stories with well written characters that hold up against any other medium. Most video game stories, even the games that are known for their great stories, are not really amazing compared to other mediums. Most video game stories aren't anything special once you remove the gameplay and player agency from the equation. This is why game adaptations don't work very often."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I thought Welcome to Raccoon City was alright. It was a stupid little Zombie flick, and I honestly don't expect much more from a RE adaptation.
Would I watch it a second time? Probs not. Did I have a good time looking for all the easter eggs? Definitely. (Now that I'm writing this I actually might rewatch it and turn the easter egg hunt into a drinking game lol)"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"To be fair, the last of us game gave the show a clear outline to follow when it comes to dialogue and story.  Resident Evil had the worst cutscene dialogue possible to adapt for tv or movies."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"People crap on that first movie, but they had to jettison ""authenticity"" to save the movie.

Romero's take was 100 times worse.

They made the protagonist a new character, because adapting Chris or Jill was not going to work back then.

Could it be done now? Maybe. But even the sequels screwed that up. Wentworth Miller tried so hard. :(

I remember at the time people complaining the UMBRELLA team were wearing STARS uniforms, but Umbrella would TOTALLY DO THAT.

The disappearing bodies were a fantastic joke about the original playstation's memory limitations.

Beyond that, any of the other stink was SONY. They've got more movie producers than talent."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,I love the Resident Evil Movies.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,[removed]
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"To be real most of the stories arent that great to translate into a movie. Something might be possible to make, but i feel if they did try again they do 7. Much smaller cast to have to write dialogue for, nothing super. And given the nature they have multiple types of villains and scares (you go from crazy hillbilly, insect queen, a hillbilly silence of the lamb, to psychological)."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,RE games don’t have good plots and need to be altered for adaptation. TLOU has a plot that could’ve won best picture and changing it would be risky.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Last of Us has much better source material, though. It was easier to adapt because it was already a cinematic experience. 

The more recent Resident Evils that are less action gameplay focused would be closer to The Last of Us in ease to adapt"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Something to keep in mind is that Neil Druckman himself is directing the last of us series, whereas most video games IP gets sold off to big studios who have no idea wtf they’re doing and don’t actually like/care about the source material that much. RE movies had little to no interest in being congruent with the games, same with that monster hunter movie that was a weird isekai about us marines or something.?? Not a video game but shinichiro watanabe wasn’t involved in the Netflix adaptation of cowboy bebop at all and he says he couldn’t make it through the first episode lol

Edit: the Witcher show is another obvious example"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"It’s HBO, they could make a show from Pong and it would be good.  Though it does help that Last of Us is story driven."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Resident Evil games are written as campy, B-movie schlock early on. It's not on the same level of writing, game direction, and tone as The Last of Us

So a RE adaptation just does not have a strong enough source material as a foundation that would elevate it to prestige tv writing"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The problem is TLOU has a phenomenal plot, dialogue and storyline. RE doesn't. RE is atmosphere, only."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,reisdent evil games are written like cheesy b-movies. the last of us was always written as a prestige hbo show. stop regurgitating this stupid bs.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Last of Us already had a great story and characters, it was just a matter of finding a studio willing to pay what it would cost to create the world and a creative team with the talent to bring it to life, everything else is right there in the game. Resident Evil, on the other hand is still more than anything just an action survival horror video game with archetype characters and a storyline that revolves around solving puzzles and reading notes. A creative team can recreate the look of the locations and characters but everything else falls on them in scripting."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,It makes me feel the opposite - now there’s a great model/template that other adaptations can follow if they want to be successful.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,I wish they would have put more effort into Welcome to Racoon city. It was a lot closer to the games but the cast was bland and it had that low budget feel to it.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Two vastly different franchises
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I think you could make a great rec movie but you'd have to lean into the b movie aspects of the games, I think physical effects, paired down action would make a great re game.
That said I feel like silent Hill fans have been disrespected even worse, silent Hill 2 could make a great somber/serious horror film, but the movie lens into action and if I render correctly completely bungled the lore"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I feel you, but RE is total Z-level horror shlock and proud of it. It's one of these games like the Mario ones, gameplay first, whatever plot late. Impossible to adapt, basically, whereas TLOU is the opposite"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I don't wanna break it to you but narratively the Resident evil games are fuckin batshit and TLOU works because it's grounded and therefor the real visuals and humans acting it out works. 

For Resident Evil? Idk, a few of the stories are solid but a lot of the franchise is both narratively fuckin awful and so out there and ridiculous that they could never do SEASONS based on any of the later games.

And to also equally talk shit about TLOU. 

That game is a mid tier videogame cut in half by a solid movie that plays between levels and during some sequences they both happen. 

Most of TLOU is just PURE narrative and nothing else."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I'm saying this as a fan of resident evil: these games from a story perspective are at their VERY best campy, shlocky, silly, stupid fun. An accurate Resident Evil adaptation would just about be a so-bad-its-good silly ass piece of crap, and in that regard the RE movies are JUST that, even if they're entirely inaccurate to the events of the games.

Now, I'm not saying you couldn't make a good RE movie- you could adapt Resident Evil 4 and just lean super hard into it being a campy spy movie (but with zombies). Cast Joel McHale as Leon and Nicholas Cage as Saddler, throw in some halfway decent action. I think you'd come out the other end with a watchable action movie. But trying to adapt the story of any of these games with even a modicum of seriousness is a highly misguided effort.

This is all in aid of saying: the story of The Last of Us has narrative weight, is told really well, and has enough depth that it could survive the change in medium while still allowing the shows creative team to express themselves. It's massive false equivalency to say that a Resident Evil TV show could have reached the heights of The Last of Us."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"To be fair, TLOU (game) was written to be a much tighter narrative with themes, hooks and dilemmas both physical and moral.  RE1 was a shot at horror with some unintentional camp that took off into a franchise.  Adaptation for RE always had a pretty large margin for error, but yeah, it seems every major attempt has failed catastrophically, at least creatively.  I'm still pretty upset that Paul W.S. Anderson hasn't been publicly flogged for what he's done.
  The point is, TLOU was pretty much already written like a movie, adapting it for a theater or TV series wouldn't be difficult at all.
RE wasn't built like that, or even around the story at all, so pinning down what makes it amazing outside of the gameplay is kind of a losing proposition.  I still want a 1 to 1 screenplay for RE, just to see what that would look like."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Comparing any resident evil storyline to TLOU is a BIG stretch
Hitlers Circle of Evil,RE source material is nothing even close to TLoU
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Far too often creatives feel like they NEED to put their own spin on something. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn’t."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,When are people gonna understand its always been about the network. HBO respects source material and its showrunners WAY more than most.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The problem is Last.of US was already acclaimed for a great story. Well told and already well shot as a game. It becomes easy to adapt when the game itself is story proto story board.

RE, never had a great story. Nothing extraordinary. And if you take a game IP and it already has a weak story then either you'll fail to create a new story worthy of the IP or make a half baked version of the same story and stretch it to movie time."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"...The characters and plot from Resident Evil games are ridiculous, though.

Also, TLOU show DOESN'T follow the source material fully. But the stuff they changed works well."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Resident Evil was and will always be a money machine.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,it seems like Constantin Films has like a perpetual hold on that IP.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Good stories make good series, if well executed.  

The primary reason that TLOU is engaging is that there was always a good story, and that the story is well-executed.  

I don’t think its success says anything about video game adaptation, other than proving something we should have already known- video games can be adapted into good series if there was always a good story in the game, and if the series is well-executed.  

My fear is that the takeaway will not be the simple truth above and instead will be “video games are ready for adaptation!” And we will be getting heavy promotion for poor adaptations of popular video games coming soon to Netflix and Amazon prime.

“Zac Efron stars as Toad in Mario Party: the series!”"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Isn't it because not all show producers actually like the source material?
Hitlers Circle of Evil,They butchered the resident evil movies :(
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Garbage in, garbage out."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Amen
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I don't see why it's so difficult to make a faithful adaptation of the first game. It's almost like playing a movie, anyways."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Ehh, have you seen the game's story? It's all corny, too. It was always destined to be a bad movie because it's about immersion and action, not good plot or believable characters."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"As a HUGE RE fan, it makes more sense to me that they fucked it up over and over again. TLOU has a compelling and dramatic story. RE has at its core a short mystery to solve and.... stuff to kill. So Hollywood turns it into an action poop-sock every chance they get bc theres no substance there. 

Now, could they make a suspenseful horror thriller of RE? Probably. But. Fuck."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Idk, I feel like LoU was already a good story. That was basically half the work done. Then you gotta get good producers, casting, and sets and you’re golden. LoU is basically a cinematic for the show, like the ones for Marvel movies. I mean, take the game away and the story is fine."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Meh, RE and TLOU are a different genre. TLOU is way more narrative based than RE that relies on a different narrative, based on the environment and atmosphere."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,TLOU is an example for all other video game adaptations to follow
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I always thought resident evil would work as a television show, if they did it mini series style. Resident evil zero is one mini series, then the next, and so on. It could be action packed and not need a ton of subplot."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Video games will be the next comic books. Resident Evil will be rebooted and done right don’t you fret. Hollywood is desperate for known source material.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The last of us makes all other video game adaptation look like they were made by people unaware that they existed as good stories in a different mediums. 

I also think its really disrespectful to all the storytellers in video games and the gamers who love them to change the source material so much that what made it cool to begin with, completly gets lost. 

Halo was imo, the most disgraceful thing to happen to video game adaptations since the super mario brothers movie and microtransactions.  

Hopefully going foward, the last of us can teach filmmakers that the apeal of video game storys translates to gamers and non gamers alike because a good story is a good story regardless of medium.  I hope its not just wishful thinking on my part."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I don't see why everyone is so amazed that the last of us is being adapted so well. TLOU is a story first and a game built around that. Adapting older games/franchises is a lot harder than ""just follow the source material"" when most of the source material is gameplay. How do you adapt a game where the majority is running around a house solving puzzles and shooting zombies. There is barely a story in the first 3 RE games that would make for an interesting film."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Resident evil wasn't an adaption, it was a dumb show with the name resident evil slapped on"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Its because idiots who dont play the games write and make them...

Still puzzles me when writers say they dont like the source material they are adapting.  I think this happened on netflixs witcher and Henry had to argue with the writers over their versions of the story...

What the fuck are those people doing in those positions?"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,[deleted]
Hitlers Circle of Evil,It’s because Netflix is a shit stain company that shouldn’t be given adaptions
Hitlers Circle of Evil,The resident evil games are cheesy and the plot is dumb. The movies stay true to that
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I wish Resident Evil fans (of which I am a massive one) will soon realize the strengths of RE as a franchise is in it's interactivity. 

The characters and plots are paper thin and redundant, because they're all riffs on pop-culture.

No, a spooky mansion with two heroic super-cop characters unraveling a corporate conspiracy with zombies and mutants doesn't exactly have a lot of depth outside of actually playing it, where it's one of the best survival horror games ever made. 

A faithful movie would just be a pale imitation of the media that inspired it, and the general population would know it, sure maybe hardcore fans would enjoy it, but I don't think most people would be very jazzed about a generic slow burn haunted house with zombies flick, the market is already completely oversaturated with lame entries.

As for characters in the series...lets see....Jill Valentine, super swat cop, no real character traits to speak of other than ""hot"". Chris Redfield, super swat cop....yeahh...kind of drawing another blank here. Barry Burton, another swat cop....defining character trait? He uhh...likes guns? Albert Wesker, cartoonish comic book villain who moonlights as a super swat cop. I love these characters, us fans love these characters, but they are as thin as they come.

Last of us didn't require extensive retooling, Joel, Ellie, Tess, Marlene, every character in the game really have strong writing, strong motives, strong character traits, strong personalities and situations they go through that already presented itself well for cinematic dramatization.

For RE to work as a movie you're undoubtedly going to piss of fans, maybe Chris is a recovering alcoholic, maybe Jill has PTSD from some unseen STARS raid that she has to overcome throughout the story, they would HAVE to inject some clearly out of character drama because there is absolutely nothing to their characters, the only way for it to work is to turn it into something that it's not, which is what has happened for 7 terrible films and a terrible netflix series. Or you can be faithful to the paper thin characters and watch 3 terrible CG films and a terrible cg netflix show, it's almost as if Resident Evil removed from it's game context has absolutely nothing worth portraying in other media."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Last of Us is probably the perfect candidate for adaptation to tv. It’s basically a playable movie already with an excellent story. Also they got the perfect people involved with Druckmann from Naughty Dog so it stays in touch with the games, and Mazin who is a brilliant screenwriter and knows how to create a post apocalyptic atmosphere.

Basically they used the right game and got the right people."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,The Welcome to Racoon City movie was really good. Characters and situations from the games. Better than all the Jojovich movies and the Netflix series combined. I hope they make more movies since they ended with a mid credit cliff hanger.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"TLOU actually kind of makes me angry lol. Because it shows how absolutely simple in concept approaching an adaptation is - *just respect the damn source material*. 

The MCU has been showing us this for *15 years,* and we're still getting garbage like Resident Evil.

So much potential down the drain over the years."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Yeah

Maybe Netflix witty hire real writers next time snd try"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Every video game adaptation, the writer and director don't want to recreate the game.  That's why they all fail."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Just about every other live, video game adaptation should be absolutely embarrassed by what TLOU is doing. 

If Paramount had any sense at all, they'd take the Halo series' entire preproduction and writing crew, shoot them into the sun, and reboot that POS."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"""Have been straight up abused""...

First World abuse, they didn't make my tv program the same as the game."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Resident Evil, Halo, Wheel of Time, Witcher, the one thing all these shit shows have in common is idiot writers who thought they could do better than the source material they were hired for. Hopefully Hollywood looks at the success of Last of Us and House of the Dragon and finally takes a hint"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,You’ve basically retracted from your whole post in this comment lol
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I will just say this. “The Last of Us” has had over 20yrs of being able to look at Resident Evil and all the other adaptations/etc and evolve, which is something I would expect all shows or movies to do compared to others made decades ago. They’ve still been making Resident Evil movies over the years but they were already in that identity so it is what it is. Raccoon City was decent but it’s only the one ya know. This is like saying the NBA today makes me sad about how NBA was back in the 60s or something. If we’re comparing these athletes to those athletes…today will always look way better. These showrunners are looking at horror related things, looking at Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, all these shows that have been fairly big too."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"And Halo is off to a great start for that ""abusing""  lawl. What makes it worse is the time from the simple idea of ""what would a live action adaptation look like?"" We got....this.  Somehow season 2 was greenlit, but I expect nothing less from the studio that allowed the abomination and absolutely unneeded series, Star Trek Picard.

I honestly keep forgetting Resident Evil got a TV ""adaptation.""  My head is still remembering the moviecircle jerks. We had WAY too many, people!"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"This is the quality difference between HBO and Netflix.

There was a time when Netflix originals were on par with HBO's originals, but not anymore. They're mostly just trash now."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Sonic the hedgehog was surprisingly good too
Hitlers Circle of Evil,I am sad about how utterly the potential of Witcher book adaptation was destroyed so I feel your pain
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Resident Evil storyline isn’t exactly breaking new ground. It’s not the strongest thing the franchise has going for it. The Last of Us on the other hand, has a critically acclaimed story that seemed, 10 years ago, to be ripped out of an HBO show only to later become that very thing."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"What do you mean, did you not like the inclusion and diversity in the shitty series? I mean that's what makes a series great right?"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"People highly overrated the RE games, especially the original game which was objectively terrible in almost every way. The movies are garbage but it's not like the source material is some sort of masterpiece"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"as it is with books. it really is not difficult to create a successful show if you stay close to the source material.

harry potter did it, game of thrones did it before they chose their own way. and with computer games it is just like that. people have fond memories of these source materials. then fucking respect that source material! look at the witcher, look at wheels of time, look at the lord of the rings tv series. all fucking trash. now look at sonic the hedgehog another succes. why because they respect the source material!

 that is why i can not comprehend how you can fuck it up so badly every time. stay close to the source material. easy peasy!"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Or Witcher, or Rings of Power. Such a cool stories completely butchered by woke show runners"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I think I’m the only one who preferred Resident Evil. 

It was camp, it was over the top, it was ridiculous- but it was different and it was fun. 

To me, TLOU feels like a less impressive version of what I’ve already seen in the game. The show feels like what we’ve already seen a million times in The Walking Dead."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Mila jovovich and her husband seem to have the rights and butcher it everytime.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Resident Evil IP is not TLoU IP. It can return in many different forms and made by someone else than netflix.

For me the first movie is the best... the focus is on zombies and horror, it's got great atmosphere, cool action scenes (not over the top like in later films) and awesome soundtrack."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I mean, the story of the Last of Us game already was amazing, the stories of Resident Evil games are.... there. Sometimes really bad. They need to work on an original story based on the games for Resi to work, but they should absolutely copy the style of the games. Last of Us LOOKS like the game, no Resi movie ever did."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,And Halo and Uncharted
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Resident Ecil went out all guns blazing on the woke angle and from there, we knew it was doomed. Just leave out identity politics at least for some shows for God's sake."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,It’s not because of the last of us. It was just handled poorly. Period. And that is enough to make you sad!
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Resident Evil had a story?
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Just play the game then, bud."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,Dude. You're 13 and probably never played RE1. You're attacking windmills here.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"The Last of Us is already a movie, just with more interaction. The God of War adaptation will be the same. Where adaptations struggle is having to write dialog and characters and coherent plots from scratch within a world that already exists. That's considerably different though I doubt Paul Anderson even tried.

The show is good but let's not pretend that they had to do much more than reenact the game shot for shot and abbreviate some parts. Sony loves these very cinematic, epic games and they are criminally easy to adapt compared to say Sonic the Hedgehog or Prince of Persia"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"To be fair, resident evil don’t have anything to tell. They have B horror movies plot with great gameplay."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"For The Last Of Us, hopefully they won’t follow the source material for season 2 🙁"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I just don’t want last of us 2… I hope they beer off their own way after saving Ellie. Seriously, part 2 is disappointing trash"
Hitlers Circle of Evil,The only thing about RE I liked was seeing glimpses of Cape Town.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"Tbf, TLOU has much better characters and stories to adapt than resident evil.






We can leave resi as games, their stories aren't good enough to be actually good films or shows, unless they're were to be very loose adaptions."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"A well written game gets a good adaptation. I LOOOVE the RE games, but the writing is always a mess."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"I’d be interested in seeing the RE7/RE8 storyline with the Winters translated to tv. 

It’s fairly easy to isolate it from the rest of the lore, and if it works out you could pick up more from there."
Hitlers Circle of Evil,* cries in Witcher *
Hitlers Circle of Evil,I like some the RE titles.   At their best they are nothing but mindless entertainment but not just anyone can make films like these.   If TLOU has more depth then good for HBO but the RE films have a place in many bluray collections.
Hitlers Circle of Evil,The first RE was really good
Hitlers Circle of Evil,"In 2-3 years HBO will be looking for the next video game to bring to the screen, so maybe then?"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,So a series which keeps Sean Bean alive? 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,I believe this is already on season 2 in the UK.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Can we please ban every use of ""chronicles"" and ""diaries"" in titles? It always sounds like a lazy attempt at classing up the joint."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Oh hey, I loved the first season of this show. Completely forgot about it. Sweet."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,For some reason the promotional pic reminds me of Walter White. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Sean Bean isn't dying in this scene.

\*ding*"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"So did they just purchase the rights to air the two seasons that have already aired? Or will they be involved in making more seasons going forward? Making it a ""Netflix Original"". "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I may have something wrong with me but this has me sold:

""Season 1 of the serialized show sees him investigating the case of a corpse made up of body parts from different children, and finding the matter involves senior establishment figures and demonic forces.""

Sounds like it is not just a Sean Bean vehicle like that Legends thing was.  

Can't wait.  "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,It's the only one episode series in history.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Seen bean

Sean bon"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Let me guess, he dies?"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Netflix seriously needs to chill. THis show is not good.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Kill him the first episode to get it out of the way, and then he plays one of the Monster's parts. Preferably the head. Though he does have nice hands."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Dame judging by the image he is Doctor Frankenstein?  And not the monster?  I would have loved to have seen him play the monster.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,">  Inspector John Marlott investigates a series of crimes in 19th Century London, which may have been committed by a scientist intent on re-animating the dead. 

Hmm, I will check this out."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Nice.  He is one of my favorite actors.  
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Sweet.  Looking forward to it.  Sean Bean is great in pretty much anything he's been in.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,its out!
The Frankenstein Chronicles,UK shows are the best....do we know when this will air on Netflix?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,He dies every episode in different ways and is brought back.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,lets not jump to conclusions
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"No, he will die in the end and become the monster of Frankenstein. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,He ded.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"HE’S ALIVE HE’S ALIIIIIIVE

-me after episode one"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,More or less. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,LOL. Only till the end of the first season.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Season 2 just ended here in the UK.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Seems like it. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,And Sean Bean is still alive? :O Must be a record. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I would've, too, if not for my mum buying The Daily Mail one week and me reading their fantastic TV magazine, whereupon I saw an interview with Sean talking about season 2 that ended with the start date.

I've recorded all six episodes of it, not had chance to see any yet, but I liked the first season. Even if it got a bit silly at the end."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"They just purchased the rights, making it a ""Netflix Original"". "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,yes and no
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Imma let you finish but IMDB says 7.6

Going to at least give it a watch but what didn't impress you?"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"[spoiler alert](#s ""He's killed in season one, episode five, but resurrected by the people he was investigating and escapes in the season one finale back into London"")"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"He's neither.

>Bean (“Game of Thrones”) plays John Marlott, a war veteran and river policeman. Season 1 of the serialized show sees him investigating the case of a corpse made up of body parts from different children, and finding the matter involves senior establishment figures and demonic forces."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,They stitch together all the dead Sean Bean characters from the other shows/movies.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"You killed Sean, you Bastard! "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Haha. CBS could make a cop show with that procedural device. Sean Bean dies every week. Lol
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Wasnt there a show with the fantastic four guy with that premise?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Edge of Tomorrow the TV series!

The Frankenstein Chronicles,Is it a good show?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Well, it is time to sail the seven seas until Netflix chooses to release their bilge in this here port and they can TAKE MY MONEY as they damn well should!  Until then, Arrr!

Has it got a subreddit?  Keen on reviews.  "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"> Imma let you finish but IMDB says 7.6

IMDB scores are talleys of those that care about a show. So the score is completely unreliable.

The Frankenstein Chronicles,That's fucking awesome
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"""One does not simply winter for England, James"""
The Frankenstein Chronicles,I’d watch that. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Forever.  He was, in a way, Immortal.  And yeah he played Mr Fantastic.  Also was in San Andreas as the asshole step father.


Good show...only lasted 1 season tho."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,yes but its not a typical frankenstein story
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"From my own experience, IMDB ratings have often been quite reliable, at least reliable enough. Some shows rated 6 or under you would think we're terrible though, but some are just slightly flawed with other reddening qualities. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"It's pretty reliable because it's not only the people who really liked it coming to leave a glowing review, it's also the people who absolutely hated it coming to leave an unfairly biased negative review. Theoretically it should even out to a more natural score. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Then pulls out a sword, as Richard Sharpe?"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Is it the actual story of frankenstein?

Where victor is a screw up of his own obsession. Driving himself to create life, and to his own death?"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,And goes off to hunt (national) treasure that turns out to be Zeus's lightning bolt?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"no sean bean is an policeman he finds a body made of lots of differnet people and starts searching for the killer, there is no monster"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Not exactly. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"It's legitimately good despite a name that sounds like a CW show, but it's really marred by endless dream sequences and unreliable narrator horseshit. The second season is even worse in that regard, where they drop the syphilis pretense and just make him crazy."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Is it bad that I went in hoping for a Frankenstein monster show? Lol :( 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I've been enjoying it too. I liked the premise of the first season more than the second one, though. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I thought season 1 was good but I think I actually like season 2 more, just because it's so different."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Does it resolve the story in the first series or is it another endless plot netflix show?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,>!Being reanimated cured his syphilis. Hervey pointed that out to him when he woke up.!<
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Crazy for good reason. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"It did take a bit to get into series 2 for that reason, and also becasue the story picks back up in such a random places. But after two spisodes I got the vibe of what they were going for, and got totally into it. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Are there no supernatural elements? I'm only an episode or two in, I was sort of hoping for something like Penny Dreadful, although it's obvious that it's different. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Neither. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Made by BBC originally
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Without spoiling too much, it does gives you some satisfaction at the end of series 1, but its not going to answer every question. You'll have the feeling that you have a decent understanding of what happened at the end of the first series. And then you start series 2 . . . "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I just finished it. I thought season 1 was good, season 2 was terrible."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,There are. Just wait for the final episode.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Yeah I'm only 2 episodes in but I'm just gathering from this review that it's more just a murder mystery with a killer who's inspired by Frankenstein. I could be wrong tho
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Made by ITV actually. (BBC's rival.)
The Frankenstein Chronicles,The whole of series 2 is much more supernatural than the first. It's like it hops genre between first and second season.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I learned that the show was in development purgatory for a few years. Series 2 feels like instead of deciding to pick up exaclty where the first one left off, they decided to instead just pick up where the story would've gone if it had been allowed to run regularly, and just fill in the missing gaps for the audience little by little. I think it was always meant to get a little sci-fi like it did. Even then, I don't actually find it out of place. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"This thread is going to be full of wholly original ""Sean Bean dies"" content. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"A&E acquires distribution rights to an externally produced mature scripted drama (Frankenstein). After cancelling a popular mature scripted drama due to it being an external production (Longmire). Yeah, that makes sense!

Edit: Words are hard. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Sean Bean is one of the few actors whom I'll always give their shows or movies a shot. Extremely talented actor.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,I'm guessing that Legends won't have a 3rd season then?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,[deleted]
The Frankenstein Chronicles,So how long until Sean Bean's character abruptly dies?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Yet this is the top comment in the thread, and yours is the only comment about it! Sucks that you sorta ""spoiled"" it for me when I was just looking for a review."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"One of these days someone is going to misspell or autocorrect that to ""Seam Bean diets"" sparking a wave of memes.  Pictures photoshopped of him eating yogurt or fruit, people losing weight via Sean Bean deaths, him just staring longingly at deserts.  Then that's going to morph into obese photoshops of him, which will in turn inspire obese celebrity memes."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Netflix picked up Longmire, so I think they made out better than being stuck in a summer timeslot on a cable channel. This way people can watch all the seasons too. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,They're not allowed to try new shows because they cancelled one you like?
The Frankenstein Chronicles,That's why I saw Jupiter Ascending...That and I knew it'd be pretty. The movie was so boring though.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,not if Sean dies quick
The Frankenstein Chronicles,He's made it a whole season in Legends so far.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Every episode. He is Frankensteined back to life after being killed each episode.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Totally agree with you there. Was still a daft move on A&E's part though, imo."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I just started watching Longmire after hearing that Netflix picked it up, and seeing that one article that called it, [""The best crime show you're not watching.""](http://www.filmdispenser.com/longmire-the-best-crime-show-youre-not-watching/)


I'm near the end of season one, and so far, it hasn't lived up to that hype. If I had to describe, I'd call it a blend of Justified (good) meets Walker, Texas Ranger (not so good).

I'm really only sticking with it because my dad likes it, and it gives us an opportunity to spend time together. And I'm hoping it will get better once it gets into the Netflix-produced season.
"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,Yeah you see this a lot where companies want to substitute their own programming rather than paying a production house for episodes. It usually doesn't work out that well though. I think the only people that can pull it off in a half decent fashion is ABC because of all the content Disney owns. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Yeah I do see the Walker Texas Ranger parts in it. The show is pretty procedural though even in the later seasons it does end up being a one and done show type with a few bits of storyline in there. 

I like watching it for the scenery, though I don't understand why they just don't film in Wyoming instead of two states lower in New Mexico. You can tell from the architecture that it is NM not WY. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Not a bog, no.

This was set on esturine mud flats - in this case an area covered by bladderwrack - which is what was supporting the guy originally, until he hit a patch of more open silt still suffused with water, and not capable of supporting him.

I've certainly seen people go straight up to their waist in similar situations, and been unable to extract themselves without help - it is a thing that the coastguard get called out for from time to time. I imagine that you could go straight under in loose enough conditions, but it would need to be a LOT of seaweed to be able to support you on the surface in the first place - and it doesn't ususally grow in those kind of amounts without something more solid to grow on, so it would have to be a load of it that had drifted down from somewhere else."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"I hunt geese in a swamp. Sometimes the swamp hides channels or sinkholes. Where I hunt there are easily channels deep enough that if you fell the wrong way you could slip, get stuck, knock yourself out and drown. "
The Frankenstein Chronicles,This makes our tornadoes in Texas seem friendly. 
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"If you haven't, check out The Last Kingdom.  Based on Bernard Cornwell books. Two seasons in and can't wait for s3 this year.  It lead me to his books.  I think I am up to about the 35th book of his.  Great historical fiction reads.  First read the Saxon tales that the last kingdom is based on, then Sharpe series (Napolenic period) and working my way through his smaller series.  If you want a laugh, try The Norsemen.  Good fun and has a female character that makes Lagertha look like a timid handmaiden.

EDIT: and also can highly recommend Boardwalk Empire and Peaky Blinders."
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"**The Terror** is coming out Monday on AMC. I’m super hyped about it, they’re already saying great things about it"
The Frankenstein Chronicles,The Alienist is top-notch so far. And The Terror looks great.
The Frankenstein Chronicles,"Not particularly medieval, just all period dramas I can think of getting new seasons: Jamestown, The Last Kingdom, Versailles, Outlander, Medici: Masters of Florence "
ONE PIECE,How are they going to do the 3 sword technique.
ONE PIECE,My expectations are LOW but I am wishing it the best
ONE PIECE,"i don’t want to instantly be a doomer about it but if they fucked up Cowboy Bebop, how is there any hope for them to get something more complex (in designs and world) like One Piece right?"
ONE PIECE,"I assume this is going to be the big Netflix series releasing this summer. Every year they seem to have one. If this wasn’t releasing until the end of the year Netflix wouldn’t be promoting it now. We will probably get a teaser trailer soon.

Hope it’s good. But I’m setting my expectations extremely low."
ONE PIECE,"*Netflix logo disappears*

Here it is, the moment of truth!

…

#”YA YO YAAAAA YOOOOOO…”"
ONE PIECE,How many chapters is One Piece up to now? And how many chapters do we realistically expect the show to cover? Or is this some sort of alt-world/complimentary side story filler kind of show?
ONE PIECE,"I can tell this is gonna be goofy, but I'll still watch it"
ONE PIECE,"Didn't expect it to premier in 2023. If you've been paying attention to the cast, staff and crew, these guys look like they are going to give it a good faith effort that respects the original series.

I'll be watching as I am a big fan of the One Piece manga and anime, hopefully it isn't a train wreck. I want to be more optimistic but One Piece seems like a very difficult adaptation to pull off."
ONE PIECE,"Looking forward to the inevitable cancellation

Edit: netflix joke fyi hope this show itself is good"
ONE PIECE,"Of all the anime to do live action versions of, this one seems REALLY stupid. I'm not like ""oh all live action versions of anime are stupid"" but this one just feels like a stupid idea. Like you know how they changed Ms. Marvel's powers for the show because they figured her comic book powers would look really goofy in live action? That. 

I'm not gonna wish this show fails, it just seems like out of everything this was a baffling choice for a live action show."
ONE PIECE,"There are so many things about One Piece that make it nearly impossible to translate to live action so expect failure but on the other hand, if they can make this work the majority of anime would actually seem realistically adaptable now."
ONE PIECE,"Oda seemed enthusiastic about it, but lol, I've yet to see a Western made anime adaptation that isn't complete shit"
ONE PIECE,"The cast is perfect and they are all really passionate about the source material.

So at the very least it will have that"
ONE PIECE,[https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/10fu3sc/taz_skylar_sanji_compilation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/10fu3sc/taz_skylar_sanji_compilation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for the uninitiated
ONE PIECE,I don't know how the announcement for this flew under my radar but the sets they built look cool as shit. I am CAUTIOUSLY optimistic about this.
ONE PIECE,"I love One Piece but I am fascinated by how this will be. One Piece is absolutely closer to a Looney Tunes cartoon than other anime or manga. Adapt it as a 1:1, you'll probably fail, as it would be so incredibly hard to pull off and have it look 'normal', even just One Piece or television 'normal'. 

Adapt it to fit its new medium however and you can retain the One Piece story, but without the comedy, the wackiness, the goofiness,...are you still making One Piece?

So yeah, I'm really intrigued by what choice they'll make for this."
ONE PIECE,Looks very good and accurate! Hope it gets the Last of Us treatment. One Piece deserves it
ONE PIECE,Can’t wait to see franky and brooks irl
ONE PIECE,Canceled after One Piec....I mean Season!
ONE PIECE,"I want this to be good bc I love One Piece but I just do not see any way this can be adapted into a live action series/movie successfully. Even less-so than bebop. Too much of the narrative is maintained with the goofy/outlandish shit that cannot be recreated with cgi. Jokes won’t land the same, battle sequences will be an awkward Michael bay interpretation and not much of the charm will remain…here’s to hoping but I’m not expecting much at all. 

Honestly think it would be better to make a new IP inspired by or based on One Piece and do their own thing with it"
ONE PIECE,Prediction: gets cancelled after half month.
ONE PIECE,"This seems like a wasted exercise.

They will never be able to tell even a fraction of the One Piece story. It's on brand for Netflix to tell half a story then cancel..."
ONE PIECE,"I have zero expectations, but I'll give it a look when it does.

Trailer should remove any doubts of how good or bad it might be."
ONE PIECE,I’m looking forward to this but it will be a little sad watching a One Piece show that doesn’t have “We Are” or “Overtaken” (the “dun dun dun sound” cue from the anime)
ONE PIECE,That sure is a pretty poster.
ONE PIECE,"So many things about this series will be incredibly easy to make look super dumb in live action. What's luffy's stretchy body/face gonna look like? Could be super dumb. What's it gonna be like when zorro has a sword in his mouth and is trying to talk at people? Are they going to dub in his voice? If so, that'd be hilarious, and also super dumb. What's Usopp's nose gonna look like? Could be SUPER dumb. Sanji's asymmetrically curled eyebrows? That looks dumb even in the manga. What are the fishmen gonna look like? Probably super dumb. Buggy's gonna look dumb, but that's one I can actually see working cause he's a straight up clown.   
Mind you I'm still gonna watch this shit when it comes out."
ONE PIECE,"I don't understand why they even try. This is like a guaranteed flop, is it not? And no way they're adapting the entire manga, either."
ONE PIECE,Cowboy Bebop vibes all over again.
ONE PIECE,Talk about setting yourself up to fail lol
ONE PIECE,"I'm cautiously very optimistic about this. 

One Piece in theory should be very difficult to adapt, but everything about this screams it's gonna be the first good live action anime. The creative team really loves and understands the source material, and Oda being involved gives a lot of hope. 

Calling the shot now, this is going to be good and break the anime adaptation curse."
ONE PIECE,This is going to be trash just like every other Netflix live action. Adaption.
ONE PIECE,"I expect this to go about the same as Cowboy Bebop. Well intentioned, but ultimately failing to understand what made the original work so well, then cancelled after 3-4 weeks of release."
ONE PIECE,Please stop
ONE PIECE,Might as well go ahead and announce its cancelation in 2023 too.
ONE PIECE,Netflix I'm on my knees begging. There's still time to delete this before releasing it to the world.
ONE PIECE,"I can see this being in the top 10 for a couple weeks (4-5) and Netflix will still cancel it because it did not do ""Wednesday"" numbers."
ONE PIECE,">Oh we havent learned a thing.

Netlfix."
ONE PIECE,"After Cowboy Bepop and a viewer who only got up to the Arc after Chopper first joined the crew (pre-time skip). I'm going to avoid this series at all costs. No matter how good or not, I'm placing my bets on a Chopper tease near the final episode of Season 1."
ONE PIECE,Open-mouth Going Merry kinda freaky ngl.  Cautiously optimistic tho—even though i probably don’t have a right to be
ONE PIECE,This is gonna suck so much ass
ONE PIECE,It looks exactly as awful as I was anticipating.
ONE PIECE,"And it's Cancelled.  Seriously Netflix need to stop doing this. Or start calling shows Limited Series.

All the best though I don't mind the One Piece manga."
ONE PIECE,Oh God they are going to ruin it.
ONE PIECE,"I’m kinda glad the hype level for this is so low. After death note, cowboy bebop and ghost in the shell turned into disasters we all know this is gonna be trash. The show runner comparing Luffy to Kamala Harris a few months ago proves that they have absolutely no understanding of the source material, which is always fun. The cast looks ok, but deep down we all know live action one piece is a shit idea."
ONE PIECE,No!
ONE PIECE,I always thought some anime would make good movie adaptions but Netflix has killed that hope in me.   They need to just stop.
ONE PIECE,"Cancelled on first season. This is gonna be another Cowboy Bebop. I am of course more than happy to be wrong.

There are sooo few decent live action anime. This ain't gonna be it."
ONE PIECE,"There is zero possibilities that this is good, some things just don't translate well into live action. One Piece works in anime because it's absolutely ridiculous. the humor and designs work there. Even if they nail everything and every character it's just gonna be cringe."
ONE PIECE,"""Oda will serve as an executive producer.""
   
Uh huh"
ONE PIECE,GOTTA GO
ONE PIECE,"Keeping my expectations low but if they can capture any semblance of the comedy and the peak intensity of the manga, then I will be happy. Obviously live actions of anime never work out but the creator of One Piece himself, Oda, has been heavily involved with this and has given it his blessing so I have hope."
ONE PIECE,Just stop with these live action anime ffs. None are even remotely close to the real thing
ONE PIECE,Another one on the chopping block.
ONE PIECE,Canceled by July?
ONE PIECE,"They never learn, do they?"
ONE PIECE,Cowboy Bebop didnt teach you?
ONE PIECE,"Yeah, it’ll be shit. But I wonder if by the end of the year we’ll be past the era of us being called racist, sexist, etc. for having negative opinions: That’s pretty much been baked into the promotional section pre-release for the past year."
ONE PIECE,"Ah wonderful, another anime Netflix can cross off its shitty attempt at making a good live action adaptation. This shall go horribly."
ONE PIECE,After cowboy bebop? I'm just assuming this is some writers shiity script that couldn't get adapted into an original pirate show so they're going slap one piece on it and it's going to fucking suck. We all know it is
ONE PIECE,Um….they never gonna learn apparently
ONE PIECE,This is going to be even worse than the Cowboy bebop live action remake. At least that one had humans as characters. They gonna have Chopper be crappy CGI?
ONE PIECE,I hear it’s already been cancelled.
ONE PIECE,"RIP. 

Add it to the list of poorly adapted, made by people who don't care about the source material, cancelled quickly series on Netflix."
ONE PIECE,NO
ONE PIECE,They aren't willing to spend the time or money to properly adapt One Piece. This will likely be terrible and be like Cowboy Bebop which the original Author couldn't bare to watch the show cuz it was such a train wreck of his IP.
ONE PIECE,The actors would die of old age before they even catch up to the anime. Let alone the manga.
ONE PIECE,I don't see this doing well. One piece doesn't translate well to live-action. I don't care if Oda is involved. The entire manga is too cartoonish and bizarre to work without substantially changing it for live-action.
ONE PIECE,This is gonna be so bad hahaha
ONE PIECE,I saw the live version of Death Note on 2023. And boy you would think they would had learn their lesson after that one.
ONE PIECE,I sure hope nami constantly talks about sex......
ONE PIECE,In no reality does this work.
ONE PIECE,This always turns out well
ONE PIECE,Another disaster incoming. 🤦‍♂️
ONE PIECE,This will be terrible
ONE PIECE,"they haven’t learned anything, have they?"
ONE PIECE,"Let me guess, Netflix hired people that don't care about the source material and they'll be all surprised when everything goes to shit"
ONE PIECE,"If Cowboy Bebop is any indicator, I’m 100% convinced that this could be the end of civilization."
ONE PIECE,When will they learn
ONE PIECE,Oh no
ONE PIECE,Why has no one mentioned the absolute dumpster fire that is Bleach? Netflix needs to be stopped.
ONE PIECE,o god....my expectations couldnt be lower for this.  Death Note was atrocious
ONE PIECE,No! Stop trying to make fetch happen. Nobody wants live action adaptations of popular anime. Just stop already.
ONE PIECE,"Don’t worry, it’ll suck"
ONE PIECE,Why!!?!?!!???
ONE PIECE,oh god
ONE PIECE,Aaand it’s cancelled
ONE PIECE,I have to ask if all the top commenters in this thread are suffering from a gas leak. You’re excited for this shit given Netflix’s track record? The fucks wrong with you
ONE PIECE,"This is going to be shit, worse than Cowboy Bebop because there is no way in hell they can pull off the wacky things in one piece.  Instead they will be another made up garbage by talentless hack writers that turn characters into mockeries of what they actually are."
ONE PIECE,Crew looks like those fake Straw Hats from Return to Sabaody Arc.
ONE PIECE,"I'm probably in the minority but...the world doesn't need live action adaptations of things. cartoons can be cartoons and video games can be video games...at least with video games you can make the argument that a show or movie is more accessible. but there's no point in turning a show into another show.

The shit is going to be 90% CGI anyway, so it's still gonna be a cartoon, just worse.

Book/comic to show/movie, sure. But show to show is stupid.

That'd be like looking at a comic book and adapting it to a children's book format. just read the comic book."
ONE PIECE,Please god no...
ONE PIECE,As someone who couldn’t make it through the one piece manga (called it quits an arc or two after the 3 year time skip) I’m cautiously optimistic. I hope they can capture the feel of the beginning of the journey.
ONE PIECE,"I just want to know who's out there going ""man, I wish we had live adaptations of cartoons"". I've never heard anyone, not one person demand a live version. It's not even an anime problem. Look at Disney's live action adaptations. They're all flops too.

#let cartoons be cartoons"
ONE PIECE,"I'd be concerned either way, but I'm especially concerned after seeing the lead in the Imperfects."
ONE PIECE,[deleted]
ONE PIECE,"ive seen a shit ton of anime in my lifetime but one piece is just one of those that ill most likely never end up watching. i simply cant stand the old fashioned kinds of anime that go on for a billion episodes with like 10 episodes of filler at a time and one battle being stretched out for five episodes. i watched tried watching naruto again and even being driven off of childhood nostalgia i couldn’t get further than the beginning of shippuden. 

all that to say im really curious about this show."
ONE PIECE,It's not HBO so I can't be too excited.  Of course I'm hopeful but I have to expect the worst.
ONE PIECE,I asked for this?
ONE PIECE,Eww.
ONE PIECE,"How much cgi budget wasted on stretchy arms? 

How sore will zoro’s mouth be from all that sword biting

Who will be cast as tiny reindeer and slash skeleton??"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Wonder why all episodes of this series was released at once, maybe it underperformed weekly."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I liked it better as a weekly show. How an it be topical if it's all released at once?
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I thought it'd lose something by not being filmed the week of, but I couldn't tell. Turns out people acting ridiculous on reality TV is fairly evergreen content. 

Whether weekly or in chunks, I hope they get to come back for more. "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Haven't gotten into it yet. Just wanted to voice my support for more shows like this. Bump up the writing, get rid of Paul Feig, and let Joel be the sassy wonder he is! "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Does Paul Feig really need to be on camera?
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,The Boston travel ad was hilarious as was the Alabama spelling bee. Shame it all went by so quick. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Joe Manganiello looked high as fuck in his episode.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I don’t have the self restraint to watch them separately. I did enjoy them though. It does lend itself to something you can put on and do the dishes rather than full attention.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I actually like it better as a weekly show, for some reason. I binge most shows on Netflix but I liked having a light comedy show I could look forward to once a week. Sure, I *could* spread them out even if they're all there but we all know I'm not going to if they're all there."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I just gotta say that whoever does the subtitles for this show is terrible at their job. Constant errors, misspellings, and completely wrong words on every single episode. I love the show but am hard of hearing and I have to keep rewinding every few minutes until I understand what they actually said as the subtitles make no sense"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I just need so much more of this show in my life. It is so cheap and dumb but I can't stop
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,So who do I need to speak to about getting another season? Cause seriously  Netflix I need more! 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I loved the Soup so I was excited for this show, but after watching it I realized that Joel is half the show, but the other half is the segment names. Gay shows, tales from home shopping, Let's take some E!, and chicks man where just as much fun as the clips themselves "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I liked having the six to watch vs one 30 minute show. That being said; he has to be topical so it is tough to do when you have something that is weeks after it aired. That is why I think we may see more international things. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I just watch episode 14.

Don't drink soy sauce. It will kill you. 

I wish no idiot will imitate it as funny dare or something."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,show sucks ass
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Netflix loves A/B testing. I think it's an easy experiment with how cheap it is to produce.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Wasn’t the whole point of the snow to talk about stuff from this past week? 

"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Could be. Could be Netflix experimenting with the format and see what performs better. Could just be that there’s less material in the summer and people wanna take vacations so it’s easier to just build up some content at this time of year. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were back to weekly starting in the fall. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,They might have just wanted to test the difference. Run the first half weekly and then have some come out to binge. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"He said as much in the trailer for the second season, something along the lines of ""We didn't do so well, but we got a second season anyways"".

Netflix probably noticed that people are binging the show when they can, so that's they went with. They also made the episodes a bit shorter."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I would think so, this is supposed to rely on immediate events from the week or so. There may be a subtle effort to not cannibalize him and Wolf, while still honoring whatever initial episode commitments they had with McHale."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"In the UK we were getting a new one each week, it seems like a strange way of doing it to just go ""here's a month's worth of stuff that happened a month ago."" "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I’d hardly consider clips of Vanderpump Rules to be topical in any context. Idiots being idiots in reality shows is pretty timeless. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,What's topical about it exactly?
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Turns out, Paul Fieg was on the first season of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. He's uncomfortable and awkward on that too. Guy's talented behind the camera, but probably shouldn't be in front of it"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Internet circlejerks aside, Paul Feig is hilarious in this"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Paul Feig cameo already feels like a cringeworthy shoehorn in. Paul Fieg is funny, just not in this. "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I actually appreciated his joke about rebooting ghostbusters with all women and cancelling the community movie. Sounds like it was made to bust on reddit 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"He seems to really feel the need to be. I think I've laughed at maybe one of his gags over the entire series so far.

I miss Heavyweights Paul Feig."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Guy's super talented behind the camera, but the worst part about this show."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Yes
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I thought he was good though
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,It’s the perfect show to fold laundry to.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Yeah I loved waking up on Sundays and watching Joel over my morning breakfast. I like Michelle Wolf's show so I guess that's sort of replaced it but a 1-2 punch of Michelle & Joel would be perfect on Sundays. And I'm totally with you, I had to restrain myself from watching more than 3 yesterday."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I also wonder if it was due to his own schedule. He's got a few movies in production and a few that just wrapped. If Netflix wanted to AB an inexpensive series and he also needed some time away, it'd be perfect timing for the test. "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"It might be cheaper to produce for binging. They have to shoot the show weekly when there were making it based on last week's shows. Doing the binge, they can shoot more than one show in a row and might even be able to do three a day. I'm just schlub on the internet so I don't know the ins and out of television production but that has to be cheaper."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Yeah but surprisingly you can’t really notice when the clips aired. Unless you’re actually a viewer of all the reality clips they find. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Not just UK, everywhere"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,[removed]
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Bro, do you even Heavyweights? "
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Maybe he *use* to be talented behind the camera. Freaks and Geeks is possibly one of the greatest shows of all time. His most recent stuff isn't all that great.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"What was the Ghostbusters joke? Just seemed like he wanted to be recognized for being ""progressive"" or something"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I dunno....""I want everyone to know the long awaited community movie was cancelled by Paul Feig, the man who also rebooted Ghostbusters with an all female cast"" was pretty funny"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Yeah I cringe every time I see him. Everything he does on here feels extremely forced. 
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Oh, for sure. It would be cool if he was as open about it as Seth Rogen or Bill Maher, and those guys are constantly productive and successful."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Joel said on twitter that Netflix data showed people liked to binge the show.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I think it's a lot of reasons. I can't speak to the popularity of the weekly format, but like you said, Joel's a prolific actor, plus he has a family, and it's summer when people want to take vacations. And there's less TV on. So it's probably easier to take six weeks when the TV schedule is light, throw together those episodes and then take some time off while Netflix decides what to do next.

Like I said in another comment, I wouldn't be surprised if they went back to weekly in September."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Netflix is a fricken pain in the ass with this shit.

Bulk binges in some places but episodic weekly release in others. They've been doing it a lot with their anime licenses lately and it's pissing fans off. Basically everywhere but the US was getting simulcasts of anime, we were forced to wait months instead.

Some people say it's to buff their own binge numbers but I don't care, make shit match up. Now they're doing this same stuff with their own shows, it makes no sense, there's a total lack of consistency."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Spy was good and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I forget the exact wording but he basically said it in a joking way making him a villain
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"They're right in my case. When it was weekly I fell out of it and forgot to continue. I binge watched like six episodes last night, though."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I used to watch The Soup and then Fashion Police.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Seriously! I miss that show so much 😞
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Chicks, man"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,God damnit I want my [Pizza Ghost](https://media3.giphy.com/media/4Tf0KkoOVT5Ke1Aemm/source.gif) back!
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Chicken Tetrazzini!
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Joel McHale is dreamy.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,[deleted]
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I really liked the Joel McHale show. Wasn't a huge fan of his before but i liked the skits and cameos and such. I was bummed when it was cancelled cuz it seemed so low budget. Why not let it keep going?
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,What about Talk Soup? Any fans?
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I loved the Soup and watched it every week. I enjoyed the Joel McHale Show until they changed the format. Then I stopped watching.

If they ever bring it back they can't do the block release model. It has to be a weekly episodic show otherwise it loses what makes it as entertaining. 

That's my opinion anyway."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I didn't really dig the Joel McHale show, something about it felt off. But the old Soup was great. There is a new Soup with a chick hosting, I have no idea how good/bad that is"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I don't understand why they cancelled it. It was funny! And it can't be that expensive to make! Surely Netflix ( babuuummmm) could work something out
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"It uhhh sorta is back

https://ew.com/tv/2020/02/11/the-soup-host-jade-catta-preta-revamped-show-less-snarky/

Just no Joel McHale"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Netflix can revive the Joel Mchale show right now. They just need a ton of clips, editors and the man himself. I’m all for this idea."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I have never watched the soup because I'm not an American, but i loved the Joel McHale show a lot. I don't get why it got cancelled especially when it doesn't look like it cost a lot to make it. It's also a good way to cross promote other Netflix shows."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I’m with you. Miss the soup and Joel so much.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I loved this show. I wish they kept to the one episode a week format. The binge format was NOT a good move.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"If you want to get a Joel McHale fix, he’s been hosting a quarantine podcast with Ken Jeung. 

It’s great, I highly recommend it :)"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Joel had my father come on a couple of times because at the time, my family won an NBC reality show called The great American road trip. McHale is a great guy and very genuine and humble."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Ok thanks I will since you asked
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,i'll just leave [this](https://youtu.be/YY12UoFYCKQ) here
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Have you listed to The Darkest Timeline podcast yet? The production is a bit shit, even for a podcast but it’s great to hear Joel and Ken Jeong chatting about stuff. They have such a great chemistry together. And I’m sure the production will get better once they know what they are doing."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I'd be happy with Joel McHale in a t-shirt reading from the dictionary for 6 hours
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,He has a new podcast
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I loved that show...anyhow...
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Instead we get Trevor Noah’s daily show 🤦🏻
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I wasn't really a fan of The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale, but I just don't understand how it got cancelled. It seemed like it had a $10 budget, there's no way it had such bad viewership it couldn't continue but what do I know."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"So many people watched the Joel McHale show and hated it. It was clear that many people had never seen The Soup and didn't realize the style of snarky, ironic comedy. People just thought it was Joel McHale being an asshole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wish it would come back so badly"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"It is back, but without McHale and honestly, without the humor. They need to bring back McHale and his staff. It's so hard to watch now."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Chicken tettrazinni, spaghetti cat, so meaty, mankini, what are the kids watching?, shoot the intern.  The Soup during the McHale years was so awesome.  I watched the finale the other night.  RIP

Anywhere to stream it?"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale," I've been dying on this hill for years, good luck."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,It was so refreshing and nice to see him on Tiger King show. He did a great job. I started watching his other show again. I need that humor in my life.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I agree but they need to do away with the skits. Just Joel, clips, and jokes."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"*lets talk about gay shows* **GAY SHOWS**

While I understand wanting it back I do feel like it was around and did what it needed at the perfect time. The late 00’s and early 10’s was the perfect peak of *trash* reality TV like the Rock of Love/Bad Girls Club/Jersey Shore era was the best. While trashy TV obviously exists and the crew can edit anything to be funny (of the only episode of the new Soup I saw the best part was how they edited the clips) it just feels like a different less interesting time"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I was not impressed by it at all.  I never saw ""The Soup""—I only remember Talk Soup with Greg Kinnear.  The jokes on the Netflix show were just too stupid and corny for me.  It wasn't mean enough, either.  And always focused on these obscure reality shows I've never heard of.

Just give me more Community, please!"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,They did on Netflix. It died. Again 😕
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"Going to be honest, the first couple episodes of The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale were pretty solid but man, I thought the majority of the show just wasn't that good.

He's doing a podcast with Ken Jeong right now, if you can get over the poor mixing and sound quality, it's pretty awesome."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I used to watch Talk Soup with John Henson (aka Skunkboy) pretty much everyday. That shit was hilarious
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I recall seeing an ad on Twitter that they were bringing back The Soup, but with a different host. I can’t recall her name. I’m not sure if it aired any episode or if the pandemic forced it to shutdown like other shows."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,I really wanted to like The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale but their were just too many skits. Plus the guests segments were awkward and unfunny. I loved it when we would just show tv clips and comment on them. He’d have me in stitches somethings!
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,One of the greatest shows of all time. This needs to happen. Soup needed now more than ever.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"can't believe they canceled The Joel McHale Show




it looks super cheap to make"
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,He could do more specials like he did for Tiger King.
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I've been enjoying The Darkest Timeline, his YouTube podcast with Ken Jeong."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,Supporting this!  The amount of humor that could be made from all these stupid dramas now a days!  Plus I'm rewatching Community for the 3rd time.  Let's do this reddit!
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,"I'm surprised Netflix canceled it.  Seemed like the perfect fit.  Maybe it was just too soon though.  Patriot Act seems to be doing fine, but Michelle Wolfe and Joel McHale got canned.  I think these would really round out Netflix's service since its only weakness versus traditional television is current event programming."
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,If you want more Joel McHale him and Ken Jeong are doing a podcast where they talk about community and have guests on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsk8pgXcNoGEp7PZryS_3IQ its pretty funny
The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale,So MEATY!!!
Brave Miss World,"I'm okay since S1 seemed to be complete. I would like to see more but I am glad they didn't end at a cliffhanger. Sure, some character lines were open ended but that is different from cliffhangers or teasing a huge twist for an S2 that never happens."
Brave Miss World,"Between this and Happy!, Grant Morrison's move to television really isn't working out too well.  Which sucks, because I really enjoyed both of these shows."
Brave Miss World,"this is part of a growing attitude in today's content producers... if it isn't the number one show across all platforms....it's gone. no second place, no building an audience, no second chances. instant success or instant failure.

not everything can be ""the best"" ."
Brave Miss World,"Shame, I thought this was brilliant.  It left me feeling almost hollow and empty, it really made think. Is it better to be free or happy?

At least it ended in a way that tied most of it up. You sort of get an idea of where all the characters ended up"
Brave Miss World,"Damn, definitely had its problems but I enjoyed it for what it was.

Getting real sick of 90% of streaming shows getting cancelled because they're not instant, mega hits."
Brave Miss World,Did they consider cancelling Peacock and keeping the show?
Brave Miss World,There’s a Brave New World TV Adaptation???? Brave New World? **THE** Brave New World???
Brave Miss World,That’s a shame. Poor Alden Erenreich can’t catch a break
Brave Miss World,More like Brave No World amirite
Brave Miss World,"Man, this show really just failed right at the end. The themes, motifs and character arcs right at the end made no sense and went out with a whimper. Was pretty disappointed in this show, so it makes sense it won't be given another season."
Brave Miss World,Who tf even has Peacock
Brave Miss World,"So Peacock have cancelled their only scripted original show already? Not a promising sign of things to come. I guess the only saving grace is the fact that whoever is in charge of Peacock likely did not want this show on the network to begin with. It was intended for SyFy originally before being moved to USA and then eventually booted to Peacock to pad the launch of the service. 

I think streamers are far to quick to pull the plug on their TV shows. I wonder if it is because they have the accurate data on how many people watched a show and how many lasted through to the very end of the show? I’ve never really trusted the Neilson data and now that streaming provides accurate data to the likes of NBCU perhaps they are being shocked by what they are seeing in the data!"
Brave Miss World,"I read BNW years ago and really enjoyed it but - no matter how hard I try - I cannot see how it would make a good TV series. Thus, without ever having watched it, I'm not surprised it's cancelled."
Brave Miss World,"Peacock is such trash honestly. Immediately cancel their one show, ads ***for fucking Peacock*** every five minutes even when you’re literally paying for their highest no commercials tier, there’s like barely any content. This cancelation doesn’t bode well for the *one* thing they’ve got coming that anyone will be excited about too; Battlestar Galactica. Why would I even waste my time if it’ll probably get canceled after a season?"
Brave Miss World,i loved it so much this is very sad for me :(
Brave Miss World,I actually loved this show and thought it was a terrific adaptation. It touched on all the elements of the book that I thought worked and reworked or ditched the ones that didn't. It expanded and added on it in ways I thought were pretty interesting and I was really looking forward to see where they were going with it. This sucks. I feel like almost every show I like lately has been cancelled.
Brave Miss World,Damn I didn’t even know they made it. There marketing team should be canned. All they do is spam my email saying they exist never saying what they have on offer.
Brave Miss World,"TIL there was a season of Brave New World on Peacock. Considering NBC/Comcast's marketing budget for Peacock, can't believe I didn't see this...But with that being said, can Peacock get cancelled already, or do we have to wait five years for all these shows to come to Hulu?"
Brave Miss World,[deleted]
Brave Miss World,Cowards.
Brave Miss World,"I got through two episodes before I gave up on it. It's so dry and so boring. And I was fascinated by the source material when I read it. 

It won't be missed by me, that's for sure."
Brave Miss World,I didn’t expect a second season at the end. It was open ended a little yes but they’d told the story of Brave New World. Personally I think it’s the best adaptation yet.
Brave Miss World,"I don't understand how you could do a series of Brave New World tbh. It should have been a mini series instead they wanted to milk it, which is ironic because Brave New World is literally /hailcorporate."
Brave Miss World,"I never even heard about this until now. And seeing that screenshot made me go ""It can't be *that* book.""

Learning that it is seems even more surprising. That picture does not embody what I imagine that book translating into."
Brave Miss World,"They kind of zipped through the entire plot of the book in the first half and kept a lingering Lenina plot line going. I enjoyed the first few episodes but after that it switched to ""everyone put your contacts in"" and ""this unseeable yet anthropomorphic algorithm controls us"", and I feel like in the book, that wasn't necessary because the society was so perfectly conditioned. I prefer the book to the super computer, secret society thing."
Brave Miss World,"Did not even know this had been made into a show, so I can't say I'm surprised it didn't get renewed."
Brave Miss World,"I haven't even gotten around to watching this yet. As long as they completed the storyline of the book, that may be enough. *The Handmaid's Tale* completed the storyline based on the book in one season, and the second season didn't interest me as much as the first. However, *The Man in the High Castle* did a great job of extending the story beyond the book. Without seeing the series yet, there is no telling which way a second season would have gone."
Brave Miss World,Didn't an exec of Peacock say they have shows people actually want to watch compared to Quibi?
Brave Miss World,Well hopefully it gets picked up elsewhere. One of the few new shows that was slightly interesting.
Brave Miss World,"Peacock is trash. I tried watching BSG on it, and it kept buffering then freezing. Such horrible software."
Brave Miss World,Can a network show actually do this justice?
Brave Miss World,Wasn't Breaking Bad in danger of being canned after the second season?
Brave Miss World,"picked up peacock streaming service because of harry potter series on it then i saw brave new world, watch episode, then they wanted me to pay, no thanks"
Brave Miss World,"Like somebody else said, they wanted this to be a flagship. They sunk $100M into the first season, which is significantly more expensive than most shows. 

The cheaper the show is to produce, the more likely it gets additional seasons. That’s the great thing about streaming, you are not constrained to a certain number of time slots & primetime, you can make as many different shows as you have the money and demand to justify."
Brave Miss World,That series felt like someone was looking for a reason to show lots of naked people.  We get it they have orgies.
Brave Miss World,They haven’t canceled the show yet. Peacock decided to not go forward with season 2. Amblin is shopping it to other networks. It was never a peacock original. It was originally going to be on USA network.
Brave Miss World,"As long as it ended well

I haven’t watched the show yet, because I want to read the book first. I got a couple new copies for $3.50 each 

It may be a while though"
Brave Miss World,That's a shame. The end definitely felt like they left it open for a second season.
Brave Miss World,What an interesting cover photo.  I wonder why they chose it?
Brave Miss World,"I really liked it, but as others pointed out it didn't really need a second season."
Brave Miss World,I had no idea this even existed. Where can I stream it? One of my favorite books!
Brave Miss World,Did this have anything to do with Huxley’s Brave New World? Judging by the image here I don’t think it was
Brave Miss World,"I just read the book and I didn't even know this existed.

So apparently their marketing was shit. Could explain why it's been cancelled."
Brave Miss World,That Alden Ehrenreich guy can't catch a break.
Brave Miss World,"I thought it was a bit of a wasted opportunity to flesh out some of the characters. 

Instead of making Bernard a jealous loser, they should have humanized him as someone genetically inferior (due to tampering at birth) forced to work at the same level as his superiors as an experiment (as elaborated on in the 1980's BBC version).

I felt they made Lenina too perfect, her character wasn't great in the original material, but they went too far the other way.

I'm not sure where they were going with the AI and revolution, in the original the lowest levels were mentally subnormal and wouldn't be able to understand the concept of rebellion."
Brave Miss World,"I thought it was kind of bad, but at the same time I'm sad to see it cancelled. I'm a big fan of the source material and science fiction in general. A lot of shows take time to grow into themselves, as it were, and I would have liked to see them continue to try to improve."
Brave Miss World,"that's a shame, I thought this show was really good"
Brave Miss World,"Wait, bikini girl, nice."
Brave Miss World,Who's the chick? Asking for a friend...
Brave Miss World,"Maybe its a blessing. 

S1 basically covers the original book. 

Look at Man in the high castle, S1 was the original story, and Season 2 and 3 were ""creative license"" 

And were really bad compared to S1."
Brave Miss World,Alden Enriech is the new Taylor Kitsch.  Can't miss young star given a massive seemingly guaranteed franchise turned to canceled TV star lost to the garbage bin of history.
Brave Miss World,Peacock like much like Quibi was DOA
Brave Miss World,"Peacock is tanking. It's been mismanaged from the start. How can a new streamer with access to the kinds of things NBC can access, with the wealth NBC can spend, do so poorly? Well, Peacock has no identity of its own, and strangling their babies in their cribs isn't going to exactly help matters either."
Brave Miss World,I'm literally on episode 2 and love it. Why??!!!
Brave Miss World,A right decent Sci-Fi show getting cancelled in the first or second season because it did not immediately create stellar rating for a streaming service....  somehow sounds familiar.
Brave Miss World,"This is why I NEVER support anything on NBC anymore. After Heroes, Grimm, so many others, I have determined the ""C"" stands for ""Cancel"". Fuck NBC."
Brave Miss World,"this is the first I've heard of it - the series, not the book it's based on. I don't even recall seeing it in any of the Peacock adds I've seen.

that sucks, but I feel like my approach to Peacock shows is going to be the same as my approach to CBS All-Access shows: if it was good, they'd give it a time slot."
Brave Miss World,I’d never even heard of whatever this show is. Might have liked it. Oh well.
Brave Miss World,Seriously?!? I JUST found out thsi show existed two weeks ago as a fan of the book and author. I guess there's no point in me watching it now. This is a few weeks after Netflix canceled two 1 season shows I and many others loved. Streaming is getting a bit old in some respects.
Brave Miss World,#1Let's devalue women✅🔽grab'em guys here :)
Brave Miss World,I’m surprised they didn’t wait out a bit before announcing the cancellation considering this was a flagship show.
Brave Miss World,"Whilst it set up things to potentially explore in subsequent seasons, it works pretty well as a self contained season. 
ending diverges from the book but all and all it follows similar beats"
Brave Miss World,is there any way to communicate to the production company my sadness and that i hope the find another home for it?
Brave Miss World,"Not only did I not know this show existed, I watch Peacock somewhat regularly since I can't get NBC and never once saw it recommended it anything. This still looks cheesy. Was it any good?"
Brave Miss World,"The really wish they’d change the damn name of that streaming service. I mean like, seriously."
Brave Miss World,"I didn't even know this was already out. Of course not having a fire TV app makes it kind of hard for me to watch their shows without jumping through extra hoops that I had no reason to jump through because I didn't know that this was out.

NBC dropped the ball on this one. I'm here on this subreddit a few times a week and I didn't know that this was out. The fact that they canceled it so soon makes me hesitant to try any of their shows if they will be canceled this quickly."
Brave Miss World,Could be the advertising. This is the first time I'm hearing about this show and I definitely would have been interested in it.
Brave Miss World,dang
Brave Miss World,I found this series to be very cheap and bad
Brave Miss World,Cancel PeaCOCK
Brave Miss World,"I guess just too expensive, and not enough viewers.

Anyway, I liked it at least."
Brave Miss World,"Fun show, but really doesn't need a second season."
Brave Miss World,I didn’t even know that this was made into a tv show. Loved the book when I read it years ago.
Brave Miss World,Jesus. Why would they cancel it? Surely they need their library built up?
Brave Miss World,"It was a heap of fun but it was fairly obvious, and not in a terribly exciting way, where s2 would have gone.

&#x200B;

Im kinda glad, I like Alden too much to see him get stuck in TV Land unless its something major and this felt...small."
Brave Miss World,Damn I loved it
Brave Miss World,What scene from the book is that picture from? I've read the book several times and don't recall it.
Brave Miss World,Another casualty of the fucking awful drive to make everything subscriptions these days. Haven't used any of these services in years.
Brave Miss World,Honestly it hasn’t had enough time to find an audience. I have it marked for watching and will get there at some point.
Brave Miss World,Cool? I guess? Didn’t even know this show existed or what it’s about
Brave Miss World,"I was hoping I misread that as ""Peacock Canceled After One Season"""
Brave Miss World,Yawn.
Brave Miss World,NOOOO
Brave Miss World,"This show was fabulous, the characters are well acted. I'm devastated. Why would Peacock market it so poorly and then immediately cancel when it's not received? You have to advertise shows..."
Brave Miss World,"Tbh I liked it, could have been better but it was still enjoyable"
Brave Miss World,Did they finish the story?
Brave Miss World,"sad news

not the best, not the worst show

but still fun to watch"
Brave Miss World,I really wanted to like this show and understand that other people do. But I just couldn’t get into it. There was just something incomplete about it that I can’t put my finger on. There’s something missing.
Brave Miss World,Makes sense really.  Why spebd money making this show when the news is basically the same thing?
Brave Miss World,"I really enjoyed it. Would have loved to see S2.  Also I know a lot of people just now finding out about it.  

Netflix showed somewhere that the most views a S1 of a show ever gets is not when it debuts, but right before S2. 

Guess they’ll never know."
Brave Miss World,Good. That series completely ruined the original book.
Brave Miss World,what the fuck is peacock? there's too many streaming services
Brave Miss World,The very reason I didn’t sign up for peacock. Totally in character with NBC.
Brave Miss World,Just throwing my hat in to say NBC had the best possible show for Peacock back in 2009. It was called Kings. it was promoted  with the grace of a drunk gorilla and canceled after 1 season despite being honestly one of the best shows I've ever seen.
Brave Miss World,I watched the first episode.  I really wanted to like it.  And I did like some parts of it.  I'll probably pick it up again sometime... but I will say that I didn't like any of the storyline in America.
Brave Miss World,"Are there multiple books for 'Brave New World'?  Altered Carbon was different books and had some overlap or nostalgia from the previous book.  The series was cancelled after season 2 since the second season was a bit confusing at the start, quickly introduced new plots, and didn't slide into the season as the first season did.  Season 3 probably would have been the same as season 2."
Brave Miss World,Book was great! Only weird thing was kids being encouraged to have sex with each other in elementary school. I really hope they left that part out of the show.
Brave Miss World,Wow - I actually thought this would get picked up. I liked it a lot
Brave Miss World,"That's a shame.  I really enjoyed this show, and would love to see more."
Brave Miss World,That looked like Antonio Brown in the back for a sec ha

First Team: Juventus,"I mean me too but I think that's fine, TV should appeal to different demographics. TV still has a lot more diversity than movies, which have for the most part been restricted to the lowest common denominator in terms of market appeal, because of the massive budgets. 

I'm sure there are lots of people who'd find this pretty interesting, and find whatever shit you like dull as hell."
First Team: Juventus,"One of my new favorite quotes I heard recently about storytelling went something like- it doesn’t matter what a story is about, it matters how it is about it.

And for instance, this applies to me for things like Ted Lasso or this documentary I watched on Tiger Woods recently or even this podcast radiolab did on American Football, I who have absolutely no interest in sports, was really fascinated by these stories because of how well they were told. 

Not necessarily trying to be contrarian, just wanted to add my two cents. I’m actually looking forward to this show because I love the idea of following a dramatized fictional history of the male pin-up/porn for ladies/gay men industry ha."
First Team: Juventus,"> One of my new favorite quotes I heard recently about storytelling went something like- it doesn’t matter what a story is about, it matters how it is about it.

First Team: Juventus,"Bradshaw:

>Last week on this show, I ran out of breath, and Howie [Long] helped me up. And a lot of people are asking what’s wrong with me, what’s happened to me physically. I just want to address it and let you know what has happened in my life.

>In November, I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. I went to the Yale University Medical Center – surgery, treatment. As of today, I am bladder-cancer free. That’s the good news.

>Then in March, feeling good. I had a bad neck. I get an MRI. Now we find a tumor in my left neck. And it’s a Merkel cell tumor, which is a rare form of skin cancer. So I had that surgery done at M.D. Anderson in Houston.

>Folks, I may not look like my old self, but I feel like my old self. I’m cancer free, I’m feeling great. And over time, I’m going to be back to where I normally am.”"
First Team: Juventus,"Terry Bradshaw reveals *two separate cancer diagnoses* in the last year, for which he had surgery, and is now cancer free. Weird to see a headline actually undersell a story."
First Team: Juventus,"I've always liked Bradshaw.

Seems like a pretty good guy and definitely not as dense as he's been accused of.  Hollywood Henderson once said Bradshaw was so dumb he couldn't spell cat if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a' !!!

;)"
First Team: Juventus,"Charted with his rendition of ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" in 1976. It wasn't bad."
First Team: Juventus,And also after getting Shingles !
First Team: Juventus,"Far as I know, he's one of the good ones...."
First Team: Juventus,FUCK CANCER!
First Team: Juventus,I don't really know anything about cancer other than that I have it (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). When I saw him last week I immediately thought he had cancer because it was like looking in the mirror.
First Team: Juventus,Glad he’s feeling better. He’ll always s be my #12.
First Team: Juventus,I don’t know much about him but I loved how he was willing to poke fun at himself on Married With Children
First Team: Juventus,"I remember years ago everyone was saying Terry had Alzheimer’s and would post clips of him forgetting what was going on and being lost to prove it, then he gets cancer and skin cancer, dude is still going, tough sob"
First Team: Juventus,My father in law beat bladder cancer earlier this year. This kinda hits home.
First Team: Juventus,"Touching moment, glad I caught it. All the best TB"
First Team: Juventus,Love ya Terry ❤️
First Team: Juventus,Never been a football fan but my dad is and we’ve always been a Steeler house. He was always my favorite part of when my dad had football on as a kid. Glad he’s doing well! Have another great couple decades Terry!!
First Team: Juventus,"Gets cancer and still gives millions of dollars away every week.

Man’s doing a reverse Walter White"
First Team: Juventus,I’m so glad he is cancer free. I saw him walking around Planet Hollywood in Vegas about a year ago now. I said to my husband “hey look it’s terry Bradshaw” and I must have said it loudly in my drunken state because he said “hey back atcha kid”. He was just really friendly
First Team: Juventus,Get well Mr Bradshaw. A good man I pray heals 100%!!
First Team: Juventus,I view Terry as my TV grandfather.  This could not happen to a nicer person and I can only hope he recovers
First Team: Juventus,"If you grew up with a dad who loved football in the US, then you know this man."

First Team: Juventus,"He broke my heart as a young Raiders fan with the Immaculate Reception, but I wish him only the fullest of recoveries for being a decent human being."
First Team: Juventus,He is a lovely human being
First Team: Juventus,Hope he’s ok. Seems like a legit nice guy.  He’s not breathing real well though so not sure what that has to do with his cancer free status.  I think he’s also said to have some potential CTE issues. Football is a brutal game and was more brutal when he played. Great player. 🙏🙏
First Team: Juventus,Ah man I love Terry. He looked like he aged a good amount from last NFL season to today and this makes sense. Hope for the best
First Team: Juventus,"Hope he can stay cancer free. I’ve always liked him, seems like a good, genuine guy."
First Team: Juventus,"Oh man, Bradshaw is so awesome. He has so much charisma on screen.

I hope he stays NOD for the rest of his life."
First Team: Juventus,"MD Andersen is awesome except to get in you have to come up with the 40,000 for screening and insurance usually doesn’t cover it, unless you have that Cadillac plan. Then there’s always that risk they won’t take you. Healthcare in the US is no longer “the best”
for patients. It’s the most profitable for insurance companies."
First Team: Juventus,Terry Bradshaw is 74 years old.
First Team: Juventus,Love this man.  Such a good soul.  He is a true family man and does everything with his whole heart.
First Team: Juventus,Wow. I had t seen him in awhile. He’s looking pretty old.
First Team: Juventus,"The age of these sports broadcasters is getting ridiculous. The us senate and sports talking head are the best job rich people never want to retire from.

It’s getting hard to watch a lot of these old fucks dying in from t of me every Sunday. Howie long should be the oldest person that is allowed to talk sports on tv. If your older then howie long. Go home we don’t need your hot take from the coaching job you had in the 80’s."
First Team: Juventus,Well now I feel bad for saying that he looks like John Lithgow as Winston Churchill.
First Team: Juventus,"I’m glad he’s cancer free.

Will the NFL play the cancer card with him just to increase viewership? Or will they do the right thing (for the fans) and fill the job with somebody in much better shape physically and mentally"
First Team: Juventus,"This is what’s wrong with America.   He lives in Oklahoma, but because he’s rich he can afford to go to New Jersey and Texas for cancer treatments to ensure he gets the best care."
First Team: Juventus,"Wow, it’s been a while since I’ve seen this man, he’s definitely aged. Bless him and his family."
First Team: Juventus,Well at-least I know why he was hugging everyone Sunday
First Team: Juventus,Noooo Terry!!!!
First Team: Juventus,I know so many people that have been diagnosed with cancer in the past year its crazy.
First Team: Juventus,Best wishes to Terry. Loved watching his commentary since I was a kid.
First Team: Juventus,I wish him well.
First Team: Juventus,"Pardon my language, but…cancer is a cunt"
First Team: Juventus,"People can say a lot of bad things about him but, he always has a way of making people feel that they are in a fun dialogue and not just speaking at people."
First Team: Juventus,Fuck cancer!
First Team: Juventus,My mother used to decorate his house each Christmas with some 8 Christmas 🎄
First Team: Juventus,"Damn, I mentioned before that TB was looking older and different, but never knew it was because of cancer. Fuck cancer! Wishing him the best in staying healthy."
First Team: Juventus,I’m curious about the original video where he lost his breath — cannot find it online.
First Team: Juventus,"Wish him well but my favorite TB story is Hollywood Henderson saying Bradshaw couldn't spell ""cat"" if you spotted him the c and the a."
First Team: Juventus,Thrilled for Terry. FUCK CANCER!
First Team: Juventus,The answer is always “more Terry Bradshaw.”
First Team: Juventus,What??! This is crazy we were all just making fun of him for being  always salty and jealous of Ben Roethlisberger literally last night. Hope he’s all good for real tho
Everything Sucks!,"Animation is always first and last on the chopping block, because it's easy for execs to cut.

Everything Sucks!,"Y'know it's honestly surprising we're still getting shows that are so high quality these days. Every single network or streamer treats their animated shows like garbage in someway. 

Cartoon Network bounces around it's shows so much. You might not even know it's running.HBO-Max is HBO-Max.

Disney sticks closely to it's 3 season model and they're always ready to just stomp it out and pretend it didn't happen. 

Netflix orders shows in formats to avoid paying animators. 

I can't even find it in myself to be excited for all the Paramount Avatar stuff because it all feels so ""we need a big universe to pump out shows and movies on our streaming service"" instead of something genuine."

Everything Sucks!,"Except for the price, the amount of content, the lack of commercials, watching on demand, not needing your home hooked up to anything special, not having to deal with cable companies and being able to drop any service at any time. Other than that just like cable."

Everything Sucks!,"Animation as a medium is more respected in Japan, but animators over there get paid barely a living wage working in shitty conditions."
Everything Sucks!,"In particular, France and some of western Europe have delivered some gems. France has ""Wakfu/Dofus"", ""Arcane"" and ""Ladybug"" most recently. Historically, you have series like ""Once upon a time life/history/space"", ""Alfred J Quack"", ""Moomins"", etc. While a lot of it was also in cooperation with Japanese or Korean studios, they are more serious animation projects than the average kids' cartoons.

Adult oriented animation is also still ongoing, though struggling. Archer (last season), new season of Beavis and Butthead and Harley Quinn are all airing now. The biggest loss so far is IMO Venture Bros, of which there's very little info on its fate."
Everything Sucks!,"Yeah it sucks that the only place to find a huge variety of quality animation is Japan. I don't mind anime. i've been watching a lot lately...but man...they have one of two modes, they either have the series run literally forever (One Piece, Dragon Ball, Bleach etc) or they do one to three seasons and stop without concluding it. Many more just do season, stop on a cliff hanger and then never have anything new again. On rare occasions something will come out 5-10 years later and just stop with no proper conclusion. Literally thousands have no proper ending spanning all the way back to the 90's maybe even 80's or earlier.

And most of them made that way on purpose just to get people to buy the books. I wish the US made stuff on par with anime. And a variety. Like stuff for adults that isn't just crude humor. Stuff that's just slice of life and pleasant etc. We got a few decent things through out the years, but we've yet to get another series like Spawn. The DC cartoon movies are almost there, but they're too afraid to go all the way with nudity and violence.

I don't mind all these crudely drawn noodle arm animated cartoons, but man...we need more high quality 2D animation."
Everything Sucks!,"Wow, that sounded really cool."
Everything Sucks!,Dammit
Everything Sucks!,"Because in any situation I mostly care more about the animators. As I'm doing my research to this response, I'm learning that HBO Max uses this strategy as well. The point is that full orders prevent animators from using any platform they gain from the show to negotiate for more pay. That's bad to me."
Everything Sucks!,"Which honestly doesn't make much sense like a lot of Vice articles. How can you call that animation in streaming sucks when in actuallity sreaming has lead to a ton of amazing animation shows in a quality we basically never had before (meaning outside of Japan). 

""Animation in streaming just took a hit"" would have been a better description / title. 

Especially when it comes to Netflix it is not even clear if that was really aimed at animation or if they simply killed of a few shows that weren't up to snuff or of which Netflix decided late that it wouldn't add enough value, especially when the article that Vice is citing even states that Netflix is still heavily invested in animation (on top of killing none animation shows all the time to the degree that people meme about it):

> Netflix is still investing heavily in animation, with “Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous,” “Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight,” “My Dad the Bounty Hunter” and “Gabby’s Dollhouse” among the film and television shows in the works. The studio recently released “The Mitchells vs. the Machines” and plans to unveil director Guillermo del Toro’s stop-motion animation version of “Pinocchio” later this year.

I also don't see them kill off successful shows like Castelvania or Arcane."

* Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
* Macross: Do You Remember, Love?

Everything Sucks!,Wait your complain about DC cartoons is not enough nudity?
Everything Sucks!,"Strongly recommend checking out the Unico Movies by Sanrio, Osamu Tezuka, and Madhouse Productions. While you're at it, try seeking out an English copy of the original manga. It's a decent children's manga, but it really makes you think as an adult. It's why I have a strong love for old school anime of the 70s and 80s."
Everything Sucks!,"Yeah, was really looking forward to it. 😥"
Everything Sucks!,"You can say that again!

At this point in time, I have 0 expectations of anything in animation. You take what you get, and forget about everything else. It's a really bad time right now in the space, and most of my favorite projects are on shaky (or at least, uncertain) ground.

Even established properties. You never know what the next day brings. 😦"
Everything Sucks!,"I'm probably missing some information here, so I'm just going to ask. What exactly is it that Netflix and HBO do that is different from others and detrimental to the animators?

It sounds as though they are paying less because they guarantee, and pay for, a full season/series upfront, rather than a few episodes at a time to see if it's a hit and then commit to more and a pay rise to go with it - or it's not a hit, it gets cancelled and the animators get nothing?

Please, don't read into this something that isn't here. I really don't much about it and I'm asking for more info."
Everything Sucks!,"I think the point about Netflix is that they killed off their own internal animation stuff. They'll still pick up other peoples' projects and put them out, like Arcane."

>Netflix is adding commercials, pay for premium no ads on every service

They're adding a cheaper version that has ads, if you already have Netflix and don't choose to downgrade then nothing has changed for you.


>they are all busting down on sharing accounts

Okay? Cable was literally only in your home to begin with. Even if they crack down on account sharing it's better.


>the bloat is happening.

What?


>It might not be the same now but it will. You are a fool if you can’t see the writing on the wall…

Yeah I'm the fool"
Everything Sucks!,"There is a lot of western animation for adults though. Just today, I saw “Flee” on Hulu, which seems to be a danish/french co-production. France has a well established animation industry, and for the past couple of decades they’ve done more adult animation like “Persepolis”, “Summit of the Gods” (based on a manga)."
Everything Sucks!,This is why I love old school anime (mainly the one from the 70s and 80s) since they weren't as tropey as today. Especially works by Sanrio Animation between 1977 till 1985.
Everything Sucks!,"There’s still enough great shit out there where you can avoid those tropes though. I get what you mean though.

Everything Sucks!,"No it's a very nuanced situation compared to the other networks I talked about. Full series orders have benefits, and drawbacks. I'd just like animators to have more negotiating power, so to me it's bad that there seems to be no point for renegotiation. Networks can't really do this kind of thing with live action because of course someone is going to stop at some point and realize their power and ask for more pay."
Everything Sucks!,"They never really had an internal animation company. All of it was third party, they just rebrand it as Netflix Animation."

Also one of Sydney Sweeney’s first notable roles, and she was fantastic in it."

I expected nothing and it was one of the best show I've seen this year"
Everything Sucks!,Loved it.
Everything Sucks!,Everything sucks now! The 90’s was epic. So glad I grew up then. I am 37 and shit sucks now. I am writing a show… fuck it.
Everything Sucks!,Is it? I remember reading one review that said “Everything Sucks lives up to its name”
Everything Sucks!,"Yeah, didn’t love this show. So much pandering to nostalgia fanatics on this one in particular. It just feels much more forced than other shows trying to land in the same territory."

Ahh yes I recall this being the first show I saw Sydney Sweeney in. Kinda funny how her doing a make-out/foreplay scene with a (then) 14 year old actress (Peyton Kennedy) in this had way less controversy than her role in Euphoria. lol."
Everything Sucks!,Your show sounds promising. I’ll give it a shot.
Everything Sucks!,Well you read one review I guess that's settled
Everything Sucks!,Personally I found it dull and unengaging.
Everything Sucks!,I love Mindunter but one is unrelated to the other.
Everything Sucks!,I was so upset when they canceled Mind Hunter. There’s been rumors of it possibly being picked up again so I’m staying hopeful that they’ll somehow come to their senses. If I recall the executive producer “wanted to pursue other things”
Everything Sucks!,This is the way
Everything Sucks!,"people probably just forgot about that, there’s controversy around alexa demie kissing a minor in a movie as well"
Everything Sucks!,"To be fair, that did get a chuckle out of me"
Everything Sucks!,"Yeah same. I mean, I'm glad people saw something in it, but to me it was so painfully unfunny and almost hamfisted, and I'm someone who grew up in that time period lol"
Everything Sucks!,They didn't cancel it. The showrunner wanted to work on other projects.
Everything Sucks!,"Not to go off on too much of a tangent here, but it was pretty remarkable how consistent their sound was on that album considering the intervening years between releases."
Everything Sucks!,If I recall correctly (it’s been awhile since I’ve seen both) the characters in Everything Sucks were only a year apart whereas the characters in mid90s were supposed to be a teenager and a little kid.
Everything Sucks!,That was a really fast cancellation from a Netflix perspective. It must have really flopped in viewership.
Everything Sucks!,"If you try to emulate Freaks And Geeks, part of that includes being a one-season wonder."
Everything Sucks!,Well that sucks.
Everything Sucks!,"That's ok, Netflix will save it."
Everything Sucks!,"I thought all Netflix shows were purchased for 2 seasons, so ""announcing"" a second season was just a technicality. I guess that's not the case anymore."
Everything Sucks!,"This is disappointing, surprised it wasn't popular. It's a nice little show, easily digestible with charming kid actors. It doesn't really have a big draw and it's Freaks & Geeks light but it's such an easy watch that you'd figure a lot of people would have watched it and that it wouldn't cost much for Netflix to produce."
Everything Sucks!,I really liked this show after a tentative start. Extremely disappointed here

I think it’s.. fine? I keep waiting for a hook to happen. For the past to tie into the present and for it to show me what its trying to say. it’s clear from the episode 2 weeks ago that that’s going to come eventually.. but god does this show take its time. 

I’m never bored by the show, but I’m just finding it hard to be invested in it. As an episode ends, I’ve never been like “I can’t wait for the next episode!” But I guess it’s not that kind of show. It’s just a look at how hard this girls life has been through the Japanese occupation of Korea and how that’s shaped her life by the choices she’s made. The history aspect of how Koreans were treated and are still vilified/looked down upon by the Japanese so many years later is all very interesting, and I had no idea there was such a resentment between the two.

All in all, I think it will win a lot of awards. But I keep waiting for this show to be as great as people have said it is..  I’m hoping as it all ties together in the final few episodes it will finally click for me.. But maybe I’m just not this shows audience. Because so far it’s… fine."

Reply 1988,"I feel exactly the same way. My wife loves it (though she prefers the past storyline over the present). I also think it's just fine. I'm never dying for the next episode, but I still enjoy watching it. It's definitely one of those shows where I could forget to watch it one week and then later suddenly realize, ""Oh yeah, I should probably catch up on Pachinko at some point.""

Everything about the show is done well. It just doesn't hook me in."
Reply 1988,"Some sad, a lot of hope too. Great show for sure."
Reply 1988,"I didn’t read the book because I thought it’d be too sad, but I watched the first episode of the show and I was hooked. I’m now planning to read the book as well. While there are certainly some sad parts, for me it’s gripping enough to make it worthwhile."
Reply 1988,"I've only heard rave reviews about this and Severance, but idk if I can justify another subscription"
Reply 1988,Is this a joke? Every other post on this sub praises Apple TV+.
Reply 1988,Booooooo Netflix Booooooo Goooooo Apple TV Gooooooo
Reply 1988,Severance is perfect.
Reply 1988,It’s $5 a month. Or a free trial. Or a whole year with any Apple product purchase. Hardly bank breaking.
Reply 1988,"Worth it. Ted lasso and for all mankind are great too. I also enjoyed foundation, but it was more mixed."

Reply 1988,"While I agree that more shows on Apple TV+ deserve wider viewership (I know a lot of people would adore Ted Lasso for example), the audience of people not watching are more like likely to be outside of reddit, especially this sub. I don't know anyone irl who has Apple TV+ or in many cases, who even know about it. When I suggest a show from the service, I get a lot of push back, not because of Apple specifically, but more because no one wants to get another streaming service. They're okay with just missing out."

Mostly, thanks to the circumstance that its a prequel, I'm very interested in how it turns out given that Kim is not in Breaking Bad.

Rooftop Prince,"Dan and Roseanne Connor are the best TV couple of all time.

 I have some friends that remind me of this couple. As annoying as Roseanne is, she's not unbearable like most TV wives. Dan's not portrayed as a moron.. The couple has an unmatched chemistry that isn't normally found on television.

The drama that the two went through felt real. As  loud and annoying as they were, they weren't constantly nagging at each other about petty shit. Neither came off as ungrateful for the other.

Dan doesn't treat Roseanne like she's a moron. Roseanne doesn't demand constant attention from him. Dan's not constantly scheming to pull one over on Roseanne. She's not trying to make him into the man she thinks he can be and lets him be the man that she is.

The only ""flaw"" in their characters is they're not attractive. They're middle aged fatties from the midwest.

The most enduring quality in this couple is the fact that the love the characters have for each other really comes through the TV screen. Unlike Ray and Debora, Penny and Leonard, Ross and Rachel, Doug and Kerri, or any other TV couple you're not left wondering WTF do they see in each other. They're a perfect match for each other."

Gangsta.,The growing disconnect between two old friends where they accepted the pending separation and reported each other was one of the best parts of s3.
Gangsta.,"My wife and I just finished watching season 3 for the first time and i love how throughout the season there is a theme of being open about the path you've chosen, be you a criminal, a reformed criminal, or a Major with a desperate vision."
Gangsta.,It’s all in the game yo.
Gangsta.,Unless they some smart ass pawns
Gangsta.,Man I will never grow tired of people posting Wire scenes.
Gangsta.,Come on guys....He wants his corners!!!!
Gangsta.,Yeah. The scene when they are reminiscing on the rooftop before shit hits the fan is just so sad. The Wire did such a good job of making us sympathize with these ruthless gangsters.
Gangsta.,"> just finished watching season 3 for the first time

Ohhh to be that person again, not knowing the excellence that Season 4 would bring. Enjoy."
Gangsta.,"> or a Major with a desperate vision.

He was done wrong by snake Carcetti."
Gangsta.,"""What you need a badminton set for."""
Gangsta.,">We ain’t gotta dream no more, man"
Gangsta.,Potentially the greatest scene in TV history.
Gangsta.,I keep hearing this!! Each season has pretty much raised the bar on itself; i cant wait to see what 4 does!
Gangsta.,"or, we ain't got a dream no more, man"
Gangsta.,"It was such a beautiful moment shared between two friends who were about to betray one another, something straight out of Shakespeare."
Gangsta.,"Season 4 raises the bar to an exceptional level.  That season enhances not only the characters you know, but also the city of Baltimore as a whole.  You take a glimpse at just how far this war stretches and the questions people face in life in the city go."
Gangsta.,It's pretty good that's all I'll say
Gangsta.,"You were watching a sitcom. What you saw, was a joke. It's a joke."
Gangsta.,Humor changes with time. It was funny back then. It’s a trope.
Gangsta.,Just thinking of Aunt Esther whooping some heathen's ass with her purse makes me laugh
Gangsta.,"You know tv isn’t real, right?"
Gangsta.,"Maybe because you're an alpha chad who doesn't afraid of anything while mere mortals are just weak pussies. Let's be honest, if you were in the movie you could beat up all of those gangsters without breaking a sweat. Sadly most people lack your bravery, intelligence and strength. You sir, are the main character."
Gangsta.,"Season 1 was fantastic and then it started declining in quality.

Still worth watching for Glenn Close."
Gangsta.,Season 1 is perfection. One of the first shows i got hooked on!Everything after the first season doesn't match but is still solid
Gangsta.,The first season was just too good. None of the subsequent seasons could hold a candle to it.
Gangsta.,"Season one was fantastic but unfortunately I didn't really enjoy it much after that stage.

Željko Ivanek was phenomenal"
Gangsta.,Zeljko Ivanek was just amazing in the first season
Gangsta.,"FX was soooo good in that time period. I feel like people sleep on Rescue Me, Nip/Tuck, and Sons of Anarchy. All 3 also had fantastic soundtracks. 

I watched Damages when it aired, don't remember much, but I do remember how much I loved watching it at the time."
Gangsta.,"Season 1 and 2 are burnt into my memory. Crazy good show, it does start to fall off though. Mainly because they start to focus more on the relationship angle rather than actually good legal stories.

They also had that network change from season 3 which didn't help at all. The later seasons were well cast but it always felt like the  network was pushing narratives relevant to the time period to try and get more people to watch.

Finally the intro is still the best ever made!"
Gangsta.,"Season 2 falters a bit, but Season 3 is fantastic, almost as good as Season 1.  Martin Short and Campbell Scott give excellent supporting performances.  The last two seasons are good, and I think it ended well, but FX cancelled it after Season 3 and DirectTV brought it back for two more seasons.  You could tell there was a significant decrease in the production budget.  Still very solid though."
Gangsta.,"This show is so underrated, most people I feel have never even heard of it. The acting is so top notch, especially Rose Byrne (Which I believe this was really her breakout role), Glenn Close and Ted Danson. 

The first season I honestly do believe is up there with one of my favorite seasons of any show, I love all the twists and the flashing back. 

I do think the later seasons don't match the success of the first, but honestly I loved the series throughout. The relationship between Patty and Ellen is the best part of the show."
Gangsta.,"Yeah, Season 1 is incredible. The Pilot episode is easily in the top three best Pilots ever made. The last scene revelation is so shocking and so intriguing. I don’t think any Pilot has hooked me in so immediately the way this one did. Best of all the season actually delivers the landing way beyond my high expectations.

It’s sad that it could never quite reach the same heights that it did, but the later seasons are still fun. Season 2 has a really good, definitive ending so in my mind the show is just two seasons while Seasons 3 onwards are just a fun bonus. I wanted to love Season 3 and it definitely has some fantastic moments but its conclusion was a little too silly for my taste."
Gangsta.,This show has some seriously good episode titles.
Gangsta.,"The first season was great - season 2 & 3 were also \*very\* good (but not quite as good) - the last couple of seasons were a bit of a let down, but still worth watching."
Gangsta.,Wow it's that old? Doesn't seem like it was that long ago. It was excellant!
Gangsta.,"Wow can’t believe someone actually posted about this amazing show! 

All the other seasons are really good as well.

I don’t know what amazing shows people are watching. I’ve tried so many and damages worst seasons are 100 times better in my opinion.

Season 1 may be the best, but the whole show was a terrific high stakes drama with elements of suspense, back stabbing, plot twists all present in every season.

The show is worth watching the whole way through just for the patty and Ellen relationship."
Gangsta.,"Agree. That first season was great, then it started to draaaaaag."
Gangsta.,"Seems to be the consensus. Thank you; I'm glad I posted.

I'll probably wait 6 months before deciding whether to watch S02.  
Though that might easily mean I'll leave it alone.  
S01 is so good, so well rounded, not sure I'm gonna want the memory sullied"
Gangsta.,He is amazing in everything.
Gangsta.,"Rescue Me always felt like one of those ""Holy shit this is good - why isn't anyone watching it?"" shows - and the ratings were pretty average throughout the run.

Another show that managed to peak about 3-4 seasons in."
Gangsta.,"Also the ones that left us way too soon, The Riches and Terriers"
Gangsta.,"Martin Short, John Goodman, and Ted Danson - all best known for their comedy roles - are fantastic in this drama."
Gangsta.,Ted Danson is great in the follow up.
Gangsta.,"Yeah, I think Rescue Me would have benefited from a shorter run, it was on too long.  

I also think it really lost something when Jack McGee (the captain) left a few seasons in.  I felt that in some ways, he was the heart of the show.  It's a shame, I heard that him and Leary didn't get along, hence his leaving."
Gangsta.,"I dunno. The cockfight/cockfart scene was pretty early on, and that might be one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV."
Gangsta.,\*THE RICHES!\* God I loved that show - I haven't thought about it in years!
The Mortified Guide,"I love his, the heartwarming nostalgia is so up my street it’s like it was tailor made for me. Like The Moth but specifically about awkward teenage years "
The Mortified Guide,It's like /r/blunderyears in doc form.  
The Mortified Guide,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
The Mortified Guide,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
The Mortified Guide,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
The Mortified Guide,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
The Mortified Guide,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
The Mortified Guide,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
The Mortified Guide,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
The Mortified Guide,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
The Mortified Guide,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
The Mortified Guide,"""Adulting"""
The Mortified Guide,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
The Mortified Guide,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
The Mortified Guide,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
The Mortified Guide,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
The Mortified Guide,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
The Mortified Guide,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
The Mortified Guide,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
The Mortified Guide,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
The Mortified Guide,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
The Mortified Guide,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
The Mortified Guide,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
The Mortified Guide,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
The Mortified Guide,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
The Mortified Guide,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
The Mortified Guide,as a nonactor me too.
The Mortified Guide,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
The Mortified Guide,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
The Mortified Guide,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
The Mortified Guide,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
The Mortified Guide,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
The Mortified Guide,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
The Mortified Guide,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
The Mortified Guide,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
The Mortified Guide,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
The Mortified Guide,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
The Mortified Guide,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
The Mortified Guide,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
The Mortified Guide,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
The Mortified Guide,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
The Mortified Guide,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
The Mortified Guide,This whole sub has just become ads lol
The Mortified Guide,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
The Mortified Guide,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
The Mortified Guide,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."

The Mortified Guide,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
The Mortified Guide,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
The Mortified Guide,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
The Mortified Guide,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
The Mortified Guide,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
The Mortified Guide,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
The Mortified Guide,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
The Mortified Guide,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."

The Mortified Guide,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
The Mortified Guide,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
The Mortified Guide,I’m glad someone said it.
The Mortified Guide,Coconut Head?
The Mortified Guide,Who?
The Mortified Guide,posting this and not saying the name?
The Mortified Guide,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
The Mortified Guide,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
The Mortified Guide,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
The Mortified Guide,The Internet is ads
The Mortified Guide,Always was
The Mortified Guide,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
The Mortified Guide,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
The Mortified Guide,The short lived Aliens in America too.
The Mortified Guide,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
The Mortified Guide,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
The Mortified Guide,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
The Mortified Guide,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
The Mortified Guide,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
The Mortified Guide,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
The Mortified Guide,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
The Mortified Guide,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
The Mortified Guide,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
The Mortified Guide,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads

Ads, ads, ads"
The Mortified Guide,Am..I an ad???
The Mortified Guide,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
The Mortified Guide,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
The Mortified Guide,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
The Mortified Guide,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
The Mortified Guide,ok work avenue q
The Mortified Guide,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
The Mortified Guide,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
The Mortified Guide,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.

The Mortified Guide,"Once more, the lucky sperm club succeeds."
The Mortified Guide,"They picked some weird “notable works” for a few of these.

-Spencer Grammer’s “Lifetime Christmas Movie” over her major role as Summer in Rick & Morty (or her lead role in Greek)

-Billie Lourd’s 2 second cameo in Force Awakens instead of her breakthrough role in Scream Queens and/or her showstealing role in Booksmart

-Grace Gummer being married to Mark Ronson instead of her major role in 3 out of 4 seasons of Mr. Robot."
The Mortified Guide,Did I miss it... was Jason Ritter not on there?
The Mortified Guide,This is some /r/dataisugly material. It makes it look like Billy Ray Cyrus had a baby with Dolly Parton.
Burning Ice,"The Simpsons came out in 1989 so going back now and watching is way different than being a teenager and seeing it in real time. Believe me, it was all anyone wanted to talk about. It was a fucking revelation."
Burning Ice,People are busy and there are so many choices. If it doesn't grab you fast enough you should move on.
Burning Ice,"I'm not going to tell anyone else how to or how not to watch TV, but the ""Three Episode"" rule makes a lot of sense to me in the world that has a glut of content.  I could see giving shows a longer try if we were back in the days of three networks churning out linear programming content without much competition, but that isn't how things are today.  When you have some very good series being made by streamers, and almost the entire history of Television available to binge, why would you waste time slogging through a show after three bad episodes?  You have too many other great shows you could be watching instead."
Burning Ice,My personal kind of rule of thumb is usually around five episodes before I give up on something (although I've become much less consistent with that in recent years)
Burning Ice,Welcome to the streaming and binging ERA my friend
Burning Ice,"I feel like it’s situational for each individual. Me personally, with work and my kids, My free time is pretty limited, so if a show doesn’t grab me in its first episode, I don’t feel inclined to keep giving it opportunities to win me over. There are simply other things I’d rather do."
Burning Ice,"Did I say anything wrong in the title or in the OP? Are these people already downvoting me even bothering to also read the OP and my arguments? It seems like every discussion post here, even the most harmless ones, gets downvoted to hell."
Burning Ice,Manga hxh is the ONLY perfect story I know
Burning Ice,"A lot of the shows you praise were bound to merchandise sales due to kids targeted TV networks strike deals to sell toys and what not. If a ""kids"" show with strong fanbase aren't buying merchs, they don't see it as profitable thus pulling the plug on it. 

Which has changed with the streaming networks where they actually can see the money pouring in through subscriptions and monitoring users."
Burning Ice,"If a show is in a genre I tend to love and I'm interested in the story, I'll likely stick with it.  If the show isn't something I generally would watch, I'll give it an episode to impress me.  If a show just outright offends me in the first episode, I won't bother continuing to watch it at all and will stop mid-episode.  Many shows people praise have had moments in the first episode where I've just said ""nope"" and let it be right there.   That's the beauty of knowing what you like and don't.  I'm tired of people saying to stick with a show because it gets really good in the second season or 10 episodes in or whatever.  If it's not enjoyable in the first episode at least a little then I'm not missing anything by letting it go and saving myself suffering through tripe to get to the good stuff.  Ok, yes you can point to dozens of great shows that have mediocre first seasons, but even those shows (like the US version of The Office)... I still laughed during those early episodes.  The show just got better from there.  I still enjoy every episode of Seinfeld and Newhart.

I watch shows I enjoy.  Life is short.  Focus on what you enjoy the most in tv and let the rest goes.  I don't care what is popular or if other people just hate what I'm liking.  I have no hard rule for long season traditional shows... if I like it, I'm going to pretty much enjoy the whole season... and the great shows I'm still going to rewatch every episode at whatever pace I want.  There are no rules except the ones I decide to go with.  Some shows I like to space episodes out to one a day or week... other shows I'll binge a bunch of episodes and finish the short season in a couple days."
Burning Ice,"Almost every show that starts bad never gets better. Sure, there are a very small number that buck that trend, but on the whole if the first episode is bad overwhelmingly the rest of the show is bad."
Burning Ice,"I don't doubt that, and I think people are often way too harsh on The Simpsons' first season. Same thing for a lot of great shows really, like Avatar."
Burning Ice,Yezzzir. I remember everyone at school talked mg about it after the Tracey Ullman show debut.
Burning Ice,"I get there really is too much ""content"" now to a fault. Instead of feeling pressured to watch all said ""content"", I would rather choose one thing to fully commit to, while being relaxed and not expecting a masterpiece, just a decent enjoyable flick instead.

I guess that I'm making this thread because there are so many shows, I would say most shows ever made, that take really long to become truly great, like Star Trek The Next Generation, and The Simpsons to a less drastic extent. And even then, they are inconsistent because seasons used to be far longer. There are lots of amazing old TV that I really would love for anyone to experience, like Twilight Zone.

And I feel sad whenever someone drops a show I love before it actually got great. I always say ""please, at least get to episode number x, if you can't enjoy it, then it truly is not for you"".

Also, when I say people are often too harsh on a show's first season, I mean amazing shows whose first season is clearly inferior, but still far from terrible, and yet people will often look down upon the first season, and even say it is almost unwatchable! I've seen many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar being so harsh and dismissive, calling their first season almost unwatchable even! And it's sad to see even fans acting like that."
Burning Ice,"Older television shows weren't meant to be binged. If you try to binge even the greatest old TV shows, they will come across as repetitive and inconsistent. Binging is a wrong way to watch them."
Burning Ice,"But you know that ends up being really unfair to a lot of amazing shows that take a lot longer than 3 episodes to fully find their footing. Specially older TV shows made before this streaming and binging era. The best to watch a show is to be relaxed and not rush. Watch whenever you can and feel like doing so, without a clear programming."
Burning Ice,"Is that rule for live-action shows? Live-action shows have episodes lasting one hour even, but animated shows generally have each episode lasting only 20 minutes."
Burning Ice,It's a really long winded meandering essay with a flawed premise about a basic topic and an accusatory tone. I could tell you were the kid show guy right away.
Burning Ice,"This is valid, but what show is BTAS?"
Burning Ice,Stop caring so much about downvotes. It'll make you enjoy life(and reddit) more.
Burning Ice,Don’t take it personally everything gets downvoted. You put a lot of thought into this be proud! I agree that things are judged way too harshly and pacing yourself can change entirely how you see a show
Burning Ice,"If the show has something that truly offends you in the first episode already, that's another matter. Not really the type of situation I'm talking about."
Burning Ice,"I get there really is too much ""content"" now to a fault. Instead of feeling pressured to watch all said ""content"", I would rather choose one thing to fully commit to, while being relaxed and not expecting a masterpiece, just a decent enjoyable flick instead.

Burning Ice,"I'm not saying every show deserves lots of patience, specially when you hate it. I'm mainly referring here to shows that already ended, people love them, but those shows still take a long time to get good for people watching them for the first time. That's where I'm asking patience. That's where I find so many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar way too harsh and unfair."
Burning Ice,"That’s right, I almost forgot it started as those shorts on Tracy Ullman… which was after or before Married With Children. Another classic for our age but probably outdated today."
Burning Ice,"Well, if they can't be binged, they aren't worth watching imo.  Linear TV is yestertech.  Those shows can't stand up to binging because they are fundamentally flawed, and only the flawed nature of Linear TV saved them."
Burning Ice,"> ... being really unfair to a lot of amazing shows ...

*unfair*? I am not in a relationship with them."
Burning Ice,"I don't really care.  Most shows don't get better, and it isn't my job to suffer through shows hoping they will get better.

If a show eventually does get better, I'm sure I'll hear about it from word of mouth.  If it gets cancelled, oh well, I doubt I'll miss it because there really is so much good content available now, I don't really have time for it all as it is."
Burning Ice,"Yeah, usually - I don't want a lot of animated stuff, but I'm often willing to give it more time to settle"
Burning Ice,"What is the flawed premise? Can you actually give constructive criticism? I worked hard in writing this essay, put great care and attention into it."
Burning Ice,Or ATLA?
Burning Ice,Batman - The Animated Series
Burning Ice,Thanks!
Burning Ice,"Seasons were far longer, and the constraints of time and budget were really bad. The Twilight Zone is one of the greatest TV shows of all time, many of its episodes are absolute peak TV, but you couldn't expect brilliance every episode. It could be really inconsistent because each season is over 20 episodes long, and had to be produced with insanely small budgets and time that would unthinkable nowadays. To the point that the fact that the show managed to produce so many amazing episodes under those hostile conditions of 50s and 60s TV is a testament to the genius of Rod Serling and all the show's writers."
Burning Ice,"Also, weekly watches have a special magic and attachment that gets lost when you binge a show. When you watch it weekly, it becomes part of your life for even years, and you get attached to the characters as if they were family. It becomes forever part of your life, and the there is greater hype, anticipation and speculation between episodes."
Burning Ice,"You can definitely be unfair towards a work of art, make unfair complaints, or even say total bullshit about it. 

We should always try to make life as fair as possible."
Burning Ice,"its not even about finding the footing for me.

Its like if in 3 episodes you can not get me curious about something then I am out.

Like for example with stargate,  first episode solid banter between the maincast   instantly more into the show.
full metal alchemist brotherhood sets up an intresting mystery.

all those three episodes need to do is give you a slight hook.

Hell Jujustsu kaisens main hook for a few episodes was its amation was beautiful"
Burning Ice,"I get there really is too much ""content"" now to a fault. Instead of feeling pressured to watch all said ""content"", I would rather choose one thing to fully commit to, while being relaxed and not expecting a masterpiece, just a decent enjoyable flick instead.

Burning Ice,">A masterpiece for me is not necessarily something near perfect, it's about the effect it has on me, the highs it has, how much I care, what I emotionally get out of it, that's the difference between anything being decent or a masterpiece

Your first sentence boils down to 'it's a masterpiece if I like it' which is a valid opinion but not one that promotes critical discussion. 

'people are too hard on first seasons' is just wrong. The majority of shows that start bad stay bad. You list a bunch of exceptions, but they're just that- the very few that actually got better. Most don't, and we don't have time to give every show a chance. The beginning is the most important part to get right. 

Look at how many of your wall of text paragraphs begin with *and* or *also*. It's exhausting. If you're going to post this many words, they need to be good ones. I'm not your English teacher but try a few editing passes before you post on the internet. 

You clearly have a specific, unusual taste in television and you're frustrated that nobody shares your passions. You think they're wrong for not liking the same things as you (or at least it comes off that way in your writing). And coming from an explicitly anti-critical viewpoint as per your first post, nobody has any reason to take your opinion seriously."
Burning Ice,"why would you assume people know this?
    
ATLA?"
Burning Ice,"It's a testament to the saying, ""Even a Blind Squirrel finds an acorn from time to time"".  You crank out enough episodes and a couple of them are going to be pretty good, even if you make much more bad episodes than good."
Burning Ice,"Well, glad you enjoy it.  The world of linear TV needs people to watch it since so many are fleeing to what they believe is the massively better experience of streaming."
Burning Ice,"If by fair you mean I should spend my time watching them, then no.

If you have to pay by watching time, how much are you willing to spend to be fair?"
Burning Ice,"Exactly.  If you haven't given me some reason to care about watching a 4th episode in the first three episodes, I have much better things I could be doing."
Burning Ice,"But I see many cases in which the first three episodes of a series give the viewer a hook, and yet some people will still say it doesn't, and then drop it."
Burning Ice,"As I said in my first post, I'm not going to tell you what to watch, and you should feel free to commit to anything.  

Personally, I just think instead of committing to a show, I'll just cherrypick the truly great shows that have been made across all times.  It's not my job to suffer through hundreds of hours of TV hoping it will get better, it's the job of the producers, directors, showrunners, writers and actors to figure out a way to get me interested and keep me interested."
Burning Ice,"First, I'm not a native english speaker. I'm proud of my english now in comparison to even just three years ago. My english used to be godawful, and it improved MASSIVELY.

Second, art is too subjective, and we should never be judgmental over the emotional impact something can have on another person. There is no work of art that everyone will love. If you want to get a far better written analysis of this subject, and what makes a masterpieve, I recommend this thread I made. Please, take a look. I think this is my best writing on the matter.

How do I have an unusual taste in television? I mentioned acclaimed shows. My point is that even the best shows often stumble and take a good time to find their footing. If people love something, and/or I'm really interested in it, I will commit to it, while being careful to not have high expectations, be relaxed and only expect decent enjoyment. To not be pretentious and too demanding.

Also, when I say people are often too harsh on a show's first season, I mean amazing shows whose first season is clearly inferior, but still far from terrible, and yet people will often look down upon the first season, and even say it is almost unwatchable! I've seen many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar being so harsh and dismissive. And it's sad to see even fans acting like that."
Burning Ice,Avatar The Last Airbender
Burning Ice,I should have fixed it. But the show is so popular that I thought the acronym would be easily recognized.
Burning Ice,"Have you ever watched The Twilight Zone? There were many amazing episodes, and certainly far more good ones than clunkers. It is one of the greatest shows of all time, and Rod Serling is one of the greatest writers and TV creators of all time."
Burning Ice,"Have you ever watched Twilight Zone? I won't ask anymore, but I would love an answer."
Burning Ice,"You know even streaming services are releasing episodes weekly, right? Streaming is not killing the classic weekly model release, and many TV creators, fans and writers nowadays strongly advocate for it. Disney released Wandavision weekly in Disney+, for example."
Burning Ice,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/scnd8i/classic_theatrical_cartoons_from_the_golden_age/
Burning Ice,"My point is that there are lots of truly fantastic shows that take some time to fully find their footing. In fact, I would say that almost every show does not start great right away, almost every show has a fairly rough first season.

I'm not saying you should be watching something that you are hating, that it is making you feel miserable while watching it. I don't either. I need to like something, it can't be complete trash.

Please, read this comment whose link is below, and you'll see what I mean.

Burning Ice,"its like one piece

I trusted this friend and we share allot in common media wise

but after like episode 12 I just couldnt anymore"
Burning Ice,"you forget everyone is a different person

what might hook you might not hook them
and what might hook them might bore you"
Burning Ice,"Don't worry, I don't commit to random shows. It's either really acclaimed shows, or ones that satisfy some particular niche I love. 

And I'm NOT saying you should suffer through hundreds of hours of hours for any specific show. When I ask for patience, I don't mean to that level. I mean morenlike being understanding that a first season of any show, even the best ones (hell, maybe specially the best ones) can have its flashes of brilliance, but be far inferior to what comes after, and have many bad episodes. I gave examples in the OP, like The Simpsons, Avatar, Justice League to show you what I mean.

Ultimately, do what puts less pressure and stress on you. Don't have high expectations for any show, don't have a rigorous watching schedule, just expect a decent flick, so your enjoyment of the greatest masterpieces will also be more natural, and you won't burn yourself with hype backlash (which is always unfair to a show and its fans)."
Burning Ice,"Good on you for learning a new language. I failed out of Dutch class, myself.

>Second, art is too subjective, and we should never be judgmental over the emotional impact something can have on another person.

Criticism of a work isn't judgment against the fans. You're allowed to like what you like, there's nothing wrong with that. Criticism is basically an attempt to describe *why* you did or didn't like a thing. Why did it have an emotional impact? What did the directors or actors do specifically to effect that emotion? When you've seen enough shows or movies, these things start to stand out. You'll notice when a show uses cheap tricks to spark false emotion and when they've gone much deeper to create a more genuine satisfying emotion. Like cooking, you can load up on sugar and fat to make anything taste good, but a nuanced blend of specific spices will make something far, far better. The more good food you eat, the worse sugar and fat will taste.

When something is considered unwatchable, that's only because we have seen so much *better* tv that we recognize the sugar and fat, and it tastes bad.

>How do I have an unusual taste in television? I mentioned acclaimed shows

You really like children's television."
Burning Ice,"Batman - The Animated Series from 30 years ago?!
    
i've probably seen every episode but it's crazy to think you can use an acronym for anything so dated"
Burning Ice,"Yes, it's OK.  Kind of uneven episode to episode. However, I think we're done, because I really don't care about your opinions.  Enjoy your old dead television and linear TV."
Burning Ice,"If you have to pay by watching time, how much are you willing to spend to decide if the show is for you?"
Burning Ice,"How long is each One Piece episode? And did you skip the filler?

12 episodes in animated shows are much less time than 12 episodes in a live-action ones. It's far easier to watch many episodes in an animated show"

Burning Ice,"My english can improve a lot (and my spoken english is terrible), but I'm good enough to have good natural written conversations in the internet and watch YouTube videos.

Critical analysis can be a great thing. And God knows how much I have heavily analysed and critiqued the shows I love, and why I love them, and what their debatable flaws might be too (and I'm under no delusion that what I love must perfect, perfection is ""overrated"", and that's the only time you'll ever see me using the word ""overrated""). But there is so much bullshit, destructive, prejudiced and judgmental criticism out there too (children's shows are often a victim of said criticisms, which I adressed in a recent thread called ""Adressing some of the most common unfair complaints against kids' shows""). 

https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/s7szwq/adressing_some_of_the_most_common_unfair/

And ultimately, the love for any piece of art won't ever be fully explained by logic. I really go into a lot of detail about this in the thread link I shared to you in the previous reply. I honestly think that OP is the best text I ever wrote. I'll think I might repost it someday in this subreddit.

I'll also ask one thing: do you really think that the ""almost unwatchable"" label is fair to throw at the first season of The Simpsons, the first season of Avatar, and the first season of Justice League? Because believe it or not, I've seen people being THAT overly harsh."

Burning Ice,"I apologize for my tone also, but I do think we know where each other stand, and I don't think there is much benefit in continuing the discussion."
Burning Ice,It is not an analogy. It is a question quantifying the value. And we just find out how much your fairness is worth to you.
Burning Ice,"I would rather use the word ""tastes"" rather than ""standards"". The word ""standards"" can be really judgmental.

To your point about being fair to art, i would agree that we don't need to go shout out that things are shit just because we don't like them. Something isn't bad just because I don't like it.  But at the same time I am under no obligation to like something just because others do."
Burning Ice,Thanks
Burning Ice,"I'm NOT saying you should suffer through many of hours for any show when watching said show makes you feel miserable. If I'm truly hating something, I won't invest a lot of time watching it, nothing against the show or who loves it.

When I ask for patience, I don't mean to that level. I mean more like being understanding that a first season of any show, even the best ones (hell, maybe specially the best ones) can have its flashes of brilliance, but be far inferior to what comes after, and have many bad episodes. I gave examples in the OP, like The Simpsons, Avatar, Justice League to show you what I mean.

Ultimately, do what puts less pressure and stress on you. Don't have high expectations for any show, don't have a rigorous watching schedule, just expect a decent flick, so your enjoyment of the greatest masterpieces will also be more natural, and you won't burn yourself with hype backlash (which is always unfair to a show and its fans). You are not obligated to like or disliking anything. What is more important is to be respectful and non-judgmental of others. I want a world in which art is as diverse as possible, including art that is not for me."
Burning Ice,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Burning Ice,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Burning Ice,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Burning Ice,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Burning Ice,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Burning Ice,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Burning Ice,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Burning Ice,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Burning Ice,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Burning Ice,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."
Burning Ice,"I loved DP, Welcome to Utmark, and Anna"
Burning Ice,Thanks for putting all this work into your list. Makes it much easier for me!
Burning Ice,A best tv shows of 2021 lost really isn’t complete without Succession
Burning Ice,"Check out Yellowjackets, The Shrink Next Door, Scenes from a Marriage"
Burning Ice,That Arcane isn’t on this list is really sad - but each to their own!
Burning Ice,"What the hell. I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles. Also, where's Succession?

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."
Burning Ice,"Okay, I have some specific praises to give that may make this list make a little bit more sense.

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Burning Ice,Yellowjackets?
Burning Ice,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Burning Ice,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Legion,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Legion,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Legion,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Legion,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Legion,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Legion,Why is he Sonic
Legion,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Legion,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Legion,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
Legion,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Legion,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Legion,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Legion,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Legion,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
Legion,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Legion,Never meet your heroes
Legion,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Legion,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Legion,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Legion,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Legion,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Legion,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Legion,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
Legion,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Legion,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
Legion,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Legion,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Legion,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Legion,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Legion,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Legion,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Legion,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Legion,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Legion,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Legion,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Legion,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Legion,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Legion,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Legion,Never go full John K
Legion,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Legion,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Legion,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Legion,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Legion,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Legion,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Legion,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Legion,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Legion,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Legion,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Legion,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Legion,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Legion,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Legion,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Legion,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Legion,Ah geez 😳
Legion,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Legion,100 years
Legion,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Legion,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Legion,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Legion,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Legion,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Legion,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Legion,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Legion,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Legion,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Legion,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Legion,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Legion,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Legion,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Legion,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Legion,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Legion,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Legion,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Legion,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Legion,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Legion,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Legion,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Legion,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Legion,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Legion,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Legion,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Legion,Incoming netflix docuseries
Legion,Yoga
Legion,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Legion,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Legion,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Legion,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Legion,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Legion,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Legion,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Legion,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Legion,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Legion,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Legion,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Legion,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
Legion,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Legion,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Legion,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Legion,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Imposters,Jim Carrey is the man. So funny
Imposters,"Fire Marshall Bill was one of the best things he's ever done.

It was true, unadulterated Jim Carrey.

Edit: [The episode where he's in the emergency room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rQkjBuJD-4).  
The way he falls down after cutting off his leg has me in tears laughing."
Imposters,That show was awesome. So much talent!
Imposters,"Oh look, it's Chet Hanks."
Imposters,"I always end up watching this along with [the Vanilla Ice parody he does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7kzarSwGE) on In Living Color.

Imposters,"Really wish this show was on some streaming network, would love to rewatch them all"
Imposters,That was a pretty good song though
Imposters,Snow made a great song
Imposters,Asca fan of California reggae I think snow might have been a trendsetter. Hrmmm.
Imposters,And start belting out mammy.
Imposters,"Carrey had several musical sketches on that show that were great.  He redid Bobby Brown's ""ain't no humping around"" by portraying Bill Clinton.  His Vanilla Ice remix was great too."
Imposters,Chappelle's Show and Key and Peele *both* owe the success of their shows to In Living Color being first. Shoutout Keenan Ivory Wayans.
Imposters,this is fucking wonderful
Imposters,"I watched In Living Color religiously, so many great funny people worked on that show."
Imposters,"Has In Living Color existed anywhere beyond the DVDs? It doesn’t look like it’s streaming anywhere and can’t even be purchased digitally.

I have the show downloaded, but its crazy how such an important and influential show exclusively lives on through 240p Youtube videos"
Imposters,"In Living Color especially the first 3 seasons when Keenan was in charge, literally were up there with SNL especially with how great Carrey, Damon, DAG and Foxx were as performers."
Imposters,He also shows up in Liar Liar.  Airport runway scene. He's in the crowd.  https://i.redd.it/gt3qoi36yr8z.jpg

At their best, this and MadTV were way better than SNL."

Imposters,"Wow, that was a good read."
Imposters,"I forgot all about that show. It \*was\* surprisingly good. Had enough weirdness to be interesting. Just one season, i think"
Imposters,"I really liked it. One of those shows overlooked because of the network it was on.

Also I'd marry Inbar Lavi in the full knowledge that she's going to scam me for all I'm worth. 10/10 charming in this."
Imposters,"Fun show, for sure. The chemistry among the four mains made it an enjoyable watch."
Imposters,"great show, and Inbar is irresistible"
Imposters,Great show that i never finished die to cancelation. Another victim of a tv channel exiting scripted content.
Imposters,"I really liked it too. Parker Young (Richard) was the neighbor/boyfriend jock on Suburgatory, another show that ended too early IMO"
Imposters,"Loved it. Richard and Ezra had amazing chemistry together, like real-life buddies."
Imposters,They’ve got 2 seasons on Netflix and I *think* I read that they were renewed for a 3rd.
Imposters,Truly. No wonder she duped 3 people into marrying her
Imposters,He reminds me so much of Ryan McPartlin (Captain Awesome) from Chuck
Imposters,From the first scene together they were so good
Imposters,Sadly it was canceled in 2018 and won't be coming back. A real shame.
Imposters,That’s too bad!
Imposters,Any Gene Parmesan reveal in Arrested Development.
Imposters,I'd argue the reveal at the end of Season 1 of The Good Places counts.
Imposters,"Not sure if it really counts, but battletstar Galactica, when he final cylons were revealed. 

Maybe when Dwight disguised himself as Pam…"
Imposters,agents of shield S1 (Ward)
Imposters,24 season 1 finale reveal was awesome.
Imposters,Probably the final episode of Mr. Robot. It made me want to immediately watch the entire show again from the opening scene.
Imposters,The season 5 finale of Lost.
Imposters,"My favorite is the episode of Star Trek TNG where Riker gets a double holo-fake out and ends up adopting an alien child who we never see again.

&#x200B;

**EDIT** *Future Imperfect.* It's actually a great episode, but with a fucking bizarre ending. Like , it's literally a Grey. https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Barash?file=Barash.jpg"
Imposters,"Doctor Who has had a number of very good Imposter Reveals concerning the Master, with the one in ""Utopia"" being the best."
Imposters,[deleted]
Imposters,"Star Trek Deep Space Nine. During the fifth season, they swap uniforms to a new style. A few episodes after that, some of the characters are captured by the Dominion, an enemy faction run by changelings, and taken to a prison camp. To their surprise, already at the camp they find Dr. Bashir, and he's wearing the old style uniform. Meaning that for several episodes, the Bashir we've seen has been a changeling imposter. It's a huge holy shit moment."
Imposters,"[Mitchell and Webb](https://youtu.be/kcGKNlIO2mI) \- not revealed though, it's still a mystery..."
Imposters,"When Deborah reveals herself as an FBI agent to Adriana in The Sopranos, such a good scene."
Imposters,That one episode of Scooby Doo where they pull the mask off the monster and it's really just a crook trying to scare everyone.
Imposters,"Not quite what you're looking for, but the endings of Star Trek DS9's ""In the Pale Moonlight"" and ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"" are great for their revelations."
Imposters,"An episode of the ITV Poirot series has a good one. When questioning a university student in the murder of a fellow tenant in their shared youth hostel, she mentions that she's studying the English poet Keats which Poirot then quotes. But as revealed later on, the poem he quoted was not by Keats. He was using this to test a theory he had - she's an undercover police officer investigating the hostel for diamond smuggling.

An episode of Midsomer Murders also has this as the reason a victim was killed. While watching some older films starring a famous actress who was from Midsomer, Barnaby realised there was an editing mistake in one of the movies. The actress was switched out for her sister mid-way through the movie because she was pregnant. She gave up the baby to her sister to continue her career but this was the movie that ended up making her a workd-famous star, which the non-famous sister resented since it was her performance that was so famous. The daughter found out and set out to ruin her birth mother in revenge for what se did to her adopted mother/aunt.

My favourite is from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. In the third part, they introduce a form of magical power called Stands, which are spirits which can only be seen by people who can also use Stands. Well, since Stand-users can use their powers remotely, they need to be able to suss out who the enemy even is if they want to fight, especially since the main villain hired Stand-using assassins to kill them.

First of all is when they're on a boat in the middle of the ocean with a Stand harassing them from the waters. The killer has to be a member of the crew, so Jotaro goes around with a cigarette to blow smoke in everyone's faces until he announces one of them as the enemy. As he reveals, Stand-users have an odd quirk or physical change due to their powers giving them supernatural senses where a vein pops up on their nose when they smell cigarette smoke.

His friends (all Stand-users) all reach up and touch their noses to check if it's true... and so does the ship's captain, the actual enemy.

When fighting against an enemy who really wants them dead (they killed her serial-murderer son), she sets up a fake hotel in order to lure them into a trap and calls the main character by his real name.

Jotaro then attacks her right then and there before revealing the entire gang wrote fake names in the guest book, due to how often they've been attacked by enemies while staying in hotels."
Imposters,"Eb, Zeke, Uncle Stewart, the curator Mr. Wikkles, Dr. Najib, Carl the stuntman, the magician Bluestone the Great, Mr. Magnus, Harry the Hypnotist, Mr. Creeps and his partner Mr. Crawl, Big Bob Oakly (alias The Master), Captain Haller, Professor Lane, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Karswell the bank president, and Mr. Roger Stevens the TV station manager 

...And they would've gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling kids."
Imposters,"The ending of season 4 of Greenhouse Academy showed that the main bad guy was the alternate personality of his ""apprentice"" who was earlier in disguise as one of the staff at the school. It was probably the best cliffhanger of a season I had ever seen, and then it got cancelled 😕"
Imposters,"Alias, Season 2 Finale. Jennifer Garner’s reaction is one of the all time great TV acting moments."
Imposters,When Jonathan Archer opened his mouth and revealed he wasn't fit to captain a garbage truck on Star Trek: Enterprise.  I think the episode was *Broken Bow?*

Imposters,I just didn’t like how much BSG relied and advertised for that gimmick.
Imposters,Wait?   It's me?
Imposters,"Hmm. Kinda fits. 

I'd argue the LMD episodes (especially *Self Control*) were better though. 

Man they did a lot of imposter storylines"
Imposters,[deleted]
Imposters,"When rewatching seems so obvious, you’ll wonder how you missed it the first time (or at least I did). Like Mr Robot clearly [Spoiler](#s "" isn’t real/is Elliot, when Elliot is speaking everyone else totally disregards Mr Robot, they don’t just look at Elliot they turn to face him, they totally exclude Mr Robot from the conversation. And it’s the other way round when Mr Robot speaks."")     
Also there’s that dream sequence in season one (episode 4 I think?) where Angela says to Elliot [Spoiler](#s ""”You were only born a month ago” and “you’re not the real Elliot”. ""). Seemed like just nonsense at the time…"

Imposters,The Henry Gale reveal in a season 2 was amazing as well.
Imposters,Which one was that
Imposters,"""I see you found your loophole"""
Imposters,I did it for the rock
Imposters,"What's even better was the reveal in Ade's final episode IMO.  
  
When Tony calls her to say that Chris is in the hospital after a suicide attempt... and then we see Chris, perfectly healthy, getting rid of her things.  
The final reveal in the car is also done so beautifully. Adriana fantasizing about leaving it all behind, and for a moment it seems real. The we see that she's actually sitting in the car with Silvio, who's about to ""drive her to the hospital"".  
   
""Long Term Parking"" might honestly be my favourite display of betrayal on TV, ever."

But christ all you have to do is watch like five minutes of his dickery."
Imposters,"Honestly

Honestly just watch an episode from seasons 1-3.  

I don't know how else to summarize it, just put on an episode."
Queer Eye,"Aw man, he was the perfect first. The show has its high and low points, but for a pilot, he couldn't have been a better candidate. That's really sad, hopefully they do a tribute."
Queer Eye,that’s sad to hear. I loved Tom and his redneck margaritas.
Queer Eye,That episode made me binge watch the show.
Queer Eye,"> He once dropped the iconic line, ""You can't fix ugly.""

Sad. Rest in Power 🙏🏿"
Queer Eye,"That’s sad. He was pretty much off the deep end with his far-right politics before the show and then returned to the status quo not long after, which is pretty depressing considering how open and friendly he was to the Queer Eye team. Can’t have been an easy life for him. Seemed to get a bit worse after his dad died. Poor guy."
Queer Eye,"Glad that Queer Eye became such a hit thanks to episodes like this one, but it's unfortunate that it went to such a disgusting man. Must've been difficult to shoot with him."
Queer Eye,Well shit .....
Queer Eye,"I wonder how the farmer guy in last season who was literally having alcohol withdrawals (unaddressed) during his makeover. 

Like yeah apologize to your ex we can’t fix all this byeeeee"
Queer Eye,"Meh, he was a bad person. Just protect Mama Tammy"
Queer Eye,"Aw man, he was a sweetheart. RIP."
Queer Eye,No!! He seemed like such a sweet man!
Queer Eye,"Oh, sad. He seemed cool"
Queer Eye,"I’m sad when anyone dies of course, but why do people like this guy? He was an alt right conservative weirdo. Not a cool person."
Queer Eye,This episode had me SOBBING. Rest In Peace to a kind soul 🥲
Queer Eye,Fuck Cancer
Queer Eye,"Now I read about his political beliefs ,just yuck on that aspect.
Still anyone dying of cancer is sad"
Queer Eye,We’re all wondering. Did his final outfit in the casket have a French tuck or not?
Queer Eye,"Cancer is such a scourge.. sad to hear, he seemed like a good dude."
Queer Eye,"I remember this episode as someone willing to be open to what he didn’t know. 

There was that great teachable moment when Tom asked in a gay marriage who was the husband and who was the wife. You could see the lightbulb go off through the parting clouds when they said they were both husbands. 

I don’t want to call it a seminal TV moment but I firmly believe many people learnt a lot in that exchange. Tom was open about not understanding but he was also open to learning. It was very powerful."
Queer Eye,"I enjoy Queer Eye, learned a few things from it, RIP Tom. To soon my friend."
Queer Eye,Rip great episode
Queer Eye,that is the most qualified obit headline I've ever read
Queer Eye,So why are people hating on this guy what’s the backstory?
Queer Eye,That was an amazing episode!!!
Queer Eye,Daaaaaamn ♥️
Queer Eye,Slow news day eh
Queer Eye,So much for the makeover
Queer Eye,I remember that episode
Queer Eye,The title has to be so long to explain why this guy was relevant to pop culture.
Queer Eye,"But this episode my my bitch ass cry :(

He was so happy, he really couldn't believe that he had ""something to work with"" and when they helped him see it it was genuinely incredibly touching."
Queer Eye,"He was a great first on the show.

I hope his life was good."
Queer Eye,Aww I remember him ❤️
Queer Eye,Time to rewatch 1st episode . I’m just about caught up on the rest of the series. I actually prefer the American original Queer Eye show . I do like this one as it’s growing on me
Queer Eye,Gonna go pour out a redneck margarita for my homie
Queer Eye,Who gives a shit?
Queer Eye,News?
Queer Eye,"63 is so young :(. RIP, King ❤️"
Queer Eye,Thank you Tom.
Queer Eye,"Could he go on QE and spout Fox News? Ya. They gave him a new outlook, not change who he was. It’s his ignorance with LEARNED racism. Tom made friends that day AND Tom is a product of his environment..It’s very southern."
Queer Eye,"He was really kind . Didn’t seem to know what to expect at first with the guys, but they grew on him and was very grateful for the help. He was so nice."
Queer Eye,Shit. That's a bummer. Is that show coming back?
Queer Eye,oh man… that’s so sad
Queer Eye,"Probably the only episode I watched of the full series. Hus margaritas and his jorts were the main takeaway. RIP man, you were an absolute legend"

Queer Eye,He seemed like a nice guy.  Press F.

Queer Eye,RIP Bert Kreischer
Queer Eye,rest easy
Queer Eye,"Tom was a really kind man. I met him about 20 years ago and sadly, he looked old and similar to how he looked on the show cause of his health issues. I assumed he was in his 60s then! I was so happy to see him getting some of his vibrancy back from the glow up. His big heart was always there and you were lucky to have met him.

RIP Tom. I hope you wore that hat until the end. You know the one. I wanna say you can see it briefly in the episode but it’s not the one they bought for him."
Queer Eye,I’ve only watched random segments. What are the low points? Just clients who weren’t good tv?
Queer Eye,This is so sad! I teach ESL to adults and I still use his episode in class sometimes because students always ended up falling in love with him. Sad news.
Queer Eye,Remind me what that was?  Wasn’t it like vodka and Mt. Dew?  This guy was really cool and I hope he went peacefully and surrounded by love.
Queer Eye,Oh me too - he was such a sweetheart.
Queer Eye,"I heard my girlfriend and her friend crying in the next room, assumed it was just some average reality TV, sat down and joined in, and it was a done deal from there, goddamn."
Queer Eye,I’ve never forgotten this line since I saw this episode. He verbalized what I’ve always felt about myself. This is so sad. He seemed like he had such a sweet soul.
Queer Eye,"NO. Not “rest in power”. Do not say this about this man. This is a white, alt-right dude. At best you can say “rest in peace”.

Edit for the deleted comment:

**Rest in Power is used for people who have died due to oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, transphobia…), and activists against the oppression.**"
Queer Eye,"Where’d you get the info on his politics and stuff??

But it makes sense, sometimes the environment you’re in can make it hard to leave that way of thinking for good."
Queer Eye,You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.
Queer Eye,"Holy shit, just looked at his Twitter account and yeah it’s full of dumb political takes"
Queer Eye,"Yeah they definitely “reach across the aisle” and sometimes make a genuine connection but a lot of these bumpkins probably turn around celebrate their free stuff and go back to Fox News dumpster in a week acting like they conned the gays, Netflix and Hollywood to all their friends."
Queer Eye,They might have just kept it simple and shot around issues.
Queer Eye,He was a racist arsehole. They edited him to seem nice.
Queer Eye,Apparently he wasn't. Made some offensive comments to Tan and Jonathan
Queer Eye,"People contain multitudes. He was a sad old man with confidence issues, and had them partially resolved by a group of strangers who did a good thing for him.

If anything, the fact that a bunch of liberal gay dudes from NYC can have that connection with someone so otherwise removed from their culture and values is pretty nice. It's a little oasis in the increasingly vast desert between rural and urban America.

John Cleese is off down some silly rabbit hole these days, but I'll still be absolutely gutted when he dies. I can't just write off someone as a person, not until they're *really* far gone. Some people, like Alex Jones or Mitch McConnell are actively making things worse and they have a huge net negative on the world. But there's too many random people who vote stupidly for me to hate them all carte blanche."
Queer Eye,"Because everyone would hate everyone if people know their real feelings. I would hate you if I knew some things you’ve thought about and you would hate me. 

People are people. Find an identity over politics."
Queer Eye,He truly wasn’t. If you cruise through his tweets he was racist
Queer Eye,Apparently he called Tan a terrorist.
Queer Eye,This ep made a big impression on me. They just showed him so much *love* he cried when they left! So inspiring.

Queer Eye,Mountain Dew and tequila
Queer Eye,I read the comments- I guess IRL he was quite unlovely
Queer Eye,"
Probably not.  To start with, cancer isn’t a singular entity that would require a singular cure.  Even two people with the exact same type of cancer often need completely different treatment from each other.  We’ve made great advancements in the treatment of many cancers though and continue to do so regularly."
Queer Eye,"take a step back. was this comment really necessary? the man died, and a lot of people were touched by his story and his kindness when he was on the show. those people wanted to share how affected them and crack jokes about redneck margaritas. 

sorry for the loss of the doctor in your community, but it doesn't have anything to do with this story."
Queer Eye,You’re in the television sub. People are talking about somebody who was on television. Maybe you should try a different sub
Queer Eye,"Won't make it either. Would have to have celebrity if you are an individual or small group or be part of a large group of people that passed due to some unforeseen incident to be deemed news worthy because that's what people crave.


Saw this episode, and the man was super sweet. In a world that is going south, losing this sweet man sucks."
Queer Eye,"Lol its okay to enjoy the content without essentially saying ""no homo"" just fyi"
Valor,I will say that too many cop shows villainize internal affairs. Sometimes it works depending on the story but it leaves the viewer with the impression that accountability is a negative for cops.
Valor,"We’ve got tons of Cop shows where the “good” cops routinely rough up suspects, witnesses, or their informants. The Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon, are a couple ones that emphasized the tough cop."
Valor,[deleted]
Valor,Brooklyn Nine-Nine is hugely different than what the news and history of the NYPD have portrayed it as. I definitely felt it odd they'd make a work place comedy out of them.
Valor,"There are plenty of cop shows, critically acclaimed ones which show the bad side of cops in an extremely nuanced way. Movies as well. I don’t get this sudden obsession just because it is in vogue now."
Valor,I haven’t bothered with too many cop shows other than The Shield.
Valor,Always demonizing defense attorneys for defending their clients.
Valor,"COPS has been geared toward turning the lower class against each other. “I may be a broke bastard, but at least I’m not THAT broke bastard!”"

Valor,Until you watch the wire and the shield
Valor,"I watch Bosch and every so often I wonder if I’m getting hit with propaganda.  My investment in the show are the characters and I like to think it shows the good and the bad of the police force, e.g. the Black Guardian storyline.  Overall I feel it’s close to the Wire then the stuff on CBS but sometimes I do wonder."
Valor,Just like the medical dramas have taught us to perceive medicine except they do a really shitty job with end of life and setting expectations. Add to that the omnipotence of doctors instead of showing that a lot of it is an educated guess.
Valor,"If anyone is interested this is a podcast episode of Citations Needed that delves into the history of the big uptick of cop shows in the 90s and 00s with some pretty shocking aspects

Valor,"I cant be the only one that watches Chicago PD and think that from an outside perspective its a fucked up show, right? I'd love to hear other opinions, especially if they disagree and can explain why how its a show about good cops."
Valor,"I was watching an episode of Dexter recently where IA is sort of harassing Deb because they’re trying to get information on Quinn, and even when Quinn literally confirms he’s a dirty cop, they completely villainise the IA officer. It’s super weird."
Valor,It got pretty hard to watch tv with my family after my mom was getting harassed by police. You start to notice a lot of crap like how often they fake hearing a noise in order to enter a house without a warrant.
Valor,"I have a feeling we're going to see articles like this until some time after the riots end.

But I'm personally curious, does anyone think that any of this is going to change anything in how the police are presented in these shows in the absolute slightest? Will it really lead to less of these sorts of shows being made? Should it?

Are people going to simply stop watching these shows in large numbers? Or are they just going to shrug, say their adults and can tell fictional enjoyment from reality?

And if they do, are they wrong to hold this opinion?

What's your take on it?"
Valor,I saw the donations today from tvs detectives and could not think of something that has done more to perpetuate stereotypes than procedural police dramas.
Valor,Yeah seeing Dick Wolfe firing a writer for leaning authoritarian is pretty rich considering Law & Order is what popularized the shift from shows about defense attorneys to an outright barrage of copaganda.
Valor,The actions of most police officers probably helped with that as well.
Valor,"If the protests achieves nothing apart from making Americans aware of the constant copanganda and sanitisation of police activity on TV,I would still consider it a major victory.



[Relevant - The Copaganda of Dirty Harry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF--2o71w44)"
Valor,This is probably why Hill Street Blues is so highly acclaimed.
Valor,Procedurals always depict crooked cops as loose cannons who are despised by the entire precinct and end up getting arrested by the end of the episode.  Systematic cover-ups never seem to exist in the world of cop shows.
Valor,South Park did a great episode where the town's people want the cop to enforce the law but not shoot anyone in case the criminal might later be proven innocent.
Valor,Try giving up LivePD though.
Valor,"I have no doubt that in the coming years, there’s gonna be a lot more cop shows like The Wire, and way less cop shows like NCIS or Brooklyn Nine Nine

With this social climate, audiences won’t be as willing to accept any cop shows that don’t have some type of commentary on the issue police brutality.

I’d say this BLM movement was the nail in the coffin for the traditional cop procedural, and that’s probably a good thing with how corrupt the police is in real life."
Valor,"Most recent cop shows depict both sides of the coin.  Good cops, bad cops.  It's up for us to decide if we look up to policeman and women or not.  But don't teach your kids to fear the police otherwise you are a shitty parent.  There are way more good cops just trying to make it home every night than there are bad cops."
Valor,I blame The Shield.  I love that show.
Valor,The Shield.
Valor,"Be that as it may, Bosch is still one of the greatest television shows made today."
Valor,you telling me CHiPS wasn't realistic??
Valor,"Ah yes, an article from vox, the repository of stupid.  I'll be sure to read that garbage."
Valor,YOU ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PROPAGANDA
Valor,Maybe in the US
Valor,i mid-read “valorize” as “vaporize” and was way more interested
Valor,You guys want to protest the police? Here's a great idea...don't call them when you need help.
Valor,"Agreed.

I'm not sure if its deliberate or if it just makes the storyline more interesting, but it does have a negative message.

Really they should make something akin to ""Line of Duty"" that is told from the perspective of internal affairs and all about how hard it is to convict cops and root out corruption."
Valor,Every cop show I've seen when they bring up IA it's always as some sort of antagonist.
Valor,"Internal affairs is kinda like when in fantasy or sci fi there is a ""high council"" or ""elders"" who exclusively use their power to somehow be both completely useless and a needless roadblock to the heroes."
Valor,They *do* get ostracized.
Valor,"The problem with this, and with other elements like playing fast and loose with civil liberties, is that the narrative structure of fiction allows us to know with complete certainty that these particular cops are the good guys. We see them going through their daily lives, know that their hearts and pure and virtuous, so anything they do (whether it be getting too rough with a suspect or searching somewhere without a warrant) must be in the cause of justice. Ergo, anyone who tries to prevent them from doing that is hampering the cause of justice. 

The problem, it seems, is that too many people can't separate reality from fiction, so they assume that real cops are just as pure and virtuous as the idealistic characters they see on TV. That needs to fucking stop. I watched the first season of The Rookie, and I kinda liked how it had sort of an aspirational, ""this is how cops *should* be acting"" type of tone. But at this point, I feel like that does more harm than good, because a lot of people internalize that fiction and think it accurately describes real life."
Valor,There’s a scene in Bad Boys 2 where Will and Martin break into a bad guys house and start shooting. The bad guys shoot back and ask who broke into their house. Will says “I’m the devil” and then kills them all. He never once said that he was a cop. From the bad guys perspective Will and Martin are just 2 psychopaths on a killing spree
Valor,"Well, yeah. Bad Boys and Lethal Weapon are action films. The tough, renegade cop who plays by his own rules is sort of a given due to the nature of the genre. It's why you can't really have a corrupt, racist, homophobic cop as a protagonist in an action film. The whole point is that you want to see them beat the bad guys, if they're a total piece of shit, you're not going to root for them. 

It's why films like Rampart or Pride and Glory exist. They portray cops in a negative light in a way that action films or shows can't. Crime dramas and thrillers are perfect for that kind of protagonist."
Valor,Or chokes a person out.
Valor,"Even on Blue Bloods Danny Reagan the son of the PC and the grandson of a PC regularly roughs people up, dis obey's orders, and generally does whatever he wants without any consequences. Even when he tries to get a warrant and his sister says no he just harasses the guy anyway."
Valor,No one's saying you can't eat a banana Terry
Valor,I just assumed it was a fictional precinct. Seems odd to me that they showmaker's didn't go that route.
Valor,I guess a comedy has some excuse cause its not meant to be taken seriously unlike a drama which attempts to mimic reality and often morphs people actual views on reality.
Valor,"Yeah, it’s a good show and all, but it does do some heavy lifting white washing one of the most brutal and most racist police departments in the nations history."
Valor,The NYPD as a whole is pretty constantly portrayed in a negative light in B99.  They are just good cops working in a terrible system.
Valor,Barney Miller
Valor,"Yes yes yes, I’ve enjoyed b99 but it always irked me and it’s because the subject matter doesn’t help with the realities of the job. I mean detectives solve murders violent crimes where people’s lives are disrupted. Sure cops can joke but the silliness doesn’t fit. I hope they take a sharp turn or end the show."
Valor,"The Wire was very good at showing the negative aspects, and why it's not as simple as ""why don't the good cops do something"" 
Even without outright corruption like we saw, there's still a lot of internal politics and pissing matches between people in positions of power that prevent the right thing from being done. Fuck I loved the Wire. How is it that in a show with hardened murderers and drug kingpins, Delonda and Valchek are the most infuriating characters?"
Valor,Those are niche shows. Ninety nine percent of cop shows are idolatry. From Dragnet to NCIS.
Valor,">  I don’t get this sudden obsession just because it is in vogue now.

Racial injustice is now at the forefront of the news cycle(rightfully so).

But a consequence is that a buncha phony people who never cared are riding that bandwagon to pile it on to get views."
Valor,"NYPD Blue, the Commish, Bosche, The Shield, True Detective, the Law and Orders, etc. all do a great job of showing the justice system and it's departments at various stages of awful. I think Adam 12 was the most positive cop show while also being the only one to truly make cops look like heroes all the time, even OG Swat and Dragnet had it's break down moments. But that was also a period of 2 cops to a car and beat cops walking the street."
Valor,They’re the minority and with the exception of the wire they’re all treated as isolated incidence rather than systemic.
Valor,"Go watch cbs for 3 hours on a Tuesday evening and I think that would help. They aren't showing the wire, they are showing white people heroically rescuing the world from everything from terrorists to 'looting'.

It perpetuates this fantasy of mistrust of others. Racism is a mental disorder and these police dramas are enablers.

Love you friend :)"
Valor,"Pretty much every profession has had a show based on them. There are probably way more shows about doctors than there are about police. Off the top of my head, we've got ER, Grey's Anatomy, Scrubs, the Good Doctor, etc. I'm missing a lot I'm sure."
Valor,Andy Griffith vs Barney Fife.
Valor,Blue man bad
Valor,"Agree. I watch a lot of dramas, so of course many cop ones. Hill Street Blues showed plenty  on the bad side. To even Blue Bloods today-having Danny being a detective who goes over the line all the time. Just because they show them, does not mean it's glamorizing them. They are only glamorized if you think they are good cops. Great actors, but not good cops."
Valor,"I do wonder how many people watched that thinking Vic Mackey was a hero, though.  People love rogue cops who ""play by their own rules"" way more then strait-laced, by the books types."
Valor,"You can track the growing influence of Kurt Sutter by the amount of times Vic says ""Jesus Christ!"""
Valor,Watch Southland if you haven’t yet.
Valor,"What’s weird is that show, like sons of anarchy, had them as villains in the end. At least that’s how I took them."
Valor,All Rise does a relatively decent job of showing both sides.
Valor,"Well, it’s an adversarial system by design."
Valor,Meowmeow Fuzzyface is a loose cannon!
Valor,I haven’t watched it in a few years because of how fucked up it is. The bad cops are presented as heroes.
Valor,"Well that’s because the IA officer is threatening deb iirc, also implied that the whole thing is personal"
Valor,No the media is ran by the elites they have an interest in keeping the police in its current form to protect them from us.
Valor,It’s less then 1% of all the police In the country.   So no
Valor,"Dick Wolf produces Chicago PD. Whose main character was first introduced in Fire trying to frame one of the fire fighters for a crime he didn’t commit. The police officers regularly bash suspects and they have ‘The Box’ Which is off site and they beat the shit out of suspects and it’s presented as good. 

There’s at least 2 people killed by police with no negative outcome. (I stopped watching after seeing multiple suspects beaten)

These are presented as the good guys."
Valor,That has more to do with having a code of conduct clause in his contract though.  I'm just waiting for Ryan Guzman to be let go of 9-1-1.
Valor,It's shitty to shame someone on a subject you really have no perspective on.
Valor,Yet you are part of a society... Interesting...
Valor,"You didn't like Obama when he was your president? Why didn't you leave the country?? Herpderp.

Seriously, what kind of Kindergarden-level argument is this?"
Valor,I don't. Most situations where the police are called are for nonviolent instances that can be handled by rational adults.
Valor,I just want people who do their fucking jobs without needing to lick their boot
Valor,"They treat IA like they are deliberately out to ruin cops careers and lives. 

But if you didn't do anything wrong, then they'll find out and it'll all be okay."
Valor,One of the UK's best crimes shows is about police in an anti-corruption unit - Line of Duty. Someone says the phrase 'bent coppers' at least twice an episode.
Valor,"If the show is from the perspective of police then it’s fair that the mechanism thats meant to scrutinize their every action would be seen as an antagonist. It’s up to the viewer to apply their own moral values against how each character reacts. 

It’s actually a great way to show how police forces become incredibly defensive of any scrutiny. 

Im not saying there arent shows that just glorify police, because we know there are. The creators of some shows/movies work with poloce/military to show these forces in their best light."
Valor,"Bad Boys 2 is probably the most hateful, nihilistic film in Hollywood history (not necessarily a criticism)."
Valor,It is. There's no 99th precinct.
Valor,Since when does drama have to mimic reality? GOT is a drama...
Valor,"Eh, they address things like Holt noting that his partner was only homophobic and not racist.Terry has an episode where he gets profiled. They get framed by other cops in one season. Jake goes to jail and the warden blackmails Him into helping Them. 

I think they do well* enough for a comedy. The other choice would to not do a comedy at all."
Valor,So you enjoy the show but completely dont like the entire concept
Valor,"“Chills, literal chills!” 
“Number five, he killed my brother”
“Oh my god I completely forgot about that”"
Valor,"One of the wire’s great parts: Herc and Carver. Partners. Herc becomes the stereotypical bad cop. Carver a great cop

Edit: Prez hitting Valchek and Lance Reddick’s bug eye. Still the non intentional funniest moment in the series."
Valor,[deleted]
Valor,Lester Freamon was good police and sent to the pawn shop unit for 15 years.
Valor,Just finished off S3. Man this show hits so many points that illustrate how fucked the system is that it prevents anyone from being a good cop.
Valor,B99 would be another great example.
Valor,[deleted]
Valor,"How True Detective? I love the show but doesnt really go into the police force as a whole,mostly focuses on the 2 cops.

Best I can think of is it shows how police can coverup an extra-judicial execution after Harrelson gets mad and kills flat circle guy. Even that is quite dubious cause it gives Harrelson some moral authority(he killed a child-killer) which softens the illegality of shooting a guy in handcuffs."
Valor,"Police Story, oldie but goodie-always showed the bad."
Valor,The SWAT reboot literally opens with a SWAT officer accidentally shooting an innocent black kid and promptly getting shitcanned. You then see those two characters show up throughout the show's run and see just how it affected both of them. The SWAT officer is haunted by what he did. He becomes a suicidal alcoholic.
Valor,"Not denying the presence of “heroic” shows, but they will always be there. It will be there in every single country. American TV though has still produced shows like The Wire, The Shield, Southland. Even NYPD Blue, Homicide etc took a pretty nuanced look at cops."
24: Legacy,Wow. I’m surprised anyone even remembers 24:Legacy. Everyone knew it was a joke and it bombed hard. Jack Bauer was 24 and without Kiefer there was no show.
24: Legacy,I haven’t seen the show but I enjoyed reading this essay about it. Thanks.
24: Legacy,"I think it’s interesting that you’re focusing almost exclusively on the *politics* of the show rather than treat as just a piece of storytelling or a piece of entertainment. You seem to be unwilling to digest the show as just a show, and are instead observing it through a prism of your own making.

I’ve never watched this season specifically because it did not involve Kiefer Sutherland, thus making it feel like a waste of everyone’s time. I saw all of the other seasons as they aired back in the day, and it definitely had a mix of really good and really boring seasons. By it’s very nature, the only way to think back on this show is by treating each season as totally unique and separate from the rest. BUT, taken as a whole, 24 was schlocky entertainment that helped usher a new era of television, so overall it was pretty damn cool.

I don’t even agree with a lot of the politics of the show, specifically the constant glorification of torture as being a justifiable method of interrogation. But I’m intelligent enough to understand the difference between reality and fiction. So to me it was just entertaining, campy, fun, those are the words I would use to describe it.

So it’s interesting reading your comment, and feeling like you did not perceive even one minute of it as a piece of entertainment. You only perceive it as a sort of political statement, and thus your entire criticism is centered on those politics. It’s just an interesting form of criticism, but I don’t think it is all that fair."
24: Legacy,If you say so.  24 had run its course long before Legacy was released.
24: Legacy,I think if they had managed to find some way to make legacy feel like it's own thing while in the same universe it would've worked. Also I only remember it cause I was basically forced to by roommate/fuck buddy three months ago lol
24: Legacy,If there was anything of actual entertainment value I could have looked past it. Hell a lot of action shows and movies are problematic as hell. But if they're doing what they do well I can mostly ignore while check noting it in the back of my head. This show doesn't even have the benefit of having a good story so yeah I ended up focusing on the shit that bothered me quite a bit. Also you must have had to have jumped straight to the end of this post to think I only focused on the politics of the show
24: Legacy,I never got past season four outside of this so I really couldn't tell you
24: Legacy,You missed out. Season 5 is the best season of the show.
24: Legacy,24 is nothing without Jack. 
24: Legacy,It was not good... I do not have hopes for them continuing this series as an anthology without Jack Bauer in it.  
24: Legacy,No reason without Kiefer. Plots were ridiculous but he could deliver. 
24: Legacy,whew glad i didn't invest my time in this show.
24: Legacy,Free Jack Bauer
24: Legacy,"Meanwhile, Jack Bauer's still stuck in a Russian gulag"
24: Legacy,"I don't think Jack is a *requirement*, I do think there are actors and actresses (not many) who could fill those shoes and be a commanding, badass on screen presence. The lead for 'Legacy' did NOT have that. 

However, the thing that bugged me most about 'Legacy' was it used the exact same formula as the previous 10 seasons of '24' did. That formula got cancelled even when the show had Jack, why would you bring it back? Bad guys? Middle eastern terrorists. The string puller ultra bad guy? White guy with high up government connections. etc etc etc. 

I was hoping they'd take their time to write a really good, new, inventive main plot with a bunch of refreshing twists and turns that we wouldn't see coming. They didn't do that."
24: Legacy,"I wanna see Jack Bauer, Chloe O'Brian, Tony Almeida, Kate Morgan"
24: Legacy,I guess we'll see Heath on *The Walking Dead* again after all!
24: Legacy,They should've had Yvonne Strahovski take over like they were clearly alluding to. There's still time for her to do another season.
24: Legacy,It wasn't good. 24 doesn't work without Jack Bauer. As long as there's money to be made Fox will keep trying though. 
24: Legacy,"As soon as they announced that Jack wasnt going to appear i crossed off the show.

Jack IS the show. If not Jack maybe follow Yvonne Strahovski on a mission to save Jack or somethin? I love the London season"
24: Legacy,I still don't understand Fox's logic of bringing in a new hero.  This show literally featured the only other cannon character that could do what Jack does.  Just use Tony!  Having him on a short leash because of his past would have made such a great story.  
24: Legacy,24 needs Jack Bauer. Without him it's nothing. Just let the thing die 
24: Legacy,"I didn't mind it, but I didn't find the new lead guy very compelling. I think they could find someone as interesting as Jack Bauer, but this guy isn't it."
24: Legacy,[deleted]
24: Legacy,Damn it!
24: Legacy,"Bad casting. I think 24 can live without Jack but the guy they picked was just dull and flat. Hell, he wasn't even that charismatic in Compton (The guy playing (Edit: sorry mixed up my rappers) Eazy was). 24 needs someone like a Thomas Jane type - someone older, more grizzled."
24: Legacy,"At least it didn't end on a cliffhanger. 

But.... I think that the a 24 Anthology series is what they should have done with this from the start. One story where they know there will be a definite ending. It was always a little ridiculous that Jack would wind up at the center of so many different terrorist plots. 

I just hope they give them enough of a budget to do some good action scenes, and that the writers do a better job of hiding the real time format. 24: Legacy only had a couple of memorable action scenes, and you were always keenly aware of when things would happen. In Legacy's case, most of the time the action would take place in the last 5 minutes. Then the next episode would pick up right after the action concluded."
24: Legacy,"Here's how this show would have been a hit... Instead of killing Curtis (in the stupest way ever) who was the second coolest character in the 24 series, keep him around, have him take over, boom Jack Bauer 2.0."
24: Legacy,I liked it it wasn't as good without jack but it was by no means bad
24: Legacy,"Without Jack, it's just not 24 no mo'. "
24: Legacy,"Good. The show was corny as hell, especially without Jack."
24: Legacy,just figure out a way to bring back kiefer for one episode and then have a season based around trying to rescue him and I will be happy
24: Legacy,"I gave it a chance but without Jack Bauer, no. "
24: Legacy,Wtf!?
24: Legacy,There should be legislation that allows more than one Jack Bauer per quadrant
24: Legacy,"Weird casting choice for the lead. Not because he's black, he just wasn't convincing in the slightest. Felt like someone from the Bachelor. Not surprised this is toast."
24: Legacy,"I watched 3/4 of the first episode because I happened to be bored and curious, as I had enjoyed the original, but very quickly I realized I was wasting my time.

Same thing with Designated Survivor- tho i think that is still alive- i made it through the first 3 episodes but the lack of realism killed the show for me..."
24: Legacy,"They need a crazier actor than Kiefer to pull it off. Like Mel Gibson in his heyday. Or Tom Cruise. Sam Rockwell. Someone that's all-in in the intensity. 

"
24: Legacy,"Slightly off topic, has anyone recently watched 24? I'm curious how it holds up. I have fond memories of it, but that was in the age of otherwise bad television (all procedural shows). 24 was one of the few shows that had a story that spanned an entire season at the time which made it pretty unique, but how does it hold up to modern day shows that do the same?"
24: Legacy,I thought that was what Legacy was going to be...
24: Legacy,"This could of worked.
I think they really didn't know what they were trying to do - bringing back old characters for no reason didn't help.
I'd have preferred a '24' that was dealing with smaller stakes stuff."
24: Legacy,good. this show was doomed from the start 
24: Legacy,Good.
24: Legacy,They shouldn't have made a spinoff.
24: Legacy,This show was really bad. 
24: Legacy,"They kept in too much of the stupid Soap Opera drama from the original series. That shit with the Socially stunted CTU techs and moles all over the place is seriously dated.
  
They need to cut out the political stuff, the Government agency stuff, and give it a new setting. Hell, maybe even pivot off Terrorism and do something related to crime or Cartels(only). I'm more engaged when the stakes are high for the characters rather then the city or the country anyway."
24: Legacy,"You know what they could do, leave it the fuck alone. 24 was fucking awesome, but like everything else, they let it run for too long and the last few seasons were bad. "
24: Legacy,"This is why if don't invest my time with fox shows. 
"
24: Legacy,It was awful. Bring Jack back or just leave 24 alone..
24: Legacy,"""Once we realized it was unclear that what we were beating was ever even a horse we decided it may be time to put down the bat."""
24: Legacy,No u don't sound like that at all my brother first they don't preference there comment the way you do and in a lot of instances they are too politically correct. But you can't replace kiefer with some boring black dude and that's coming from a black dude. 
24: Legacy,"I'm at the ""if you love something, let it go"" phase with 24. The end of LAD was pretty fitting. Jack, in custody for his (many) sins, smiles and accepts his fate. The fate he always knew was coming for doing illegal, crazy things, despite his good reasons. Plus, he repaid his debt to his best friend to save her."
24: Legacy,"24: Legacy was poorly written, poorly cast, and poorly acted. 

A show this bad is doomed to fail with or without Jack Bauer."
24: Legacy,Welcome back Heath
24: Legacy,"This is another one of those ""Just let it die and move on to a new idea"" situations.  "
24: Legacy,The only redeeming thing about this season was the cute terrorist girl...
24: Legacy,I'm guessing Heath will find his way back to Alexandria
24: Legacy,Fuck yeah he was damn I miss jack lol
24: Legacy,"I still think you can make a 24 series without Kiefer, it's just that you need to write your show well"
24: Legacy,"""Black Bauer"" didn't pan out? Who could have seen that coming.... >.>"
24: Legacy,Black Bauer
24: Legacy,"You know, I thought Freddie Prince Jr would take over 24. I thought he did pretty good. "
24: Legacy,"I was really enjoying this but I think that was mainly due to the fact I hadn't watched normal 24 since Season 4 so it was a bit of a nostalgia trip. 

I hadn't actually realised the series had finished, I thought it was on one of your mid season break things. "
24: Legacy,"Good news of this, we'll finally find out what happened to Heath on TWD!  

Good thing they left his character totally MIA"
24: Legacy,"No Chloe, not watch. I NEED SCHISMATICS OF THAT BUILDING NOW, AND SURE JUST SEND THE 4K HD VERSION TO MY ORIGINAL PALM PILOT.  "
24: Legacy,Where's the fucking spoiler tag for the article!!
24: Legacy,"smh, racism continues"
24: Legacy,"And here I thought he escaped, gained a secret identity, and ran for office. Short while later a terrorist attack led him to the presidency. "
24: Legacy,I thought Kate from Live Another Day would be perfect to take on the lead role. I mean they basically set up her character so she could. It's a shame that Yvonne Strahovski was busy.
24: Legacy,It's jack without Bauer?
24: Legacy,If they can't get a season with Jack Bauer I'll happily substitute the cat named Jack Bauer.
24: Legacy,He's on designated survivor.  Basically 24 but in the white house
24: Legacy,"And everytime anyone said that they were downvoted because ""YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.  YOU DON'T KNOW."". Fucking morons."
24: Legacy,I'ma disagree. The actor and his lines were such a letdown. The logic our man employed was flat out stupid. So bad script writers and bad actor delivery.
24: Legacy,kinda wanna rewatch a season now but they were son long and there's so much other good stuff out there
24: Legacy,"same here, never saw a minute of it and don't regret it after hearing how mediocre it was."
24: Legacy,"It was actually pretty funny if you could avoid being offended by the heavy handed stereotypes. My friends and I lovingly refer to The new season and it's main character as ""Black 24"""
24: Legacy,It was really bad
24: Legacy,"I was planning on watching it until I saw the trailer.  He tells his wife to hide, then she takes out the last bad guy.  Nope.  Not watching it.  Im sorry, but I just can't deal with that kind of stupidity. "
24: Legacy,With purchase of equal or lesser Jack Bauer.
24: Legacy,Isn't he in the Whitehouse these days? 
24: Legacy,Tell me more.
24: Legacy,"At this point 24 just repeats itself: I'd be fascinated to see a political thriller version of 24 where it takes elements of State of Play. Start with a murder but have it be a tightly crafted 12-13 hour investigation with mercenaries, criminals, politicians. 

or say fuck it and make a 13 hour Suicide-Squad esque season with Tony Almeida at the core for the first chapter, then segway Jack back, etc."
24: Legacy,[deleted]
24: Legacy,I hope so. He's a great pick and the character was ridiculously underutilized. 
24: Legacy,he needs to put on 20 lbs first though
24: Legacy,Chuch prequel!   But yes I agree she had the show ready to go. 
24: Legacy,"Would have been perfect, still would."
24: Legacy,"Tony is the only other character (besides curtis but they killed him) who could carry the show as the lead. And he's AMAZING. He could have been doing black ops for CTU and it would have worked with most of the same story. 

It was just stupid."
24: Legacy,Yea he was super boring but the surrounding cast was good. But they need someone you feel could literally blow your brains out at any second. 
24: Legacy,"They were risk adverse to it bombing with the reload. 

Looks like they were right to hold off. Most people who were fans of the show I know, myself included, took a pass. Just seemed like they were trading on the title and past. Could easily have called it something else and maybe could have garnered its own genre based interest."
24: Legacy,Live Another Day was 12 hours and that was great. 24 episodes a season just doesn't work anymore.
24: Legacy,Yeah because it would have been soo much better with double the amount of episodes? They already had filler so I dont know how the writers would have managed that.
24: Legacy,"Isn't it how it is for every show nowadays? If you look back at older shows like Prison Break, 24, Lost, The Shield, etc, they had like 20 episodes on average per season. 

Now, networks only want max of 12 a season. It's lame."
24: Legacy,I know right!!!!. I wanted more. It was so off when it ended.
24: Legacy,"What movie did you watch, Flava Flav was not in Straight Outta Compton and he had nothing to do with NWA"
24: Legacy,"Yeah, he really didn't have the charisma to be the lead. He would have been great as Jack Bauer's partner or even a CTU tech guy. He was actually more believable in Kong: Skull Island than in 24:Legacy.

Who should have been the lead was either Yvonne Strahovski, Carlos Bernard or even Annie Wersching (if they decided to do an asspull and say Renee 's death was staged like Tony's.) Heck, I would have loved to see Maggie Q be the lead. Her character in Designated Survivor was pretty much like Jack Bauer."
24: Legacy,"I didn't watch so I am just wondering, was the casting a case of ""well, the original hero was an older white man, so now we need a young black man"" ??"
24: Legacy,How about Benedicked Cumbersnatch?
24: Legacy,"Actually that's what I thought they were planning to do and really wish they had. Curtis was the closest character they had to Jack.  But that season just went off the rails and got worse.  I loved 24, it's still my favorite series to date but the writing was pretty terrible towards the end."
Ollie and Moon,Music is good and animation is likeable enough but definitely aimed at a younger demo.
Ollie and Moon,This is definitely going to be some kid's favorite show.
Ollie and Moon,It's literally a cartoon on the Disney Channel.
Ollie and Moon,"So was gravity falls, the owl house, amphibia, etc"
Ollie and Moon,"And like all those other shows, it'd reach a wider/better audience from the start if it debuted on streaming instead of the dying Disney Channel."
Ollie and Moon,I got some bad news for you if you think any of those shows *weren't* also aimed at a younger audience. It's fine to like kids shows as an adult but you still have to admit and acknowledge they're children's shows.
Ollie and Moon,"I don't think MG actually aired on DC, it debuted with 2 episodes on youtube and then they dumped 6 episodes on Disney plus"
Ollie and Moon,[deleted]
Ollie and Moon,"They’re aimed at multiple audiences, there’s plenty of shows that are just aimed at the younger audiences, paw patrol and stuff like that, but others are aimed at both"
Ollie and Moon,"There's a big difference between a show aimed at tweens/teens (even when it doesn't receive a higher rating from the network) and a show with the same age rating but most focused on elementary age kids.

It's not that the former isn't for kids, but the audience who will get the most enjoyment will be 10+ kids and teenagers, rather than the 6-10 folk.

Just compare shows like Hamster and Gretel or Craig of the creek (quality shows but mostly focused on whimsical shenanigans and light in narrative) to the likes of Amphibia or Steven Universe (which require more attention from the audience, to keep track of the character and story development, and have more sophisticated animated sequences and humor)."
Ollie and Moon,I think most Disney cartoons do that now of having the first episode for free on YouTube. They did that for both the ghost of Molly McGee and a big hero six
Ollie and Moon,"I'm not disagreeing with any of that. It doesn't change the fact that it's a show aimed at children. Just because it has content adults can enjoy doesn't mean the *target audience* wasn't little kids. We're talking specifically about the *target audience* here, not overall appeal. 

Y'all are so insecure whenever people point out that these shows aimed at kids are objectively intended for children, it's so weird. Just admit you like watching kids shows, it's not that big of a deal but you look so damn insecure when you sit and argue about it like this. Spongebob had adult humor too, it's still a show that was aimed at children when it was created."
Ollie and Moon,"""This is a limited series""

""Season 2 is coming""

Quelle surprise."
Ollie and Moon,Well that’s good because it just kind of ended
Ollie and Moon,“2x the most violent thing we’ve done yet! You won’t believe what is shown (offscreen)” - Disney
Ollie and Moon,"I wish they would experiment and take this next chapter to a movie. 

I liked the series but I think his story would benefit greatly in the movie format."
Ollie and Moon,"I actually liked this one, probably my third favorite of these shows over all. Oscar Isaac does an incredible job in this and I liked Lila and Khonshu as supporting characters. Just for the love of God quit cutting away from the action. Now that you've done your Jake reveal you have no excuses"
Ollie and Moon,I’m not sure why this show gets a lot of hate. I personally liked it a lot and am really happy to see another season.
Ollie and Moon,"Please don’t make it a power rangers finale again.

The most interesting episode was 5, which was completely deflated in the finale."
Ollie and Moon,More talking hippo!
Ollie and Moon,Yes finally some good news after all those cancellations
Ollie and Moon,Oscar’s performance was good but the writing was awful. It was like a CW cartoon show rather than something with logic and stakes
Ollie and Moon,As a longtime Moon Knight enjoyer: no thanks. This wasn’t what I wanted at all and didn’t come close to the comics tone or appeal.
Ollie and Moon,So we’re gonna get another season with a total of 5 minutes of Moon Knight actually doing Moon Knight stuff. Count me out of the CGI Hippo show.
Ollie and Moon,"I really enjoyed it, start to finish!"
Ollie and Moon,I hope they can get better writers and possibly directors this time around.
Ollie and Moon,What is going on with D+? Everything is just not good. Wtf..........
Ollie and Moon,"It was really boring, though, the worst show so far"
Ollie and Moon,The show stunk but Oscar issac was great. Hopefully they could actually add a few more episodes if they have to and fix the pacing.
Ollie and Moon,[Here](https://www.tiktok.com/@hayaattiaaa/video/7127721556708445445?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&q=Oscar%20Isaac&t=1659618376034)
Ollie and Moon,No thanks
Ollie and Moon,Great ! I loved S1. Oscar Isaac was fantastic in it
Ollie and Moon,It’s ok you can keep it
Ollie and Moon,Yessss! I loved the first season!
Ollie and Moon,... TOOOO HOOOOLD MEE!
Ollie and Moon,"Just leave it. It was a bad show. Same with book of Boba. Obi wan did suck but the idea of a season 2 of kenobi is hilarious to me. They've already beaten a dead horse, what's a few more kicks."
Ollie and Moon,"It was a good series with an excellent balance of action, humor, and drama"
Ollie and Moon,Best Marvel show ez clap
Ollie and Moon,I'd hoped the shows were gonna be like 1 season and then movie. Kinda like they did with Wanda..
Ollie and Moon,Will it have Moonknight in it this time?
Ollie and Moon,"I have really struggled to finish this show. It just isn't doing it for me, maybe it's the Marvel fatigue finally setting in. I made it thru 4 episodes and I just have no desire to finish it. I'm surprised it's getting a second season. 

Am I missing out by not finishing it? I've seen everything else and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by not seeing Moon Knight?"
Ollie and Moon,Steven was so annoying the whole show was unwatchable for me.
Ollie and Moon,"To everyone that’s talking shit about the show (needs better writing, directing, it’s not like the comics, etc.), I genuinely want to know how you would make this show better. How would you write the story and direct it given the chance yourself? Seriously. I don’t get why some people feel entitled to a show they personally didn’t ask for or invested in any other way other than being a “fan” of the character/comic. 

I watched the Avengers Assembled episode for Moon Knight (like a behind the making of the show) and it gave me perspective and respect for the work and effort put into, what I thought, was a good show. The directors and writers and actors are all interviewed and talk about their thoughts and reasons for what and how they did the scenes compared to the comics etc. Also Oscar Isaac’s performance was incredible."
Ollie and Moon,"eh, seems like Oscar Isaac is trolling there"
Ollie and Moon,"Cool. I mostly enjoyed it, but then I don't give a toss about comic books or Marvel in general."
Ollie and Moon,"Felt bad, like DC."
Ollie and Moon,Make it a movie.
Ollie and Moon,That’s OK.  We’re good.  Thanks.
Ollie and Moon,^Yay!!!
Ollie and Moon,It's just going to be the Batgirl and Supergirl movies edited down.

Ollie and Moon,"seeing how there were no mention in phase 6, gonna have to wait a while."
Ollie and Moon,Show was so stupid. Loved that every time something cool would happen he would black out and boom the MAIN BAD GUY IS DEAD. Thanks for that.
Ollie and Moon,What?
Ollie and Moon,Well no shit
Ollie and Moon,I’d like to see more of Jake in the (potential) next season. Excited!
Ollie and Moon,"So… I hope so. I really do. It had some of my favourite post wave 3 moments. 

But it was a tiktok where they were in Cairo. They could just be hanging out. Probably not, but temper your excitement."
Ollie and Moon,Enjoyable show but I thought the CGI was distractingly bad.
Ollie and Moon,Please don’t.  This show was an utter chore to sit through.
Ollie and Moon,YES!!!!!
Ollie and Moon,I enjoyed this at first but by the end of the season I really was just watching because I had started it.
Ollie and Moon,We have a Werewolf By Night Halloween special coming this year.  Moon Knights first appearance was in that comic. I wonder if he pops up?
Ollie and Moon,"Ooh good, more blackouts!"
Ollie and Moon,"Moon Knight ranked pretty lowly for me, so hopefully S2 is better."
Ollie and Moon,I couldn’t get into it. Everyone was just…. Unlikable.
Ollie and Moon,"I really wanted to like it and the first episode I really did but it dropped the ball for me. Especially the finale was pretty bad. Which seems to be a thing in Marvel shows. I dont think there was even one good season finale so far. 

Loki at least setup some good stuff but was ultimately matrixed with 20 minutes of monologue."
Ollie and Moon,"Isaac has said from the very beginning that it may be a limited series but further seasons were a possibility if he felt they were compelling enough. He managed to snag a good contract where he can bow out of the role after each season/movie if he wants to.


Apparently he felt it was compelling enough to continue, so it's not a limited series."
Ollie and Moon,"I am honestly surprised. Moon Knight is a cool character with lots of potential and this show was a waste of some good character work by Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke. 

The cosmology was seemingly based around convenience and while I don't require brutality in my entertainment, don't piss on my shoe and tell me it's raining - they constantly cut away from pretty much anything that wasn't big standard superhero stuff after essentially promising a Daredevil level street hero. Laila's fight with the mummy in the horror episode? Yawn. The cutaways for Jake have been well covered as well.

I expect season 2 to be a nice paycheck for everyone involved and to have a thematically interesting first episode which eventually leads to a disappointing punch out finale."
Ollie and Moon,"Yeah, and there wasn't even any penetration, it just sort of.....ended"
Ollie and Moon,"For real, it was so abrupt.

I hate that they put a key plot resolution in the post credit scene too but hey that's another thing"
Ollie and Moon,[So you kinda wanna see that stuff? Well TOO BAD!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgmOfLyFZZk&t=75s)
Ollie and Moon,I hated how they marketed this show.
Ollie and Moon,"How they did it made sense to me from a story telling perspective. Though now that we've been introduced to the alter responsible for that violence, it'll make less sense to do it again in season 2."
Ollie and Moon,Still waiting for the violence
Ollie and Moon,"""Moon knight director says season 2 will change the way we see mental health!"""
Ollie and Moon,"Honestly, *Moon Knight* is the one Disney+ show so far that really felt like it would've worked just fine as a movie.  I'd definitely be in favor of seeing him make the transition to the big screen."
Ollie and Moon,Think of it this way: you get 6 hours of Moon Knight instead of 2
Ollie and Moon,"I enjoyed those cutaways, but kind of wished they had revealed Jake with a subversion of that rather than the way they ended up doing it.

Overall I quite enjoyed Moon Knight. As someone who's grown a bit weary of the MCU over the years, I'm also sort of pleased that the last couple of D+ series (Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel) didn't have a lot of connection to pre-existing MCU lore. That stuff can be fun, but it gets a bit exhausting after a while so I think they're smart to let some things be relatively standalone. Though if I had to guess, things will end up getting more interconnected in subsequent seasons of those shows."
Ollie and Moon,">Now that you've done your Jake reveal you have no excuses

No, they can still do it. The audience might know that Jake exists, but Marc and Steven don't. The cuts will still fit narratively when Jake gets control."
Ollie and Moon,Yeah Oscar gave one of the best performances I've seen in the MCU. Marc & Steven's journey was very interesting. I wish we'd seen more of the actual character of Moon Knight.  I'd rate it a lot higher if not for that & the rushed finale.
Ollie and Moon,"Yeah, it certainly wasn’t perfect and the final episode suffered from the usual Marvel problems(could have done without the Kaiju fight as an example), but honestly I’m surprised at the amount of people who outright disliked it.

More creative than recent fare like Spider-Man: Fan-Service and certainly way more thematically distinct and deep than most of what I’ve seen from Marvel that wasn’t on Netflix.  It was pretty rough coming off the finale of the show and watching MoM, for example.

Plus fantastic performances by Hawke and Isaac.

Even as a fan of the comics, I don’t get the hate.  If you were really expecting an indie production or them to come out of the gate with violence on the level of the Apartment Complex issue…I don’t know what to tell you.

Now if S2 doesn’t improve and build off of it, then that’ll be a problem, but otherwise….honestly I thought it was a fantastic foundation for a different side of the MCU."
Ollie and Moon,"I loved the cutaways, but yeah, now that Jake’s had a formal introduction they should probably retire that device."
Ollie and Moon,the cutaways and editing actually made me dislike the show a lot but most of the other mcu shows are either so mediocre or just fall flat at the end that moon knight gets a 3rd place finish by default lol
Ollie and Moon,"I swear to god Oscar Isaac died recently. Everyone was so sad because Moon Knight was generally well received. Wtf is happening!?
I guess it was Gaspard Ulliel, but I remember seeing Oscars face all over the news. Weird AF."
Ollie and Moon,"I really liked the cut away and then cutting back to all the bodies and a confused, horrified Steven. What I wish they did was, in a later episode once we know what's going on, show a flash back to the fight we cut away from and show Mark kicking ass."
Ollie and Moon,"It felt to me like The Eternals but TV. 

&#x200B;

I am also very much not a fan of the ""We're big super powerful Gods, but we decided not to interfere, and also we're pretty useless"" trope"
Ollie and Moon,It’s a common flaw in the six episode series.
Ollie and Moon,It was a fight on the ground while the gods fought in the background. What's the issue with that?
Ollie and Moon,I've seen Power Rangers finales LEAGUES better than Moon Knight.
Ollie and Moon,"Dead ass that power rangers ending made me turn it off. Was fully expecting Rita Repulsa to come out and say ""make my monsters growwwwwwww"""
Ollie and Moon,"Completely agree. I have no idea how anyone enjoyed this one; Isaac is great, the set pieces are cool, but that’s where good ends. The writing was so bad, and the pacing was a slog to get through."
Ollie and Moon,"His performance was fine but it suffered from poor writing. 2 episodes in during a 6 episode season and he (Steven) is still like “whoa whats happening we can’t use violence against these people trying to kill us!” I get that when you have these big name actors they want something more than a standard superhero beat em up but like, moon knight has always just been a crazy dude who is out of hand violent."
Ollie and Moon,"Yup. If it wasn't for being Marvel, I think this never would have recieved the attention it got and would have been largely forgotten already."
Ollie and Moon,"I enjoyed the show (for what it was) and Ethan Hawke and Oscar Isaac were both excellent in it but yeah, I was a bit baffled at the positive reception towards the child abuse reveal for example, because the acting (aside from Isaac) and writing in those specific scenes was either totally over the top or underwhelming and made it feel contrived for me.

I did really enjoy the rest of that episode though, mainly because it was primarily Isaac and Hawke playing off each one another. I dunno if it's just because they're friends/neighbours, but they had great chemistry in their scenes.

Also *later alligator* had far better impact in [something else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)) for me lol"
Ollie and Moon,It just completely missed the mark in every way. It could have been a genuinely unique and interesting show and instead it was the Oscar Isaac is confused show
Ollie and Moon,"I liked it, they wanted to capture a Mummy-esque 90s adventure movie and it worked. 

Season 2 has a lot of potential."
Ollie and Moon,"When they make Loki and people say it's the greatest thing ever, they think that they should do just that with different characters. In reality their own good show was WandaVision and even then they flubbed the ending hard."
Ollie and Moon,seems like it’s chugging along nicely unlike a certain dumpster fire in town
Ollie and Moon,"I disagree with everything you just said, except that there shouldn’t be a second season of Obi-Wan. I agree, even though I thought it was okay (aside from the Luke episode which made me feel warm and safe inside). They need to let go of the Skywalker Sage-era SW and move towards the future, post-sequel trilogy. If/when they decide to do more “episode” movies, there should be plenty of story and canon between comics, D+ stuff, and books to call back to without it being required viewing/reading, and that should start relatively soon. Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."

Coach Snoop,"Robert was a good man. ""Look the part, be the part, motherfucker."" 

My favorite robert story is how he would help to tutor the kids. In season 4 there were a lot of child actors for the school scenes and they would always be misbehaving and fooling around. Robert would help them get focused and teach them how to act. He was a great mentor and a great actor overall. 

When I found out that he had passed a few years ago I was very sad. RIP to a great one."
Coach Snoop,Good to not eschew him

S1 premieres August 31"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Man excited about new job opportunity.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"""Generic statement about part I played once."""
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I mean that’s kinda what happens when you’re in a movie that gives almost nothing to its characters. It’s one of my least favorite parts about Rogue One. Certainly my least favorite of the newer films.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I asked my friend who his favorite character in Rogue One was.  He said Poe Dameron.  I told him that character wasn't in that movie, and that he was just proving my point that none of the characters in the movie were memorable in the slightest."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Said by every actor getting a nice fat cheque
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Felix!
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Farfetched but big hope (due to Diego Luna's outspoken obsession) that Cassian runs into Jabba on Nar Shaddaa or something.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Nobody asked for this…his character didn’t need a solo series. He wasn’t important lol
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Star Wars really needs to cool it with prequels. When we already know where is character ends up (especially because we know he's still kind of a scumbag at the beginning of Rogue One), it severely limits the character development that can happen.

The best Star Wars anything in the past 20 years was The Mandalorian because he had no set future, the opportunities were endless.

Personally, I loves that Rogue One killed off their entire main cast, because it forced it to be a one-off story, and I don't think this show will do well."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,There’s no bigger plot armor then knowing the exact fate of your main character because we’ve seen it.  Any scene involving danger will have zero suspense
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I bet it’s going to take place before Rogue One. Then he’s going to leave mid season to have the movie events happen. Then he dies as a martyr for Andor. Making the second half of the season post Rogue One for a new main character.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"this sounds like it will be shit.  Andor in the movie talked about all the horrible stuff he had to do for the rebellion.  now with a prequel they have to show it.  problem is, its disney+ and all their shows are half-baked and averse to displaying unsavory things.  so it will be him walking around talking to people and performing a few misdemeanors"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I love Rogue One and I liked Diego in it a lot, but I don’t feel like I need anything more from Andor. 

I’ll watch it at some point, but I’m feeling zero hype for now."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Watto spinoff when?
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,The character was flat and forgettable. There's nothing there to hang a hat on.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Another pointless story like Obi Wan with 0 stakes as you know how the story will end.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Honestly I'd rather watch a Star Wars spy show about some new characters that Andor might pop up as a side character in. Perhaps it might be post Episode 3 leading into Episode 7 events. It gives you real stakes since it's not a prequel series for the characters and you can do more with it.

This show has to get Andor to Rogue One and therefore there is far less tension since he's safe."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,“Yes I want to act my way into a dead end” as so many Star Wars characters are saying these days
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"He went on, "">!so many more friends to kill!<""."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,He is a gorgeous man.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Isn’t his character dead
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I hope he will get to touch Jabba’s belly this time
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Did you, Diego? Your character started as a murderer and ended partially redeemed but not really."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,This is going to blow.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"No, you didn't"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Is anyone excited for this? I felt that way about Fraiser tho back in the 90s and was proven wrong so hopefully that happens again but I doubt it..
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"This show is so unnecessary.

Spoiler alert, he dies."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,There’s an entire universe out there! Do something new!
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Rogue one was, for me, my favorite Star Wars film. Add in a spy thriller narrative and I am all in."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I find it strange when actors say things like this. He didn’t write the character, so technically he (Diego) isn’t providing anything to the character other than what was written for him."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I wasn’t particularly excited about Andor, but all the behind the scenes stuff that has come out now has bumped this up to one of my most anticipated new shows. Does anyone else feel the same?"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Holy shit can we get any articles about returning to roles without people making the same “it’s about money” joke every single time. It’s as bad as the “looks like *insert actor name*” when they release the first stills.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I can’t imagine a single thing this show could be about.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I trust this show to be better than Kenobi based solely on the fact Diego Luna rarely does turds.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Read “I like money”
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Give us Kyle Katarn back not the Great Value version.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"What the hell does that even mean? Unless he is the one writing the episodes, it really means nothing."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"""I was allowed to act for this role"" - actor"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Can’t wait for this
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,“I have so much more money to make with this forgettable character.”
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Whatever he does it all ends in a shitty pointless cash grab called Rogue One
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Time will tell. If KK combed here grimey hands through production we’ll get another mediocre series following BOBF and Obi Wan.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Name three things.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,It's the money.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Stop revisiting characters you’ve already used!!

There’s a whole universe of things to explore, but they keep rehashing the same shit. No more Obi Wan. No more Anakin. No more Leia.

Tell some original stories!"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Yea.  The lines that were written into the script
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Here's the thing, I'm pretty excited to see more inner workings of the rebellion in the tumultuous period before the death stats, how they worked with political capital among sympathizing systems and the lengths they had to go to to resist autocracy. 

What I'm not excited about is Andor himself. The single most important character development happened in Rogue One. Nothing interesting can happen to his character in this show without breaking his moment in Rogue One. And judging from the track record D+ has on honoring characters, I doubt anything good will come out of it. 

They can't even resist fucking up characters they themselves created."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Disney *really* needs to move on from anything that is even tangentially connected to the Skywalker saga, and this is coming from someone who actually liked the Kenobi show.  

Prequels aren't necessarily a bad thing just because you know the outcome of the story already (see Better Call Saul), but that's all they can do with the Skywalker stuff now, and it's getting old.  It's time for new characters, new planets and new conflicts.  Something like an anthology series would be a great place to explore some of that stuff, get their feet wet and see how the audience reacts to something new."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Well that makes... one person.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Say hello to my little friend.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Did people actually like his character? Doubt I'll watch this unless the reviews are very good.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Rogue One is the only good movie out of all the new ones. Love it
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,This show is gonna have the same stakes as Kenobi. No real consequences to the main character and the side characters are going to be the interesting ones.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"What else is he gonna say?

""I didn't really want to do it, but money talks"""
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Just once I wish an actor would be like “well they offered me a ton of money so why not?” It’s a job, not every actor in every fandom needs to be a super fan lol."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Really? Like what?
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,The trailer looks good but I have a hard time imagining what the trajectory of his character is going to be? Is this the story of him transforming from a naïve new rebel into the hardened cynic we see at the start of Rogue One? That honestly sounds pretty bleak.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Between this and House of the Dragon, it’s a good time to be alive."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,His name is cute
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,ya bsg
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"""I had so much more money to make from this role."""

Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"“More to say and do” 

After this many Disney plus shows, does anyone believe this anymore? They’re all clearly just cash vows for the teams involved. Nothing new or fresh introduced m, more of the same bland content."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Star Wars has zero momentum.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,No you didn’t you fucking chancer
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"My god reddit can be so annoying sometimes, this entire thread is repeating the same fucking joke."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"The trailer for this show actually piqued my interest more than any other D+ show trailer so far, it looks much more gritty and interesting than the usual Star Wars fare, and not in a cheap way either. Fingers crossed this one breaks the streak of meh that D+ has been stuck in for a while."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Surviving a direct hit from a Death Star laser would be a canny trick, even by Star Wars standards."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Secrets only the Rebellion knew!
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"This would be nice tho, I wish I could see him and Felicity do this roles together more. They shouldn’t kill him off and just you know, let him do job outside of main saga action. It worked with Ashoka."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Zero. Since we know when it’s set.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,No one’s ever really gone
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,The dead speak!
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"""But Diego, please! There is much more for the character to say and do!""

""No, I don't care what you offer. I, a working actor, consider this character's contribution to the story finished"""
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Gotta remember folks, once you take money for a role you’re NEVER allowed to hold an artistic or personal connection to it.

Never. 

Reddit says so."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"""And it's about family."""
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I went into *Rogue One* with no expectations except that Donnie was gonna have at least one scene of whoopin stormtrooper ass Zatoichi-style.  I was pleasantly surprised with that film!
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,">Going into andor i have no expectation at all, so maybe a good surprise ?

I mean it worked for Rogue One. Came in under the radar and ended up in contention as the best Star Wars movie. And certainly the best outside of the original trilogy, the Holiday special, and Revenge of the Sith for putting and end to the ""new"" trilogy."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Been burned by D+ too many times to be confident, but 

Tony Gilroy has great chops as a political thriller writer/director, and

this is mostly disconnected from the Skywalker Saga stuff, which gives it less fan service baggage and hopefully makes it good

so, despite it all, i’m hopeful"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"That's the best way to go in with every type of media, with zero expectations. Things became so much more enjoyable.

There is lots to say about star wars, I'm just enjoying the ride and the content. Can't all be good but they all have good things within them."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"What gave you high expectations for Kenobi?

EDIT: Downvote me all you want. It’s a genuine question."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I usually keep my expectations low, but I’m actually hype for andor. Kenobi had multiple red flags (it being delayed and reworked so many times, rando writer who knew nothing about Star Wars). Andor though seems to have all the makings of a great SW show."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I don't know if this is true but Kenobi felt geared towards fans who really liked the prequels. As someone who didn't that kind of hampered my overall enjoyment of it.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Stellan Skarsgård is in it so my hopes are already too high. Can't help it.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I dunno man, I had a fairly low expectations for Kenobi after the disaster that was Boba Fett and I still ended up disappointed."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"Kenobi was dire
By far the worst of the 3 shows so far.

I'd like to see a Gungan/sopranos mash up. it shows Jar Jar struggling to deal with his role in the rise of Darth Vader so he seeks therapy. Meanwhile he has to balance his family with the demands of his role as enforcer in that unwater city he lives in.

More Jar Jar"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,What was wrong with Kenobi? I quite liked it. I thought third sister actress was great.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Ah really? I loved Kenobi.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Kenobi stuck the landing imo.  Ending was quality
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I think since Disney purchased SW it’s important to go into all of that with ZERO expectation.

I went into Mando season 2 with such high hopes.

Same with Book of Boba.

Both let me down immensely, have zero expectations and you’ll be surprised by what you see.

I went into Obi Wan with zero expectations, even knowing Hayden was back and he was in the suit.

Obi Wan is probably my favorite Disney SW project by far.
It’s as close to the Skywalker story without feeling like fan fiction (rogue one, sequel trilogy)

By no means is Obi Wan perfect, and that’s fine.

Neither were the prequels. 

That’s probably why I love it so much. 

It meshes so well with that cringe pre OT universe George created."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"I went in with low expectations for kenobi based off of the screenwriter of the show that was announced months in advance

I seriously do not understand why people do not look at the writers to determine the quality of a show in advance…"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,I had low expectations and I was infuriated by Kenobi.
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"It has 12 episodes? I’m actually more interested knowing that, plenty of room to develop everything. A lot of the Marvel shows suffer from rushing through 6 episodes to get everything in."
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,"> ""Behind everyone that has brought change, there's a story, there's a reason. And I just love that now we have 12 episodes to tell you that story.""

This captures what I hate about Disney's approach to Star Wars. Not everything needs to have a back story,  a character can have a role in another story and be done with it. And every single time they have tried this it has been dissapointing"
Luna Petunia: Return to Amazia,Surprised that leading role gave him more to work
Altered Carbon,"i enjoyed the first season. second was okay but a step down. bummer, but i guess i'm not surprised."
Altered Carbon,"I know the show is about interchangeable bodies, and as much as I like Anthony Mackie, Joel Kinnaman is what I loved about the first season. He has that whole, dark and brooding noir thing down. Without him in season 2, I checked out after the 2nd episode."
Altered Carbon,Disappointed but not surprised. S2 was kind of all over the place.
Altered Carbon,[deleted]
Altered Carbon,This is disappointing but I'm not shocked. I thought Season 1 was fantastic and it ticked all the right boxes for me. It was unique and surprisingly fucked up. Season 2 felt like it was missing most of what made me love the show in the first place. It was like a shell of itself.
Altered Carbon,"Huh, I had blamed Mackie for how mediocre Season 2 felt but now I guess the truth was that he wasn't given much to work with to begin with as others have noted the second book wad bad. 

I think what really bothered me was that in S1 of the show, Kovacs seemed to be a pretty cold, distant and calculating guy, this weary mercenary, terrorist/soldier type who had special abilities mainly related to deduction that allowed him to solve the murder.

In S2 Kovac is presented as more of this simple minded brute with fighting skills utterly obsessed with finding his ex-GF.

It felt like a big change from who the character was in S1 and wasn't as enjoyable to watch."
Altered Carbon,"Sad but not surprised, it was pretty rough around the edges."
Altered Carbon,"Season 1 felt like cyberpunk, season 2 felt like really generic sci fi. I'd probably be disappointed if I got this news after season 1, but having seen season 2 I'm neither dissapointed or surprised. Cant imagine a season 3 going back to cyberpunk."
Altered Carbon,If they didn't spend most of their budget on getting Anthony Mackie (who did a mediocre job at best) then maybe they could have hired a competent production team.
Altered Carbon,[deleted]
Altered Carbon,The creators said they didn't know how they got approved for their budget. They said it was more then $90 Million for 1 season making it the most expensive tv show ever made by far. It was an amazing show but I don't blame Netflix for cancelling it. Im shocked with how expensive it was that we even got a season 2. I hope we get more Cyperpunk type movies/shows.
Altered Carbon,Even though it's canceled Season 1 is still worth watching. It's a self contained story and while it left some stuff open for the future it tied up the story it was telling. Joel Kinnaman's performance is worth it alone. So for anyone that hasn't seen it you can ignore the second season and that it got canceled but the first is worth it. Like a mini series.
Altered Carbon,"I'm ok with this, solid little run and worth it for the Poe."
Altered Carbon,"That’s what you get when your make Envoy corps into a bunch of fucking forest terrorists. 
Seriously, every stupid thing that show was  criticized for was there because they changed the source material."
Altered Carbon,Really sad cuz the show has so much potential to go in so many ways. Damn that sucks.
Altered Carbon,I believe the change of directors for season 2 and casting Mackie for the sleeve really hurt the show. Tbh the female sleeve in the first episode felt way more like Takeshi Kovac than Mackie ever did. I'm really sad about this cancellation
Altered Carbon,"Season 2 was so disappointing. I loved the first season. Kind of like Westworld. Great first season, long wait for second season and it was not great."
Altered Carbon,A combination of poor writing and Mackie’s bland acting really made me hate season 2.
Altered Carbon,Man that sucks. I really enjoyed both seasons but the first season felt more of its own story. Could've just kept it as a mini-series
Altered Carbon,"Man I loved season 1 too.  Imo Mackie is just really not a great actor for these kinds of series.  Needs to be more gritty and dark like how Kinnaman brought it, it felt more Marvel-Disneyish with Mackie.  Apparently he's the reason why they dropped nudity in Season 2 too.

The story felt objectively just worse in Season 2 as well."
Altered Carbon,"Season 2 was such a mess this is not surprising.  Mackie just made the character so unlikable in season 2.  I know it was not his fault and the blame rests more with the directors and writers, but damn that take on the charscter had none of the charm of season 1.  I was hopping for one more season with the asian actor who played Kovacs original body taking the lead."
Altered Carbon,A lot of fans are going to *blow their stacks*
Altered Carbon,[deleted]
Altered Carbon,Another example of an interesting concept poorly executed.
Altered Carbon,Because the second season was nowhere near as good as the first.
Altered Carbon,Season 1 was great! Season 2 was so disappointing... couldn't even get past the 2nd episode.
Altered Carbon,Well that sucks.  I liked both seasons.
Altered Carbon,2nd season was hot garbage
Altered Carbon,Santa Clarita Diet
Altered Carbon,First season started soldily. But they changed shit for no good reason. I'm content to see it cancelled.
Altered Carbon,"Netflix really needs to put someone else in charge of axing shows. They keep canceling the few halfway decent shows they have left, yet they still manage to drag along ALL their trash shows like The Order for 10 seasons. Really Netflix? Really?"
Altered Carbon,Netflix is the new Syfy.
Altered Carbon,"Too much cost, too little quality"
Altered Carbon,If they canceled it after the first season i would be mad but while first season is great second season is just boring.  Even that i would watch the third season i am not that sad for cancelation. Anthony Mackie couldn't fill the Joel Kinnaman's shoes. Instead of giving a lot of money to Mackie if they used Will Yun Lee as a lead it would be better.
Altered Carbon,Season 2 was weak in comparison to 1 but god damnit... season 1 was SOOOO GOOOOD
Altered Carbon,2nd season sucked donkey balls
Altered Carbon,"Netflix got what they wanted out of it, another title viewers will have to scroll past while they’re looking for something they actually want to watch."
Altered Carbon,Altered Carbon should have been a one and done. There wasn't much of a point continuing the story.
Altered Carbon,As expected from Anthony Mackie. Guy is cringey to watch.
Altered Carbon,"The actors in 2nd season and 2nd half of the first season we're really empty, they could not carry the shows as main actors. The only good actor in both seasons was the guy who played Poe the AI. The biggest problem with the show was trying to pass off supporting actors as main actors. Joel kinnaman was the only good Takeshi Actor that actually had the chops to be interesting and the actress for his sister was terrible."
Altered Carbon,"Season 2 was a struggle to get through, I'm not really surprised that it didn't perform well. Plus, one of the biggest elements of this story is one of its biggest problems when you take it to TV. It's hard to stay attached to a character when a new actor plays him differently every season. I really liked Joel in the role, but Mackie did very little for me and I never felt like I was really watching the same character that I had watched in the previous season.

My brother, who liked season one, didn't even get past episode 1 of season 2 because the actor swap threw him off too much."
Altered Carbon,"Great concept, weak execution- especially season 2. There's a good series in there somewhere, but this wasn't it. Unfortunately it was probably too expensive to spend another season figuring out."
Altered Carbon,"I can understand, that second season felt like I was watching a CW network show instead of the HBO feel season 1 had.

edit: Looked into it and they pulled a producer of The Flash tv series to showrun the second season. I think that bled over too much"
Altered Carbon,"Loved the first season, couldn’t make it through the second."
Altered Carbon,"I felt the first season was kind of meh but interesting enough to finish watching it.

Second season feels like a massive meh; not quite sure what's going on and I really don't care. Stopped after one and a half episodes."
Altered Carbon,And that's why I don't even start watching Netflix originals anymore.
Altered Carbon,What about incredible amount of money wasted
Altered Carbon,I hope Netflix picks this up!
Altered Carbon,"Let's go with Love, Death and Robots."
Altered Carbon,"First season, great. Second season, awful."
Altered Carbon,First season was so strong.
Altered Carbon,"I’m pretty sure this is a Netflix model- green light two seasons then cancel. I believe their algorithm says after two seasons the show gets exponentially more expensive to produce and if the viewership or work of mouth isn’t stellar they cancel.  

https://deadline.com/2019/03/netflix-tv-series-cancellations-strategy-one-day-at-a-time-1202576297/"
Altered Carbon,Couldn't get through the second season due to the casting change of Kovacs. Shame because the first season was great.
Altered Carbon,"On the one hand, I disliked most of the changes they made. On the other hand I’m getting real sick of Netflix’s “cancel it after 2 seasons, we have our subscribers now” policy."
Altered Carbon,"Not surprising, Netflix shows are either Stranger Thingd or 2 seasons."
Altered Carbon,Liked season one. Couldn’t make it past first few episodes of season two.
Altered Carbon,Second season was boring. I would have loved another season with the first actor and another cyberpunk mystery.
Altered Carbon,I really liked season 1 but season 2 was just awful in my opinion.  The story wasn't interesting and Mackie just couldn't match Kinnaman's performance from the first season.
Altered Carbon,"Many shows have a rough start, but grow into themselves throughout the first season or two. I felt S01 of AC was the other way around. Started out nice, but the end was an unbelievable mess. I gave up a few episodes into S02."
Altered Carbon,"Ah for fucks sake, fuck you netflix."
Altered Carbon,Good. Season 2 was an absolute waste of the potential that a flawed Season 1 showed.
Altered Carbon,Poe will forever be one of my favorite tv characters of all time :’)
Altered Carbon,"Fuck this shit seriously, 1st season kicked ass, 2nd meh. Whats the fucking point in getting invested in Netflix shows these days if they just cancel it when the going is getting good."
Altered Carbon,"First Season was amazing. 2nd came out so long after and was Meh, with a different actor playing the same Lead character. He did as good of a job as he could have, but it was hard to dive back into."
Altered Carbon,"Good. 

I enjoyed the first season.  S2 right off the bat put me to sleep.  Glad to see that money will be put into new endeavors."
Altered Carbon,"That's too bad.

I was hoping they could have rediscovered their mojo with a third season."
Altered Carbon,"There are some moderately similar books by Hannu Rajaniemi that would make excellent, if expensive, shows.

""The Quantum Thief"""
Altered Carbon,"Another reason to not bother starting half the shows that start on Netflix, they’re going to get canceled after 2 or 3 seasons"
Altered Carbon,"I remember when season 2 dropped I expected to open Netflix and find them advertising it in the masthead of the app. 

Nope. Even though I had watched season 1, I had to search for it to get it to appear. That’s when I knew it was over. Same thing happened with the final season of Daredevil.

Season 2 was a steep drop in quality from the first though so maybe it’s for the best. The show just lost the aesthetic and grit it had in S1."
Altered Carbon,At this point it's hard to get invested in any Netflix series. Everything gets canceled.
Altered Carbon,"This should have been a series that I loved but couldn’t make it though season 1. Still, hate to see it for the fans."
Altered Carbon,Damn this show was dope for true sci-fi nerds
Altered Carbon,"Mentions wolf dna.

Rolls eyes.

Stops watching.

Not upset at all about this cancellation."
Altered Carbon,"Loved season one, couldn’t get through season two."
Altered Carbon,"Season 1 was to me a quality HBO production, season 2 went straight to The WB style of cheese."
Altered Carbon,They did all that world building and failed to take advantage of it.
Altered Carbon,Shoulda kept the guy from first season.
Altered Carbon,"Maybe Amazon will save it, like they did with the Expanse."
Altered Carbon,Season 2 was awful so I am not surprised.
Altered Carbon,"First season: Rocky start, fantastic finish. Let's see where this goes.  
Second Season: Train Wreck. No other words are need to describe what was a jumbled mess."
Altered Carbon,Bring back The OA please.
Altered Carbon,Because the second season was pointless ?? Connect with the main character for a full season then transfer him into a new body for the second. Nope
Altered Carbon,"Anytime Kilcrest Falconer got involved I wanted to skip past it.

Doubly so for the second season."
Altered Carbon,"Fuck man, I enjoyed this show. I was bummed about Joel, even though I love Mackie, he just didn’t bring what Joel brought. I really enjoyed the concept."
Altered Carbon,God damn it noooooo
Altered Carbon,"It feels like Kovacs' personality changed completely between the first and second seasons. Season 1 was fuck you, i have my own goals. Season 2 was superman, save everyone, be a morally upright person."
Altered Carbon,Terrible Casting for the second killed it.
Altered Carbon,"Man, what the crap. I enjoyed this show a lot. S2 wasn't the best maybe. But it had built such a great world. I was definitely waiting to see what came next. Such a great concept."
Altered Carbon,The way netflix series started off so well then became oversaturated and poorer quality
Altered Carbon,I had a hard time seeing Anthony Mackie as the lead. Just wasn't a good fit.
Altered Carbon,"Second season was littered with anti masculine crap, oh ya and it sucked hard. Loved the first one"
Altered Carbon,Just like true detectives. You can’t make a magically season and pass the show on to someone else.
Altered Carbon,"After the shit heap that was season two, this does not come as a surprise. I like Mackie but u did not like how he played the character. Finishing felt like a chore, and after watching three episodes I mistakenly played an episode of season 1. I ended up watching two more. The difference in quality, worldbuilding, sets, acting, effects... it was like going from an hbo show to a syfy special."
Altered Carbon,"What a joke

Anthony Mackie was one of the worst possible casting choices for this series"
Altered Carbon,No surprise there. Season 2 was botched to shit.
Altered Carbon,"Thanks Netflix, RIP to another show I enjoyed. 

I understand the financial justifications for what they do as a company, and you know, COVID, but at the same time even pre-COVID, Netflix has this trend of starting shows and dropping them a year or two later (I understand why but I'm salty with this one)"
Altered Carbon,Loved season 1 but they shit the bed with season 2.
Altered Carbon,First season on OLED nuts
Altered Carbon,Falcon just didn’t do it for me. 1st season was great.
Altered Carbon,That's because season two was trash in comparison.
Damnation,Ah crap! I had been meaning to check this show out. It looked so good but I hadn't gotten around to watching it yet...Perhaps I should be blaming myself for this.
Damnation,"Not too surprising unfortunately. It wasn't a perfect show but it was entertaining enough and had a good, relevant message. I'd have liked to see it continue.

P.S. I wonder if USA is regretting their Mr. Robot pivot towards serious dark dramas yet. No one watched *Damnation* or *Falling Water*."
Damnation,To bad. I really liked this show.
Damnation,Damn 
Damnation,Logan Marshal Green (Creeley) cant catch a break. First Quarry now this.
Damnation,"Was hoping the Netflix deal might safe the show but it was kind of expected with those ratings.

Shame, it was an interesting story and a setting you don't see on TV all that often."
Damnation,"i had a gut feeling that it was gonna be cancelled. a very good and promising  show , i felt that it was kinda neglected like a middle child"
Damnation,"Fuck what the fuck. I was under the impression this show was doing real good. 


This show was unique with a unique setting. Fuck. "
Damnation,Never heard of it.
Damnation,"Unfortunate, but not surprising . Really liked it while it lasted though. "
Damnation,I just finished it last night.  I really struggled with the first few episodes but then it got pretty good.  I think it had decent closure.  They clearly were setting things up for a next season but that particular story had closure.   I did not care for the wife’s arc so could care less about that cliffhanger.
Damnation,[deleted]
Damnation,terrible marketing i never heard about it
Damnation,Does it end on a cliffhanger? It airs on Netflix next week in my country and I really wanted to watch it.
Damnation,"good start, but then it became just meh..."
Damnation,Tbh I'm not surprised...The moment I found out about the main story I suspected it wouldn't survive one season...They should have come up with something different.
Damnation,"Overrated, good riddance."
Damnation,"Maybe they should do a wide variety of different types of shows to appeal to a broader audience, rather than trying to convince the same people to watch every single one of their shows."
Damnation,But *The Sinner* was a big hit. 
Damnation,"Yeah I miss shows like White Collar, Monk and all those blue sky shows even though I love mr robot"
Damnation,At least Falling Water got a season two
Damnation,"Legitimately one of my favourite actors too, annoying the fuck out of me that I can't get a single multi season show with him as a lead"
Damnation,"dude's still booking lead roles in series consistently, I think he's fine"
Damnation,"Is that discount Tom Hardy, or am I thinking of someone else?"
Damnation,Netflix hasn't even aired it internationally yet. I suppose it's possible they'd be interested in acquiring domestic rights too.
Damnation,"So NBC's Universal Cable Productions will still be a co-producer despite deciding to take it off the air of an NBC channel in USA?

edit: here's how THR described its production:

>Produced in-house at Universal Cable Productions, Netflix boarded the Depression-era drama as a co-producer to help offset the costs of what USA described as an ""epic saga of the secret history of the 1930s American heartland."" The streaming giant had first-run rights for the series outside of the U.S."
Damnation,It was.
Damnation,The sinner was only a limited series
Damnation,Yeah. they could be twins. https://media.culturalist.com/media/3b91acd1ccf6ccecfd7fda4d0cdcdb8a.png
Damnation,yeah I assumed they were going to wait on this decision until they saw how it did internationally. guess not
Damnation,It was popular so it's very likely a full-blown series now. That's what happens these days.
Damnation,"Nope won't be and that's exactly why it's a big hit, told its story in the perfect way"
Damnation,"[Deadline](http://deadline.com/2017/12/golden-globes-tv-will-grace-smilf-mrs-maisel-handmaids-tale-big-little-lies-feud-sinner-1202224098/) in December:

>Of the three breakout new limited series, *Big Little Lies* and *Feud* already are working on second installments, with *BLL* likely moving to the drama series category, while USA is looking for ways to do a *Sinner* followup."
Damnation,Did you see it? Of course they'll want to keep it's name but no way they can continue with that story
Damnation,"I saw it.

Are you changing the goalposts now? Anthology series are still series. (edit: though I guess one could quibble here, nevermind) If it's even an anthology though. They may really want to keep Jessica Biel involved, which may necessitate the story continuing in some way. *Big Little Lies* is continuing their story."
Damnation,Nah I'm not changing the goal posts you said a full blown series while I would bet they wouldn't bring Biel back as a continuation with her character. Maybe they do and ruin it but I doubt it 
Damnation,"Oh man, Wednesday couldn't come sooner. "
Damnation,"""The show is a little bit tricky show to describe,"" Tost said. ""It's the Dust Bowl world. It has the feel of a Western. It has the strikebreaking. It has the religious themes. It has the pulp conspiratorial element. I've said it's one part Clint Eastwood, one part John Steinbeck, one part James Ellroy.""

--I've been intrigued by promos. But that's got me pretty excited."
Damnation,"I hope this does well, because I'm tired of seeing Logan Marshall-Green's shows get cancelled. He's awesome and The Invitation is the most under-appreciated movie of the last 20 years."
Damnation,">like a powerful collaboration between John Steinbeck and Dashiell Hammett.

I'm sold. Steinbeck's voice is as relevant as ever, and a lot more people could do with being asked to think about society like he did."
Damnation,USA has been killing it with great TV lately. The Sinner was pretty fucking solid and Mr Robot is going to go down as one of the best tv shows in history. 
Damnation,"The show is at 58 on Metacritic. This review seems to be an outlier, and I wouldn't go into the show expecting greatness."
Damnation,I think it premieres Tuesday...
Damnation,Come join the discussion in /r/DamnationTV!
Damnation,Quarry had a fantastic first season.   : (
Damnation,Come join the discussion in /r/DamnationTV!
Damnation,Come join the discussion in /r/DamnationTV!
Damnation,"Based on only four reviews, wouldn’t jump to conclusions"
Damnation,Fuck Metacritic
Damnation,Wednesday morning over here. 
Damnation,"That's what I'm saying, don't jump to conclusions. This thread is full of people getting excited about one review. I'm telling you that the average isn't great."
Damnation,I trust it more than Cleveland.com.
Damnation,hard to believe that the USA Network used to be known for its 'blue skies' programming.
Damnation,"Saw this trailer during The Sinner, looks really good. Crazy how Kanye songs fit on so many trailers."
Damnation,"Just so people know, It's on Netflix for non-Americans"
Damnation,"Man, putting ""From a Co-Executive Produce of Game of Thrones"" in this trailer made it sound desperate for legitimacy as a decent show. "
Damnation,S/O to the two album theory
Damnation,"Apparently there's a very serious debate about the merits of communism vs. capitalism going on in the YouTube comments.

Anyway, the show looks interesting. I look forward to it."
Damnation,Farcry 5 the TV Series
Damnation,Don't think it will be good show.
Damnation,Don't pretend like co-executive producers are the unsung heroes behind all great projects. 
Damnation,Marketers do that for pretty much every show and movie trailer.
Damnation,"Man this was like a month ago, what brought you here?"
Damnation,"Haha, sorry about that. I was googling to see if a subreddit for the show existed (there's one at /r/DamnationTV) because the subreddit search didn't work too well, and found this post."
Damnation,I liked the show. It actually took me a couple episodes to realize that one of the main characters was the guy on quarry. 
Damnation,"If you haven't seen the 1st season, binge it. Solid show."
Damnation,"fyi USA Network has two of the lowest-rated scripted dramas on TV right now in [*Damnation*](https://twitter.com/TVMoJoe/status/954414460805963777) and [*Falling Water*](https://twitter.com/TVMoJoe/status/954414461804101635). I kinda doubt *Damnation* is coming back, but the Netflix co-production factor is interesting. We'll see..."
Damnation,Really enjoyable show. Great characters. Cool world. Builds and builds and builds -- the last handful of episodes elevated the show into the upper ranks for me. 
Damnation,"I didn't like how they ended season 1. I was enjoying it all the way through, but for episodes 9 and 10 they scrambled to load it up with action, but characters were acting out of character, and then [spoiler](#s ""a lame cliffhanger"")."
Damnation,Can’t see his forehead bump with the hat. 
Damnation,Who was acting out of character in your view? I thought the arcs were solid. We saw both the Sheriff and Connie thawing out in previous episodes...
Damnation,Man I hope damnation gets a second season and blows up. First season was maybe my favorite premiere season of 2017. (Yes i know part of it was 2018 but still)
Damnation,"I would disagree.  I watched them both.  Godless is just more compelling and has fewer weak links (Killian Scott, the preacher, in particular was not very good).  Godless has a tighter story arc, better writing, and better acting.  It also probably had better marketing."
Damnation,"Got some bad news for ya, bud."
Damnation,http://deadline.com/2018/01/damnation-canceled-usa-network-one-season-1202269632/
Damnation,"Netflix is running it here in Japan, so they might try to get rights to produce a second season?"
Damnation,Godless was not great. I will watch this other one now cause you don't like it.
Damnation,"Godless wasn't ""great"" necessarily, but it was thoroughly enjoyable, without many hiccups.  Damnation isn't ""bad"", really, either.  I just don't think it's as good."
Damnation,"I thought it was alright. I get why people liked it so much, but westerns just aren’t my thing. My dad loved it and I thought Daniels was amazing, but I’m glad it was just a one and done. "
Damnation,"Jeff Daniels was great, but I really enjoyed Merritt Wever’s performance."
Damnation,"Mr Robot was big for USA. They have other shows, obviously, but if they get one more that's as good and successful as Mr Robot, they might do what AMC did with TWD, BrBa, and Mad Men and really make themselves relevant in quality TV. "
Damnation,Cool. I love 1930s American history. 
Damnation,"sounds like it could be pretty interesting!

Damnation,For me it's Suits and Mr. Robot. A third would really solidify that network. 
Damnation,"And the good thing about it is that USA has a built in crowd who really enjoys the ""USA shows"" so if they can retain that crowd while bringing in newer fans to the network, it could be huge for them."
Damnation,"Feel like ""Burn Notice"" was the start of quality originals for USA.. before it jumped the shark."
Damnation,Well to be fair TWD and Breaking Bad were ratings successes. Mr. Robot while critically successful is not a ratings success at this point. It averaged just over 1.3 million viewers a week with a pretty big drop off after week three going from 1.7 and 1.6 million viewers to 1.2. Suits in its fifth season on the air averaged almost a million more viewers at 2.13 million viewers on the same network. 
Damnation,"That's true. I saw a few episodes of it and it was quality stuff. But I think it was still drowned out by old show reruns and edited teen comedies, at least USA Network was. 

For me, it wasn't until Mr Robot that I thought the channel had more potential than what I had known it as for the 15 years prior. "
Damnation,"I was talking quality-wise, not just numbers. TWD has become trashy the past few seasons but there's a cult following so it'll stay on air as long as people keep buying merchandise and maybe even the comic books too. 

I imagine a lot of people ""caught up"" with Mr Robot during the off season and it's believable because it was only the first season and USA shows aren't really that well marketed. 

Now that people know about, we'll see how the second season's numbers look."
Damnation,Yeah quality wise I hear good things. It will be interesting to see where the numbers go. Breaking Bad had lowish numbers its first three seasons before finally exploding in the fourth season. Not that I'm comparing this to that though. 
Damnation,I'm in.  I give every historical drama a shot.  I'm a total sucker and it almost always pays off.  Nobody else seemed to watch Hell on Wheels or Turn and both were excellent.  
Damnation,"Hmm, I may check this out. It's been a while since I watched out any antihero genre fare. edit clarity"

Fugitive Boys,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Fugitive Boys,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Fugitive Boys,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Fugitive Boys,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Fugitive Boys,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Fugitive Boys,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Fugitive Boys,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Fugitive Boys,Yellowjackets?
Fugitive Boys,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Fugitive Boys,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Fugitive Boys,Why?
Fugitive Boys,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Fugitive Boys,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Fugitive Boys,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Fugitive Boys,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Fugitive Boys,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Fugitive Boys,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Fugitive Boys,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Fugitive Boys,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Fugitive Boys,Ted Lasso anybody?
Fugitive Boys,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Fugitive Boys,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Fugitive Boys,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Fugitive Boys,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Fugitive Boys,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Fugitive Boys,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Fugitive Boys,Nordic shows are great
Fugitive Boys,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Fugitive Boys,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Fugitive Boys,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Fugitive Boys,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Fugitive Boys,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Fugitive Boys,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Fugitive Boys,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Fugitive Boys,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
Fugitive Boys,"> black hole/space monster that functions as his heart.

Rathbone's chest monster was Thrakkazog, who was the villain of the week from this episode of the 90's animated series:

Fugitive Boys,"I don't know, what direction is justice?"
Fugitive Boys,Three yaks and a dog?
Fugitive Boys,Susan?
Fugitive Boys,Laxative Log?
Fugitive Boys,This is their 31 Days of Oscar schedule and looks like  there’s no overall theme this year but the 4 movies starting at 8ish are “versus” each other so the 8ish movie and the 10ish movie have a theme and so do the Midnight-ish and 2ish movies.

Fugitive Boys,By far 
Fugitive Boys,Even without the breaking bad finale
Fugitive Boys,Biggest in terms of quality or quantity?
Fugitive Boys,"OK Go wrote a song tribute to you guys, loved it. "
Fugitive Boys,"/r/ChicagoFireTV, /r/NBCChicagoFire, and /r/ChicagoFireNBC also exist. If someone wants to run a subreddit for the show, they should message the mods of whichever subreddit they want and ask to be added as a mod (or use /r/redditrequest to get the subreddit), and then [redirect](http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/rpk40/how_do_i_redirect_a_subreddit_to_another_one/) the other two subreddits to the proper subreddit. (To actually ""redirect"" subreddits that way, they'd need to be a mod in those subreddits; if you can't make that happen, a single link to the active subreddit usually works.)

And then, assuming that subreddit stays active, one could message the mods of /r/chicagofire and ask them to link to the subreddit at the top of the sidebar to prevent confusion."
Fugitive Boys,"Yep. It's back :D

It's on Hulu if you missed it."
Fugitive Boys,No SNL?
Fugitive Boys,"3rd generation restauranteur?

I love Bob's Burger's but I never knew this was part of his back-story.

I hope they explore the restaurant's past in some episodes."
Fugitive Boys,The content of /r/HelloLadies does not seem to be particuarly related to the show (despite the subreddit title).
Fugitive Boys,Very true. I actually just started Breaking Bad. Since it will be over this weekend I won't have to wait week to week.
Fugitive Boys,So far? Both.
Fugitive Boys,Fixed 
Fugitive Boys,"good and bad thing, good because week gaps between episodes suck. bad because you are going to have to be very careful about spoilers"
Fugitive Boys,You might want to [reddit-request](/r/redditrequest) /r/HelloLadies and [redirect](http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/rpk40/how_do_i_redirect_a_subreddit_to_another_one/) it to your new subreddit (/r/HelloLadiesTV).
Fugitive Boys,"Totally, I haven't started GoT either and I have successfully avoided spoilers so far which seems kind of impossible with me being on the internet."
Love and Lies,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Love and Lies,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Love and Lies,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Love and Lies,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Love and Lies,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Love and Lies,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Love and Lies,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Love and Lies,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Love and Lies,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Love and Lies,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Love and Lies,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Love and Lies,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Love and Lies,Travelers is a good time travel show
Love and Lies,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Love and Lies,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Love and Lies,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Love and Lies,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Love and Lies,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Love and Lies,Love this show so much.
Love and Lies,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Love and Lies,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Love and Lies,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Love and Lies,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Love and Lies,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Love and Lies,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Love and Lies,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Love and Lies,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Love and Lies,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Love and Lies,"great show
always recommend it"
Love and Lies,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Love and Lies,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Love and Lies,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Love and Lies,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Love and Lies,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Love and Lies,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Love and Lies,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Love and Lies,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Love and Lies,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Love and Lies,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Love and Lies,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Love and Lies,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Love and Lies,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Love and Lies,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Love and Lies,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Love and Lies,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Love and Lies,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Love and Lies,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Love and Lies,Someone must have never seen futurama
Love and Lies,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Love and Lies,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Love and Lies,I think Dark has something to say about this
Love and Lies,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Love and Lies,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Love and Lies,Good summer binge show
Love and Lies,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Love and Lies,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Love and Lies,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Love and Lies,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Love and Lies,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Love and Lies,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Love and Lies,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Love and Lies,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Love and Lies,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Love and Lies,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Love and Lies,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Love and Lies,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Love and Lies,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Love and Lies,Very nice
Love and Lies,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Love and Lies,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Love and Lies,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Love and Lies,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Love and Lies,Dude spoiler!
Love and Lies,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Love and Lies,Upgrade!
Love and Lies,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Love and Lies,Shame about *The Rig*.
Love and Lies,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Love and Lies,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Love and Lies,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Love and Lies,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Love and Lies,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Love and Lies,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
Love and Lies,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Love and Lies,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Love and Lies,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Love and Lies,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Love and Lies,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
Love and Lies,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
Love and Lies,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
Love and Lies,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
Love and Lies,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
Love and Lies,Legion comes to mind.
Love and Lies,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Big Little Lies is fantastic and my favorite show this year. There is just nothing bad I can say about it. Great show from start to finish.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I find _Sneaky Pete_ above Good/Enjoyable.

List is also missing one series that I really liked, _GLOW_. It's not astonishingly good, but it can make the cut into Good/Enjoyable."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I can't figure out of Patriot is actually good or just part of a stealth marketing campaign. It never seems to be on any lists outside of reddit.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I liked that show ""Downward dog"", it's already been canceled tho. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I adore Patriot. The writing is extremely tight, with subtle but impactful character development, intertwining storylines, and excellent set up and pay off. The unusual combination of drama and off-kilter humor felt surprisingly compelling and genuine, thanks in large part to the cast's great performances across the board. In addition to the purposeful and visually interesting camerawork and style, there's also some pretty spectacular scene choreography, such as in the long, single-take rock-paper-scissors game and pipe sequence.

I could see the show having a similar viewership trajectory to Breaking Bad, in which it slowly builds up steam for the first few seasons through acclaim from its small fanbase before reaching critical mass and becoming a hit."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I am in the middle of episode 8 of Gypsy, and I cannot wait for this piece of shit series to end. I wouldn't rank it as the absolute worst series I've seen this year, but it's near the bottom."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I thought The Good Fight was really good. CBS obviously did to make it their first series on their new streaming site. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"While I can understand leaving it off the list, ""Brockmire"" has an undeniable charm, although I find its uneven tone to be a bit hard to handle. I am glad it was renewed as I think it has legs."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"i love the mick. anyone expecting kaitlin olson to create a ""just like IASIP"" show is gonna be disappointed. but the mick is hilarious on its own, and the actors who play the kids are amazing. i've rewatched the episode about [sully the clown/ben's birthday party](https://giphy.com/gifs/26xBxo80vzmY4xigw/html5) multiple times. "

Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"**TL;DR** - in case it's too lengthy (well, it obviously is lol) or you didn't understand the layout. Here's a ranking of the 25 new shows (that I've seen) of 2017 so far. 

1. Legion - (Outstanding; best new show)
2. Big Little Lies
3. The Handmaid's Tale
4. American Gods
5. Patriot
6. Harlots
7. Z: The Beginning of Everything - (Good)
8. The Mick
9. Sneaky Pete
10. FEUD
11. The White Princess
12. Three Girls
13. Dear White People
14. G.L.O.W. - (not listed; Good)
15. A Series of Unfortunate Events
16. Dimension 404
17. Santa Clarita Diet
18. Crashing
19. Born to Kill
20. Taboo - (Overrated)
21. 13 Reasons Why
22. Marvel's Iron Fist - (Underwhelming)
23. Girlboss
24. I Love Dick
25. Anne
26. Gypsy - (not listed; Underwhelming)
27. Guerrilla "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I completely disagree on Taboo. It was by far my favorite show of the year. The script, acting, plot, production value and directing is amazing. I don't think it moved slow at all but I guess I understand why others do.








I would switch Taboo and Legion. Legion was great film making and the visuals/tones were really cool and innovative but the plot was lacking and the last episode especially was pretty underwhelming. 



Also, no thoughts on the leftovers and BCS?"
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I would add a category of ""shows that showed promise but were killed after their first season"" and put Emerald City in there. It's a bizarre reimagining of the Oz story with the delirious visuals characteristic of Tarsem Singh's work. 

Unfortunately, I think that they missed the right tone for the Wizard (even though he is Vincent D'Onofrio) and *specially* for Dorothy, who is that kind of protagonist that we couldn't care less for."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Twin Peaks? 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"You should check out The Son on AMC.  My favorite new show of the year, by far."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Two comedies I really enjoyed that premiered this year on NBC: Trial & Error and Great News.  I'd put them in the Good/Enjoyable category, they aren't part of the greats quite yet, but they both found their comedic voices and rhythms pretty quickly and have casts with great chemistry.  I'm really looking forward to seeing their second seasons."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I would take 13 Reasons Why out of the overrated category and put Legion there. I don't think people were making 13 Reasons Why to be anything special but just really showed affection for some characters like Clay, Jeff while detesting some other characters. Legion however I see as wasted potential, it has to have some of the most under-developed characters I've seen(I hardly ever notice things like this) and super weak world building. 

I'm going to stop criticising Legion at this point because I still have  3 episodes left but based on what I've seen I think it's vastly overrated, especially on this sub."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"American Gods is definitely in the overhyped category to me.
It looks nice but is absolutely boring to watch for me."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Great description on American Gods. Loved the book and was pretty skeptical about it being adapted to a TV show. It ended up having fairly obvious small problems as you described, but very enjoyable still. Excited to see where they take it now."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,[deleted]
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Thanks for this list! Ahaha it used to be in like 2009 there were maybe 4 or 5 *good* shows to keep up with, now I have to be picky even with the cream of the crop, so this is very useful.

One question about Legion, is there anything else I have to watch before this? Do I have to be super familiar with other Marvel shows and movies? I've seen a few of the X-Men movies, and Logan, and I haven't really kept up with Marvel since the Avengers."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I disagree with the negatives for The Handmaid's Tale about the flashbacks and modernization - that personally really made it feel real to my wife and I. 

[spoiler](#s ""The scene where the first shots are fired too, was one of the best and scariest scenes of innocent civilians being attacked that I've ever, *ever* seen. It was terrifying and felt real despite the slow motion effect. I think a lot of that content is vitally important to what happens in the present of the storyline, and they do a good job of setting up the flashbacks."") 

Offred is an unreliable narrator, and so are the others, but you can genuinely feel their anguish when you compare their current lives to their previous lives, and contrast both to their time at the Red Centre."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I feel like both *Legion* and *American Gods* are overrated. Both are good shows, but they both have glaring issues. 

EDIT: I pressed send too quickly :/

I have more issues with American Gods overall so i'll start there. I read the books, and upon learning that it was going to be adapted into a series I immediately wondered how they were going to make Shadow compelling. He's fine in a book format, but even then he was kind of just....there. Luckily, the show instilled some life into him. But, the actor wasn't good at expressing it. He was decent but he was so clearly out of his depth compared to everyone else it was hard to watch at times. Also, the decsion to instill some life in Shadow backfires in that he just looks past way too many weird things without seriously questioning them. With book Shadow, he's so blase that it's easily forgiven. It's not the same for his TV counterpart. 

I also hated how slow the plot moved. I didn't know how they were adapting the books when the series started. I assumed this would either be a 2-3 season adaptation of 8 episodes, or they were going to expand a lot. I guess we got something somewhere in the middle, but even then the plot moved excruciatingly slow. Ironically enough, however, my two favorite episodes were the stand alone ones :/ Oh, and something has to be done about that damn music. I literally muted my TV during that Vulcan episode because the music was so obnoxious. 

As for Legion, I don't remember as much about it since it's been a few months since i've watched an episode. I do remember thinking the plot moved slow for the sake of moving slow though. They stretched out the mystery farther than they had to and it only served to annoy me. Tying in with that, the whole thing was a blue ball. The slow moving plot was one thing, but we NEVER got to REALLY see the extent of Davids powers. When it seemed like we might get the chance it's either not as big as the tension and buildup suggest or it's avoided or masked in some way. I also thought the show went so far with the quirkiness and unconventional style that it ended up coming off as pretentious at times. Oh, and that was probably the most anti-climatic ending coupled with a infuriating cliffhanger i've ever seen.  "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Really great list. Gonig to give Legion a try as I'd completely written it off.

You should take a look at SS-GB. Fantastic 5 part mini-series.

It's a look at the world if Germany/Japan won WW2. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Legion - gave up after 3 episodes because the deliberate weirdness and obfuscation made it a chore to watch.  
  
American Gods - quit after the pilot episode because I had no idea what the hell was going on and frankly, didn't care at all.  
  
Crashing - it's better than just OK"
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I just can't believe someone thinks Anne is uninteresting and irritating. A better explanation is that maybe you don't get the story or you don't like it. If you watch, it has an amazing story, acting, writing and directing. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Master of None???
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Taboo is a lot better than ""overrated"" and Legion was let down by Noah Hawley getting carried away with himself (the 6th episode in particular was appalling)."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I would add Master of None S2 to Outstanding. Found S1 to be very good and S2 tops that like a mother fucker!

edit: Aah, just saw the 'new' shows part but I am gonna leave this anyway."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"And the **13 Reasons Why** bashing continues on this sub. Over-rated? That certainly isn't true here. 

And yes, the series definitely has Perks of Being a Wallflower beats but let's not pretend that's a perfect movie either. Changing the writer would not necessarily be an improvement. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Your list doesn't include Powerless, the single worst sitcom of all time."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I'm glad to see *Dimension 404* mentioned, because that's how I felt about it, too.  I thought the ""Bob"" episode was exceptional, though.  It had Tom Noonan and Megan Mullally who are always awesome, but I thought Constance Wu knocked it out of the park.  

Before that episode I only really knew her from *Parallels*.  I really liked the character she played in that, mainly because I thought it was a very cool concept.  Now I think I also liked her in it because she's really that good."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Agree on Taboo being disappointing. It took me almost two months to watch the whole thing, even though I started over halfway through its run. It was like every time the show was gaining momentum, it petered out and went off exploring something else. Hardy was great and I liked how dirty and depraved London looked, but it all became a bit ridiculous and convoluted by the end. A more personal narrative would have been more compelling, in my opinion. It was too spread out and none of the threads amounted to much. I just kind of shrugged my shoulders after the finale and wondered what the point was."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"American Gods should be on the good section, so does patriot and completely agree with Taboo, the best thing about is the acting which is most carried by Hardy."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Big Little Lies and The Handmaid's Tale are my fav tv shows this year so far.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Having never watched Always Sunny, I loved The Mick and want to see Kaitlin Olson play a crime boss/evil mastermind in a movie.  I just imagine those eyes staring at a goon/good guy as they killed horribly, I think she would be great as an evil genius, etc."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"over the holiday i just binged season 1 of a bravo show called 'imposters' - clever, enjoyable in the 'guilty pleasure' category, though smarter than that moniker implies.  very much looking forward to season 2."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I agree with your list with the exception of taboo. Iron fist, you are right worst of the Marvel-Netflix. And I binge-watched Big Little Lies, such a nice show, thank you hahaa :)"
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"This is a very strong list, and I personally agree with almost everything. I'd put Dear White People in my Top 10 and Big Little Lies as my #1 (haven't seen Legion).

But I cannot cosign the inclusion of Dimension 404. It felt like a very bad Nickelodeon version of Black Mirror, I only got halfway through the 3rd episode before I had to stop."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"If you read the book The Handmaids Tale show is atrocious. 

The changes they made completely take away from the themes of the show. 

Girlboss was atrocious too. The main actress is disgustingly annoying. 

13 reasons why was very good for a teen drama show. Good acting. Good story. It's also for the most part the most realistic portrayal of high school. And compared to shows like riverdale the actors look high school ish."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,[deleted]
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Legion and The Handmaids Tale outstanding? Legion was a mess and The Handmaids Tale seemed like chapter 1 (the boring chapter) of a long book.

Sure, The Handmaids Tale explores an interesting setting but that's about it. Where's chapter 2 where she actually attempts to escape?

To me best shows from the list so far are:

1. Dear White People

2. American Gods

3. Taboo

Though haven't seen a bunch of them."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Big little lies is half desperate housewives and half   lifetime movie
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,The Leftovers. Vastly overrated.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Iron fist is better than half these shows. Haters gonna hate
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I wrote it off as not my thing, but that description sounded better than I expected."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Nicole Kidman: The Tom Cruise Years was apparently a rejected title for the show
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I didn't think it was interesting enough. Like not a lot of drama or mystery. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I binged GLOW all in one day. It was charming and hilarious. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"God damn GLOW was fabulous, hopefully a s2?"
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Its just not a great list overall. American Gods was a really fun book, but the series was kind of a disappointment. 

GLOW on the other hand, was a surprisingly good show. I also think The Mick might deserve to be ranked higher."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Please just watch it. It's just as good as you've heard. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,It's fucking great.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I loved it, but as soon as I finished it I thought ""Crap, I have no one to talk about this with and the fact that it's on Amazon means that very few people are going to see it"".

I also think that it's one of those shows which might turn a lot of people off with its quirks. It reminds me of Wes Anderson, in a way, and while I love Wes Anderson I get why other people might not."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Amazon's shows don't seem to be well-known. I bet there's a sizable proportion of Prime subscribers who don't realize they have access to some good TV.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,It's legitimately good especially if you like dark awkward comedy. As the OP described it's kinda like Fargo meets a spy drama. Completely ridiculous but super entertaining. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I think it's pretty good. It's definitely not for everyone though. It sucks that it's getting swept under the rug. It just isn't flashy and doesn't have big stars to grab people's attention and with quality shows coming out the woodwork something isn't going to get the love it probably should.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Same.  I avoided it for awhile as I thought it would be a dumb comedy but it was amazing!  I binged the entire series in a few days and was sad to find out it ended on a cliffhanger.  Hoping season 2 comes out soon.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,binged watched it yesterday. I even made a post about how bad it is lol. I had to force myself through those last couple episodes.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I thought it started out promising but it soon became clear that the faults of the early episodes would just get worse, not better with time. So many characters and stories devolved into caricatures. They basically take stories and characters that seem to be designed to fit in their previous comedy Braindead and planted them in a drama setting that takes itself way too seriously for what it is. It just doesn't work."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,it's left off the list because I didn't watch it lol 😅
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I really *wanted* to love Brockmire, but I was *sooo* disappointed with the trope filled meltdown at the beginning of ep1 that it lost me and i never went back.   "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"The Mick is good, but it falls into the same trap as a lot of modern sitcoms of trying to redeem the characters in the third act of every episode.  

It makes me miss shows like Malcolm in the Middle that let the characters stay true to themselves and didn't always try to shoehorn in an ""aw shucks"" moment."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,The little kid eating the birth control was hilarious!
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,oh shit I keep spelling her name wrong mad bad 😩
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I can't wrap my head around how you can rate Taboo so low on your list, to me that show was exceptionally well crafted."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,How do you find the time to watch so much TV?
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,No love for Kate Walsh on 13RW? She had the most heartbreaking scenes on that show and she nailed the role.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I personally loved legion but you havent seen the highest rated episodes or any of the climatic stuff. Not saying you wont feel the same way after you finish it but its usually a good idea to finish something before labeling it overrated 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,The list is only new shows so no Leftovers or BCS. Also Taboo really blew.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I concur.  Emerald City was marvelous.  
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,What channel? 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,wouldn't say that is *new* since it's a continuation of the original series. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Last year AMC had Damien. It was my favorite show in the horror genre last year. I haven't seen The Son but i'll check it out. Hopefully, it will be as good as Damien was
"
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Ooh yes, I really enjoyed Great News! I hope it comes back for a second season."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"As much as I enjoyed Legion and look forward to season 2, I definitely feel it's overrated. Its ""trippy visuals"" paled in comparison to American Gods' (and Hannibal's)."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"You think? I loved the book and hated the show, I think their choice of non-book filler was really boring and unappealling. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,[deleted]
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,no. best to go into Legion not knowing anything about it really
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,you like plot progression I see 😅 I can understand that. Both Legion and American Gods are style-over-substance shows tho...meaning they're fueled by surrealism rather than thr plot which mostly lingers in the background.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Yes. Thanks. I know it's an old as hell post but I just loved Anne as a 26 yo guy. And I watched it alone.


It's a cute show with charming actors. I don't know the books, but the series hooked me up and I followed it like crazy. So glad there's gonna be more."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,'**new shows**'...
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"> Legion was let down by Noah Hawley getting carried away with himself

how so? I thought the whole fucking thing was fantastic. Not into trippy visuals? "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,At least they didn't put The Americans or The Leftovers on there. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"No love for Kate Walsh either, when she nailed that role..."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,It's funny you say that because the average age of the Riverdale kids is lower then the 13 Reasons Why kids. 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,those aren't 'new' shows.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,> The Best and Not-So-Best **new** TV shows of 2017
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"> Where's chapter 2 where she actually attempts to escape?

season 2?? fam, this is a TV series adaptation, not the book."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Maybe, maybe not. But this post is about new shows."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,it's not new....and no it isn't.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Cool. 

Edit: As said by John Oliver."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Fully agree. It's not a masterpiece, but it's very good entertainment, done the right way."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,Its got a ton of buzz online for a show that wasn't really promoted at all. I think we'll definitely get a season 2.
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"It's **very** well setup for a second season, so I think it's gonna happen."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I almost couldn't finish the last couple episodes. It was too much pressure from the building tension, plot, and style. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,I tweeted at the guy who plays Dennis and he told me they start filming season 2 in August. So hopefully the wait won't be too long 
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"Jesus, it was terrible. I felt like they were trying to imply a sinister subtext (or maybe it was me hoping), but there was just nothing. The characters were all absolute shite, and the the motivations of Naomi Watts' character made pretty much no sense, other than maybe she has a brain tumour."
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"I didn't find any sort of relation to BrainDead. The comedy in TGF is no where near that. In fact, they did a great job of transitioning The Good Wife universe into this new series while giving it its own individuality. 

Just like any new series, it takes a minute to find their footing but the reviews have been positive and I encourage anyone who was a fan of TGW to check it out. "
Fate/EXTRA Last Encore,"That opening scene was based off of a funny or die sketch, the rest of the show isn't like that"
Babylon Berlin,"Two reasons.

1. Netflix isn't willing to pay up for it at the moment. In America, it is actually not that popular. In fact, it's absurdly unknown. If you check [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4378376/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt) you'll find that only 4,000 out of 26,000 voters are from the USA. It's very geographically concentrated, and the longer it takes to get on Netflix, the more Americans will either just pirate it or forget about it.

2. Sky isn't willing to sell it at the moment. Someone on r/babylonberlin said:

""What I understand is that *Babylon Berlin* is a co-production between Sky and German public broadcaster ARD.    
Sky has the rights to show it first and s4 ran on the Sky channels and their affiliates in Late 2022.    
ARD doesn't get to show season 4 until Fall 2023.  And I assume the contract implies that Netflix doesn't get to show it until after it premieres on ARD.  ""

But I agree generally that it's a shambles. It's 2023. If you have a new TV or film production and you do not make it accessible to the world on day 1, the internet will do it for you. This should be unacceptable now.

[Season 4 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNi2a22ZvDk)

Masterclass in how to destroy a show set in one of the most fascinating periods of modern history that could have easily have been closer to Peaky Blinders or Boardwalk Empire in popularity if not destroyed by a brainless release schedule and non-existent advertising."
Babylon Berlin,How is this show? What can I expect from watching it?
Babylon Berlin,"I'm curious, when it airs in the US is it dubbed or subtitled? 
In UK it's aired subtitled and while I loved the first two series I found series three a bit of a slog and gotta admit hadn't even realised there was a series 4. Might revisit three and see if I'm more receptive to it now."
Babylon Berlin,They should because season 4 was much better than season 3
Babylon Berlin,I love this show and did not even know there was a S4 completed.  I really hope to watch it at some point.  May have to take to the high seas since Netflix is lagging.
Babylon Berlin,"The ocean is lovely this time of year, set sail.

I waited long enough for the 4th season to drop i'm not waiting any longer for media companies to distribute it out to all regions."
Babylon Berlin,Season 1 was amazing. Two was a bit hey hey. 3 was better than 2. Heard good things about 4.
Babylon Berlin,That's nuts you guys haven't been able to watch season 4. I forget not everyone is willing to sail the high seas
Babylon Berlin,"> you'll find that only 4,000 out of 26,000 voters are from the USA. 

I figured it was niche but not that niche. That's a shame it's quite good."
Babylon Berlin,"Wow, thanks for the amazing answer!!!"
Babylon Berlin,">rst and s4 ran on the Sky channels and their affiliates in Late 2022.  
>  
>ARD doesn't get to show season 4 until Fall 2023.  And I assume the contract implies that Netflix doesn't get to show it until after it premieres on ARD.  ""

A complete absurdity. I mean season 3 aired back in the States on Netflix in January of 2020.  That is now over three years ago. I get that Covid delayed the production, but it is absolutely a shame how little gets communicated from anyone over that time period.

I have been waiting patiently for season 4 since about March of 2020, and now we have to go by mere rumors to understand that if we want to see it legally, we may have to wait until 2024 to see it on Netflix. Likely waiting atleast  \~ 5% of our lives for the release of the following season, while being provided zero information and paying the netflix subscription fee every month.

This was one of my favorite shows of all time back in 2020, but now I can barely remember what happened.

Streaming services are as bad if not worse than cable providers now. A complete lack of transparency to string along subscribers that might just pay for their subscriptions for a couple of shows. Screw them. Long live torrents then."
Babylon Berlin,"It's about the Weimar Republic, during the worldwide market crash and leading (so far) into the rise of the Nazi party, when they're about at the stage the Proud Boys are now. The main character is a police detective solving cases that take him through the underground culture of the doomed era. It's great"
Babylon Berlin,High production value and a good story. It is definitely worth watching.
Babylon Berlin,It will be both
Babylon Berlin,"Season 4's only been out since 2022.

But dude, just pirate it."
Babylon Berlin,That might explain the delay since their isn't a dub to my knowledge
Babylon Berlin,That would be weird. Many people are quite happy now to use subtitles.
Babylon Berlin,"I detest the dubbed version, I was pointing out a possible reason to explain a delay to US as the show doesn't have a dub and that's how Netflix has been releasing the show to my understanding"
Babylon Berlin,Such an OUTSTANDING show. The “ashes to ashes” song is addictive from Season One.
Babylon Berlin,So glad this show has persisted for so long. High-quality german content at it's best.
Babylon Berlin,"They dropped the first four episodes. On a Monday. Sky madlads. 

Edit:
Wow did not see them launch the season last Monday…. 

https://thetvdb.com/series/babylon-berlin/seasons/official/4"
Babylon Berlin,How are the previous seasons of this show? I only watched season 1 and maybe part of 2.
Babylon Berlin,The first season was incredible when I watched it a few years ago. Can't wait to rewatch it all.
Babylon Berlin,🔥
Babylon Berlin,Finally! I hope we don't wait too long to get it on Netflix here
Babylon Berlin,Fuck yes! This is my favorite show. It's so fucking good
Babylon Berlin,"Such a great show. It's so fascinating to see the chaos, violence, and revelry of the Weimar era on screen."
Babylon Berlin,"Such a good show, visually stunning too!"
Babylon Berlin,"Get in Netflix soon!  So looking forward to this.

I may need to go back and rewatch the earlier seasons."
Babylon Berlin,Has anyone noticed how most prestige German shows have this same visual look? Do they all share the same color graders or?
Babylon Berlin,"This show was excellent until the scene where they are nearly falling from a plane.  Its been a while since I watched, but remember thinking this would be the German version of 'jumping the shark'.  

The rest of the show was good though"
Babylon Berlin,Agreed. The performance was mesmerizing. The shot where Nyssen leaned forward and was super into it was me at home.
Babylon Berlin,Excellent.
Babylon Berlin,"First season is perfection.

Second season, narratively, is just as amazing. Although, they clearly ran out of money at some point.

Third season was fantastic but narratively it was a noticeable step down from Season 1 and 2. From geopolitics, ideological conflict, an Imperialist Putsch, and civil war tensions between the Communists and the Weimar Coalition in Season 1 and 2... to a whodunnit in Season 3. Sure, Nazis play a bigger role in this Season over the first two; obviously they won't be in power for another 4 years/seasons but they're starting to go from background nobodies that people laugh at and joke about in Season 1 and 2, to becoming an actual nuisance in Season 3. There's also a reoccuring theme throughout the season of a society unwilling to stand up to the growing Nazi threat, either for political reasons, or because they're sympathetic to the cause, or because they have their head in the sand, or because of fear of violent retaliation from the Nazis. But at the end of the day, the season is still about Gereon and Charlotte solving a murder at a movie sound stage.

Regardless, I'm really looking forward to Season 4, it's one of the best shows ever made."
Babylon Berlin,Netflix initially combined the German seasons 1 and 2 into a single season so you may have seen both.
Babylon Berlin,Apparently Sky dropped the first four episodes if you're in Europe!
Babylon Berlin,"No idea but it looks fantastic. 

The LOTR show could use a few pointers from there."
Babylon Berlin,Do you mean taking photographs from a plane?
Babylon Berlin,"The writing is rather constrained by the books the series is based on. The general feeling I've seen in other discussions is that the source material for the third season was particularly weak, and what we saw on screen was a major improvement over the book. But they couldn't stray further without making it too loose of an adaptation."
Babylon Berlin,Nah. Ich bin Amerikaner.
Babylon Berlin,yes that part. will edit
Babylon Berlin, I've been waiting for the show to enter the 1930s. I really cannot wait.
Babylon Berlin,Yessssssss. I’ve been patiently waiting for a new season. One of my all time favorites!
Babylon Berlin,"I hope the Gereon going Nazi thing is a case of misleading trailer, and more to do with him going deep cover as I don't think it works with his character at all, or, in my opinion the theme of the setting

His entire friend group is 'progressive'. He sheltered Kattelbach from the Nazis. He led an investigation looking into the nazis etc"
Babylon Berlin,Does anyone know when it will hit Netflix US?
Babylon Berlin,I absolutely loved this show. But the 3rd season lost me. It didn’t feel like the same show. I’ll give this a shot and hopefully it’s more like 1-2.
Babylon Berlin,Best end credits sequence
Babylon Berlin,"Wow I had no idea they were even filming a fourth season, so to find out that it will premiere on October 8th is a really nice surprise. I just hope it’s a return to the quality of the first two seasons and not the third one. 

Additionally, Charlotte is such a great character."
Babylon Berlin,I love this show but I really hope they’ll have Ashkenazi actors playing anyone Jewish because it’s been so distracting when they don’t. Also anyone notice in season three that it’s suggested Charlotte might be Sinti?
Babylon Berlin,Blast - better get back to it and finish Season 3!
Babylon Berlin,Man I need to rewatch this
Babylon Berlin,I'm pretty sure it will be on Netflix shortly after the last episode of the season airs.
Babylon Berlin,Watching it now and it's more like season 1-2.  Sadly no Armenian this season it looks like.
Babylon Berlin,"They did have to give her a stupid level of plot armour in one scene in the past, but hey, I'm not complaining too much."
Babylon Berlin,It wasn't as a good as the 1st and 2nd season. Was actually disappointing
Babylon Berlin,"I hate what they did to her in season three, so I’d actually like if she finally had some plot armor instead of suffering additional misery."
Babylon Berlin,[deleted]
Babylon Berlin,"I almost felt the same way because there was such a long wait between S1+2 and S3.  I rewatched it a while back and I thought each arc had their own momentum and devoted equal screentime to the principals, even though S3's climax had a thriller/slasher vibe with the antagonist >!being merked in a university classroom like it's straight out of an 80s B-grade horror!<.  I hope S4 holds its own."
Babylon Berlin,"Yes, her going through a version of that five men, one woman meme so she could buy medicine was not nice to watch."
Babylon Berlin,I agree. I was more interested in the political aspect of the show which is why I didn't enjoy the 3rd season as much
Babylon Berlin,Damnit 😕
Babylon Berlin,"That in itself was bad enough, but then her little sister, whom she’s tried desperately to protect, being sexually assaulted by a pedophile just added a whole new layer to her misery."
Babylon Berlin,Can't recommend this show enough - if you are a fan of noir/period mysteries/detectives etc give it a try. sets and costumes are absolutely stunning as well
Babylon Berlin,I found the 3rd season a bit disappointing. I hope they find their stride again.
Babylon Berlin,This show absolutely rocks. Shit is about to be even more out of control now that the Nazis are really starting to be on the scene.
Babylon Berlin,I absolutely loved the first 2 seasons of this show. But I could not get through season 3. It just didn’t hit with me.
Babylon Berlin,Netflix killing the international space
Babylon Berlin,This show is really good- it does an amazing job of capturing the chaos of the Weimar era in Germany.
Babylon Berlin,Good!  I have loved all three seasons they put out so far.
Babylon Berlin,"I just finished season 1 - taking it slow, like only an episode every couple days, because subtitled shows are quite demanding to watch, but it’s very good.  Charlotte has to be one of the best female characters on tv."
Babylon Berlin,I couldn’t get past season 1 of this show. It must be worth getting past it if there’s a 4th season.
Babylon Berlin,Which network is it on?
Babylon Berlin,This is brilliant news. One of my all time favorite series.
Babylon Berlin,"Seconded,  I found series 1 a little hard to get into as I recall, but it’s a truly fantastic show"
Babylon Berlin,"It sounds interesting but I do most of my watching before bed and subtitles tend to keep me awake longer. Is this show in German with subtitles, or is it in English?"
Babylon Berlin,"i liked the subplot of the businessman and the brownshirts subverting the government more than the main plot of the random serial killer targetting people at the movie studio.

damn show keeps not giving us gereon and charlotte. chareon stan right here."
Babylon Berlin,I think it's the first one with no source material to work off
Babylon Berlin,I couldn't  finish it
Babylon Berlin,"Weimar Germany is such a vibe, and we never see it on movies or TV. I'm amazed it went on so long before the Nazis showed up."
Babylon Berlin,"Great characters, acting, production design… one of my favorite shows."
Babylon Berlin,Well that charismatic character was killed off :-)
Babylon Berlin,I was the same. It seemed so much like something I would like but I just didn't find it very compelling. I might have to give it another try.
Babylon Berlin,Sky and ARD. Netflix everywhere else.
Babylon Berlin,"it's german with subtitles, but like Dark, it really is something people should watch imo"
Babylon Berlin,"there's an English dubbing available on Netflix, but like a lot of such things, you could be like me and get annoyed enough by lips not lining up with the audio to turn it off and go with the subtitles."
Babylon Berlin,German with subtitles but I think there's a dub.
Babylon Berlin,Thanks!!
Babylon Berlin,Not Netflix anymore.
Babylon Berlin,"Yeah it sounds super good. I’ll probably check it out, it’s just finding the right time/place for that kind of viewing is difficult. Thank you."
Babylon Berlin,"The difference is that the story in Dark is told exclusively through brief glimpses of family portraits and the dialogue is superfluous, subtitles or not."
Babylon Berlin,"Yeah I don’t care for dubs, I’d definitely opt for subtitles. It’s just a time and place thing. Right before I fall asleep is not the time and place for me haha"
Babylon Berlin,Oh really? Where?
Babylon Berlin,And not in Germany... guess Sky has exclusive rights here.
Babylon Berlin,"Wow, with Netflix's ""Dark"" last year and this, it seems like Germany is finally in the quality television game"
Babylon Berlin,I finished the sopranos in December and Boardwalk empire yesterday...seems like a natural progression for the next show 
Babylon Berlin,Its cool to see some film noir in a diferent setting than America. I cant stand German films or series most of the time but this one is great.
Babylon Berlin,I’m on episode 4 of this. It’s brilliant! And a GREAT soundtrack. Stylish and interesting. Recommended.
Babylon Berlin,"It was on Sky here in Germany and quite a big hit. I would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing a suspenseful crime drama with good acting and atmosphere or those who are simply interested in the (wonderfully recreated) time. 

It is by no means perfect - it could've used some more character development and the very last episode has a scene that visually and thematically fell a bit flat for me, and a cliffhanger that might seem too drastic. 

That said, I still want to give this show all the props for bringing this rarely portrayed time to live **without too obnoxious political commentary on the imminent rise of the Nazi dictatorship**.  There is political commentary in the show, but mostly in a way that is appropriate for the time. I also like how one of the main characters is sometimes genuinely doing some questionable stuff too, but it again feels correct for the organisation and social class he's part of.

8/10 from me. Good thing is they are shooting a third season already. 

Edit: Oh and there's r/babylonberlin too. I don't know why it isn't in the sidebar."
Babylon Berlin,Great name

One of Us,"Peacock's track record is abysmal.

Not a single show has made it past the second season. Even *Girls5eva* was cancelled and only got a third season because Netflix stepped in. How do you expect to be taken seriously as a streaming service if nothing gets a future? 

I'm looking forward to *Poker Face* and Bryan Fuller's *Friday the 13th* series, but I don't think they'll last long on that service."
One of Us,"Teen vampire series aren't doing so hot. People want to see adult aimed vampire series. Bring on the blood, sex and violence!"
One of Us,"Bad week for YA streaming shows with Gossip Girl, One of Us is Lying, and Vampire Academy getting axed. Of the bunch I’ll miss One of Us is Lying the most. It was actually pretty good! 

Peacock have had nothing but failures with YA and it is the same story for Amazon. Seems only Netflix can get them to work and even they fail half of the time. 

Poor old Paramount are the next up to give the genre a go. They have both School Spirits and Wolf Pack in the offing. I’m not hopeful they will find an audience even if they are good."
One of Us,Fuck. I actually liked One of Us is lying. And it came here to Brazil as Netflix Originals... (and it really feels like a generic netflix show)
One of Us,It's interesting that even people with showrunner experience are failing at the streaming game. I'd have thought Julie Plec would know how to whip up addictive trash in her sleep but being on Peacock didn't help.
One of Us,Does the economics of streaming just not work? Is that what we are learning in the post-lockdown era?
One of Us,I’m still disappointed they canceled the Saved by the Bell reboot. It was one of their best programs.
One of Us,I'm really hoping they don't cancel The Resort
One of Us,Julie should have stayed with Legacies instead of handing the show over to Brett Matthews. I knew to stay away from Vampire Academy
One of Us,It's pretty clear the shows that NBC is having success with are skewing towards older demographics. Neither of these fit that strategy and I am sure they have the metrics to back it up. Streamers that aren't Netflix can't be all things to all people and are going to need to target niches to grab and retain subscribers. Paying for YA shows that don't draw numbers are probably not it.
One of Us,"I wish Chucky S2 would end up on Peacock.  SyFy's streaming is abysmal.  

I don't have high hopes for Natasha Lyonne's new show on Peacock, but I'm still going to watch it.  Right now we're keeping Peacock entirely because my husband wants to keep an eye on the new Night Court and a handful of movies pop up on Peacock occasionally that's worth streaming.

I don't think it'll be my Go To streaming service, though."
One of Us,"Peacock has Days of Our Lives and Yellowstone, hard to beat that!"
One of Us,One of us is lying is really good fun if you haven’t seen it yet. Season 1 can be self contained and think s2 too
One of Us,"Peacock should stop with the original series and just focus on being a library of classic tv and cable shows, which are hard to actually find now."
One of Us,This is probably because no young people watch peacock.
One of Us,"I knew Vampire Academy was doomed when I saw Julie Plec was directing, And of course so many pointless changes...Dimitri doesn't have a Russian accent? Why? Rose and Lissa have switched personalities? Why? Lissa is interested in politics and being Moroi queen from the beginning of the show? WHY? Make it make sense.

Richelle Mead and Vampire Academy deserved better. Sigh."
One of Us,One of us is lying is fine with one season anyway since it finished with one book🤷‍♀️
One of Us,"Vampire Academy was awful. Within the first fifteen minutes of the pilot I counted like 15 cliches. Normally I can get past it, but when guardian one gets spun and dipped by guardian two I checked out."
One of Us,I didn't even realize Vampire Academy season 1 had been released already.
One of Us,"My disappointment is immeasurable due to the cancelation of One of Us Is Lying. Both season were so fun and really good for a teenage, mystery show."
One of Us,The terminations were not unexpected and come as the streamer moves into its next era of progress.
One of Us,"That's a shame, I quite liked 'One of us is Lying'

I guess I won't bother watching that 2nd season now then :/"
One of Us,I was really looking forward to the third season of One of Us Is Lying :*(
One of Us,"Peacock is never gonna get that one big hit huh...drowning in mediocrity over there.

We Are Lady Parts is fantastic though so everybody watch season 2 when it comes out."
One of Us,"Vampire Academy just upsets me. I love the books so much and was excited for another chance at an adaptation after the 2014 movie. The show was horrible, and it just kills me that they wasted our last chance on an adaptation on that crap. Kinda glad it was canceled, because whatever that was was not VA."
One of Us,It really does look like most shows on Peacock are rough but everyone should try The Resort. Was very into that one and hope we get more.
One of Us,"More dumb shows canceled, who’s woulda thought…"
One of Us,"Macgruber fans pleading to Peacock for season 2

https://imgur.com/a/xTolBRM"
One of Us,That's really good
One of Us,Peacocks days are surely numbered
One of Us,"Peacock is for The Office and Law & Order reruns, I guess. I wouldn't be surprised to see them shift strictly to only original movies or realize it's a failure."
One of Us,and here all of them shitting on netflix canceling everything
One of Us,"Whelp, this is my 13th reason"
One of Us,I hope Vampire Academy gets picked up elsewhere. I thought it was very good.
One of Us,"I want a horror movie called ""One of us is lying"".... where the twist is ""One of us is lying, and so is someone else""."
One of Us,"Universal should've shopped this to Freeform, Freevee, Syfy or The Roku Channel."
One of Us,"Vampire Academy was truly awful, and I enjoyed the movie. We need more Vampire shows like Interview with the Vampire and A Discovery of Witches."
One of Us,Cancel culture strikes again!
One of Us,"I just opened the app for the first time in months. Shows like King of Queens, Columbo, Six Million Dollar Man, and Little House on the Prairie are locked behind the premium tier but in the top couple rows on the home screen. Little House is from the 70s. Columbo started in the 60s. These shows are available to stream legally for free from other services. 

For their new shows made for their service, the only one I could name off the top of my head is Killing It. Whatever their new shows are I'm somehow missing any advertising they do.

I really just don't understand Peacock at all. I don't know anyone that has it other than a few guys that get it only for sports."
One of Us,Girls5eva is cancelled? Huh TIL
One of Us,"They’re doing a series set in Ancient Rome with Anthony Hopkins and Roland Emmerich that could be good and they’ve got the community movie, but yeah not much good content"
One of Us,Even Saved by the Bell didn't get more than two seasons.
One of Us,"You could run a streaming service fine with one season shows.. *If you goddamn told both the audience and the show creators that is what you are doing*. 

""You get twenty episodes. Finish the story""."
One of Us,"Peacock isn't even 3 years old yet, Paramount+ (CBS All Access) is over 8 years old and only 6 shows have lasted past 2 season with 3 of them being Star Trek spin-offs and 2 others already ended at 6 and 4 season.

It feels worse with streaming because the cancelled shows hang around rather than disappear like so many 1 and done network shows."
One of Us,I’m still mad about saved by the bell.
One of Us,VA was in a weird place.  They basically took a YA property and then aged up the characters to make it more adult.
One of Us,IWTV as fantastic. Great new interpretation. The Mayfair show not so much...
One of Us,"There's a True Blood reboot in the works although it doesn't look promising given that its Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa behind the wheel, showrunner for Riverdale and the Pretty Little Liars reboot..."
One of Us,"I would not trust current hollywood, but the necroscope series have some terrifying vampires, with blood, sex, psychics, spies, alien parasites, necromancy and more, or maybe something like the lost boys as a series.  Not much sex, but plenty of blood and violence.  Then again, the old world of darkness (pre 2000) gameline, had a ton of different vampire clans and powers that catered to all types of vampires.  There was a show based off of it back in the day, but was canceled because the lead died in a bike accident.  Outside of that, I would not mind a reboot of Forever Knight, a vampire cop solving crimes with flashbacks of different time periods he had lived through, could just make a darker version of it.  Sadly, all modern vampire shows want to go the twilight/romance route.  I want vampires to be scary monsters again."
One of Us,"It's because they hand off YA shows to writers who don't understand the YA audience and then they hire 30 year old actors to play the part.

Netflix has so many great YA shows and in addition to the US shows they have a lot of great foreign YA properties.  South Africa, Mexico, Spain, Netherlands. . . ."
One of Us,Amazon actually has a YA hit with “The Summer I turned Pretty”
One of Us,Yeah I really liked how all the characters on One of us actually seemed to get along in the 2nd season. Like you’d see them have emotional conversations with characters other than their designated SOs all the time. It was refreshing.
One of Us,Netflix owns teens so bad. Middle age demo shows like Jack Ryan stand better chance.
One of Us,Does YA= young audience?
One of Us,[deleted]
One of Us,"Who is producing sex lives of college girls? 
I liked that show"
One of Us,"I liked it, but I don't think it needed a third season.  It didn't really need a second season, we figured out who was lying. . . ."
One of Us,"No, her stuff has been flopping lately because fans have been catching on to her weaknesses. I think she got way too cocky with Vampire Academy and tried to make it into something it wasn't. Too overly complicated when she doesn't even have that type of skill."
One of Us,Vampire academy is based off a book series and book fans hated it since she changed so much and she went too fast for new fans
One of Us,"I was really liking Vampire Academy (because it's addictive trash admittedly), it has a huge twitter following too. I think Peacock big wigs are just idiots"
One of Us,"It works if you have enough subscribers.

Places like Peacock were purposefully overspending with the hopes of attracting more subscribers. Now without the streaming boom caused by the pandemic slowed, the economy getting worse they're having to tighten their belts.

Even places like Netflix which are profitable are doing it but I don't think the economics of streaming don't work."
One of Us,I knew streaming couldn’t completely replace cable but holy shit are we seeing some downsides these days
One of Us,Has there been any official talks for a second season?? That’s one I’d really look forward to.
One of Us,"Even if you never read the books, Vampire Academy was way too confusing. You were right to stay away."
One of Us,SYFY at least renewed it's two YA shows.  Chucky and Reginald the Vampire are fun.  Not sure why they're not on Peacock yet.
One of Us,"Poker Face is by Rian Johnson, so you can be a little excited about it if you want."
One of Us,I'll tell my great-grandparents.
One of Us,"Seems that the streaming networks are specializing again, just like back in the cable days."
One of Us,Or can afford it.
One of Us,"Same. I kept saying it was gonna be a fail because she got her hands on it but no matter what new updates got released, EVERYONE made excuses. ""We haven't seen the cast act yet, you haven't seen footage yet, you can't judge based on the trailer, You've only seen 1 episode!"" 

Please, I suffered through season after season of Julie Plec, I already know she cannot write anything good on her own, much less an adaptation."
One of Us,"Never a good idea to piss off your built in fan base from the start.

A lot of the changes worked, but a lot were just weird and unneeded."
One of Us,"There have been two books in the series so far, with a third and final set for release this summer."
One of Us,"We found out who was lying.  Didn't really need more.

It was fun though."
One of Us,"It only gets worse, the scene when the Guardians were going up the wall was cringy and even the CGI Psy-Hounds looked like Graphics from 1999."
One of Us,"I actually enjoyed it, not a perfect show but certainly entertaining."
One of Us,It wasn’t any good so your not missing anything
One of Us,I loved it and I’m devastated.
One of Us,Julie loves to trash book series.  VA if done right could have been great but it was a dumpster fire
One of Us,They have a pretty good slate of documentaries.  They should keep that up.
One of Us,Peacock is the worst at canceling.
One of Us,"Me too, I’m a fan of the book series and I loved the show. The changes they made were largely for the better. And the Rose and Dimitri actors were fantastic with amazing chemistry. I’m so bummed."
One of Us,The fact that you think the movie is better than the show is laughable
One of Us,People love The Office. I think their plan was to use episodes with deleted scenes added back in to get people to sign up. And then nothing after that.
One of Us,"I have peacock but only because my brother pays for it.

I mostly use it to watch Little House reruns. 😂"
One of Us,I got it for Bravo/The Real Housewives. New episodes air the next day so for me it's a big plus. Also looking forward to poker face. I started watching one of us is lying before I subbed and kind of forgot about it but season one was pretty good.
One of Us,"I have peacock because Bravo reality shows are a guilty pleasure of mine and it has all of them, plus my boyfriend can watch sports on it."
One of Us,But it’s getting a third season on Netflix 🙂
One of Us,Temporarily then Netflix picked it up
One of Us,">Roland Emmerich that could be good

Those words don't go together at all."
One of Us,"> They’re doing a series set in Ancient Rome

Oh nice!"
One of Us,"The other one must be Evil, the only Paramount show I watch. I guess when new Avatar content comes it'll be better. Nickelodeon is Paramount right?"
One of Us,They were talking about merging Peacock and Paramount+ at one point. What ever happened to that idea? They'd be better off merged.
One of Us,"This is a pretty flawed take. Paramount+ didn't do original programming until the 2017 drop of the Good Fight and Star Trek: Discovery.  Good Fight just concluded with it's planned sixth season finale. Star Trek: Discovery's season five will be dropping later this year. 

Most of their cancelled stuff works just fine as stand alone seasons (Why Women Kill, Tell Me a Story, Twilight Zone, Interrogation) or are just straight up miniseries.

The only shows that were cancelled without wrapping up their stories are Guilty Party, Coyote, and Strange Angel\*, 

Paramount+'s track record of wrapping things up and giving them multiple seasons is really strong.  You seem to be dinging them for not having much older content."
One of Us,"I'd take a oWoD series. In fact, I'd pay good money for it. Chances of it are zero, though--if they're making a show based on WoD, it's gonna be nWoD and it's boring."
One of Us,Let us see if it gets a third season. Folks though The Wilds was a hit then Amazon cancelled it after the second season.
One of Us,"I hate that show so much. lol. 

But either way, genuinely asking... is it a ""hit""?? Doesn't feel like one at all as far as social media talks go. Shit, The Wilds felt like a bigger hit when it first dropped and look what happened to that. Wouldn't be surprised if it comes back with viewership slashed in half and it ends up getting cancelled."
One of Us,young adult
One of Us,Netflix is killing a shit ton of their fan favorites too....
One of Us,HBO
One of Us,I think Julie Plec rehashs alot of the same plots. Her work is incredibly dated.
