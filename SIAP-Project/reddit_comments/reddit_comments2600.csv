Im Alan Partridge,"> The office (lol sorry Ricky ours was nicer)

Ricky had executive producer credit for the whole US series, plus ""created by"" credits, making him a very very wealthy man.

There's probably no-one happier than him that the US version reached more success :)"
Im Alan Partridge,"I agree about the us office, although apparently season 1 isn't that well reverred I don't get why it's my favourite of all of them, slightly behind season 2 and the episode where Michael gets sent into the woods."
Im Alan Partridge,"Cheers>Frasier, huh? 

I don’t personally think there’s a big distance between them although I also kinda prefer the original over the spin-off by just a hair. One of my favorite opening themes ever and from what I remember didn’t have as many inconsistent dips in quality like Frasier did in the latter years after Niles’ arc was pretty much complete by  like season 8 and he found love.

Honorable mentions include Scrubs, Cheers, Frasier, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and That ‘70s Show."
Im Alan Partridge,"""What in your opinion is the main difference between both styles of comedy?""

I really don't think there's much of a difference in styles. Social class storylines seem to have persisted much longer in the UK than the US, but it's hard to tell when you're just seeing stuff that made it across the Atlantic."
Im Alan Partridge,it's always sunny in philadelphia
Im Alan Partridge,Interesting.  You prefer The Lucy Show over I Love Lucy?
Im Alan Partridge,"It was pretty great but the UK one was good too it was just kinda mean humour though, however I could watch it without subtitles so that was a nice win haha"
Im Alan Partridge,[deleted]
Im Alan Partridge,It's bigged up in the UK as the cringiest comedy (I'm referring to the UK one) but it doesn't feel like it. It feels like Ricky Gervais acting like Ricky Gervais does meanwhile not much comeuppance happens to him. Certainly doesn't compare to peep show. Christ I didn't include peep show in my top 5 loool  this is what I mean the us list was easy for me but all those shows have weeks upon weeks worth of entertainment the UK shows I struggled to fit just 5 in the top 5 but I think the longest shown listed has like 36 episodes which wouldn't even be 2 seasons in the US.
Im Alan Partridge,"Totally different!

The 50s show ""I Love Lucy"" also starred Desi Arnaz and William Frawley as Fred Mertz.  Two couples living in NYC.

The 60s show ""The Lucy Show/Here's Lucy"" only had Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance. No husbands. Lucy was a widow with kids living in California."
Im Alan Partridge,"Lmao it really is just Ricky gervais playing himself.  However gotta give the man credit, After Life is an amazing show, now if it would only stop being a dink.  Peep show is on my list I need to watch it yet, same with what we do in the dark or whatever it's called, I love me some Matt Berry.  Uk seasons I love and hate, I love that I can marathon a full season in a day but I hate it when the show is good and I want more; however it really does take away from filler episodes which is a positive.

I was super lucky because I'm from Canada and grew up with access to not only Canadian shows but BBC and US network shows too.  Thanks to good old Postman Pat I got into UK stuff fast haha"
Im Alan Partridge,"""Here's Lucy"" was a separate show, too. She starred in that with her kids, Lucy and Desi, Jr."
Im Alan Partridge,Best British comedy ever made. Did you watch Blackadders Christmas Carol as well? People often miss that one.
Im Alan Partridge,"Blackadder, red dwarf and mighty boosh. Top 3 for me."
Im Alan Partridge,"You all remember the final scene. Brings tears to my eyes every time. 

A lot of aristocratic officers made the working class soldiers do stupid stuff that got them killed."
Im Alan Partridge,"I always assume this isn’t going to catch on cos you’ll start the first season and nope the fuck out cos it’s utter shite. 

S2-4 are arguably the best British sitcom ever. The tweaks to the Blackadder and Baldrick characters are perfect. Elton and Curtis complimented each other perfectly in the writers room. And, no offence to Tim Mcinnerny, but Hugh Laurie was the better pompous fool, and Darling is a much better fit. 

Also: Miranda Richardson is one of the finest actors England has produced. She can do it all."
Im Alan Partridge,I was watching Blackadder before I could talk; it really developed my sense for cunning schemes.
Im Alan Partridge,.... Wibble
Im Alan Partridge,"Yes, Minister!, The Young Ones, The Thick of It and Only Fools and Horses."
Im Alan Partridge,"the episode with William Pitt, the Younger and the Even Younger had me laughing the most out of anything I've ever seen besides The Office OG and Monty Python's ANFSCD  

""Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I shall be brief, as I have rather unfortunately become Prime Minister right in the middle of my exams"""
Im Alan Partridge,"Love the show.  

Our history teacher used to put on a episode of Blackadder whenever it was vaguely relevant.

Studying the history of medicine?  Throw on the episode that mentions leeches!

Studying world war 1?  Time for the saga of speckled Jim!"
Im Alan Partridge,"I am a busy man and I can't be bothered to punch you at the moment: here is my fist, kindly run towards it as fast as you can."
Im Alan Partridge,"From s2 forward, one of the best comedies I've watched. And the writing was so so good. Never mind that knowing Atkinson only from Bean, this was... so refreshing."
Im Alan Partridge,"Baldrick : But, my Lord, I've been in your family since 1532. 

Blackadder : So has syphilis. Now get out."
Im Alan Partridge,"I still say ""I have a cunning plan"" almost daily. 

Brilliant series, a textbook example of shorter seasons being of higher quality thing."
Im Alan Partridge,"top 3 all time, sublime

nothing in the world makes me laugh more than Darling's ""there's nothing cushy about life in the Women's Auxiliary Balloon Corps!"""
Im Alan Partridge,"YOU MEAN COMEDY OF THE GODS??

blackadder 2 is sheer genius."
Im Alan Partridge,"My hot take:  Season 1 is the worst season of the show, but still really funny and worth watching.  The King character is hilarious."
Im Alan Partridge,"I Also Watched it all last month for the first time & regretted not watching it earlier! Another one was The New Statesman, that is good too."
Im Alan Partridge,"I know I'm late to the party here but I grew up with British television and blackadder was probably my favorite one, along with red dwarf. Some people just dont get it but I think that style of comedy tv is some of the greatest humor in media. Happy to hear about your discovery! And if you haven't seen red dwarf, give it a shot. The first few seasons are goldmines of comedy but also pretty awesome scifi."
Im Alan Partridge,What starts with ‘come here’ and ends with ‘ow’?
Im Alan Partridge,"When a man soils a Wellington, he puts his foot in it!"
Im Alan Partridge,One of the greats. Think s3 has to be my favourite. I used to have the cassette tapes and listen to them when I was a teenager. Showing my age there
Im Alan Partridge,"Love?  Oh, you mean rumpy-pumpy?

So much love for the show., I'm psyched that you enjoyed it.  It's a great show for when you're feeling depressed or down, I can't count the number of times I've seen it."
Im Alan Partridge,I haven't seen this in years and yet we started watching it last night.
Im Alan Partridge,"Here are my genitals, please kick them."
Im Alan Partridge,"Blackadder, Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and Are You Being Served all contributed to my obsession with British TV as a kid."
Im Alan Partridge,I have a cunning plan.
Im Alan Partridge,"I grew up on British Comedy. Blackadder, Waiting for God, Fawlty Towers, Yes Minister, Keeping up Appearances, Are You Being Served, Allo Allo… just iconic shows."
Im Alan Partridge,The Vicar of Dibley should be on your list as well.
Im Alan Partridge,I’m eagerly waiting for my kids to be old enough to watch it. Any time someone brings up Mr. Bean I always try to redirect to Blackadder.
Im Alan Partridge,"I will try it again then.

""Yes minister"" and ""in the thick of it""are both  peak British comedy for me.."
Im Alan Partridge,black adder is the best British comedy i have ever seen. it is just so ridiculous good. just as you stated. it is timeless.
Im Alan Partridge,"Melchett: (back to Baldrick) Now then, soldier, do you love your country?

Baldrick: Certainly do, sir.

Melchett: And do you love your king?

Baldrick: Certainly don’t, sir.

Melchett: And why not?

Baldrick: My mother told me never to trust men with beards, sir."
Im Alan Partridge,A bit of Fry and Laurie is almost on the same level
Im Alan Partridge,"""Yes, Minister"" will always be my favourite but Blackadder season 4 is a close second. 

In fact, that prompted me to watch ""A Bit Fry & Laurie"" as well."
Im Alan Partridge,"It was a really brave decision to reinvent the show after the first series but one which has turned it into an all time classic. I think the 'silly' style of comedy presented the first series has aged fairly poorly and it's probably the reason why it isn't shown on TV anywhere near as frequently as the others. The other three series with the focus on the witty Blackadder are an absolute blast where joke after joke lands successfully. After the Inbetweeners, it's my favourite sitcom."
Im Alan Partridge,"You might want to watch Upstart Crow. Comedy about Shakespeare that briefly, in one episode, reprises a character from Blackadder. I won't spoil it, thought it was super clever. Then go lookup more stuff from David Mitchell and his buddy Mark Webber."
Im Alan Partridge,Always and cromulently.
Im Alan Partridge,Father ted also recc
Im Alan Partridge,"A timeless classic.
Hoarded, to ensure that it never disappears, as the humour, like Fawlty towers is allegedly offensive to snowflakes.

One of the best shows ever created."
Im Alan Partridge,Ohyes! To be honest I'm not a fan of the last series but just LOVE the rest!
Im Alan Partridge,Fuck yes you legend
Im Alan Partridge,"To me it’s a bit samey the whole way through.

“Baldrick, It’s about as funny as slapping a fish against my car on a rainy Sunday”

<viewers rolling on the floor laughing>"
Im Alan Partridge,"Gentleman, the King!

Where?"
Im Alan Partridge,I did! I watched all the specials...such good stuff. I'm starting Fawlty Towers next and plan to binge through some other British goodness for a while. :)
Im Alan Partridge,"This guys brains for example, Theledj, is so immensely ginormous, that if a pack of hungry cannibals cracked his head open, there would be enough to cover ten-thousand water biscuits."
Im Alan Partridge,You forgot Bottom and The Young Ones.
Im Alan Partridge,"> Don't forget your stick Lieutenant

> Rather, sir. Wouldn't want to face a machine gun without this."
Im Alan Partridge,Good luck everyone
Im Alan Partridge,"Have you seen the original pilot? It reverses the roles of Bkackadder & Baldrick, to the way they are in the other 3 seasons.  Its great."
Im Alan Partridge,Why DO only fools and horses work?
Im Alan Partridge,"""And which Pitt would this be? Pitt the toddler? Pitt the embryo?"""
Im Alan Partridge,I work in a school and I keep telling the history teachers they need to just put Blackadder on but they don't. The students are missing out.
Im Alan Partridge,"When I was in secondary school, we watched the entirety of Blackadder Goes Fourth when we learned about WW1. Great show."
Im Alan Partridge,"And 3 and 4 and Chrstmas Carol and Cavalier Years and, yes, even Back and Forth."
Im Alan Partridge,Red Dwarf is next on my list after I finish Fawlty Towers. And I've gotten some great recommendations from this thread so will likely be stuck on old British TV shows for quite some time. :)
Im Alan Partridge,I don't know.
Im Alan Partridge,Ah! I spent the night with a  pair of Wellingtons and I loved it!
Im Alan Partridge,"I had the cassettes for Fawlty Towers, listened to those for years before I ever saw the show."
Im Alan Partridge,Done!
Im Alan Partridge,I had a fun moment with my teenage daughter. She's a huge fan of House. I had her watch a few minutes of the Prince Regent in season three and she just couldn't quite put her finger on who the actor was. After a while she made me tell her and when I said it was Hugh Laurie she totally lost it and is now watching it herself. :)
Im Alan Partridge,"Really?  The 4th series is probably my favourite.

And I wasn't keen on the first series"
Im Alan Partridge,"I would recommend *Not The Nine O’Clock News* if you’re going into the UK comedy archives. 

It’s not an obvious one but I’m sure you’ve heard of the usual ones.

Also *The Young Ones*."
Im Alan Partridge,"If you can find it, there's also a special episode set during the English Civil War which is pretty good. And there's one more called the millennium special that is well, kinda meh.

Edit, oh maybe it's called Back and Forth?"
Im Alan Partridge,Father Ted!
Im Alan Partridge,"Fawlty Towers, Bkackadder and Father Ted are the holy trinity of British TV."
Im Alan Partridge,*A Bit of Fry & Laurie* has two of the greatest comedians/actors/speakers being brilliant right out of the gate.
Im Alan Partridge,"Put the best comedy series of all time on that list as well, [I'm Alan Partridge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/). There are more series that feature Alan but start with that one first."
Im Alan Partridge,"I think One Foot in the Grave would be in my ""Holy Trinity"", but not sure I can narrow it down under about 12 lol."
Im Alan Partridge,"You really, really wish Baldrick had a cunning plan to get them out of that mess."
Im Alan Partridge,">Why DO only fools and horses work?

For a Living"
Scrotal Recall,"I started to watch it after a post in r/AskReddit about the best unknown shows in Netflix. I love it, it's so different from the usual com-rom series. The writing is on point."
Scrotal Recall,"Watched the first 5 episodes, show hasn't missed a beat. Might actually have gotten better. "
Scrotal Recall,"I had no idea, that is awesome. I will watch it right now."
Scrotal Recall,I love that they started right from where the last one left off. I'm trying very hard not to binge this.
Scrotal Recall,"Such a fantastic show!  Season 1 was great so I'm super excited to start season 2.  For those that haven't seen it, each episode is less than 30 min and there are between 6-8 episodes per season.  Not a huge commitment to get into.  Get on it!

Side note:  For those of you who like fun, English folk music, the lead actor is Johnny Flynn.  Check out his album ""A Larum"".  It's one of my favorites."
Scrotal Recall,"I tried so hard not to binge it but I plowed through all 8 episodes already. Just as good as the first season and a good bit funnier as well, I really loved it. Hoping to see Daniel Ings especially get some more high profile work after this."
Scrotal Recall,"Wha...what? I'd completely forgotten they were making a second series! 

Now to find the time to rewatch season 1. I love surprises like this."
Scrotal Recall,Haven't  started watching it. I know I'm going to binge it and I have to work tomorrow. But I loved the first season and it has been a long time coming. Just hoping this season can make the show gain more popularity so that it doesn't take another 3 years for a new season.
Scrotal Recall,"Two episodes in, really enjoying it. it's more of the first season really, which is exactly what i wanted."
Scrotal Recall,"Love this show , will binge this in the weekend."
Scrotal Recall,"Great show, the opening on S1 with the doctor is one of the strongest comedy openings I've seen."
Scrotal Recall,I loved the show but I could not tell anyone about it because the title was so ridiculous. I thought it would be cancelled. Glad they rebranded it. 
Scrotal Recall,Any reason why the name changed?
Scrotal Recall,"Arrrrgh I've been waiting for this! Thanks!

To Netflix!!!"
Scrotal Recall,"Love this show, can't wait to binge it after grad school finishes in December."
Scrotal Recall,Been waiting for this for weeks! Going to get started tonight!
Scrotal Recall,"I just discovered this show about a month ago and binged the first season. Its a GREAT show, funny and has a great love story to it. Can't wait to watch season 2"
Scrotal Recall,I'm halfway through season 1. It's like how I met your mother if it was written by Richard Curtis. I'd say it's a solid 8/10
Scrotal Recall,This show is amazing. That is all. 
Scrotal Recall,I just rewatched S1 and started watching S2 too. 
Scrotal Recall,"I might have to rewatch S1, I remember liking the show, for the most part. But I was so confused as to why he was revisiting such OLD partners for what seemed to be a simple STD. Unless it's been too long and I forgot the actual premise."
Scrotal Recall,They should have kept the original name. Initially I only watched the show because of its unusual title.  SEason 1 was pretty funny so hopefully season 2 lives up to it.
Scrotal Recall,"I love this show so much. It's like a British ""You're the Worst"", but slighly more laid back and relatable."
Scrotal Recall,"What?! No way! I remember watching season 1 on Netflix last year, not thinking yoo much about it other than I wanted to watch a fun British comedy, and I LOVED it! I'm so glad there is a season 2 and that it's just like the first and better. Thank you for the info!! "
Scrotal Recall,Howled with laughter at some of these episodes. Great stuff again. All three leads and solid but my favourite character is Angus! What a guy.
Scrotal Recall,"you've seen You're the worst right?

also Love"
Scrotal Recall,Ahhh I can't contain my excitement. I love season 1 and have been waiting months for the new season. Thanks for confirming there hasn't been any drop in quality!
Scrotal Recall,Just binged it over a good all-my-time-not-consumed-by-class.  11/10 would do again
Scrotal Recall,"I didn't realize he was a musician until I saw him on The Detectorists. The theme song to that show is one of his, and one scene shows him playing it. Thanks for the album recommendation, I'll check it out!"
Scrotal Recall,... same. What have I done? I waited almost a year and a half for more episodes and now they are all gone.
Scrotal Recall,Suprises like a finger up the arse?
Scrotal Recall,"Well I've had a difficult time convincing some friends to watch the show because of the name. I think when people hear Scrotal Recall, they expect something a bit crasser and sillier than the actual show."
Scrotal Recall,Because Scrotal Recall is a stupid name.
Scrotal Recall,Name is weird
Scrotal Recall,Was gonna watch some of S2 last night....ended up re watching all of S1 and half of S2 with my flatmate who hadn't heard of it before. No regrets.
Scrotal Recall,"I think part of that is explainable with how much of a romantic Dylan is. He heard ""notify your previous partners"" and took it on as a introspective journey rather than just a simple task. He's wondering why it never seems to work out so the chlamydia thing gives him an excuse to look back and figure out what went wrong."
Scrotal Recall,"also the characters aren't *the worst*. Jimmy, gretchen,and lindsey are all awful in YTW, which can sometimes be grating. 

in know thats kind of the point but i feel like even the ""redeemable"" qualities arent actually that. theyre just vulnerabilities that aren't enough to make them any way likable."
Scrotal Recall,"I watched all of Love, but I just couldn't see why so many beautiful women were into Guy. The best episode was the one where he went on a date and the girl wasn't into him."
Scrotal Recall,Scrotal Recall is definitely UK's equivalent of You're the Worst.
Scrotal Recall,It's different from the usual *American/Netflix-friendly* comedy series. It's definitely in tune with the British writing.
Scrotal Recall,"This is my reasoning for never watching it, even after the name change. I figured any team that chose such a terrible name must have wrote a terrible show too. Seemed like something for college frat bros. Maybe I'll need to catch an episode or two and see if it's as good as this thread is saying."
Scrotal Recall,Is it about a guy time traveling before he was snipped?
Scrotal Recall,It's why I watched the show in the first place tho
Scrotal Recall,"Lovesick is even worse, though. Scrotal Recall was at least original. "
Scrotal Recall,"Yeah I almost started from S2, but then i didn't really remember that much of S1 and rewatched it and S2 after that!"
Scrotal Recall,"True, I never looked at it that way, but it makes sense."
Scrotal Recall,"I could not deal with the male lead in that show, I gave up watching halfway through because of him. He was so incredibly annoying and nothing about his storyline was compelling at all. Shame, because I really liked what they were doing with Gillian Jacobs and the Australian roommate was very enjoyable as well."
Scrotal Recall,"Okay, you've sold me"
Scrotal Recall,People keeping saying this. I still can't get into You're the Worst. 
Scrotal Recall,"yeah, same reason i ignored it at first. but it's actually quite warm, subtle and sentimental."
Scrotal Recall,"It's a very different vibe than the name implies. Very British humor but not to the point where you hate the characters. It's lighthearted and witty but also gets deep and very touchingly emotional at times. If you like stuff like You're the Worst, Casual, Love, Man Seeking Woman, etc then you'll probably like this one."
Scrotal Recall,Total Recall isn't about time travelling so why would Scrotal Recall have time traveling.
Scrotal Recall,"Same- It definitely piqued my interest. But it seems like the word ""scrotal"" puts people off in greater numbers than it brings them in."
Scrotal Recall,"It's easy to tell a friend about a show called Scrotal Recall. It's less easy to tell acquaintances, especially work colleagues, since it's so crass. If I want to recommend a show, I'd rather it have a simple, albeit uninspired, name. "
Scrotal Recall,Scrotal Recall made no sense.
Scrotal Recall,Good point. I must have mistook it for another Arnold movie. Either way it sounds like a scifi story about testicles. 
Scrotal Recall,"He has to recall all the people he's nutted in, doesn't he?"
Scrotal Recall,[deleted]
Scrotal Recall,"Not gonna lie, I avoided it because the original name sounded so dumb. But I've heard nothing but praise on Reddit about it, so I put it on the list to watch after a couple other shows."
Scrotal Recall,"I watched it over a year ago and I was really upset that it seemed like the show's plug was about to be pulled. Randomly re-watched the first season again a few days ago and I noticed they renamed it *Lovesick*. Was so excited to find out they're hooking it back up with a new season. 

And yes, the soundtrack by itself deserves a huge thumbs up. "
Scrotal Recall,"Im so glad there's going to be a season 2, I was really worried they would end the whole show after that final scene. "
Scrotal Recall,"According to my TV episode fracker, TeeVee, it will be back in 95 days!"
Scrotal Recall,Met a woman working on season 2 last night actually. They're finishing post-production. Said season two was good with a bit of a slump through the middle.
Scrotal Recall,I loved it too. I don't know how I missed it when it first came out. Anyone know any other similar shows? 
Scrotal Recall,"Thanks for the writeup, OP. I went ahead and binged it in nearly one sitting. Absolutely loved it! The tone hit the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and yes, even romance. ""Contemplative"" is quite a good word for the tone of the more dramatic scenes.

So glad that I only have to wait a couple months for season 2 on Netflix. 

Get on it if you're on the fence, people!"
Scrotal Recall,"Good summary and agree with the comparisons. A little more interesting show title would have been great...still better than the terrible original name though.

Imho it is not as funny as the first seasons of Catastrophe & You're the Worst and not as endearing as the second seasons of both series in terms of the more ""serious"" themes.

Still worth the watch as it lies somewhere in between these series and their two seasons. Looking forward to S2.
"
Scrotal Recall,If you haven't you should watch the pilot to Misfits. 
Scrotal Recall,"And for me, I watched it because of the dumb name, and enjoyed it way more than I thought, simply because it was so not what I expected when I read the name. Definitely recommend it to others."
Scrotal Recall,It is going to be less than 10 episodes again? 
Scrotal Recall,"Really glad you gave it a shot and enjoyed it! This was such a great discovery for me I really wanted to give people a push into watching it w/o going all ""zomg it's the best thing evverr"" Glad it's just a short 2.5 month wait for us instead of 2 years (last ep aired in 2014!)"
Scrotal Recall,[deleted]
Scrotal Recall,It's eight episodes.
Scrotal Recall,Seriously might be the hottest three minutes in tv history. 
Scrotal Recall,Oh hell yeah! This show really surprised me in the best way possible and I had given up hope for a 2nd season. I really like this new wave of pseudo rom-coms and this show ranks up there with the best (which imo are Catastrophe and You're the Worst)
Scrotal Recall,"Great show. The name really doesn't do it any service at all. But this goes great with Man Seeking Woman, You're the Worst or Master of None."
Scrotal Recall,"So excited, binged this show in a day last year and completely forgot about it up until now. Don't let the name dissuade you, not much of a commitment, and well worth the watch."
Scrotal Recall,Honestly this is one of the funniest Netflix originals. I'm stoked to see another season is coming.
Scrotal Recall,"I don't understand why people hate the title so much, I think it's very interesting and attractive"
Scrotal Recall,Good. Just watched this last week.
Scrotal Recall,This is excellent. I loved the first series and had given up hope of a second purely because the terrible title seemed to put of its potential audience. This news has made my day!
Scrotal Recall,"Good news, the scene where he describes Point Break was amazing"
Scrotal Recall,"YES!
Honestly, I stumbled on this show and watched episode 1 because of the name (I really was expecting something terrible). Glad I did, such an underrated show, and I NEEDED something more after that cliffhanger!"
Scrotal Recall,"Great news, thank you Netflix!"
Scrotal Recall,Woo. Glad it's coming back for a season 2.
Scrotal Recall,"This is fantastic news,  Really thought we weren't going to get another series! So happy about this."
Scrotal Recall,"Great news!  Such an enjoyable show, wonder if the second season will continue to follow the same structure. "
Scrotal Recall,Never heard the name of this show before. I would give it a try. Looks pretty nice. 
Scrotal Recall,"Awesome, this was such a great show. Can't wait."
Scrotal Recall,This is one of the best rom com shows out there. Scrubs like in it's blending of Comedy and Drama
Scrotal Recall,"Hm... I refused to watch this show on principal because I thought the title was so fucking terrible, but reading the comments, I think I need to give it a try... I'm stubborn"
Scrotal Recall,"Good news, it was such a charming and funny show! I was worried it wouldn't get much recognition but a season two is a win!"
Scrotal Recall,"Hell yes, I've been waiting for more since it first aired on channel 4, especially since it ended on a cliffhanger"
Scrotal Recall,Does anyone know if Sense8 season 2 is happening?
Scrotal Recall,"Amazing !!! Also can you please change the title , so many people are turned off by the show title"
Scrotal Recall,"This is amazing news, but I really wish they would just rename it. I'd rather have to explain ""yeah, the first season is under a different name"" than have to convince skeptical friends that it's a good show."
Scrotal Recall,"I thought it was terrible. The only reason I watched was for Antonia Thomas, who is fucking beautiful. "
Scrotal Recall,"This whole comment chain confused the fuck out of me until I realized we weren't talking about Testees. 

Cool announcement. Guess I should finish the first season. "
Scrotal Recall,I loved Catastrophe and YtW.  You should give Casual a shot.  Not 100% rom-com but certainly deals with dating and is refreshingly original.
Scrotal Recall,"It's not a Netflix original though, it's a channel 4 show (or it used to be at least)"
Scrotal Recall,And very fitting given the subject matter.

Shaun the Sheep,I heard that Norm recorded dialogue for this season i wonder will they give him a send off?
Shaun the Sheep,Am I the only one who found the season 3 opener slow and predictable?
Shaun the Sheep,"Fantastic episode that covered a really really dark subject phenomenally. 

If you’ve missed out on this show, I can whole heartedly recommend it even if ur not into the genre."
Shaun the Sheep,Damn what a heavy episode. Star trek never went here before so that's interesting. You can really see the budget increase for the special effects. Also was the USS Quimby a Simpsons reference? Haha
Shaun the Sheep,"I miss Orville season 1.  Sure all the jokes didn't land but it was interesting seeing a ""funny"" version of Star Trek: The Next Generation that made fun on the tropes. 

 Then we got season 2 that tried to be more serious but each episode became painfully predictable.  Season 3 premiere seemed to lean even more into the serious side but the problem is most of the cast has fan fiction level acting ability.  

Side note, as much as I like starship porn it seemed like half the episode was exterior shots, maybe that's because the A story was a little thin though.

In universe nitpick for this episode:

-So the new girl gets her job (and rank) back after disobeying orders?

-Little dangerous to do a live fire exercise in an active space port?

-Anyone else put off by Gordon agreeing with the new girl ?  I get that ""lower deck"" or other officers that don't have a lot of contact with Isaac would be untrusting due to lack of familiarity, but bridge crew??"
Shaun the Sheep,"it was a bit too much.  All the joy is gone from this show.  I was happy it was back but geez this one was hard to get through.  Like being at Thanksgiving dinner with that ostracized family member.  First two seasons were fun but don't know if I can recommend season 3 to anyone.    I understand the world is shit sometimes and media has to represent that, but I kind of miss being able to escape a little from the constant losing.  Sad to see the show be so dour and joyless"
Shaun the Sheep,This show was a comedic spoof of Star Trek and now its just a ripoff of Star Trek. What happend to the damn jokes?
Shaun the Sheep,"It was a great watch, and I'm so glad to have this series back. I didn't love the direction of the first episode, however. I have no problems with the dark themes. I just felt like it was too early for it. Personally, I think  if they let the tension within the crew build more, the episode would have hit better later in the season. Obviously, the entire season isn't out yet, so by episode 5, I may feel completely different."
Shaun the Sheep,"Picture of Gordon Ramsay

""Delicious. Finally, some decent fucking Star Trek."""
Shaun the Sheep,How is Seth McFarlane in this?  His screen presence always kinda feels off to me but maybe I just haven't seen him in the right role yet..
Shaun the Sheep,This show is significantly better than Star Trek discovery. I'm glad I have strange new worlds and this show to keep Star Trek alive
Shaun the Sheep,"On Hulu, there are 2 seasons of The Orville, then there's the pilot episode of The Orville: New Horizons. From what I read, there won't be anything further after this season. They should've stopped after season 2. Damn shame."
Shaun the Sheep,"I think some of their takes on suicide were... not right?  


saying it was up to the person that does it after being ostracized and constantly harassed? feels like putting the burden of blame on the victim"
Shaun the Sheep,Is this show better than the current Star Trek shows?
Shaun the Sheep,"I love this show, I enjoyed this episode, and I have nothing but admiration and respect for Penny Johnson and Seth MacFarlane.

...but

That scene where the Doc eventually cries in the holodeck was fucking rubbish."
Shaun the Sheep,"The pacing was bad. Too much filler scenes (how many times must you show people welding a tile to the ship? The “look at the new ship specs” felt empty; these are details, not something you devote a lot of screen time to when you haven’t set up any semblance of a story). It feels like the lengthened format made them lazy with the edits. Zero chemistry between characters, cool new CGI adds nothing. I’d rather have a show with heart/humour/good writing/pacing than listening to bad dialogues and new characters that take themselves too seriously. Such a dissappoinment. Loved seasons 1-2. I hope it gets better."
Shaun the Sheep,Opening screen is a memorial to Norm.
Shaun the Sheep,Same.
Shaun the Sheep,"I started it, and realized almost 3 minutes in I had completely forgot what happened in season 2.   So I need to watch that finale again."
Shaun the Sheep,So is this a comedy or serious show? I thought it was supposed to be funny but the trailers don’t seem that way.
Shaun the Sheep,Horrible episode. Different strokes…
Shaun the Sheep,"Star Trek did go there in TNG, where Worf refused to assist an enemy in sickbay to recover."
Shaun the Sheep,Vote Quimby!
Shaun the Sheep,"I had the same thought, though I felt like the writing missed the mark here and there. One glaring question: if Isaac only did what he did to improve crew efficiency, why did he not tell anyone he was going to do it? Why record a message and do it alone in his room? Anyone asking him that would have lent a lot more richness to his character insofar as there’s not really a completely logical explanation to it."
Shaun the Sheep,"""-Little dangerous to do a live fire exercise in an active space port?""

I hate when I fixate on little things like this, but that bugged me. They couldn't paint the drones with some sort of lager tag set up? Instead they blow them up close to other ships? A waste of materials and very dangerous"
Shaun the Sheep,Season 3 is an unfunny and less creative star trek TNG now.
Shaun the Sheep,"Really agree with your last point. I think I literally shook my head when he said that. It felt like a betrayal, especially after how many personal exchanges Isaac and Gordon had had in previous episodes."
Shaun the Sheep,Seth MacFarlane has made it clear in multiple interviews recently that they are embracing the more serious tone. Let's see if he can deliver with it. I liked Episode 1.
Shaun the Sheep,"Well put. The show lost its heart. After years of pandemic, I personally need escape, adventure and humour, not a depressing slow show with bad writing. Hell, that’s what made the show special."
Shaun the Sheep,MacFarlane always wanted this tone. He couldn't do it earlier because Fox wouldn't greenlight a serious version of the show.
Shaun the Sheep,I was looking for the whole kelly time travel effect. I thought they left off on that?
Shaun the Sheep,"Highly recommend you give Strange New Worlds a try. I'm not a big fan of modern live-action Star Trek, but Strange New Worlds recaptures the magic of 90s Trek. In fact, this may be heresy to say, but Strange New Worlds is *way* better than this premiere episode of The Orville."
Shaun the Sheep,This!
Shaun the Sheep,I agree. He’s like Seinfeld but it’s not endearing. So he just seems off when juxtapositioned with the other professional actors.
Shaun the Sheep,"From what I gather, he’s a big reason the show even exists."
Shaun the Sheep,He's quite good in this one. It takes a few episodes to get into the show though. The first few episodes of Season 1 are a little weak.
Shaun the Sheep,"Are you kidding? He created it. Clearly out of a huge love for TNG. If I had clout and money And I could have asked for a good TNG ripoff where I got to play the captain, I’d be all over that. 

He does pretty well though and the eps he’s written are pretty decent. Though I’d love for them to bring in Ronald D Moore to write an episode or two, for old times sake."
Shaun the Sheep,"Complicated question.

When Discovery first aired in 2017, Orville was seen as a more classic Trek because it was a homage to The Next Generation, and Discovery was doing its own thing that was definitely not classic Trek.

Then Picard aired, and... was not what people wanted. Orville was still seen as a throwback, but also stood on its own a bit better as it had some really interesting episodes in S2.

But now, we have Strange New Worlds, which is a more traditional Trek. In my opinion, Strange New Worlds is better than the Orville as it feels more modern and not stuck in the 90s. It retains the important Trek sensibilities in a way that Discovery or Picard did not.

TLDR: Strange New Worlds > Orville > Discovery > Picard."
Shaun the Sheep,We’re watching them together and like them both!
Shaun the Sheep,"Miles better than Discovery or Picard.  I'd say it goes SNW > Orville > Lower Decks, but all 3 I strongly recommend.  I don't generally like McFarlane's sense of humor so it brings it down a notch, but it's not that present and got toned down by season 2."
Shaun the Sheep,[deleted]
Shaun the Sheep,"YES.

Especially if you're a fan of TNG/DS9. The show feels so much closer to those shows in every way than the current crop of official star trek shows."
Shaun the Sheep,"It will be interesting to see how it compares to Strange New Worlds, but it has been, and still is, far better than Discovery or Picard."
Shaun the Sheep,"There is so much hate for Picard in these comments and I agree it's not exactly what I wanted as a fan. Yet Picard has had some great episodes in particular both season finales. Season 1 ended giving Data the send off he always deserved and even though season 2 was not that great over all the finale might be one of my favorite episodes of all Trek. I was never a big fan of the Q episodes from TNG especially watching them back because it was a completely unfinished story arc. The way Picard finishes Q's story couldn't have been better in my opinion, that finale really sets up a potentially exciting season 3."
Shaun the Sheep,Why?
Shaun the Sheep,It does get better. Waaay better.
Shaun the Sheep,Yeah I watched the last two episodes of Season 2 before starting Season 3.
Shaun the Sheep,Star Trek had silly/fun episodes as well. This show mixes together serious episodes with fun episodes. I'll honestly take ten Bortus pee ceremony episodes over a single Lwaxana Troi episode.
Shaun the Sheep,Season 1 it tries hard to be a comedy with some serious parts here and there. Season 2 it becomes a serious show with some comedy in it. Season three seems to be more serious than two. It's entirely worth watching.
Shaun the Sheep,"The person below said it's a comedy with serious aspects, but in my opinion, it's the exact opposite. It's basically a Star Trek show tone-wise, with a bit of comedy and humor thrown in there. Especially this new season premiere; it was basically devoid of comedy almost entirely. We'll see how the rest of the season pans out."
Shaun the Sheep,It's not as good as season 1 was.
Shaun the Sheep,Comedy that has some serious aspects.
Shaun the Sheep,"To me, it’s like if Star Trek managed comedy better. TNG always flopped on its belly trying to tell a joke. This show is earnest in trying to be a good serial sci fi. It’s not just doing parody. But it has a pretty well tuned funny bone. Watch it in that context."
Shaun the Sheep,"That's unfortunate, embracing the serious tone in season 2 got the show demoted to Hulu.  Hopefully, they can pull this off."
Shaun the Sheep,Well of course Fox didn't want to approve a derivative ripoff of Star Trek. The comedy is what made it original.
Shaun the Sheep,Alternative timeline doctor went back to the past and fixed it.
Shaun the Sheep,I'm watching it right now. So far it's decent but I'm going to let it finish out the season before I go crazy with praise. Discovery seemed promising too at first.
Shaun the Sheep,"Did not know this.  Now you got me excited to see Strange new worlds. As a die hard DS9 & TNG fan (well all 90s ST and even Enterprise, which i didn't like originally), I'd do anything to get 90s style ST back. 

I'm praying J. Michael Straczynski pulls this off with the reboot of 'Babylon 5' but not sure if they'll give him complete control.  Anyways, gonna watch Strange new worlds tonight."
Shaun the Sheep,I may be a minority but I love Disco too. New Star Trek is far better than it has any business being.
Shaun the Sheep,"Which episode do you think it finds the right balance? For me it was episode 6 ""Krill""."
Shaun the Sheep,"I am actually amazed to say this, but SNW is actually quite decent. It's certainly better than Discovery/Picard. But I don't think it's quite as good as Orville. But it's definitely close.

I would group quality in the following way:

(TNG/DS9) > (ORVILLE) > (TOS) > (SNW) > (VOY/ENT) > (DISC/PICARD)

I genuinely like TOS and I recognize the show paved the way for an entire universe worth of science fiction that came in the 70s and onwards.... but the production quality was generally awful, many of the episodes were driven by the easy availability of costumes, sets and props (lets visit the nazi planet, the roman planet, the chicago gangster planet, etc). Many of the episodes are amazing and classic but huge sections of the show are absolutely painful to watch.

TNG represents a very solid refinement of the TOS formula. It has a few spots where the show's quality is trash  (season 1 and big chunks of season 7) but there is a mountain of good trek in there.

DS9 is the TNG quality but with wider story arc and I think that for the most part DSN9 completely nailed it. Generally great writing, great acting, great directing, great special effects, etc. Again, there are weak spots but it's mostly very good.

Orville is basically TNG without star trek IP. Season one is kinda weak (but still worth watching) but the show quality picks up massively in season 2.

SNW might eventually rate higher or lower depending on how the show shapes up. I thought discovery was going to be amazing during season 1 and it disappointed hugely. 

Voyager and Enterprise are in the same basic vein as TNG/DS9 but they are separate due to the much lower quality of the writing and acting. Voyager is especially bad. Each show has some decent story arcs and great episodes mixed in, but the truth is that it's just not that good. 

DISC/PICARD is star trek written by and for non-trekkies. It's trash."
Shaun the Sheep,"wow everyone here is getting me really excited about Strange new worlds. I still watch my favorites all the time DS9, Babylon 5, TNG, Farscape and I've been dying for a quality ST (well quality my what i like which is 90s ST). But now hearing from quite a few people how good SNW is, i couldn't be more excited... thanks"
Shaun the Sheep,It is is a good time to be a Star Trek fan
Shaun the Sheep,"Don't downvote this guy, he is correct."
Shaun the Sheep,"I should clarify.

The scene was going well with all stuff at the start with the kid, and the discussion of the dangers of substituting dead loved ones with simulations. That would have fit perfectly into any random ST episode.

Everything after that with the Doc by herself could have been accomplished in seconds with the zoom in we eventually got...after nearly 2 minutes of her slowly walking around a table, for some reason."
Shaun the Sheep,"Thank you, I had just about given up and was pretty sad about the show losing its sense of adventure/fun and character chemistry. Around what episode does it get better? I started episode 2 yesterday and it was a chore to watch, had to take a break."
Shaun the Sheep,"Nope that's not what got them moved to Hulu. Fox didn't want to spend the extra money Seth MacFarlane was asking for Season 3 so Fox wanted to cancel. Disney moved it to one of their own platforms rather than leasing the show to Fox. 

Also, moving from network TV to one of the top streamers is a promotion, not a demotion."
Shaun the Sheep,"That, and the rapid pacing/editing."
Shaun the Sheep,Yeah I went back and rechecked and I guess they did resolved it but I just thought they would kind of pickup and season 3 where they left off in season 2 cuz it kind of seem like a big deal but now we have this new version which seems like a different Universe than the first two seasons
Shaun the Sheep,"Fair enough! Trek fans have been quite burned by the producers of nuTrek, so I understand holding-off judgement until all the episodes in the season have premiered."
Shaun the Sheep,"Awesome! Just make sure you watch more than the first episode. Personally, I think the first episode is the worst out of all the ones that have premiered so far. But they’re all good, honestly."
Shaun the Sheep,"I'd give Disco a 5.5/10, personally. Honestly, if they just cut back on the melodrama by 75%, then the show could easily shoot up to a 7 or 7.5 - But that would require a fundamental shift in the writing, which would incidentally also improve the show quite a bit. As much as DS9 is my favorite Trek show of all time, the amount of melodrama in that show doesn't even compare to the amount in Disco. Disco is like, ""What if we injected the DNA of a soap-opera into a live-action Star Trek show?"" And I just don't understand why they feel the need to do that. The amount of melodrama is actually *painful* for me to watch sometimes, like I will physically cringe. Anyway, that's just *my* biggest problem with the show. But if someone else likes it, that's great, I'm not here to shit on you. 

The Picard show, though - It's just painfully bad in my opinion. It's so bad that I don't understand how it made it to the screen. Like, actual, *real* human-beings wrote and filmed that show."
Shaun the Sheep,"Totally agree with your overall point, although I have a couple different opinions. Notably, TOS is basically unwatchable to me. There are, of course, some absolutely incredibly episodes. But for the most part, TOS is extremely dated; not just in the set-design and whatnot, but the attitudes in the writing. I understand that it was very progressive for the time; but by today's standards, it's unbearable. This is all, of course, just my opinion.

As for Strange New Worlds, I'm in-love with the show. It's just *soooooo* good. I love the Orville too, but this premiere episode was really weak in my opinion. I have no idea what the fuck was going on; but all the acting felt wooden, especially the new ""Charly"" character (Also, I'm *so* over the whole ""Genius prodigy who's the only one that can fix the situation and oh look at how much of a genius this person is""). And the directing of the episode felt completely all over the place. Maybe it's because McFarlane was trying to capture the slow, misty-eyed elements of a movie like Star Trek: The Motion Picture, as he's stated in interviews. But overall, I just didn't like this premiere episode. Contrast that to Strange New Worlds, which came swinging right out of the gate with a fantastic opener, and it's only gotten better since. I don't really enjoy the other nuTrek live-action shows; I watch them for the most part, but it's more a chore than anything. I don't actually look forward to any of the new episodes. But Strange New Worlds is different; it's just so much better.

Also, have you watched Lower Decks? It might actually be my third favorite Trek show of all time. I love it so much."
Shaun the Sheep,"So I wanna speak to your point - The doc's walk around the table was part of a larger disjointed first episode that I felt was taking place as I watched it. I thought the episode was *decent*. But there was something with either the script, directing or acting that really held this episode back. I don't know how to describe it, but it was jarring. Everything felt so out-of-sync, and I have no idea why."
Shaun the Sheep,"If it was moving the ""numbers"" significantly they would have definitely kept it on Fox; network TV is always going to get more eyes on it than a niche show exclusive to a streaming site."
Shaun the Sheep,"Fwiw I think your assessment is totally fair. To me the show’s pivot point has always been humanity and nature as much as science fiction. If you look at the intro, it’s thematically all about the intersection of nature and science. So I guess I’m a bit more accepting of the melodrama since the show is aiming to exist in a different space than I think other Treks have. That said, TNG certainly had its fair share, lest we forget the Troi episodes.

I haven’t seen any Picard so I have no opinion on it but your opinion certainly doesn’t seem unique there."
Shaun the Sheep,"> I have no idea why.

I hope I''m wrong, but I suspect we're seeing a bit of a George Lucas in the 1990s kinda thing. 

It doesn't matter if you're the literal genius who breaths life into this creation, you still need people around you that you respect enough to listen when they to tell you to dial it back, or try it a different way, or cut it altogether."
Shaun the Sheep,"It's completely the opposite. Most to all popular shows nowadays are on streaming apps and the shows that aren't are usually only heard of because of the streaming service they're on.

Really the only shows this doesn't apply to are HBO shows.

A show being on a streaming service instead of a TV Network is absolutely and unequivocally  a ""promotion""."
Shaun the Sheep,"1,000 percent!"
Shaun the Sheep,"Oh Brian, you came! No, I just spilt my drink."
Shaun the Sheep,"The episode where they go clubbing really comes to mind (although I haven't seen it in well over a decade). They hang out with this club rat  all episode and then they are all partying their minds out. The guy stops dancing, looks around and sees everyone else dancing (and I think some drugs were involved) and says to himself: ""looks like my work here is done"" and then just leaves dramatically in a blinding white light.  Not sure why I found it so funny but I did."
Shaun the Sheep,"""smoke a fattyboombatty till we're absolutely munted""

God I absolutely loved this show."
Shaun the Sheep,Maybe my favourite series ever.

Shaun the Sheep,Best show ever
Shaun the Sheep,"Aside from the other ones posted, here's one of my top moments:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1yuhBtdHL0"
Moomins,"Neat. I used to love watching this back in the early 90’s on CBBC, a little creepy, but great."
Moomins,"I've been binging this since yesterday and it's even better than I remembered from my childhood. The playlist that I've linked might direct you to the final episode, but all episodes are available, at least the first season that got dubbed from Japanese to English"
Moomins,[removed]
Moomins,"I randomly get compilations recommended to me on YouTube of this show. I don't know why I never watch the show before, but it looks really bizarre in a calming way."
Moomins,I can't watch the Moomins unless they speak Swedish with a Finnish accent.
Moomins,"I watched the Norwegian dub as a kid, myself. But no, I think you would have to pay for it unfortunately. But I found myself really enjoying the English dub, too"
Moomins,I'd love to see something closer to Tove Jansson's original art. 
Moomins,I have a Moomin tattoo on my hand. http://imgur.com/a/dOJWX
Moomins,I must be the one one here who always thought the moomin was a bizarre animation. Never like it as a kid. Find it quite strange still as a man-child
Moomins,"Wow The Moomins was something I completely forgot existed, even though I loved it as a kid"
Moomins,"Remake ALL THE THINGS!

But seriously, I can see this going horribly wrong. It could be made in bad 3D animation, watered down where all the darker subjects get cut out, modern pop-culture references forcibly melded to characters... Another childhood memory completely desecrated.

Here's hoping it will actually be good."
Moomins,"If it's anything like the [2014 Moomins on the Riviera film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ie8lqrOe_4) from the same company, I'm sure it will be great.

It's definitely worth a look."
Moomins,[removed]
Moomins,"Also, the director for this series is Steve Box, who directed films and shorts for Aardman like Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit."
Moomins,This cartoon freak the fuck out of anyone else as a kid?
Moomins,"Yes, fuck them so hard. Worst shit ever."
Moomins,"I used to love this in the 90's. Amazing theme song too, which was in every version except for the Japanese one."
Moomins,what channel
Moomins,"We love the laughter and we love the living. The Moomins. 

I thought I was the only one who sang this song just because it was that good"
Moomins,That's the ending theme! Wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as the theme song.
The Last Nazis,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Last Nazis,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Last Nazis,[removed]
The Last Nazis,[removed]
The Last Nazis," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Last Nazis,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Last Nazis,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Last Nazis,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Last Nazis,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Last Nazis,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Last Nazis,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Last Nazis,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Last Nazis,Rat King is coming
The Last Nazis,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Last Nazis,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Last Nazis,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Last Nazis,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Last Nazis,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Last Nazis,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Last Nazis,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Last Nazis,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Last Nazis,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Last Nazis,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Last Nazis,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Last Nazis,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Last Nazis,[removed]
The Last Nazis,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Last Nazis,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Last Nazis,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Last Nazis,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Last Nazis,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Last Nazis,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Last Nazis,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Last Nazis,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Last Nazis,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Last Nazis,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Last Nazis,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Last Nazis,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Last Nazis,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Last Nazis,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Last Nazis,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Last Nazis,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Last Nazis,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Last Nazis,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Last Nazis,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Last Nazis,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Last Nazis,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Last Nazis,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Last Nazis,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Last Nazis,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Last Nazis,[deleted]
The Last Nazis,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Last Nazis,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Last Nazis,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Last Nazis,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Last Nazis,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Last Nazis,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Last Nazis,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Last Nazis,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Last Nazis,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Last Nazis,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Last Nazis,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Last Nazis,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Last Nazis,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Last Nazis,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Last Nazis,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Last Nazis,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Last Nazis,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Last Nazis,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Last Nazis,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Last Nazis,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Last Nazis,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Last Nazis,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Last Nazis,We gonna get the rat king.
The Last Nazis,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Last Nazis,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Last Nazis,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Last Nazis,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Last Nazis,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Last Nazis,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Last Nazis,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Last Nazis,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Last Nazis,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Last Nazis,[removed]
The Last Nazis,[removed]
The Last Nazis,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Last Nazis,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Last Nazis,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Last Nazis,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Last Nazis,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Last Nazis,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Last Nazis,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Last Nazis,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Last Nazis,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Last Nazis,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Last Nazis, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Last Nazis,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Last Nazis,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Last Nazis,And more golfing
The Last Nazis,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Hells Kitchen,They shoot for 16-18 hours 6 days a week so it’s easy to have an off night.  In addition the dinner service is a couple hours but they just show you the couple instances where they mess up.
Hells Kitchen,"Gordon forbids instant-read thermometers just because it makes for more drama.

Every kitchen uses instant read thermometers. They are a tool, not a crutch."
Hells Kitchen,[deleted]
Hells Kitchen,"The producers look for a very specific type of ""chef"" when they cast for the show, they are looking for people who have worked in and even managed professional kitchens but not actual fine dining. Also who have inflated egos and who overestimate their actual cooking skill, preferably with emotional maturity deficiencies.  These producers have figured out there are plenty such people working in food service, and that they the are the perfect set up for the exact type of drama they want to create on the show.

There is a huge difference between working in a run of the mill, ""nice but not fancy"" white table cloth kind of place, and working in a place that has a Michelen star type of reputation on the line. 

Don't get me wrong, all kitchen work is demanding and oftentimes just plain hard, but it really is a whole different ball game working at the highest level of fine dining, where you're expected to hold yourself and everyone around you to the highest possible standards in everything you do. It takes years to fully acclimate to that environment, and even then it is incredibly stressful, daily. In Hell's Kitchen they try to make people who imagine themselves to be seasoned pros and try to acclimate them to that world in a matter of days, and predictably the meltdowns ensue.

No, the episodes are not staged but the dramatic blow ups are highly engineered."
Hells Kitchen,Its more that its edited to portray things a certain way
Hells Kitchen,"In the defense of Gordon Ramsay, I do feel as though some of the excessive drama is staged, especially in the latter seasons, but having been a line cook for most of my life, there is a BIG difference between most commercial restaurant kitchens and those of fine dining establishments. 

While I've only worked in hotel kitchens throughout the DMV, I did spend a week in an actual fine dining restaurant in New York and the level of service was on an entirely different plain of existence. 

Even with my experience, there was a much higher level of service and perfection wasnt expected, it was demanded and when I did make mistakes, they spiralled throughout the entire team. 

It was like being a part of a machine and having one bad rotation that then completely threw off the rotation cycle both metaphorically and literally."
Hells Kitchen,"I'm convinced that all cooking competition shows have producer gremlins. Someone who accidentally lowers or raises the temperature of an oven, removes a needed tool, or makes sure there's only one container of a necessary ingredient to go around.

Not exactly a script, but definitely a way to manufacture drama."
Hells Kitchen,"This also seems a bit sped up probably. And a lot of these chefs are not experienced. Some are but others have only worked a couple years in kitchens. If you are throwing in the pressure, the speed, the lack of help I don’t know why you think people trying to compete with others would fail sometimes. You are also comparing a 10 dollar omelette which doesn’t even get checked probably to a 150 dollar steak which have to meet his standards."
Hells Kitchen,It’s real but manufactured competition to create tension and drama. So they don’t get all the tools and are deliberately placed in very difficult situations.
Hells Kitchen,"* Dinner service apparently lasts a lot longer. Like hours while serving hundreds of dishes. The camera only catches the moments that they screw up.
* Different kitchen and appliances may play a role. You are cooking in a completely alien environment compared to usual, and even the same recipe can have wildly different result depends on the heat setting etc
* Lots and lots of pressures. Competitors are locked in a dorm with no Internet and ways to contact the outside world (understandable so they can not simply leak the results etc). They also can not contact their family. Accompanied with being bombarded by GR, it happened. 

Also I think it's part of the producer effects to specifically pick certain participants with high ego and what not."
Hells Kitchen,It’s not one service u see. U see a week or month of service and usually they have a couple thing of each of the chef to pick over. The whole idea is for tv drama but also works to see how bad each chef will get. It is still a job competition too
Hells Kitchen,"I ain't no bitch, chef"
Hells Kitchen,"Trained on other menus, with more room for error, more options to correct mistakes, simpler dishes, etc...

Obvious the show is exaggerated for effect. Ramsey over-fixates on small issues because it makes good tv, but I still believe that not everyone knows how to make risotto, or properly cook Halibut. Working at IHOP doesn't teach you have to nail a scallop."
Hells Kitchen,"Yes, it's staged, in the sense that the people running the show manipulate the contestants, the situations, and the editing to produce the most drama.

Even though it's called ""reality TV,"" there isn't that much that's real about it."
Hells Kitchen,"Everyone here has mentioned the grocery list of reasons why it's likely staged. What I just want is for reality television to get its head out of its ass already with the kayfabe shit.

For those unfamiliar with wrestling lingo, kayfabe refers to staying in character. In the pro wrestling industry, it was standard practice up until the late 90s that performers had to stay in character in outside media as well as pretend any ongoing storylines are honest to god reality. Consequences could be severe for anybody who breaks kayfabe, as the industry was fiercely protective of the perception that pro-wrestling is a legit sport. Most people knew it was scripted, of course, but it was often hard to tell at times because nobody really knew.

That's where reality tv is at right now. We all know it's fake, but they still have their heads stuck in the sand pretending we don't. Get rid of all the stupid non-disclosure agreements where you can't talk about behind the scenes stuff even after the airdate. We know about wrestlers keeping razor blades in their wristbands, I want to know if the rumours of remote-controlled appliances are true."
Hells Kitchen,"u/c_rookie - you want to address this? I wouldn't blame you if not, LOL."
Hells Kitchen,"I've always felt it was fake, or at least partially. I think there are two real candidates that Ramsay picks then the rest of the chefs are cast to fill a role, much like Big Brother. They add drama with fake scoring of team based challenges, I think a lot of the outcomes from challenges and service are all planned out in advance and they stage things to help the producers narrative play out. 

Just my personal feeling I get when I watch it."
Hells Kitchen,"everyone is staged. Hells Kitchen isn't the worst but it is one of the biggest. 

Ramsey picks 2-3 out of the list of everyone, then they bring in the rest. Then they go though the show. All of the appliances are 'remote controlled' go with me here. They can turn the stoves off or put the temps in the pizza oven from 400-500 in a second. You see this a lot to build drama. For example scallops. Anyone can cook them but can anyone cook them when the stove get's cooled down without anyone noticing it or heat it up and watch the fire start. Remember, how the spaghetti pot sometimes isn't at a boil and Ramsey yells? Donkey the stove isn't even on but they said they remember it. Yeah. 

It's silly stuff like that. They are always watching on the cameras and after the two weeks, they make a show out of it. Sometimes Ramsey has to reshoot something or you can pick his voice when he has to redub something. Usually, his back is to the camera when it happens. 

Then there is the chaos of calling the tickets. Some of the non-three people have never worked a line in their life. Tickets get called and Ramsey knows which ones are confused... read it back and poof, drama. 

It's not like they can't cook. It's that it's cut on the floor to look like they can't. 

If you watch the food network shows they are better at it but silly stuff still happens. 

I honestly know about all the BS but I still love watching Hells Kitchen. Usually you can pick the top 2-3 out after the third or fourth episode but it's fun to watch them do the dance."
Hells Kitchen,Tv fake? No way
Hells Kitchen,It's fake. A 3cstar Michellen restaurant and not a single hair net
Hells Kitchen,Because capable talented chefs would make for bad tv. I think I stopped somewhere around season 8 when i binged.
Hells Kitchen,"I’m sorry are you seriously asking if a reality show is staged?

How stupid are you lmao"
Hells Kitchen,you can walk right? why arn't you an Olympic marathon runner? it's basically just fast walking right? are you the dumbest walker on earth? why can't you win an olympic gold medal in walking fast?

Hells Kitchen,"They require the cooks to make everything to-order, and eliminate a lot of shortcuts that any sane chef would use."
Hells Kitchen,"All reality TV is staged to different degrees, some completely, some partially. Assuming Hell’s Kitchen is only partially staged you have to realize these chefs are learning a new kitchen, equipment, head chef, recipes, and stations while filming long hours and barely sleeping which helps nudge the drama along. Also, not all of them have experience in a high volume, busy restaurant. 

And don’t forget, editing can make you see whatever the show runners want you to."
Hells Kitchen,"One-stress of competition. Two-working with those you really don't know, who are competing against you, in a kitchen not your own, doing plates, not your own."
Hells Kitchen,"I mean of course it's staged. When they do the challenges it always (99% of the time anyway) comes down to the last dish or whatever to see who wins. Really??? There is NEVER a blowout by one team??? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show but that aspect of it always irritates me on every episode."
Hells Kitchen,"As with ~~most~~ all ""reality"" TV, if it isn't outright scripted, it's mostly staged and the drama and difficulty is contrived to be more than it really is."
Hells Kitchen,"I'd add that they are thrown at random stations and swap the menu constantly. Yeah, I can see how someone would make 2-3 mistakes over the course of a night (which is often enough to get sent home)."
Hells Kitchen,"Most reality shows follow the same basic rules:
- Select people with personalities that are considered aggressive or abrasive.
- Keep them stressed out and sleep deprived, or occasionally drunk, to keep emotions and simple mistakes at an all-time high.
- Give them tasks and give them a time limit that is extremely difficult to meet.
- Watch the TV magic happen."
Hells Kitchen,"when  i bought one for the first time about a year ago it was a lifechanger.. is that pie done in the middle? Before I'd over cook things to 'make sure' and now i stab it, the pumpkin pie filling is 200F and i'm just like yup that's it."
Hells Kitchen,I remember he told one of the chefs not have one and I remember my girlfriend who was a chef at the time literally saying why? A lot of those things are pretty common now in steakhouses to save on waste. The touch and feel technique is more of a showman thing.
Hells Kitchen,"This gave me a rage flashback. When I graduated high school my parents were pushing me pretty hard to do some kind of further education, so I picked cooking school. At the time the school was accredited and had a huge rep for being the Place to Go, but I had a really bad time there for several reasons. But I remember that our chef would have us make things like a genoise cake, and he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.” (Wut)

Eventually I caught on that they actually just didn’t have enough mixers for all of us to use one and I started to get suspicious.

Anyway the environment was crazy toxic overall and I dropped out after about 4 months when my mental health absolutely tanked. My parents were maximum disappointed in me, but I got mad vindicated when the lawsuits against the school started rolling in a few years later, and it was eventually shut down after being repeatedly sued for its false claims about the success they could provide you with if you went there. Which made sense because they would get you internships after you were there for maybe 14 months, and when I quit I was working in a Papa Murphys, and a guy got hired at the Papa Murphys as his internship from the school."
Hells Kitchen,"I saw a recipe video of his a few days ago.  The dude was making pasta and said in the video ""first you start with the most amazing water"" and I was like I don't think hes really a chef."
Hells Kitchen,"There have been some past contestants that've talked about how the producers did all they could to fuck with the contestants. Like keeping them standing around for hours while the get enough footage of the food, how they contestants were sleep deprived  so they were constantly on edge. 

Add in the idea that there's a single dramatic person that stirs up trouble that lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6, I wouldn't put it past the producers from telling Gordon and the others ""Keep this person around"" and feeding the judges small guidances. It's definitely not staged but it's definitely not some ideal situation where you just have to be a good chef."
Hells Kitchen,"This is something the other main posts are missing. The episodes are heavily edited, and things are sometimes out of context, stitched together, and shown out of order. If you really pay attention, you can see that the dinner service footage is sometimes not shown in proper order, a lot of times to make it look like someone's reacting to something that happened they're trying to make look like was a big deal when it wasn't."
Hells Kitchen,Does the DMV have good kitchens?  I assumed if anything it would just be cafeteria and vending machine food.
Hells Kitchen,"Its a 5-6 hour service that gets condensed into a 20-25 minute segment of the show. Pretty much all of the mistakes get put in the show and it really isn't a lot of them for the overall night but there is a ton of pressure to do good and Gordon really puts on the pressure for every single mistake. 

It's also very stressful because its so fast paced. The show is only filmed in a few weeks. The services are usually every single day, sometimes they skip a day but it's almost always all filmed within 5 or 6 weeks and they are working 12-16 hour days every single day"
Hells Kitchen,"I totally agree with you on this. Being from the UK, I often see the US reality shows and think how unrealistic and over dramatic they are compared to the ones produced over here. 

It was at this point when I realised that all ""reality"" shows film for 4 or 5 hours a day, and for a week, or a month. Then they just hand pick all the most dramatic and exciting/interesting footage that they imagine will keep people watching, you can imagine how much content ends up on the cutting room floor and how many times people have arguments or screaming fits at each other. 

Same with the talent shows on TV when they have the crazy nutjobs on, you know they were already aware of this before letting them on, so why do it? Just for views, much more interesting than boring people who are talented."
Hells Kitchen,"I did a lot of restaurant kitchen work back in college and for a while afterwards, so I have a good idea of how the back of the house actually works. It amuses me no end to watch Hell's Kitchen because a lot of the contestants look like they'd struggle to make eggs and sausage for the family on a Sunday morning."
Hells Kitchen,Even fucking Dr. Phil uses methods like this.
Hells Kitchen,"Exactly, just shake up the coke bottle til it explodes"
Hells Kitchen,"That’s unsafe. You need the pumpkin pie to be over 212 for safe consumption.   You gotta boil that sumbitch

Edit: people really needed the /s huh"
Hells Kitchen,">he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.

Lmao I don't get why schools impose such artificial limitations on students. It's like a programming class that says you're not allowed to use code libraries. But in a professional industry time is money, and everyone uses a library if they can."
Hells Kitchen,"> lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6,

that must be why in the final rounds it gets so professional"
Hells Kitchen,"It's also been stated that the producers and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen, like turn off/change the heat on a burner/stove, hide ingredients, move things from where they left them, etc."
Hells Kitchen,"He means the DC, Maryland and Virginia corridor. Not the Dept. of Motor Vehicles."
Hells Kitchen,"Considering I've worked in the cities of D.C, Baltimore, Alexandria and Hyattsville, I would say that assumption is entirely wrong. 

Several of the hotels and restaurants I've worked at in those cities have been highly rated and while not fine dining, the kitchens were rather well to do in most respects. 

I only jumped around because I cant sit still and being young at that time, I wanted to learn everything from everyone. 

Only reason why I remain at my current job is because I'm the only Black female chef there and I'm arrogant enough to say that I can cook circles around my colleagues."
Hells Kitchen,"I would agree especially risotto and scallions...

THEY ARE BURNED YOU DONKEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Hells Kitchen,"You said “even Dr Phil” like Dr Phil isn’t one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. He is a grifter, con man."
Hells Kitchen,LeVar Burton does not endorse or approve boiling any sums of bitches.
Hells Kitchen,"Not using code libraries at the beginning kind of makes sense though, cause your usually meant to learn Gad algorithms behind those libraries at that point"
Hells Kitchen,"""Been stated that""? Has there been anything other that a reddit post by a fan suggesting that as a possibility?"
Hells Kitchen,">and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen

Um, isnt there any sexual allegations in this regard? They should outright sue them because of this."
Hells Kitchen,"DC, Maryland, Virginia."
Hells Kitchen,I think they thought Dept. of Motor Vehicles lol. As a Baltimoron myself most people that aren't from around dunno DMV🤣
Hells Kitchen,Oh…. I seriously thought you worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Now it makes sense.
Hells Kitchen,"It was a season 6 contestant, Tek Moore."
Hells Kitchen,"Two contestants, Jen Yemola and Tek Moore, both stated that a lot of the drama was artificially created (and that Gordon Ramsey was fed lines through an ear piece).

But really, it's common in reality television."
Hells Kitchen,"""fuck with them"" means mess with their heads - so if someone leaves the paprika on their station, someone on the crew will grab it and move it to another contestant's station, for example"
Hells Kitchen,Corrected.
Hells Kitchen,"You're fine mate, I really need to get out of that Marylander habit of not spelling out that acronym."
Hells Kitchen,The idea of certain dmvs having high end fine dining is pretty funny.
Hells Kitchen,Hell's Kitchen is my personal favorite form of schadenfreude.
Hells Kitchen,It’s Reddit on TV without the mods. Ramsey says it like he wants to.
Hells Kitchen,"It got boring for me-well except seeing our pasta boy Adam Pawlak the season before.  Mainly because I would love for them to change up the menu & get rid of scallops, risotto & beef Wellington. Like chefs can't massively screw up any other dish????"
Hells Kitchen,Have you seen the UK episodes? They’re so much better
Hells Kitchen,"That’s ironic, considering how produced and scripted Hell’s Kitchen US is"
Hells Kitchen,"Agreed on the menu being too samey. I understand it's Ramsey's kitchen and it's fine dining, but the most exciting part for me is when they come up with their own dishes to cook."
Hells Kitchen,I like all versions of it.
Hells Kitchen,"> Have you seen the UK episodes? They’re so much better  

Just curious: are you sure you're not thinking of Kitchen Nightmares? The Hell's Kitchen in the UK was so long ago, and didn't last very long:  

* S1 (2004) head chef is Ramsay, before he started USA HK in 2005; Angus Deayton is the presenter   
* S2 (2005) head chefs are Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli; Angus Deayton is the presenter  
* S3 (2007) head chef is Marco Pierre White; Angus Deayton is the presenter  
* S4 (2009) head chef is Marco Pierre White; Claudia Winkleman is the presenter  
* And that's it...there were only 4 series (seasons) of HK in the UK  
* There were 6 seasons of HK in Poland, 5 each in Russia and Italy, and 4 each in Brazil and Bulgaria; just sayin'"
Hells Kitchen,">	Just curious: are you sure you’re not thinking of Kitchen Nightmares? The Hell’s Kitchen in the UK was so long ago, and didn’t last very long:

I wasn’t, but you do make a good point for sure.

Also the UK version of Kitchen Nightmares was so good compared to the US version. It was genuinely great candid TV to watch"
Hells Kitchen,"> the UK version of Kitchen Nightmares was so good compared to the US version. It was genuinely great candid TV to watch

Absolutely. That's why I thought you might have been thinking of it, instead of HK. For me, KN UK is soooo much better than KN USA. But for HK, the USA version is tops in my book."
Hells Kitchen,I get this. I usually love Hell’s Kitchen but the Young Guns one is just ok.
Hells Kitchen,[deleted]
Hells Kitchen,"I have seen every season, except this one. No interest."
Hells Kitchen,The promos for it turned me off completely. Can't wait for a main season to begin. I'm glad it's okay cause I figured it'd be a mess IMO.
Hells Kitchen,"I watched the entire thing. It was interesting to see the issues they tackled as a new country (currency, deportation, disasters). I'd say the first 3/4 of the season are good. Because I forgot it was the CW and it was then bogged down in relationship drama. Still worth a one season watch. Despite the CW crap I do wish it was renewed."
Hells Kitchen,[deleted]
Hells Kitchen,I watched one episode to see how well the Quebec locations imitated New Hampshire. It was very close to the real thing.
Hells Kitchen,"It was also a terribly placed summer show. I don't think anyone even knew it was there.

Also some of their characters just disappear for a majority of the season. It was weird introducing them and then just having them leave. Contract issues or covid? 

If you liked Lincoln from Agents of SHIELD he's a main character in this."
Hells Kitchen,and half of the cast dies in the opening credits....
Hells Kitchen,That felt so much longer than 57 seconds.
Hells Kitchen,"Do you watch the show?

The over-the-top intros are, in some strange way, a normal part of the show.  I mean, [have the whole damn set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Che4Zm1MoNY) and watch the descent into madness."
Hells Kitchen,As an animator and vfx artist a lot of this was probably really difficult to do. They might have just got bad footage but i dont thinks its nearly as bad as you say.
Hells Kitchen,I like the opening to [Season 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_n8ju1oZrs) the best.
Hells Kitchen,"All the HK intros are like that.  A completely odd theme with a  lot of CG. 

I actually am usually pretty impressed with the special effects on the show, they do these neat little animated pitchforks before commercials.  There are hundreds of them over the years and they are generally incredibly varied and original. "
Hells Kitchen,That was cool as fuck
Hells Kitchen,Ahahaha fucking Sherkeena with that big horn! Classic!
Hells Kitchen,"The Hell's Kitchen intros are always like this, they're crazy ridiculous green screen crap. 

I'd rather have this than some generic intro showing off the chefs. "
Hells Kitchen,You just watch this to hear the clever ways Ramsey finds to insult the contestants. 
Hells Kitchen,"That was entertaining.
Is the show like that at all? "
Hells Kitchen,That seemed fun. Never watched the show but maybe they don't take themselves (the producers) too seriously?
Hells Kitchen,"Yeah, they lost all the good graphic designers from season 6. Half-man half-donkey 100% quality television. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXq0bsh14gU&index=6&list=PL5YxTzPk7mn5jsu7K7JCLmZ1SXa67g01g"
Hells Kitchen,Technically that's not bad a all. Conceptually on the other hand...
Hells Kitchen,Eddie = Edward Snow'din
Hells Kitchen,"Kitchen Knightmares is the better Gordon Ramsay show.

And The F Word."
Hells Kitchen,"All of those special effects, shitty as they may be, would cost you significantly more than $50."
Hells Kitchen,"As someone who has tried animation and graphic design I was actually impressed and this definitely takes some skill to do. I don't think OP has ever tried to program or design anything on a computer. I may be a little bias though, I fucking love this show."
Age of Rebellion,"This reminds me of a post I saw on Twitter with all the character posters from Rogue One asking ""Who deserves their own show next?"". I'm not so sure that the character of Cassian Andor even ""deserved"" his own show. Don't get me wrong Andor is maybe my favorite tv show this year and certainly the best thing on Disney+ to date, but the show wasn't carried on the back of some hype worthy but underutilized character, it was carried by a incredible supporting cast, a smart and thoughtful script, and beautiful cinematography and production design. None of the characters in Rogue One are untapped mines of obvious potential, but if you take any of them and treat them with the same care as a character that Tony Gilroy gave to Cassian Andor you could probably find another critical hit among the cast."
Age of Rebellion,The star was the friends we made along the way
Age of Rebellion,"ok, now the andorian’s are just trolling this subreddit, right?"
Age of Rebellion,I could be marooned on an uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean and a message in a bottle would wash up and all the message would say would be “have you watched Andor yet?”
Age of Rebellion,what is this r/andor
Age of Rebellion,The r/television subscribers were never the star of this subreddit - the disney PR team was
Age of Rebellion,Bold move posting more Andor stuff here. Hope it pays off for you.
Age of Rebellion,"Yo, if you guys don’t stop the Andor spam I’m gonna go ahead and block this sub, this shit is ridiculous, admins wtf is this"
Age of Rebellion,"wow you blew my mind, headline."
Age of Rebellion,That’s it.  I’m officially boycotting this show.  Someone has to take a stand.
Age of Rebellion,"How much more $$$ is Disney going to throw at these “articles?”

The brand is damaged, Andor could be The Sopranos (it’s not even close to the best of HBO) and those fans who left the franchise still won’t return. 

The constant barrage is now keeping people away."
Age of Rebellion,"Shut up about Andor, Jesus Christ"
Age of Rebellion,I’m about to unsubscribe if I see another Andor post. This shit is brutal.
Age of Rebellion,Just make it stop
Age of Rebellion,"I’ve been on a hunger strike until I stop seeing Andor articles here, I think I’m going to starve to death…."
Age of Rebellion,"Damn what even is this headline? What a ""nothing"" sentiment - like why is this even a thing being pondered in journalism?"
Age of Rebellion,Another Andor post? Disney people must be working overtime now.
Age of Rebellion,"No, he's the star of the show. He's name is in the title and gets top credit."
Age of Rebellion,I honestly think this show would’ve done better numbers if it was called Rebellion or something. Andor wasn’t a very memorable character in Rogue One in my opinion and thinking it was about him made me write it off immediately. I didn’t know how great the show would be!
Age of Rebellion,"I’m begging people to actually value actors who give more subdued/withholding/quiet performances. Cassian Andor and OJ Haywood from *Nope* are two of the most impressive performances of the year in part because Luna and Kaluuya are doing so much skillful work on the margins without being given loud, declarative dialogue. Little smirks, facial twitches, brief looks, a small scoff… this stuff matters just as much (and maybe a lot more, honestly) as the louder performances that get most of the attention.

Diego Luna does impeccable work all across the series to build, bit by bit, a convincing character who’s silence and quiet nature speaks magnitudes. Cassian wants very badly to be just some side character in the world of this budding rebellion. Some dude who just clocks in, robs a vault, and then gets to live comfortably in obscurity. So of course he keeps his head down, and stays quiet, and tries hard not to ruffle any feathers. The beauty is in watching him - and watching his face - realize that isn’t possible, and that the Empire (read: fascism) will come for everyone, including him and the people he loves. So he might as well fuckin’ fight.

I love just about every supporting performance in the show (Ebon Moss-Bachrach! Fiona effin’ Shaw! Adria Arjona! Alex Lawther! Andy Serkis! Denise Gough! All so good!) but let’s not get it twisted: Luna is the star and he’s a damn good one. Just the kind of star that often goes unfairly overlooked."
Age of Rebellion,Wake up babe. More paid Andor articles.
Age of Rebellion,Let’s not forget his mother also has the name Andor and she was an important part of the rebellion uprising.
Age of Rebellion,"Babe, it’s time for your four times daily Andor article."
Age of Rebellion,"Oh man, I'm glad someone finally made a post about Andor.  I haven't seen ANYTHING about it on /r/television before."
Age of Rebellion,"I'm sick of being told to watch this. I'm going to make it my life's goal to never watch it out of spite.


Edit: I'm also going to tell other people they shouldn't watch it. Not actively, but like if it ever comes up in casual conversation I'll say they shouldn't watch it."
Age of Rebellion,Watching the finale was a strange experience. It was literally about an occupying army suppressing local rebellion. It was so on the nose there was even an IED explosion scene. Yet American audiences feel like they are identifying with the rebels.
Age of Rebellion,"They should have called the show ""The Uprising"" or ""The Rebellion"" and more people would've watched. A lot of people didn't find the premise interesting knowing the fate of the protagonist. Also, Andor wasn't particularly interesting in Rogue One. I feel like if they renamed the show and have Andor in it as a character a lot more people would've watched."
Age of Rebellion,"No, B2EMO was."
Age of Rebellion,We were all Cassian Andor
Age of Rebellion,i blocked u/chrisbokiul because of the Andor spam on my front page now this shill is picking up the slack.
Age of Rebellion,"As I was watching the show, I honestly kept thinking if it even needed to be about Cassian at all. Like it could easily have been the exact same with a brand new character instead of Cassian."
Age of Rebellion,Andor fucking sucks
Age of Rebellion,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Age of Rebellion,"Andor big good Star Wars show, nobody talk watch Andor so good TV, Star show good Wars talk watch Andor, best Disney big Andor good show, watch? Talk nobody Wars? Star Andor!"
Age of Rebellion,"After all these paid puff pieces that are posted here, I've been telling people not to watch it. It feels like an awful show and I will tell this to everyone."
Age of Rebellion,This is the way
Age of Rebellion,"So yea I've ultimately accepted that this sub and those websites are nothing more than a stinking pile of advertisements in disguise, going to unsub"
Age of Rebellion,Do I need to unsub from r/television? Why is there a post about this show every day? FFS
Age of Rebellion,Leaving this sub until Andor ends
Age of Rebellion,"Babe wake up, another Andor post"
Age of Rebellion,Alright it's about time to unsub from these garbage circle jerk subs
Age of Rebellion,"It’s the best Star Wars property. I am 39, so it’s mature theme carried me like rouge one, even more so. I never really was all in on the rest of Star Wars,  but more of this and you will have a new wave of different Star Wars fans."
Age of Rebellion,"I stopped watching ANY Disney affiliated content a long time ago. Not about to start now because the millionth shill is blasting another pseudo-intellectual take on a show that’s too little too late. Die, Disney, die!"
Age of Rebellion,"Okay, sure, interesting... 😴"
Age of Rebellion,">Don't get me wrong Andor is maybe my favorite tv show this year and certainly the best thing on Disney+ to date, but the show wasn't carried on the back of some hype worthy but underutilized character, it was carried by a incredible supporting cast, a smart and thoughtful script, and beautiful cinematography and production design.

My post thoughts on the show clarify that every character in the show is a separation by degree from Cassian Andor. When the question was asked, why him and my first thought was six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

So how do we get from Cassian Andor the mook, to Capt Andor of the new republic intelligence service and how do you identify weak points in the empire that would leverage the kind of reaction that Luthen wanted and achieved.

Why Luthen chose Andor is kind of fuzzy cause I don't think the show really showed that part of the seduction very well, if at all. Luthen did not need Cassian for the heist, he needed him for his floating morality and his ability to be trained in asymmetric warfare and recruitment. 

Mon Mothma was never going to fight the Empire, at best she is a figure head meant to give legitimacy. People on Ferrix probably would have viewed her like Pelosi or Clinton, but someone like Andor, they would fight. 

So he was not the star, but he was the focus and the lens that shows why every day people would rise up."
Age of Rebellion,I swear to Jesus…
Age of Rebellion,Andor conversations are now officially as lame as grogu conversations. Please stop.
Age of Rebellion,"Again with the fucking andor shill, its beyond obvious at this point just put a limit on show advertsiments per week"
Age of Rebellion,"Cassian Andor was never the star of his own series, B2EMO was"
Age of Rebellion,Andor is Maarva's last name
Age of Rebellion,"Well yes, but it’s not like there was no Cassian either. We get more about him than about actual rebellion members. His family and friends, that wouldn’t need so much on screen time if this was purely about the rebellion

If you think about it, the original trilogy, too, is more about the galaxy, the rebellion and empire, than about Luke himself. So…"
Age of Rebellion,"The biggest mistake they made was giving it the title “andor”

Should have been something like Star Wars: Rouges"
Age of Rebellion,ITT: People forgetting that reddit has always been a wretched hive of scum and villainy (and astroturfing).
Age of Rebellion,"This reminds me of a post I saw earlier today. And last night. Yesterday afternoon. And again in 5 mins. And later this evening I am sure.

Andor, Andor, Andor, Andor, geezus it's at nausea."
Age of Rebellion,Disney really lost money with this show didn't they? How else do you explain the constant stream of bs posts about this somewhat above average show
Age of Rebellion,Tony Gilroy and Yip Man are my best friends
Age of Rebellion,I always had the feeling watching the show that cassian was a bit slow. Like he isn’t computing half of the time.
Age of Rebellion,"Well maybe it should be called ""The Rebellion"" then"
Age of Rebellion,"Cassian Andor will do anything to survive, we see that in the first 5 minutes. He acts like a cornered animal, getting those instincts from his youth on Kenari. He inadvertently sows the seeds of rebellion with the chaos he leaves behind. 

Ferrix: after Cassian leaves, the Empire shows up and starts mistreating people, leading to more rebellion. 

Aldahni: Mon Mothma gets all nervous about her creds after the Aldahni attack. The Empire cracks down and sends more people to prison camps. 

Narkina 1: the harsh prison conditions lead to a prison riot, and to the Narkanians helping them escape. 

There’s also a fun bit of an undercurrent of characters misinterpreting Cassian’s motivations in the show as some big act of rebellion when in reality the guy is just hopscotching from one chaotic escape to the next and holding on for dear life"
Age of Rebellion,Cassias was never the star of his wars—it was the friends he made along the way
Age of Rebellion,at this point I'm gonna spam posts about andor too
Age of Rebellion,Another one
Age of Rebellion,Oh! His name is Andor. That explains everything.
Age of Rebellion,Alright thats it Im unsubbing
Age of Rebellion,Enough
Age of Rebellion,"Another Andor post, are people getting paid to post a new post every day?"
Age of Rebellion,Thanks for posting this. I'm never gonna watch it then. All this time I thought it was a series about the Ewok planet. I didn't even know it was based on the guy that died in Rogue One.
Age of Rebellion,The epitome of wrong place wrong time
Age of Rebellion,I thought Andor was a planet name lol
Age of Rebellion,"The Star was the continuous barrage of fawning over this show. 

#WE GET IT!

I’m so tired of hearing about twitter, and trump, and andor, and musk, and whatever else Reddit’s collective OCD hive mind is obsessing over this week. Aren’t you all sick of it? How many times can we talk about the same fucking things over and over and over. We know! Tie fighters and Elon musk blue check and Kanye west “troubled man.” Holy fuck, what boring people that inhabit this place.

#IT’S A STAR WARS SHOW. 

People will either watch it, or they won’t. If they didn’t watch it when it first dropped, they’re most likely not going to watch it now. And honestly, I can’t blame them. Is this show great? Probably not, judging by the incessant propaganda these “media news outlets” have been pumping out hourly. 

Out of protest (not that it matters), I refuse to watch andor. Disney’s relentless pressuring has made me completely uninterested. Holy shit."
Age of Rebellion,"People whining about this show in comments are more annoying than these posts.

If you don't like it downvote and move on no need spout baseless conspiracy theories that everyone who likes this show form Disney PR.."
Age of Rebellion,best show of 2022.
Age of Rebellion,Sort by controversial to see the truth
Age of Rebellion,"Diego Luna was great as was the rest of the cast but it’s not a character study, Cassian is an idea, a walking metaphor for the rest of the galaxy, where most people were content to ignore the empire and it’s brutality as long as it didn’t touch directly upon them."
Age of Rebellion,"And it’s not simply the lofty ideals of the rebellion, either— it’s the actual on-the-ground reality. The sacrifices, the hard choices, the manipulations and counter-manipulations. The heart of the people that make up the Rebellion."
Age of Rebellion,A Star Wars about a star war
Age of Rebellion,Opinion
Age of Rebellion,Only Star Wars in the background
Age of Rebellion,?
Age of Rebellion,"Bruh, what?!"
Age of Rebellion,Why is his last name the same as a planet name? As a Star Wars casual I was kind confused by that during the Andie TV show.
Age of Rebellion,The true Star Wars Rebels.
Age of Rebellion,"Ye, can someone help me filter out Andor posts from appearing for me? I love the show but these daily's are getting out of hand."
Age of Rebellion,"""It's all about familiarity."""
Age of Rebellion,"The show was “about” Cassian Andor only in so much as it needed a vessel or viewpoint to show the growing sentiment around the rebellion, and the ultimate birth of it after years of gestation. The whole show was about whether or not the average person should believe rebellion was necessary and unavoidable, and it used Cassian to show *other people* dealing with this issue: from the cynical but effective Luthen instigating various attacks and heists, to Skeen who didn’t really care about anything at all and ended up just wanting to take the loot and get out. On top of that, it showed us insight into the Empire itself, again highlighting the actual people behind the faceless wall of absolute power, having to make decisions about the effects of a rebellion and how to deal with it. 

I have so many hopes and expectations for season 2, especially hoping for even broader views of the empire in the midst of the growing insurrection, the political ramifications, and the changing circumstances for normal people on the ground. 

What they have here, in this show, is the much needed deep-dive into the *essence* of the Star Wars universe, rather than just the heroic tales of individual characters that we’ve gotten before. It’s the anti-thesis to Book of Boba Fett, a show about a character that really *doesn’t have* any character to speak of, and whose story never really needed to be told nor has any impact on anyone else’s story at all, really. Andor’s story affects *the whole universe* in a deep and meaningful manner, and is about the vast, core differences and struggles that later set the stage for heroes to come along."
Age of Rebellion,"Yeah, I don't know when was the last time I've seen something with all of the cast just acting the HELL out of their scenes. I'm astounded at how much EVERYONE is great in this. My only real complaint for the season is that it was only 12 episodes long. There were plenty of times where I'd have liked to stick longer to a particular mood or emotion but it had to keep moving to the next thing. Amazing stuff."
Age of Rebellion,I think the show proved that it DIDN'T need specifically Cassian as lead. It could be any new rebellion character because it really doesn't connect Rogue One character with Andor character on any level deeper than actor's face.
Age of Rebellion,"I’m just here to see all the annoying “OMG yet -another- Andor bot article I could scroll over?!?!? Everyone hates that show, boring!!! People should only talk about new shows only please and they should only be shows I like! Give me swooshing lightsabers, nothing else!”"
Age of Rebellion,"That's because they cared about actually making a show. The other shows were all made because of the character and mining nostalgia for them. That's the entire reason for even creating the show, they didn't have a story/concept and figured it out (badly) because they needed the commercial exploitation."
Age of Rebellion,"I’d argue that good writing and casting makes it a solid show. Casting doesn’t feel forced and the writing is solid. Until now all the SW series have been the opposite. 

I also think that the metoo movement was important but it also came with some negatives where castings felt forced.  Just looking back at the force awakens series and Rogue One kind of forced writers to always include stereotypical females in its series. 

Sure this might be a controversial statement but I feel like the female characters in Andor feels thought out and fit in with the story way better than the series before it.

The characters should extend the story not the other way around imo."
Age of Rebellion,So what you're saying is there's a chance we get a Galen Erso show
Age of Rebellion,I need the whole rogue one cast to get a show if they maintain the quality
Age of Rebellion,"I'm pretty positive if we didn't already have a show called Star Wars Rebels, it would have been called something similar."
Age of Rebellion,I especially am glad we met his moms depressed robot. That thing made me sad everytime I saw it.
Age of Rebellion,The star is the wars we fought along the way
Age of Rebellion,"The star was the articles that keep getting spammed to this sub about andor

I want to watch it, but every time its promoted I delay my watch of it out of spite for the hail corporates and mega fans"
Age of Rebellion,"The real stars are the public relations teams who have managed to get a hundred media articles written about this. I swear, Capeck is out and Eiger came back and all the media shills think Disney is going to start spending money on ads again. Little secret, there's no money left."
Age of Rebellion,I'm a fan of the show and I'm tired of it clogging the main TV subreddit.
Age of Rebellion,What of it pinkskin?
Age of Rebellion,"Yeah, right? It's crazy that /r/television is being spammed with posts about...

\*checks notes\*

Highly acclaimed currently running TV shows."

Hi Score Girl,Severance was so fucking good.
Hi Score Girl,Yeh Severance was something man. What a first season. I’m really worried about the second.
Hi Score Girl,"Those are absolutely my top 4 too, but the biggest revelation I had this year was The Bear.

From the very first scene I couldn't stop watching. Absolutely brilliant, original television that packed an incredible amount of comedy, drama, brilliant dialogue and fantastic direction into tight, 25 minute heart and soul-filled episodes.

I cried like a baby several times. Just wonderful TV."
Hi Score Girl,Severance and Andor the best things I’ve watched this year easily.
Hi Score Girl,"As someone who isn’t a Star Wars fan and hasn’t watched something from that world in ages, is it still worth watching Andor?"
Hi Score Girl,"I like this list and I'll say it again like I always do, if you haven't watched Reservation Dogs yet get to it."
Hi Score Girl,"Severance is my favorite thing I watched all year. And I loved The Bear and The Rehersal.

That said, Atlanta is too low. Seaon 4 was masterful and cemented its legacy imo. 

Also, I presume Yellow Jackets is considered 2021 even though it finished airing this year (and most people didn't catch it until 2022)? Cause I'm 7 episodes deep and it's almost as good as Severence."
Hi Score Girl,"I find it amazing a Star Wars show is making around the top of a lot of lists for best show of the year, not best sci-fi show, best show in general."
Hi Score Girl,Surprised to not see Station Eleven. Is it because the first ep was December of 2021?
Hi Score Girl,Severance deserves it
Hi Score Girl,I really need to watch Severance. I'll start it in the new year. The Dropout would be in my top 5 though
Hi Score Girl,Top 4 similar to mine except swap 1 and 2
Hi Score Girl,Can someone sell me on Pachinko??
Hi Score Girl,"Network Breakdown:
- WBD (HBO/Max): 8
- Disney (Disney+/Hulu/FX/ABC): 8
- Apple: 3
- Netflix: 3
- AMC: 3 

Feels like Apple should have had a few more but outside of that it feels pretty representative of the year. Oof for everybody else being shut out though with the big losers being Paramount, Amazon, NBCU, and Starz!"
Hi Score Girl,"lack of Slow Horses is jarring, but cannot argue with the top three"
Hi Score Girl,severance and white lotus are my tops for sure
Hi Score Girl,"Better Things should be way higher. What a smart, funny show. I'd drop Abbott Elementary down. It's a pleasant show, chuckle-inducing, but not exceptional."
Hi Score Girl,I watched 8 of the top 12 and can confirm I recommend all of them. I didn’t see any from 13-24 but I do love 25.
Hi Score Girl,“Fleishman is in Trouble” should have made the list.
Hi Score Girl,"I'm so glad This is Going to Hurt made it on this list, y'all are absolutely sleeping on this show!

But yeah I love a lot of the shows on this list, and Severance is definitely my #1 as well."
Hi Score Girl,where is under the banner of heaven
Hi Score Girl,I move Barry up just over Andor. And I loved Andor.
Hi Score Girl,"I thought The Bear would get #1 (guess I haven't seen that many critics lists after all), but I like Severance a bit better anyways."
Hi Score Girl,It makes sense that Better Things ranked higher than Stranger Things
Hi Score Girl,Needs more 1899
Hi Score Girl,I'm happy to see Barry here. I'd be remiss not to mention that Season 3 was a serious knockout.
Hi Score Girl,"FYI, This is Going to Hurt was on BBC1, and Derry Girls was on Channel 4"
Hi Score Girl,No mention of Station 11?  That was probably my favorite of the year.  Saul and Severance were better but Saul we expected to be better and Severance let us know how weird we were going to get right off the bat.  Station 11 made me feel things.
Hi Score Girl,"I haven’t seen it but for those of you that have, does Bad Sisters deserve 13th place? I’m surprised to see Hacks so low comparatively, it was a sublime and intelligent season."
Hi Score Girl,"Heartstopper was such a feel good show but I never would have thought of it being the most loved show of Netflix this year. No surprise they renewed it for two more seasons.           
Interview With the Vampire should be higher imo."
Hi Score Girl,Honestly this year was such a great year for TV. So many other good shows aren’t even there.
Hi Score Girl,The one show I LOVED this year that’s not one the list is The Old Man. Such fantastic writing.
Hi Score Girl,Good picks but I'd probably put Peacemaker at either 22nd or 24th place
Hi Score Girl,I though *What We Do in the Shadows* was very hit-or-miss this season. It had some great episodes but others that weren't good.
Hi Score Girl,"Having seen the top 4, I'd probably bump Severence to third and bump up Saul and Andor to 1 and 2. I liked Severence a lot, but a) It's a really freaking slow burn that doesn't go anywhere for a long time and b) I'm really not convinced there's a big picture behind it all. Felt like a lot of shit was made up as it went and I'm not expecting any big answers to the questions the show asks.   


Andor was like the unexpected lighting strike that shot so much goddamn life into a franchise which was at it's final dead end. Book of Boba Fett and Obi Wan ruined the good will from The Mandalorian for their TV efforts, thank god Andor was SO well written and yes, its a bit slow but it gets going a *lot* faster than Severence did. And it made me care about Mon Mothma's terribly frigid home life that weighs on her and I can't believe this.   


Saul though was just, god. It's always been the best thing on TV and it's maintained that all the way to the end. Almost every episode of this show I came away feeling *nourished*. I felt like I had just been shown how TV should be. Considering this is the last time it could be nominated, why the hell wouldn't you put this at No.1?   


And really, For All Mankind should be somewhere here, even if its third season is it's weakest so far."
Hi Score Girl,They're just trying to sneak Andor posts under the radar now lol
Hi Score Girl,Somebody Somewhere is hilarious.
Hi Score Girl,Barry is amazing. Glad it’s getting it’s due.
Hi Score Girl,Even though I consider both Euphoria and Stranger Things mid-tier shows this season I found Euphoria 2 a *way better* watch than ST4.
Hi Score Girl,"Recency bias is obvious in this list when you look at ""# other"" (meaning ""mentioned at all""). New shows have about 50% more mentions than continuing ones.

I don't think it's fair to compare a 1st season of one show to the 2nd/3rd/…/final season of another anywayy so I either rank completed shows or new ones.

That being said, my favorite \*new\* shows were 1. Andor, 2. Severance, 3. Station Eleven (if it counts as 2022). To get a complete ""top 5"" I'd add House of the Dragon and Pachinko but I'd put them a level below the other 3.

Edit: And let me say this much: Better Call Saul landed in my all-time top 3 – even above Breaking Bad."
Hi Score Girl,What about For All Mankind?
Hi Score Girl,"Atlanta hit us with two incredible seasons of TV this year and deserves all its flowers. Should be top 5, IMO, but I think a large audience of white TV viewers just didn’t gravitate to its later seasons."
Hi Score Girl,All this list is missing is for all mankind
Hi Score Girl,I mean I'm on board with this list. Top three definitely.
Hi Score Girl,Someone please explain the rehearsal. I tried watching a few episodes. but cannot understand how it has any entertainment value.
Hi Score Girl,"I’m here to say that Welcome to Wrexham was the best thing I’ve watched on television all year, and I’ve seen most shows on that list."
Hi Score Girl,No Sandman? That ain’t right.
Hi Score Girl,I’m not displeased with this ranking although I’d have Atlanta higher. Where is Succession? White Lotus? Station Eleven? Fargo?
Hi Score Girl,1899
Hi Score Girl,Surprised House of the Dragon isn't higher on the list.
Hi Score Girl,Severance is the best show of 2022 easy imo
Hi Score Girl,Im just glad Wednesday isnt on this list
Hi Score Girl,"Interesting to see the meta critic scores for Severance and Andor actually not that high, but make the top of these lists. I’m thinking some critics who may not of loved them so much probably felt a bit of pressure to put them at that top of their lists."
Hi Score Girl,This is a much better list! Although I’d switch 1 and 2
Hi Score Girl,The fact that The Peripheral is missing makes me dubious about this entire list
Hi Score Girl,"Man, we tried the first few episodes of The Bear and just got really bored. What were we missing?"
Hi Score Girl,"The Bear being so high is weird to me.

Had a really hard time liking it because everyone was constantly screaming and being assholes for no reason"
Hi Score Girl,Wow I’m really surprised Star Trek: Stramge New Worlds isn’t on there. That show was straight 10’s almost every episode for me
Hi Score Girl,You know the list is a joke when 1899 is not even on it.
Hi Score Girl,"Severance is massively overrated imo.

I mean it's an OK show with some great performances and a banger of an opening episode, but all in all it's Lost all over again. Surface level ""meaningful"" while treading water most of the time and promising viewers answers and meaning that are always just \*one more episode away\*, and then they never come.

The season finale was great in that something actually happened in it, but I'm pretty sure they will backtrack most of that in S2 and keep us guessing and dangling the carrot in front of our faces all over again.

I'd be happy to be proven wrong, I love the premise of the show and I loved it for a while, but became tired of it in the latter half."
Hi Score Girl,Fuckin finally severance gets the recognition it deserves. Easily my number 1 this year and it’s no contest.
Hi Score Girl,Severance deserves it. Incredible show.
Hi Score Girl,Very good list. Shoutout Hacks and Derry Girls if you want to see some of the funniest women-led comedies of all time
Hi Score Girl,Where’s The Peripheral? That show is amazing
Hi Score Girl,Why isn’t The Boys on there?
Hi Score Girl,"I don't get the hype for Severance. Slow start, mildly exciting middle, and a finale episode that relied on forced miscommunication to extend the duration of the plot. It should have ended 20-30 min before it actually did. The only thing I didn't see coming in the entire series was >!the wife reveal!<.

It was watchable, but my patience wore thin by the end."
Hi Score Girl,"I really enjoyed Severance but having it over BCS, Barry, and a few other more developed shows is nuts. Feel like we need to see more from a show like this until we crown it. I’m worried we are in for a Lost or Westworld 2.0 here where the pay off can’t possibly match the intrigue of season 1."
Hi Score Girl,"So I watched Severance and greatly enjoyed it. The concept was unique and thought-provoking and the cinematography was striking, but I didn't think the dialogue was anything to write home about. Am I alone in this?"
Hi Score Girl,I tried getting into Andor. I watched the first 6 episodes and I thought it was so boring.
Hi Score Girl,[deleted]
Hi Score Girl,The Bear was the best show of the year. HOTD 2nd for me.
Hi Score Girl,"I’d probably swap The Rehearsal and House of the Dragon, but overall very solid list imo"
Hi Score Girl,That top 4 is just goated
Hi Score Girl,"1. Severance / The Rehearsal
2. Atlanta
3. Barry"
Hi Score Girl,"Me and my friends really enjoyed watching The Bear. Do you guys think they will like Severance? I think they liked The Bear because 1) it's a kitchen environment and we all liked that, 2) it's really fast paced"
Hi Score Girl,Ferry girls higher on the list then euphoria what?
Hi Score Girl,I do not like better call saul.
Hi Score Girl,It's nice to see Rings of Power not on this list.
Hi Score Girl,"Oh yeah, I trust the critics.  It's not like they have a vested interest in blowing smoke up my ass."
Hi Score Girl,"no Rings of Power?

not that i disagree, but the most hyped show this year, costs a billion dollars to make, and it doesn't even make the top 25?

wow!"
Hi Score Girl,Sort of  and Righteous Gemstones (HBO/Max) should have been on this list.
Hi Score Girl,[deleted]
Hi Score Girl,This is a real solid list
Hi Score Girl,Pretty accurate
Hi Score Girl,"I won't say Severance doesn't deserve it, because it definitely does. It's probably the best ongoing show rn (personally I mogjt prefer Succession though). But c'mon man, Better Call Saul's final season was AMAZING"
Hi Score Girl,It upsets me that Ted Lasso and See is not on the list.
Hi Score Girl,Wait is succession in a different category or something?
Hi Score Girl,People’s views on yellow stone?
Hi Score Girl,I was all excited about this list till they stuck the best show at the very bottom
Hi Score Girl,no black bird?
Hi Score Girl,Saved post for future reference
Hi Score Girl,I was really loving The Rehersal until maybe the final 2 or 3 episodes but it turned into a mess. Like I don’t get it. What was the point of those episodes. What was he trying to do/accomplish? I wish he had just stuck with helping a different person each episode.
Hi Score Girl,Damn that's my top 3 as well.
Hi Score Girl,The Rehearsal was not my cup of tea. That’s being polite in my opinion.
Hi Score Girl,This is a list I can get behind.
Hi Score Girl,"This list seems about right, from what I've watched, considering it's an aggregate of critic opinions.

I personally enjoyed Peacemaker more than anything this year, and I don't particularly care for superhero films or shows, but I like James Gunn's humor even though I know it rubs some people the wrong way.

I still think the music, pathos and the best opening credits in existence should carry it higher."
Hi Score Girl,Hotd has gotta be in the top 5
Hi Score Girl,"A rare year that I mostly agree with it. 

My personal list would have stranger things higher. I  don't know if it was the best series I watched all year, but it was the most fun."
Hi Score Girl,"Wow did not think Abbot Elementary would be so high up. And ahead of Barry ? Just could not get into it, maybe it picks up later on."
Amazing Interiors,"I loved Hannibal! Although it was mostly Mads Mikklesen (sp?) that did it for me. But I thought the case in general was great, visually, I enjoyed it. Kind of surprised to see it on a list like this as I don’t feel like it had much acclaim to it."
Amazing Interiors,"I disagree with you (obviously) on most of these, but I also think Hannibal's not as good as most people claim. I thought Mads Mikkelsen was amazing in it, but the slow motion shots and snail-paced rhythm of the show got old real quick. Most of the time I'm fast forwarding through these elaborate tracking shots and I'm just like GET ON WITH IT ALREADY."
Amazing Interiors,"I'll never get why we have to have these tedious ""overrated"" discussions. It's completely a okay to not like a popular thing, I dislike plenty. Rick and Morty, Arrested Development, The IT Crowd, Lost. That's not the issue here. You should be able to express unpopular opinions without getting flack. 

*However*, people aren't ""overrating"" any of these just because YOU don't find them as great as everybody else does. That's why opinions like these are received poorly and people think it's always because they have these opinions on their own. That's not it. You may say you're not saying those who side against you are wrong, but the language employed doesn't signal that at all. So many misunderstandings would be avoided if we all erased words like ""overrated"" from our collective vocabulary."
Amazing Interiors,"While I agree with you on some of these, in particular Hannibal's style over substance growing old fairly quickly in the run, I always think when people make lists like this, they should also post their top 5 shows for comparison."
Amazing Interiors,"Not sure why you said that Hannibal was up there with the worst you've seen this decade... Surely you've seen worse? How is it overrated if it got cancelled due to ratings?

I enjoyed the show a lot. Great visuals and Mads Mik."
Amazing Interiors,"Ouch, I absolutely love Hannibal, The Leftovers, and BoJack Horseman but hey to each their own. I'm in the minority that thinks The Office and Breaking Bad are overrated (still great, but overrated.) Point being I've accepted these things are all subjective, what some people like others simply won't. 

Out of curiosity, what were your 5 favorite shows of the decade?"
Amazing Interiors,"I'd agree except with the Leftovers. I'd replace it with Game of Thrones' second half. Bojack's been letting me down the last year or two. I haven't finished the most recent yet. 
Hannibal however is one of the only shows I actively hated after loving it. Season 3 to me was carried on the Tooth Fairy storyline's back. I was so disappointed left and right. The Season 2 finale fell flat knowing only one side character died and they shoehorned Alana back in despite being the only main character there without a role in the story afterwards."
Amazing Interiors,"I use shows like Flowers, The Leftovers, and Kidding as compatibility gauges.  We, sir, are not compatible."
Amazing Interiors,"How dare you speak ill of Hannibal.

That show is a legend."
Amazing Interiors,[deleted]
Amazing Interiors,"I liked ""The Americans"". It was a good thrilling drama which definitely deserves the praise it gets. On the other hand i felt Breaking bad was a little slow at times. 

I absolutely hated my time watching The Leftovers and watched it till the end just because i didn't want to give up in the middle.

I loved 24, Person of Interest, GOT (except the last season obviously), The Expanse, Community."
Amazing Interiors,"I rather enjoyed Bojack Horseman but I'm a sucker for the juxtaposition of a colorful cartoon with morbid characters and complex stories - same reason i loved Moral Orel, which was severely underrated and would have been a flop completely if not for the third season which they released exclusively online in order to tie the pieces together."
Amazing Interiors,"Sorry looks like you got awful taste.

Dare not badmouth Hannibal man !!  even crown..

On Hannibal :

>Its dialog is spoken like it contains amazing philosophical insight, but is saying nothing at all.

Euphemism for not understanding it.

>acclaim is for Bryan Fuller’s visuals, but I actually find it an ugly show due to its cold palette and lighting.

Only visuals ? Apart from the fact that they were amazing, Hannibal is not only acclaimed for it's visuals but sheer mastery of layering and metaphors.

Basically I can bet that you have not understood the story. Tell me, what is the story in one or two sentences ? No disrespect intended.. it is a damn difficult story to fully understand, lots of layers and misleading narratives hiding the main story.

Still I would have ignored this post and gone past it, never commented if not for the line where you mentioned people watched them for appraisal from critic friends. That's a self serving assumption, like I am now assuming that lack of comprehension sometimes is hindrance to enjoying a good show.

Anyway good night mate."
Amazing Interiors,Hannibal ? Leftover ? Are you serious !! Hannibal is the best thing that happened in Tv in the last decade .. forget overrated it is hugely underwetched and underrated.
Amazing Interiors,"Really? Why can't people just say the list of shows I hate. Because it's all about opinion on what you like or don't like. Overrated has nothing to do with it, except somehow you think your opinion outweighs everyone else's.  You're special, huh?"
Amazing Interiors,Agree highly on the leftovers.   The ending was just terrible.   It had some great episodes in the middle though.  Americans and Hannibal I never finished.
Amazing Interiors,"Only one I disagree with is The Crown. It's a great show, IMO.  Totally agree with you're #1. I've tried several times to like it, because of how many times I hear how great it is, but I don't get it. It's a terrible show."
Amazing Interiors,"Would swap out The Americans and The Leftovers for your honorable mentions Good Wife and Handmaids Tale. I really like those!

As a Hannibal / Fannibal even I would agree that third season was weak sauce and drags down the overall rating. 

As a Bojack Horseman fan I would agree that the show is not this life altering experience people are claiming it to be, so truly the most ‘overrated’. 

Good Wife last two years ended very poorly which hurts the overall show, Handmaids Tale has gone off the rails since adapting the book, I’m behind on The Crown so can’t speak to it."
Amazing Interiors,Excellent list!
Amazing Interiors,"To Bojack, Headline reads: ""Bojack Horseman, top rated show of the decade."""
Amazing Interiors,"Because if you make a thread about how much you love something everyone ignores it.   But if you shit on a bunch of popular things people show up to defend them and it’s almost like people are paying attention to you.

I honestly think we should add “overrated” and “get any better” to the list of phrases that automatically delete a post. It’s always the same shit. If it’s more than a couple hours old chances are you’re going to click it and see that bold blue name of the OP next to a bunch of comments downvoted to oblivion."
Amazing Interiors,"To be clear I genuinely think they’re overrated, I was just trying to be nice about it."
Amazing Interiors,">style over substance 

eh ? Hannibal was all substance along with superb style"
Amazing Interiors,"Thank you. I sometimes feel like I’m the only one that feels that BB is not the perfect masterpiece.  
Also love Hannibal, Leftovers and Bojack."
Amazing Interiors,"My top tier: Once Upon A Time, Community, American Horror Story, The Walking Dead, The Mindy Project. 

Other shows I’ve huge fans of: Broad City, Halt and Catch Fire, Succession, This Is Us, The Good Place

Happy to consider them classics but slightly less personal attachment: Mad Men, Breaking Bad

I'm aware I’m way, way off the reservation this decade. In 00-09 it wasn’t that bad, my top 3 are Six Feet Under, BSG and The Sopranos, but also consider Lost, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Shield and The Wire as genuine legendary shows. The only one from that era I have a firm overrated stance on is Deadwood. I have faith in my own taste and its stubborn consistency, so my take is everyone else’s taste evolved not mine. And maybe there’s nothing wrong with that, much like I’m currently confused by the generation after me's taste in pop music compared to the ones from my era, like how many generations before me have hit that point. But it seems to me like the current TV critics are highly vulnerable to social media and what their peers think in a way that wasn’t the case pre-twitter."
Amazing Interiors,It was good at first.. after 3-4 seasons it started going down and after season 6 all shit.
Amazing Interiors,"I didn’t say they watched them for appraisal from critic friends, I said their opinions are influenced by what their peers are saying."
Amazing Interiors,This.
Amazing Interiors,"I don't know, I think one can get just as many people shitting on something they do like. I'm with you on overrated being used too much. I'll add cliche & jumped the shark. Too many have no idea what these mean."
Amazing Interiors,"I'm glad you enjoyed the flowing paint that was supposed to be blood visuals and the food images that were a quarter of each show.  Personally, I got the point during the first season and it was pretty much fast forward material after that."
Amazing Interiors,You got a god awful taste my dude 😂😂
Amazing Interiors,Why do you think Deadwood is overrated?
Amazing Interiors,"Ok so looks like you have a particular choice.. You go for shows with a lot of events and less of character development.. no layered meaning at all, straightforward stories.. basically you like simple stories. Nothing bad about that, like out of your list AHS, Succession are ok.. but they are for easy entertainment not the kind of stuff I would think over and rewatch and enrich and add on or write my own little personal note or a fiction about. You pushed even Breaking Bad to the third tier or happy to consider ! I mean lol a succession cannot match Breaking Bad, The Good place can never come anywhere close to the level of Hannibal.

Bottomline - Your taste is pop and easy, so the heavier stuff feels incomprehensible and 'overrated' to you."
Amazing Interiors,"ouat, ahs, twd... jeez if you couldve come with some exceptional, less heard of, brilliant shows, i wouldve assumed that youre avoiding the mainstream but these are hella awful choices. these shows (leftovers, good wife, hannibal, americans) are great for my taste by the way. i even watched ouat, twd, ahs at least 4,5,6 seasons to evaluate. and like them for a while but best of decade..."
Amazing Interiors,"No mate, it is a case of who likes what. Having watched at least two from your list.. Hannibal is my all time favourite. Crown is good too. Didn't care about peer or rating I mean I haven't even heard or seen another person watched Hannibal. It's only after I joined the fandom, after watching the series is I met people who watched it. 

It is just the case of someone liking it vs someone not liking it, not for me thing. Twin Peak is highly rated, but I never watched it beyond few episodes not my cup of tea that doesn't make it overrated. stuff like that."
Amazing Interiors,"Would sound nagging (Fannibals are nagging).. give Hannibal another shot, you won't believe how many people fail to get the story at one go. They think they figured it out but it's difficult to achieve at one go. Did you realise Will was also a hidden killer from the beginning ... there is a lot lot more to unpack there.

Mizumono and the finale are one of the two best episodes in television ever.

Cheers."
Amazing Interiors,"Yes I enjoyed the visuals and the food, they had literal and metaphysical significance but they were only the peripheral elements. Season 1 was a delight but the tory actually took off in season 2 after the weekly murderer thing stopped. If you have noticed it was a gothic psychological romance and story of self discovery. But you fast forwarded it .. fine.. to each their own. Still would urge you give it another shot, this time slow the narrative is so laden and purple in the first watch i barely noticed a quarter of what they were trying to say. Story within story within story and every dialogue is heavy, a lot of meaning behind each of them."
Amazing Interiors,"lol that's what I saw, what they can't comprehend is overrated."
Amazing Interiors,"It reminded me of the HBO-ing in shows like Game of Thrones and True Blood with a million characters and C, D, and E plots. I struggle sometimes with that format, it makes the episodes feel bloated and in needed of editing to me. I enjoyed GOT and TB more tbh just because the subject matter interested me more.

I understand some people are high on the dialog, but when it comes to non-dialog writing (plotting, etc.) I thought it was somewhat flawed and not really going anywhere. Every other scene being a extended monologue probably didn’t help the pace.

Ian McShane’s performance was great but watching it late after a decade of morally corrupt guys you like in other shows, made it seem less special than it likely felt at the time."
Amazing Interiors,"I’m a sucker for the shows that mix in the flashbacks with the present like Lost, OUAT and This Is Us, so this would go against the straight forward storytelling theory. And AHS style of storytelling is is certainly not straight forward.

Much like everyone else the thing I care about the most is emotionally complex characters, followed by good storytelling, and being made in an artistically interesting way. It just so happens that I consider many of the dramas on my list like OUAT, AHS, TWD and TIU to have those emotionally complex characters. I feel people missed on that because they’re not taking the shows as seriously.

To use the example of TWD since it’s easiest to explain... I feel the people who watch it for the zombie attacks (relative minority, I feel) are seeing it incorrectly. It’s always been a layered human survival story. The main battle has never been zombies vs humans, it’s been humans vs their inner darkness, as they fight to keep hope alive and what it meant to be human. It’s actually a very similar show thematically to Battlestar Galactica. Think about it, replace the Cylons with zombies and it’s almost the same story. Always on the run, asking if it’s worth it. Having to decide how to run their remaining group or society, etc. 

I could make the same argument for other shows on my list. I consider AHS to have been an emotionally driven character show from the start. Add in how thrilling I consider its storytelling and plotting style and it’s really the full package for me, albeit sometimes inconsistent season to season naturally. OUAT spends as much time on emotional character development as virtually any show can, and it’s not subtle about it. I would argue compared to Lost it’s the one that cares more about the character development, while Lost is the one that got caught up chasing its mystery box plot around after the first season. But the idea of it being one of the most emotionally rich shows on TV is so beyond what it looks like on the surface that I feel it already lost a lot of people. What annoys me isn’t so much people not liking it, it’s how few people realize that it was one of the most ambitious shows on TV, much like how This Is Us is currently one of the most ambitious shows on TV. It was telling an absolutely massive serialized story over hundreds of years of intertwined events and multiple worlds. That’s not even the best part of the show (the character development is), but in a network TV landscape where most shows are derided for doing the complete opposite (case of the week), that alone should have at least earned some respect. Ambition isn’t enough to make a great story, as I said in my original post I consider the Leftovers and Hannibal to be wildly ambitious but I still don’t like them, but if more people adknowledged that shows like OUAT or This Is Us are trying something very big, they may be more likely to give it a chance from a serious analysis perspective."
Amazing Interiors,">Leftovers and Hannibal to be wildly ambitious but I still don’t like them,

Ambitious and delivered on that, Hannibal is far more complex character and relationship development than AHS. If you understood Hannibal for what it is... because on the outset it looks like story of macabre murders and weird psychopaths while it's not at all that. 

Anyway your list looks like an assessment best on your taste and preferences, basically discarding what falls outside !"
Amazing Interiors,"I liked it a lot aswell, really well made."
Amazing Interiors,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've never read the book, but it was added to my TBR pile very quickly after. "
Amazing Interiors,"I thought it was alright, I'm enjoying war and peace more. I felt ATTWN was too short to care about the characters, and the lead female character's back-story was hard to follow. I read the book, and I still  needed to look up why she did it when it was over."
Amazing Interiors,Just checked it. Ah I sadly can't.
Amazing Interiors,How close to the book does the plot follow?
Amazing Interiors,Can I still watch this on BBC iplayer?
Amazing Interiors,I agree I only found it alright. The cast was great though. If it didnt have such an amazing cast I wouldn't have liked it as much. I'd give it a 7/10. I also loved War and Peace! Here's a recommendation if you like British TV. Check out The Outcast from last year. It's a miniseries and it is fantastic!
Amazing Interiors,"Pretty closely. Some minor details are changed. But as far as I remember, most of the major details are at least the same in spirit. It does try to be quite a bit more dark and disturbing than the book though. The book is a cozy mystery, doesn't get too gory or anything, but the miniseries does amp up the blood and language and other ""mature themes"" 

Edit: The only thing I didn't have particularly enjoy about the show, and there are no plot spoilers in this, is Phillip. In the novel he's quite charming and nonchalant, but Vera notices he has a hidden side that reminds her of a wolf, and also reminds her that he is the most obviously dangerous person on the island. In the show, he's got that Criss Angel ""I'm dark and disturbed"" troubled past vibe. He is well acted still, but the direction of the character made him seem generic when novel Phillip had the layers that really made you go back and forth on whether you could trust him, and it played into the whole cat and mouse vibe. "
Amazing Interiors,Yeah the cast was most of the appeal.
Amazing Interiors,"Cozy? I haven't seen the show, but you and I have different memories of the book. "
Amazing Interiors,"My views differ greatly, I thought Philip was the best character. Aidan Turner was perfect as Philip. His performance was excellent."
Amazing Interiors,"Cozy is a type of mystery novel where sex and violent themes are downplayed, even when they are present. If a character is murdered with an ax, it's going to be damned gruesome but in cozy mysteries, like what Agatha Christie wrote, the details will be glossed over quite a bit. Like I believe she literally just describes the ax as being stained with a brownish-red when they find the murder weapon. 

It's not the purest example of a cozy mystery, because usually the protagonist is a Miss Marple amateur sleuth type, but it kind of plays with the genre itself because the major characters of the ten in ATTWN are each their own sleuth in that sense, they are just also the victims. "
Amazing Interiors,Is it as wholesome as The Great British Bake Off?
Amazing Interiors,I'd say it's more like Trading Spaces but with a competition element thrown in. The judges can be a little bit snarkier but they're usually not saying those things right in front of the contestants.
Sugar Rush,"bruh, i almost thought this was a revival season for the Sugar Rush (UK) series from early 2000s. I almost lost my shit. lol."
Sugar Rush,A cross over with Nailed would be really fun
Sugar Rush,July 31
Sugar Rush,"Finally! It's about bloody time! Jeez. We've been waiting to hear if Netflix was going to renew ""Sugar Rush"" for a third season. They confirmed it a couple of months ago but didn't give us a date of when they would drop it. I'm looking forward to it! Although, I'm confused that the prize money has gone from $10,000 down to $1,500. What's up with that?"
Sugar Rush,A cross over with Nailed It would be really fun
Sugar Rush,"I really like the show, but one complaint is they they are tweaking the rules every season when the first season model was fine"
Sugar Rush,"You're not going to top The Great British Bake Off, no matter how many variants of the baking show you throw at the wall, so please stop and just give us more of The Great British Bake Off."
Sugar Rush,Glad I wasn’t the only one
Sugar Rush,Same
Sugar Rush,"They didn't lower the prize money. They added an ""extra sweet"" twist to the winners of Round 1 and Round 2. They can either get 15 extra minutes or $1500. The winner still gets $10000."
Sugar Rush,[deleted]
Sugar Rush,There was a UK LGBT series called Sugar Rush from the 00's. I  thought this might have been an American remake... 
Sugar Rush,I wonder how many confused Wreck-It-Ralph fans will watch this while waiting for the sequel?
Sugar Rush,Yes but it's also good and thoroughly watchable. Personally I love no-frills cooking competitions like this. It has a small twist in terms of mechanics but ultimately it's just people cooking neat stuff. There isn't any random ingredients like Chopped or insane drama like Hell's Kitchen. Netflix could produce a ton more of this low budget stuff and I'd keep watching it. 
Sugar Rush,"Loved that show so much. Was gutted it got cancelled, along with so many more. Netflix don't get my money anymore."
Sugar Rush,"yes... yes... a million times, yes. loved insatiable."
Sugar Rush,"I enjoyed the first season but never completed the second one.

It got a lot of hate for fat shaming which missed the point imo."
Sugar Rush,Loved Insatiable it was so campy and over the top. Maybe I'll start a rewatch tonight
Sugar Rush,I just watched it. Wow. That was a wild ride! Absolutely want more. Any hope??
Sugar Rush,"Sadly, it got cancelled. We won't see any more of it."
Sugar Rush,"Wow, you got a lot of them already, but here's the one's I think you could also include:

*Freaks and Geeks* is Lindsay Weir's story of how she falls in with the bad crowd.

*The Legend of Korra* while not as strong as the original, yet, is still a good animated series with a female lead.

*Dollhouse* has a female lead although the you could right question how strong a character could be in that role considering the memory is wiped clean every episode.

*Dead Like Me* has a female lead. The show certainly has its ups and downs but overall pretty good.

I would argue the Major from *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* is the lead there, and an excellent character all around to boot.

*My So-Called Life* was the original Claire Danes TV show before *Homeland* came along."
Sugar Rush,Why wouldn't Homeland count? Carrie is the main character. 
Sugar Rush,[deleted]
Sugar Rush,Why'd you put Parks & Rec under dramady? It's a pretty straight comedy
Sugar Rush,"[Bomb Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1955311/reference) is Canadian btw, unless there's another one, in which case the Canuck show should be on there...

Also, add in [Being Erica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149608/reference) - love that show.

And [Hunted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069449/reference)

Both versions of La Femme Nikita, of course... (although the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118379/reference) was better than the [remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592154/reference) hehe..)

[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098898/reference) (UK) - all seasons/series.

[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/reference) - renewed for a second season yay.

(ps you dont really need to mark anything as Canada since like 50% of the shows listed are produced here and it's redundant.)"
Sugar Rush,"What about Bones? Booth is also a lead, but the show definitely revolves around her.

The Middle could also potentially fit. It generally focuses on Patricia Heaton's character as she deals with her family, though it's become more of an ensemble.

The New Adventures of Old Christine was definitely all about Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character, and should be added for sure."
Sugar Rush,"I think perhaps you might consider adding Little Mosque on the Prairie, it's a little goofball, and kind of skirts some of the more serious issues brought about by the meeting of Canadian culture and Islam, but does feature some strong women, and women of colour to boot.  My personal favourite character is Fatima, a local restaurant owner."
Sugar Rush,I think both Moesha and The Parkers would both qualify as well as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 
Sugar Rush,"""Veronica Mars"" is not a fantasy show. You might want to add ""Nancy Drew Mysteries"" though. Cheers. :-)"
Sugar Rush,"*Necessary Roughness*

I quit watching this season because it basically rebooted itself. Not groundbreaking. Along the lines of traditional USA shows, but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Definitely add *Murphy Brown*.

And while they're older than most shows listed: *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, *Rhoda*, *Maude*, *One Day at a Time*, *Cagney & Lacey*, *Police Woman*, *Wonder Woman*... I'd even argue *Bewitched* and *I Love Lucy*."
Sugar Rush,"Without a Trace (US Marshall/cop drama)  
~~Gilmore Girls (debated whether this fit your 'strong' criteria, decided relationship-oriented didn't necessarily mean weak).~~  

Edit: never mind, you were on it."
Sugar Rush,Hawthorne! Was on air for 4 seasons. Jada Pinkett-Smith is lead. 
Sugar Rush,No X-Files? 
Sugar Rush,"I would have thought Grey's Anatomy would count. It's named after the main character, Meredith Grey.

Borgen, Spiral, Lost in Austen, Land Girls, Sugar Rush, The Sarah Jane Adventures.... Daria? ;)"
Sugar Rush,"Separate the list to include science/speculative-fiction and fantasy as a separate category. Put Fringe, Torchwood, Terminator:SCC. Dollhouse, Star Trek Voyager, Buffy et al under that. "
Sugar Rush,[deleted]
Sugar Rush,"Both from Denmark -  Borgen and Forbrydelsen.  The Killing is based on Forbrydelsen. Borgen is a political drama.

Also Annika Bengzton, Crime Reporter.  On Netflix."
Sugar Rush,"I'm glad to see Covert Affairs here--that show is continually getting better and better. Season 3 was incredible. 

I'm also a big Necessary Roughness fan, although the show's new direction has taken some of the focus off of Dani, and doesn't spend much time on family life anymore, which I enjoyed because how many other shows revolve around a mother with older kids? "
Sugar Rush,"[McLeod's Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod's_Daughters) - this may or may not be to everyone's taste, but it's really good for what it is. The story is carried by a strong cast of female leads and is very heavily female-centric. I personally love it to bits."
Sugar Rush,"None of these have women of colour except maybe Drop Dead Diva (asian woman), but she isn't really a main character.

Pulling (UK) - A comedy revolving around the antics of 3 quickly aging but uncompromising women.  

Accidentally on Purpose - a middle aged woman gets pregnant on a one night stand (might be too focused on both the woman and the dude from the one night stand, but I think the woman is really the main character)

2 Broke Girls - The story of 2 financially lacking girls trying to make it in life.

Drop Dead Diva - A female model gets put into the body of a chubby female lawyer after death.

Hellcats - Cheerleaders dealing with university and athletic pressure.

Reba? Might focus too much on the whole cast rather than just Reba.  (Don't judge, it's a great and adorable show)

Pan Am? Also might focus too much on the men in the show, but I think the women are the main characters.

EDIT to add more shows and: This is a pretty comprehensive list you've got going - I'm definitely saving this thread."
Sugar Rush,"Maybe I'm wrong but I would definitely say Castle.

I guess Castle may be the lead, but Beckett is a close right?"
Sugar Rush,You can put Law & Order SVU on your list. Detective Benson is the main character now that Stabler has left the show.
Sugar Rush,"American Horror Story,
The Americans,
Bates Motel?

"
Sugar Rush,"What do you suggest if I like action/crime shows? I have already watched R&I and I don't like things that are too old or that can't be grabbed from the Internet.
"
Sugar Rush,"I'm rather late to this thread, but: [Hit & Miss](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70271757?locale=en-US&mqso=81198655&titleVideoId=70271757&awadgroupid=8344250348&awcampaignid=121071908&awcreative=34988547188&awdevice=c&awexpid=&awkeyword=%2Bhit%20%2Bmiss%20%2Bnetflix&awmatchtype=b&awnetwork=g&awposition=1t1&gclid=CMP-vaOv_LsCFXPNOgodf2IAqw) (UK). (Technically the character is a pre op transexual, but close enough)"
Sugar Rush,Nice list but now the question is : which are worth watching?
Sugar Rush,"""Strong"" female figures? Some of them, maybe, not all. Not by a long shot."
Sugar Rush,Hightown.
Sugar Rush,I take it you didn't see the end of *Dollhouse* if you question whether or not Elisa Dushku's character is strong even with the memory wipes.
Sugar Rush,"Some good ones, thanks! Added to the list."
Sugar Rush,"I wasn't sure - it seems like an ensemble show (Carrie and Brody). But now I'm remembering that the producers have said the show could go on even without Brody, so you're right. I'll add it to the list. Thanks!"
Sugar Rush,"Great suggestions! Hadn't heard of Devious Maids or Scott and Bailey, and forgot about Prime Suspect and Call the Midwife. Will add them and The Killing to the list. Probably won't add The Bridge since it appears to be an ensemble piece (both the male and female lead have equal billing), but still plan to check it out. "
Sugar Rush,"Just missed it when I was going back through the list. Thanks for the reminder, I'll correct."
Sugar Rush,"Good catch re: Bones and The New Adventures of Old Christine. Never watched the latter, but love Bones. She's a great character (Angela, too :).




Left The Middle off for now because it seems more of an ensemble."
Sugar Rush,"Added. Looks like an interesting show, is it available to watch on DVD or a streaming service?"
Sugar Rush,"Good additions, thanks!"
Sugar Rush,">but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Damn right. Her guest starring on Burn Notice was great as well."
Sugar Rush,"Added. Keep seeing Necessary Roughness and plan to check it out - though this season's promos of John Stamos have not filled me with confidence. Good to hear the first few seasons are good, though."
Sugar Rush,"Nice one! I like Jada, though I got bored after a few episodes...did it get better over time?"
Sugar Rush,"The show seems equally focused on Fox and Scully. Scully's a great character, though."
Sugar Rush,"Agreed. Greys main character, meredith, is complicated and interesting. And the good thing about greys is while Grey is the show's namesake, the rest of the female cast are arguably more interesting and funny and fun to watch. It seriously belongs on the list of good shows with strong female lead(s).

It's written by a woman of color, Shondra Rhimes who also writes Scandal. It's also very rewatchable, it has layers and connections that you can pick up on a 2nd or 3rd viewing. It's on Netflix, 172 eps, and it's good until the S8 finale."
Sugar Rush,Done. Also specified which shows have teen leads. 
Sugar Rush,Added. Is it sc-fi?
Sugar Rush,Are these shows in English?
Sugar Rush,"Just finished marathoning Covert Affairs from the beginning. Starts off a little generic, but gets really good! I'm definitely hooked now."
Sugar Rush,"Good suggestions, added. And I liked Reba, too. :)"
Sugar Rush,">women of colour

sup tumblr"
Sugar Rush,"Officially it revolves around Castle, so it doesn't qualify. Since most TV shows are still led by male characters, or by ensemble casts (if you don't believe me, just browse top TV shows on IMDb, or the shows nominated for Emmys, or the prime-time lineup for almost any network), I want to keep this list to the relatively smaller number of shows led by female characters."
Sugar Rush,"Good point - it started out as an ensemble show, but I think she evolved to be the main character."
Sugar Rush,I think all these are technically ensembles. Good shows! But not appropriate for the list.
Sugar Rush,"All pretty good (in my opinion): Alias, Nikita, The Closer, Major Crimes, The Commander (UK but available on Netflix), Scandal, The Good Wife, Damages"
Sugar Rush,Depends on what you like. What are your preferences?
Sugar Rush,"From the OP:

> It doesn't necessarily mean likable or physically strong, but they have to be *more than one-dimensional caricatures* (i.e. no I Dream of Jeannie's).

""Strong"" as in carrying the show, not as in a character trait."
Sugar Rush,"I think they've said it could go on without Carrie, too. But I would still consider her one of the two lead characters for now, which is enough to make the list, I think."
Sugar Rush,[deleted]
Sugar Rush,Another one is Rookie Blue. It's a Canadian show where Missy Peregrym plays a rookie cop that the show is centered around.
Sugar Rush,"Grey's Anatomy has tons of great female characters, I just forgot it technically revolved around Meredith. I'll add it. 




LOVE Scandal - that was one of the first I thought of when I started making the list."
Sugar Rush,"I was thinking Utopia as well.  It's not exactly sci-fi, but you can put it in that category.  It's also amazing btw lol..."
Sugar Rush,"They're not but the first two are definitely worth watching even if you don't like reading subtitles.

My suggestions would be The Blue Rose (NZ), Outrageous Fortune (NZ), Offspring (AUS), Spirited (AUS) and Lip Service (UK)."
Sugar Rush,I don't get it.  Is there a famous women of colour tumblr or something?
Sugar Rush,That makes more sense. I've always thought that science fiction writers tend to create more well-rounded female characters than other writers. Why do you think that is?
Sugar Rush,If they take Carrie out then they'd have to change the opening.
Sugar Rush,Added. Thanks! Been meaning to check some of these out on Netflix.
Sugar Rush,"Will definitely check out the Danish shows, thanks for the recommendation! And for the NZ and AUS shows, they're good additions to the list."
Sugar Rush,"I think it's because of the writer's theory-of-the-future, or progress more generally.

When thinking of how the future will be, they decide that women will have a larger role in society, more important roles in leadership, and to-but-it-bluntly *more complicated* lives.

I think this is gibberish myself as women already have more complicated lives than they are shown to live in most fiction. When a writer has a female character in a present day fiction that character needs to be complicated in order to be both interesting and realistic.

I think another reason is the mostly male producers either poorly relate to complicated female characters *or* the believe the *auduience they are selling to* will poorly relate."
Sugar Rush,I don't see that as a problem.
Sugar Rush,[deleted]
Sugar Rush,"If I had the time, I'd try to do the Bechdel test on all of those shows/movies. Thanks for your reply, I didn't think I'd get one from anybody!"
Sugar Rush,Try /r/gravityfalls may get a good conversation going there.
Sugar Rush,"While season one did have better pacing, I thought season two was a lot better in regards to story, characters, depth, and my overall investment

And while yes, they technically are both the main characters, keep in mind that the creator based Dipper off of himself, so he can relate to him a little better

Very in depth though, miss good discussion of this show :)"
Sugar Rush,"""According to Alex Hirsch, there was supposed to be a scene where Gideon finds Journal 2 in the woods while playing. Why didn't they show that?""

It's called ""cutting scenes for time"". Plus there's no need to show us this scene. As demonstrated in episodes like 'Irrational Treasure', Gravity Falls has a lot of hidden secrets.

EDIT: ""Continuity Error. At the end of the episode, Dipper and Mabel are not in bed that night when in the very next episode that picks up where this one left off, they are in bed.""

I don't think this is an error. The previous scene of them out of bed is taking place during the day, but while Stan is entering the portal it's night. That's clearly a transition between two different scenes."
Sugar Rush,I did.
Sugar Rush,"Thanks. 

I'll be covering season 2 very soon. I liked the actual story of season 2, I just feel like it wasn't executed all that well in terms of storytelling."
Sugar Rush,I do feel like it was kind of needed to show that and how he drove his mother insane because it would really show how the Journal corrupted him.
Sugar Rush,"Yeah, but I'm not sure it would be good to expand it to 3 seasons without just adding mostly filler. Not that I'm opposed to it, but"
Sugar Rush,"I think they should've stuck to the original plan of 3 seasons to have more character development, but with my lists, I'm focusing on how the series could've fixed some of it's mistakes with just 2 seasons."

Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,🙂💕
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Back Street Girls -GOKUDOLS-,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."

The Comedy Lineup,I worked with JR de Guzman earlier this year. He is an awesome comedian and a great person in real life I watched his special as soon as it came out. He so deserved it. 
The Comedy Lineup,"Fox was really weird around then about green lighting these interesting, unusual, atypical types of shows and then doing everything in their power to kill them upon launch. I always got the impression that either there was a regime change where a bunch of people approved the shows and then left, or there was just a ton of tension between the execs who approved projects, the schedulers, and the people in charge of marketing.

Remember when *Family Guy* came back, and Peter led off with this long list of shows, saying something like ""We can only come back if all of these were cancelled?"" There were some real gems in that list."
The Comedy Lineup,"> Years later, the actor pitched a new live-action take on the character, which Amazon debuted in 2016 but with Peter Serafinowicz as the lead. (This version lasted two seasons.) “I really did wish we got to do it,” laments Warburton of not reprising the role.

I wish the [2016 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick_\(2016_TV_series\)) lasted a few more seasons. It was great. Amazon dropped it after two seasons and while the creator was shopping it around the actor's contracts all expired"
The Comedy Lineup,Never before in the history of everything was there a better casting choice than the pairing of Patrick Warburton as The Tick.
The Comedy Lineup,I really loved this show. Sad it’s gone.
The Comedy Lineup,We need Batmanuel now more than ever.

The Comedy Lineup,To think the animated series had more seasons than the live-action shows.
The Comedy Lineup,"Sonnenfeld has put up some amazing TV. The Tick, Pushing Daisies, etc. It's hard to grasp how easily something like a live action The Tick could have gone horribly wrong and disappointed everyone. It's a bummer it wasn't able to have the run it deserved, but at least everyone involved can be proud as hell.

*Spoooooooooooon!*

**Edit:** As a side note, lookup the film *An Honest Liar* which he produced about one of my personal heroes -- The Amazing Randi who used his knowledge as a magician to out charlatans and frauds. Fantastic documentary."

The Comedy Lineup,"They forgot that the best way to deal with Fox is to do what you want, let them cancel you, get super popular offline, sign a better deal with them, bad mouth them in your first episode back. Rinse and repeat if you're a legend"
The Comedy Lineup,Newer Tick was great at least.
The Comedy Lineup,"I was a huge fan of the animated series and was really looking forward to this version when it premiered back in 2001. I last two episodes before I stopped watching. Other than the casting of Patrick Warburton, ""The Tick"" just fell totally flat for me. It had little of the fun or energy of the animated series. I still don't get what this version of the show was going for."
The Comedy Lineup,"From what I remember, the team fucking blew all of their money on mundane shit like entirely cgi'ing out the suit's seams among other things.  I think Fox realized this was going downhill and put a cork in the leak."
The Comedy Lineup,Every Sci-Fi show ever made by FOX: join the club...
The Comedy Lineup,Why don't they just revive the animated show? It would be perfect for Adult Swim or a streaming service
The Comedy Lineup,Fox murdered a lot of good shows.  They cancelled family guy and firefly.
The Comedy Lineup,The newer Tick with Serafinowicz was much better. And cooler. Got mad when it got cancelled.
The Comedy Lineup,"This is one of the biggest tragedies in tv history. The show was phenomenal, and was only getting better. Amazon screwed us all."
The Comedy Lineup,If they would have done the villians it might have lasted.  I guess they didn't have the money for it.
The Comedy Lineup,I loved the Tick cartoon.  Hated this show.
The Comedy Lineup,Isn’t Fox’s MO to cancel anything that is popular?
The Comedy Lineup,"Keep in mind that Fox programming is also a reflection of the political environment and what subtext Fox wants to push.  Bill Clinton wins presidency in 1992 election.  Better make people not trust their government!!  X-Files premieres in September of 1993.  The government is lying to you!!  The government is conspiring with aliens!!  And they ALWAYS make sure to show Bill Clinton's portrait in Skinner's office.  

Bush ""wins"" in 2000.  Time to use any means necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks.  Oh and an added bonus: Jack Baurer would've fixed everything in the first hour if weren't for those pesky regulations and government bureaucracy.  Also, torture is totally cool.

The health care debate roars back to life.  Better start a show showing how the American Healthcare system is the best in the world.  On the show House the best and brightest minds solve medical mysteries, conduct expensive tests at the drop of a hat because every instrument is available all the time with no waiting!  In one hour the patient goes from dying to cured and no mention of the hospital bills.  Oh, except for the **hospital's** bills.  It can't make enough money to stay afloat!  American health care is just *too cheap to make a profit*!  Added bonus: painkillers are an awesome super-pill that let's House save lives!  

Now, I used to watch and enjoy these shows.  But as the FOX mask slipped and the conglomerate became more brazen with pushing ideology I started to notice that it wasn't only Fox News that was doing this.

Edit: corrected a year"
The Comedy Lineup,They have been trying to make that damn show live action since the 90’s and it doesn’t work. Go back to animated!
The Comedy Lineup,"It would have been hard to outdo the cartoon when the budget doesnt really constrain creativity in a cartoon.  Maybe drawing something more complex would take a little longer, but not totally impractical to do in live action. It would have been better if they continued the cartoon with these actors doing the voice work."
The Comedy Lineup,"But they are really great at spreading misinformation, or is it disinformation, or maybe it’s just bad information… let’s just say Fox is pure garbage and call it a day."
The Comedy Lineup,Who cares about the tick? I just want to see the [flea](https://muchalucha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flea) !
The Comedy Lineup,What ever happened to the Amazon show? I heard they were doing a season 3 then nothing.
The Comedy Lineup,I've enjoyed every iteration of The Tick and look forward to the next series when the copyright is up and someone needs to put out a new show or lose it.
The Comedy Lineup,"I loved this show at the time! Nestor Carbonell carried it with his Bat Manuel, imo. 😂"
The Comedy Lineup,"I’d watch the Tick if they had to get mundane office jobs, like “the incredibles” meets “the office” but live action. With a few implied superhero action sequences that are met with eye rolls by other office workers who are over all of it."
The Comedy Lineup,"I thought ""Batmanuel"" was an improvement on Die Fladermaus which is a pretty esoteric joke"
The Comedy Lineup,"So they had a “kids” cartoon animated like the comic book that was really good and fun to watch. I remember being a kid during the cartoon show airing and then being a teenager when the live action show was being promoted, if I recall they even had a super bowl ad for the show, the live action show debuted and I lost all interest after the first episode. I was young and just moved on to something else."
The Comedy Lineup,I watched cartoon  the tick back in the day … I can’t tell you just by looking at this one picture I soundly watch this. Just saying
The Comedy Lineup,Another great show sees an early demise due to people's inability to let the creative juices flow and push a couple envelopes. I enjoyed this show very thoroughly and laughed more while watching it than while watching any other show in probably 5 to 6 years at least.
The Comedy Lineup,Still the best version of the Tick.
The Comedy Lineup,SPOON !!!!!!!!!
The Comedy Lineup,It’s always someone else’s fault

The Comedy Lineup,"Ah, another treat from the orient! Mmm! A secret message, from my teeth!"
The Comedy Lineup,[Relevant clip](https://youtu.be/0oMTmtN7lHI)
The Comedy Lineup,"I always got the feeling that the people in charge of greenlighting new shows and the people in charge of setting the schedule had VERY different ideas of what kind of network they were running.  It couldn't have just been a regime change, because it happened over and over again for years.

Then it turned into a self-fulfilling cycle.  An interesting new show would be announced and people would get really excited until they realized it was on Fox and decided not to watch it because it would just get canceled halfway through the first season. And then it would get canceled halfway through the first season, citing low viewership."
The Comedy Lineup,"I spoke with Nestor Carbonel (Batmanuel) right after the cancellation, and he said that the Tick was killed by a regime change at Fox. The leadership during the development and pilot phase had been incredibly supportive, and then there was an executive shuffle and the new programming head killed everything that his predecessor had developed. He said the show had been incredibly fun to shoot, and really found it's rhythm before the end."
The Comedy Lineup,I feel like once X-Files took off they decided that scifi stuff would be their niche. So they just kept greenlighting high concept scifi shows hoping another would take off.  If it wasn't the next big international hit by the end of the season it was canned. And nothing really made it.
The Comedy Lineup,"There's also a huge number of shows that get greenlit, have one season, and are totally forgotten by everyone. I mean, at one point they made That 80s Show and a show about the Geico Cavemen. 

Tosh.0 did it as a weekly gag (""we'll be back with more [cancelled show here]""), and finally ran out of cancelled Comedy Central shows near the end of their run."
The Comedy Lineup,Greg the Bunny was the SHIT! I still laugh at many of the episodes. Favorite is still the pot brownie one
The Comedy Lineup,"Yeah, Fox is famous for green lighting, then destroying a lot of shows with great concepts. Poor marketing, constant time slot changes, direct meddling. It almost has to be a Murdoch considering how long it has been going on."
The Comedy Lineup,"I heard the original draft for that list that Peter goes through was much longer but they had to cut it, like, in half for time. I think it's mentioned in the DVD commentary."
The Comedy Lineup,"One thing that is different with Fox is they have less prime time programming than other broadcast channels. The local news starts earlier on Fox. This came about when Fox was just starting out and it incentivized stations to broadcast the new channel (nationwide programming is less profitable than local programming). They have never changed course on this as it would be very unpopular with the affiliates even though they are one of the big channels now. 

So with less prime time slots, there’s less room for error and less room to give a show multiple seasons time to grow and gain an audience.  Don’t get me wrong, still a lot of mismanagement and opportunities (and not just fox) but I would guess Fox is faster to make a change because of fewer prime time slots."
The Comedy Lineup,"The people green lighting the shows aren't the same people scheduling the shows, so unfortunately that often plays a part of it."
The Comedy Lineup,"Either Fox’s process was broken, or it was hellish by design.  It’s like big corporate sales. The sale rep gets you in the door and then hands off to the rest of the company who finds out how shitty and/or complex a sale it was.

Fox was an upstart in the late 80s and 90s and I’m sure they had a group greenlighting everything and then after that it was just a meat grinder to find out if anything would stick. Even then, their incessant meddling in schedules and constantly changing time slots was incomprehensible but could be just to see if a screenwriter could take the abuse. Honestly I think the Fox TV organization is just like the Fox News corporation; basically just dis functionally functional, filled with whack jobs and egos who somehow make the company profit.

Telling that the entire network is now sold off to Disney minus the two areas that still make Rupert money."
The Comedy Lineup,"The thing is that *all* networks do this, not just Fox. 

It's just that Fox was more willing to take bigger risks, so when they cancel it gets more of a reaction.

The reality is all these ""interesting, unusual, atypical"" shows tend to be *a lot* more expensive to produce than your standard reality show or sitcom, so the expectation for viewership is higher...which means the chance of it getting cancelled is *also* higher since that threshold is different."
The Comedy Lineup,Ah Greg the Bunny came to mind before I even finished reading this post lol

The Comedy Lineup,"Fox has always been about giving people a chance but refusing to pay for it. Thats why they were always successful because bombs dont hurt them and hits do way better. Its good business but it also leads to lots of bad decisions that affected entertainment like Family Guy, Firefly, Futurama, Brooklyn 99, Arrested Development, and many more critical darlings."
The Comedy Lineup,They always wanted to play it safe.  In order to get Logan made Hugh Jackman had to take an enormous pay cut.  They simply didn't believe an R-rated superhero film would work.

The Underwear,"Bluey and Bingo:  An ice cream shop!  Oh they're closed...
Bandit:  If it makes you feel any better I wasn't going to buy you any anyway."
The Underwear,"I'll play your game, as long as I don't have to move any part of my body or say anything with my mouth."
The Underwear,Bandit Heeler is one of my role models in life.
The Underwear,"The camping one with Jean Luc gets me in the feels every time.
It's a great show."
The Underwear,"Aww, biscuits!"
The Underwear,"This is one of the few kids' shows that also has so much to offer for adults! We're also waiting to get more on Disney+, using VPN is too much of a hassle with our TV. 

My favourites are the takeaway episode and funny quotes from here and there, such as the supermarket one with Bandit sitting in the toilet paper aisle:
""Can I help you?""
""Wish you could, mate."""
The Underwear,Big +1 to Bluey. Love the family dynamic and the parents play with their kids in realistic ways. Incredibly watchable cared to most children’s shows.
The Underwear,"Also, there are SEVERAL episodes that will make you openly cry."
The Underwear,"I got suckered over Christmas. My nephew asked me to come hang out and play Stardew Valley while watching Blippie. I thought Blippie was Bluey. 

It's *not*.

That kid is lucky he is five."
The Underwear,The lessons about parenting in that show are spectacular. The one where bandit is playing too rough with bingo is great. He handles it so well and it’s something that always stuck with me.
The Underwear,I remember the first time my son came up to me and said “papa you were too rough and I don’t like it.” At first I was like wtf are they talking about and then I remembered the episode and now I embrace it cause at least I know they will tell me if a stranger does that too
The Underwear,Fun fact: Bandit Heeler won Australian Father of the Year in 2019
The Underwear,"I also endorse Bluey. Sweet show, it models good play behavior for kids and 6 minute episodes are *chef's kiss* perfectly timed."
The Underwear,"Bluey is my son's favorite show. I've been trying to get him into the show ""Hilda"" on Netflix. It's also Bluey-like"
The Underwear,"/r/bluey exists.

You're welcome."
The Underwear,I love this scene that was cut for U.S. broadcasts. https://youtu.be/xwNkO2U7SG4
The Underwear,"100% agree.  

This is one of the few kids shows that isn't just insufferable to have on.  

&#x200B;

Muffin is absolutely the worst, but she's such a polar opposite that my kids recognize that and will tell one they are being a 'Muffin' when one starts throwing a tantrum.

The grannies episode makes me laugh a lot."
The Underwear,I am 34-years-old and have no children. I fuckin’ LOVE Bluey.
The Underwear,I heard the host raving about this on The Watch podcast but thought he was just joking.
The Underwear,I have a 3 and 4 year old daughter. This show is my family dynamic almost to a T.
The Underwear,When my 2 year old granddaughter asks to watch Cocomelon I tell her it’s broken and turn on Bluey instead.
The Underwear,"This is definitely my favorite father daughter show, I also stumbled along it and now recommend it to every parent fantastic writing. I have conversations with my 6 year old about the show days after, must watch tv in my house"
The Underwear,"I appreciate that the episodes are short. Don’t have to commit to a long time in front of the TV, just 8 minutes.

Also the music is really great lol"
The Underwear,"Watching it with my daughter right now. She just turned two and is obsessed. This Christmas she got a Bluey stuffed animal and carries it everywhere. The first thing she says every day is ""Bluey Bluey!"" hoping we'll cuddle and watch some episodes.

My favorite part is probably Bingo's pretend names. My least favorite episode is the one where they're getting takeout at Golden Crown. So stressful."
The Underwear,My only issue with this show: it creates unrealistic expectations of just how long parents are willing to play along with their kids game ideas. I can't keep up with Bandit's and Chilli's willingness to play along.
The Underwear,"Fantastic show. My son is three and we’ve definitely had our fill of Bluey. Easily my favorite of all of the kids’ shows he watches. Honestly, it’s nearly watchable without needing to have the kid around."
The Underwear,This show is amazing and as a new parent I find it making me choke up on far too many occasions. It is basically the new Office in our house. Just always on repeat in the background while relaxing.
The Underwear,"as someone who also started watching it recently with their 1 year old, it's easily my pick for best kids show out there, and easily a contender for best kids show of all time. it's so good I often times find myself wanting to watch it while my daughter is asleep. it has great lessons, it never feels like it's pandering to the kids or parents, it's just fun. it makes me emotional, and it's also really funny."
The Underwear,"I thought I was a good dad. 

Then I saw Bandit Heeler in action and realized that I am nothing compared to that blue perfection."
The Underwear,No worries cunt
The Underwear,"Love Bluey! Both Bluey and Bingo are girls, I don’t know if that was an error in your post but I’ve had to correct my daughters on that point before."
The Underwear,"Hospital, season 1 I think. Dads being the patient and they ""x-ray"" him, it's a crayon drawing, and dad wakes up and asks, ""is that a pot plant""

It's censored on disney but [its out there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DttoFaDj7Ko&ab_channel=NathanChristian)"
The Underwear,Oh my god. Yes! The take away advert had me in tears. I thought it was one of the funniest things i've seen. If you like Bluey you may like Hey Duggee. Particularly the stick song!
The Underwear,"This show is an entire how-to guide on parenting for real. I suggest it to *literally* every parent I talk to lol.

I heard a few people talk about it earlier this year, so I turned it on and both my daughters are obsessed now. Honestly, I kinda am too. We just got done with a *very* Bluey Christmas hahaha. 

Love it when my oldest asks to watch Bluey!! Can’t wait for the next season tbh…"
The Underwear,"Just drive the train, mate."
The Underwear,"Besides everything op mentioned, the pacing of the show is excellent especially compared to other things my kids could be watching."
The Underwear,"Man, in Bingo's dream episode they insert Jupiter from Gustav Holst's Planets masterfully. That song gets me every single damn time, and they used it perfectly.
As well, thanks to this show, my daughter has taken to calling ""duuuuuuuude"" ALOT."
The Underwear,Any episode they dance is pure magic
The Underwear,"My favorite adult related joke is when Bandit is setting up a chair swing on the porch and using one of those tiny Ikea Alan wrenches they give you and as he's tightening a bolt, it slips out of his hand and falls to the floor and he gives a frustrated look of disappointment. Very relatable."
The Underwear,"Even for people who aren't within the age range that it's made for, it's really entertaining."
The Underwear,"As a 30 year old father, I love this show. It is so wholesome in so many ways. PLEASE I need new seasons"
The Underwear,"I’m a new, first time mom. Bluey has been cathartic."
The Underwear,"My kids love Bluey and it’s definitely quality programming, but that dad is just WAY too much fun. He’s a great dad but he’s too much fun. My kids want to copy everything in the show and it’s too much sometimes."
The Underwear,Mr Monkey Jocks is one of my favorites!  Found this show with my child waiting for a medical procedure.  We laughed our heads off.  It is such a great show
The Underwear,I randomly put on an episode when it first appeared out of curiosity and it was so chill. It's almost the same vibe I get from watching Great British Baking Show. Just pleasant.
The Underwear,"Use a VPN to access ""ABC iView"", which has all the episodes plus the new season! This is how us Aussies watch it. I think a few scenes were cut from the Disney+ US versions, and the originals are amazing!"
The Underwear,"If you would like a some what realistic look in to Australian culture, BBQ episode is brilliant. Pretty much what happens in real life. 

Also if you are interested this Instagram account has locations around Brisbane in which some of the places are based on: [Bluey Locations](https://instagram.com/bluey_locations?utm_medium=copy_link)"
The Underwear,"I suggest you join us over at r/bluey. We post about theories, toys, articles, news, and the occasional praise for the show. And if you need help correcting some misconceptions, I’m your guy (but fair warning: I’m not a parent)."
The Underwear,I love this show. My kids watch it all the time.
The Underwear,"'Sleepytime' legit got me kinda teary eyed. Such a fun show, and refreshing to see so much heart in a kids cartoon."
The Underwear,"I’ve been able to hang out with my 4-year-old nephew more than average lately. He loves Bluey, and now I love Bluey. Many phrases have worked their way into me and my girlfriend’s conversations."
The Underwear,Bluey is such a great show. I love watching it with my kids. It legitimately makes me laugh.
The Underwear,"I love Lucky’s dad, Pat. He’s always game to play along with whatever his neighbors are cooking up, no matter how silly. He commits."
The Underwear,"Yeah this is a quality show with good parenting characters. 

Going from blippi on YouTube to those random Asian badly translated animal toy or cartoon videos on YouTube. Bluey is amazing."
The Underwear,“Hey Bandit! Check it out! New Pizzar Oven!”
The Underwear,This show is WONDERFUL. The space episode where Bingo learns to sleep by herself makes me emotional!
The Underwear,"For real. I remember seeing Bluey toys in Kmart one day about two years ago, and thinking ""What the fuck is bluey and why does a toy cost 45 dollars!""

I watched a few episodes with my step-kid and I just laughed. Probably enjoyed it more than her. The first episode I saw was the Pool episode. Where Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo all forget the pool toys, sunblock, towels, and floaties.

The whole interaction with the dad is exactly how I would respond to my daughter, or even my nieces and nephews."
The Underwear,"My daughter loves it (along with my wife and I). We always joke about it being a show meant for parents, but kids can enjoy as well. It does an extremely god job broaching kids problems, while also showing more serious life problems that face real people everyday (parents getting older, miscarriages, divorce, etc). It all didn’t hurt that we have a red and a blue healer and my life goal is to be bandit"
The Underwear,"The show is a household favorite, but I also really like the music. So much so it's on my spotify list and will have a listen for a quick cheer-up."
The Underwear,You're welcome
The Underwear,"My kids and I love Bluey and we recommend it to everyone, I can't wait for S3!"
The Underwear,Amazing family show!
The Underwear,Amazing show
The Underwear,It’s a fantastic show!
The Underwear,"I slipped on my beans! 

My kids(and I) love Bluey! They have favorite episodes that we’ve seen a million times and I still enjoy them each time."
The Underwear,It’s so stinkin’ good
The Underwear,"Love me some Bluey, I watch it with the grandkids. That crazy toy bird they have is hilarious."
The Underwear,r/daddit is leaking and that's okay!
The Underwear,My son and I play Featherwand all of the time!
The Underwear,I love watching this show with my 4-year-old. She's started running around the house talking like Bluey. Plus I love how relatable Bandit is as a dad.
The Underwear,"If you want a bit of similar humour but with an adult audience in mind check out Strange Calls by the same creator, Daley Pearson (you might know him as Thor's roommate, Darryl)

It used to be available on Netflix overseas, hopefully it still is - It was short lived but very funny"
The Underwear,"My friends and I, all well into our mid to late 20s, love to watch it together. None of us have kids, we just really, really Iike it. It's wholesome and sweet without being patronizing about the ideas it wants to encourage. And the art and animation is lovely.

It is fun to see which friend cries first though, there's ALWAYS that one episode that .ages somebody bawl over the mic."
The Underwear,When Bandit teaches Bluey to hold his arm when she wants to interrupt adult conversation.  Love it.  We are practicing that with my daughter right now.
The Underwear,Hmm I don't know.. I prefer the show where parents exploit their children to sell cheap toys.
The Underwear,I've watched this on a loop for 3 weeks solid!! The joys of having a 3 year old! It is a really great show though
The Underwear,[deleted]
The Underwear,"I tried really hard to enjoy this show because Reddit says how amazing it is ALL the time. It's just a kids show. I really don't get it. At this point I'm usually told i don't get it because i don't have kids. Idk. I'm a twenty something stoner who enjoys kids shows like Gumball or Apple and Onion or Centaurworld.

Bluey isn't even that. It just seems like a random vapid nick JR or Playhouse Disney cartoon. Does it get better after the 3rd episode or something??? WHY DO PEOPLE HERE ENJOY THIS SHOW SO MUCH. IS THIS A PRANK OR A FORCED MEME OR GUERILLA MARKETING? IT'S AS STIMULATING AND FUNNY AS AN EPISODE OF DORA THE EXPLORER.

I have upset the bluey fandom"
The Underwear,"Yeah I disagree. I feel like this is cuco all over again. Our kids are basically learning to be dicks from these guys. While it may be funny so see this dynamic, something about it doesn't really.make me want to let my kids watch it."
The Underwear,"Strongly disagree. The kids are selfish jerks, the dad is a pushover and the mum is emotionally distant. Screw Bluey. Hey Duggee is the GOAT."
The Underwear,"Can someone explain to me the ""Someone's husband eventually gets it!"" bit please?"
The Underwear,I dont want a life lesson I want ice cream
The Underwear,First ever award!  Thank you!
The Underwear,"Bye Muffin, bye Uncle...Strawberry."
The Underwear,Let's play Doctor!
The Underwear,"Best dad line ever. Also, I just lay on the ground and my kids will start crawling on me. Keeps them busy for minutes."
The Underwear,That was the first episode I had on where I realized the background show my kids were watching was actually hilarious
The Underwear,"Magic Claw has no kids. 

His days are free and easy."
The Underwear,I so wish I had the patience and grace of Bandit with my kids. It’s a perfect show
The Underwear,"If I ever get to play DnD, I'm making a Bandit Healer character"
The Underwear,The episode where Bingo is dreaming about the solar system then the sun starts talking with her mom’s voice… that made me weepy
Treehouse Detectives,way of the dog was excellent and threw right back to the very first episode
Treehouse Detectives,Dude thank you for this. The Simpsons were everything for me and my sisters growing up. We watched at 5/5:30 and 10. Everyday. I will check these out as I have admittedly been a purveyor of the “Simpsons” suck now regime.
Treehouse Detectives,i’ve been needing stuff to watch lately and i’m a big fan of the simpsons peak seasons so thank you for this
Treehouse Detectives,Going to go through these. That quote from Halloween of Horror sounds like some 90s level Homer-being-a-good-dad.
Treehouse Detectives,"Couldn't agree more with this post. I would also recommend Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me? (S31 E9). One of my favourite episodes."
Treehouse Detectives,"Thanks for this, I will watch these episodes and I applaud the effort you put in. Even if the quality varies, I love the cast of characters the Simpsons created and can watch them in almost any scenario.

What I find annoying about Simpsons criticism is yes even if you don't think the show was as good as it used to be, most of the people saying that haven't watched the show in years, and therefore are speaking from ignorance and pre-conceived bias. And worse they have to be a party pooper for those who still enjoy the show."
Treehouse Detectives,"I've been rewatching on Disney+ and planned to stop after the ""golden years"" but kept going since I'm stuck at home anyway. I'm on season 17 and still been enjoyable enough."
Treehouse Detectives,I would also add Barthood. The parody of Boyhood.
Treehouse Detectives,I have always maintained they have at least one episode each season that reminds you what it was in its prime.
Treehouse Detectives,I have been watching it every now and then recently and I have to agree people need to give this show a chance again it got really bad for a few years but damn if it isn't good now
Treehouse Detectives,"The whole ""Simpsons is unwatcheable"" fad has completely taken a life on its own.

That's like complaining that your favorite sports team got knocked out in the first round of the playoffs, and that they're worthless.

They may not be the same as their championship years, but they could be alot worse.

There is so much television out there that is worse than what the Simpsons currently are."
Treehouse Detectives,There will be buds is a modern classic
Treehouse Detectives,"Heartbreak Hotel was funny in a cringe type of way. I liked it, but it made me sad to see how broken their marriage is. I was expecting the black & white scene to be a dream sequence but nope. Marge was really after that dude lol. Then the way it ended was just… man y’all need a divorce already😔"
Treehouse Detectives,"I check in on The Simpsons every once in a while, and I usually enjoy it. Personally, I actually think it is better now than it was in the 1990s; but I seem to be alone in that regard. Same with SNL."
Treehouse Detectives,"Been watching in order, I'm around season 12 and the drop in quality is starting to get noticeable. Glad to hear that there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Treehouse Detectives,[deleted]
Treehouse Detectives,"If you have to pick 10 episodes from 5 different seasons you sorta prove its not a worthwhile show to watch. It just has worthwhile episodes, but the majority of them won't be."
Treehouse Detectives,The people who regurgitate the whole simpsons is unwatchable haven't watched it in years.
Treehouse Detectives,"I don't know if you knew this but that B&W scene was a parody of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", a very good movie. That actually made the ep for me ha."
Treehouse Detectives,“Simpson Safari” was the episode that made me notice the dip in quality. That whole episode just feels very off. It’s like a series of comic strip gags in a fish out of water setting. There is no plot until the last 5 minutes and then it ends with the simpsons becoming billionaires (?)
Treehouse Detectives,So you disagree with my opinions on episodes you haven't even watched?
Treehouse Detectives,"You’re getting downvoted but it’s true. After 9 great seasons, the show started to fall apart and a few good episodes per season doesn’t make it a good tv show."
Treehouse Detectives,"I agree with the guy above that by season 11 it was shockingly bad. I think I have the had the whiplash effect he mentioned. I struggled through until about 14 I think. But it wasnt even a slightly worse show, it was embarrasingly bad. I'll give your episodes a go though and hope that they're good."
Treehouse Detectives,[deleted]
Treehouse Detectives,"I've seen every episode and he's completely right.  ""the Simpsons has sucked for years"" may be a meme now but so is this emerging ""the Simpsons is good again"" nonsense, only the former has basis in reality though."
Treehouse Detectives,"I agree, and like you I am curious to see the episodes recommended here. But I'm skeptical because of the assessment by OP of season 9 as ""transcendent"". IMHO it was already starting to slip there, and was merely good, not great, much less transcendent. And 10-13 as ""great to excellent"". 10 is middling, really starting to slip, and like you said, 11 onward is mostly shockingly bad."

Explained,I know nothing about this franchise other than I always thought the chunky space marine suits looked cool as fuck.
Explained,"If we could just get Gaunt's Ghost TV adaptation with somebody like Anthony Starr as the titular character, I'd be perfectly fine at this rate. 

There are tons of more human focused stories within 40k that you could have a plethora of ideas developed before even considering focusing on a Space Marine centric idea. 

Warhammer 40k's range can be all over to place. From militaristic action with hints of Hogan's heroes, to something akin to Altered Carbon's Cyberpunk themes, to crime stories based in a hive city, and then to literal inspired Lovecraftian horror. Hell, Mad Max inspired Necromunda, or something that itches that Firefly or early 90s sci fi ideas with a Rogue Trader setting."
Explained,I just really hope the narrative isn't entirely focused around the Ultramarines.
Explained,It's goibng to be interesting to see how this gets adapted. There is so much lore across the 40K universe that it's inevitable large swathes get ignored. But I'm very intrigued by an adaption with Cavill at the front so fingers crossed they can pull it off.

Explained,Mentally preparing for it to be as good as the Halo tv show.
Explained,Forge worlds are planet sized Amazon warehouses!
Explained,"To me, the absolutely crucial thing is they don't start right out of the gate with space marines. 

I think this was one of the many reasons why the recent Halo series really sucked - they had nothing to build toward. The first scene was all about establishing master chief and his fellow supersoldiers as badass.

The thing is - that is something you should build towards.

One of the reasons why the Marvel Cinematic Universe thoroughly trounced DC was they built up each individual hero before throwing them together. 

DC immediately made a beeline for Superman vs Batman and it was terrible - that needed to be the culmination of a few movies worth of plotline, not a starting point.

Before they bring in the marines we need a lot, and I mean a lot, of plot involving regular ass guard or inquisition.

When a marine arrives it needs to be more of a force of nature than anything recognizably human. Massive, hulking and *fast*. 

I would like to see something like Eisenhorn on the trail of chaos and perhaps at the end of the season we get our first space marine action and it's damn near a blur of destruction it is so fast, and simply enormous. Our protagonist thought this cult had him and he was done. 

And that is *one* space marine. Not even an elite or legendary one. But that is what was whispered about in legend and something that maybe one in a billion people in the imperium actually witness - an astartes in action. 

But end of season teaser for season 2? Our protagonist finds evidence that the cult is bigger than he thought, and clues that there are more space marines around, as there was gruesome, wanton cultlike butchery. But this wasn't an imperial act. Whatever managed this massacre was a space marine alright, but not the kind that are loyal to the emperor.

Having seen what a marine is capable of, how the hell will he deal with a hostile one? Will he make contact with an actual space marine chapters knowing they may go full exterminatus on the whole planet over something like this? 

I know the temptation is to lead with marines from the beginning but goddamn, save that shit for *season 2*."
Explained,i really hope they don’t whitewash the imperium in this to make cavil a hero
Explained,"The 40k universe is largely just torture porn, but in a good way? Also the movie Event Horizon is considered to be canon and takes place in the far past"
Explained,"My hope for the show is not to go with Space Marines. That they follow an Imperial Guard company and make it a show like Band of Brothers, then in the last climatic battle they can have Space Marines rock up to just destroy everything if they want. But save the space marines till later so that they seem even bigger and better than if they showed them straight away."
Explained,"You’re gonna need a bigger article, but hope this turns you into some fans, the subreddit is pretty welcoming"
Explained,"I’ve never known much about the 40k world, except that it’s expansive and Event Horizon is somehow related. Are there any good books for someone interested exploring the lore side of it, rather than the gaming?"
Explained,"I haven’t played since like 2004, had a 2000pt Eldar army. Everything was just about getting my Avatar onto the Table. I don’t know if they’re even still a thing but I really wanna see an Eldar Avatar in live action."
Explained,Where the hell do you start if you want to read the best of the best and skip the mediocre. I’m pretty picky about the quality of my fiction since there’s so many good books out there
Explained,"[**Take a good look at this image here.**](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/629/527/large/tze-kun-chin-the-lady-and-the-knight.jpg?1514061454)

It's called *""The Lady and the Knight""* by Tze Kun Chin

If I were handling the 40k IP, this is the image would be the first thing I would hand any writers, producers, set designers, crew, etc. And insist that they physically sign it before I let them anywhere near the project. So they fully comprehend what the fuck this fictional setting *is*.

[The knight is that giant battlewalker in the background there. And that thing at the front is very much a lady. A callback to how a fair maiden blesses a knight on his way to battle](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/ladysfavor_godspeed.png)

But just LOOK at her! Enhanced to the point that she's an engorged, cybernetic skeleton. Held aloft by slaved servitor minds and mechatendrils. Leading a holy procession of blessing banners and flanked by the genetically engineered flying babies that reek of turned meat and preservation fluid. Speakers blaring battle honours and prayers to The God Emperor of Mankind.

And this isn't some fringe element of the fiction. This isn't the ""Mordor"" of the setting. Where everything is perfectly normal in the good guys camp. This is just a normal Tuesday on any random feudal knight world.

This fictional setting is absolutely insane. And anybody willing to adapt it must understand this. It's not the sort of thing where some face prosthetics and a pointy hat can cut the mustard.

To do this thing justice, one has to fully commit to this aesthetic.

------------------------------
**Edit** - Furthermore, this image would serve as the [""rubber ducky""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) of the script writing.

Whatever idea the writers come up with for a story, they're to face that image and *explain* it to The Lady. Picturing themselves momentarily at the head of that procession with her undivided attention. Amongst the cacophony of noise, in the swirling dust of ten-thousand years of skin cells and detritus, nostrils assaulted by the stink of those spectators who have starved. Now picked apart by carrion eaters.

Picture how The Lady reacts to being told an episode is about two characters *finding love*, or *finding themselves*, or the *importance of their skin colour or societal class*.

For to be a human in this setting is to be one among untold trillions. Your life merely currency of The God Emperor, to be spent at His discretion."
Explained,Yeah something tells me Gizmodo isn’t the best source for this
Explained,I can't wait until it's a little different from the source material and all the nerds Reeeeee likes it's a personal attack on them
Explained,"I'd like to see the process of some recruits going through the trials of being a space marine.

It's not space marine wank material, but you'd get to see someone human go through some shit and become slowly less human.

Would give an opportunity to see space Marines and grand vistas of a space marine home world.

Or just give us a Gaunts Ghost series. It's perfect for a TV run"
Explained,I love this so much
Explained,I'm just ecstatic that Cavill gets to do something that he has a passion for without (hopefully) some other schmucks screwing it up.
Explained,"I honestly feel sorry for whoever wrote this article because no matter how well they wrote it besides just ""its the future, shits fucked, it's supposed to be social commentary and satire"" people are going to throw in some pretty hard ACTUALLLLLIIIEEESSSS. It honestly wasn't that bad of an article and hit the waves tops pretty well (except they haven't read any of the newcron stuff like a lazy bum who probably only plays ultramarines)."
Explained,I am so down for this
Explained,This is a great primer. Concise and factual.
Explained,"Imo go American horror story with it. Each season tell a different, fully self contained story."
Explained,Not much faith in Amazon after Rings of Power and Wheels of Time.
Explained,I hope the style is everything like astartes part 1-5
Explained,Sounds awful
Explained,I hope it will turn out better than the Witcher.
Explained,"I think the important thing to remember is that what works for one medium doesn’t work for all. If you try to make books based too accurately around the rules of the table top you would have messy nonsense, same for when you make computer games or board games, different mediums require different nuances. 

If they try to make the series in such a way as to please all of the people that froth at the mouth over the lore it will be a shit series.

Accept it for what it is and you will probably enjoy it."
Explained,"I cannot wait for this adaption with Cavill. I hope it’s good, rated R as fuck, and fully embraces the action and grim dark of 40k. If the story they tell in this series works we could see a plethora of 40k stories brought to the screen and the lore is so deep it’s be amazing. 

Horus, flight of the Eisenstein, Trayzn, Commissar Yarrick, Ghazghkull. Fuck it could be great."
Explained,"It’s likely to suck as it’s going to be made for the wider audience, not fans."
Explained,"So is Hollywood gonna put yet another group of Directors and writers that become, allegedly, aggressive against  ever staying faithful to the original material?

‘Cause if they do, i rather those guys go in with the Mindset of Starship Troopers."
Explained,"40000? I have never heard it called that. 

It’s called 40k by everyone I know."
Explained,"I have been waiting for a TV show or movie in this universe to happen. I've been interested in the universe for a long, long time, but the barrier to entry was just too much for me."
Explained,Honestly think anything but animated is doing this IP a dis-service tbh. No way in hell is live action possible
Explained,"I have three hopes for this show
1.	 That they mail the Grimdarkness of it
2.	That they stick to the lore
3.	That newcomers get into it. 

It’s gonna be hard to pull off."
Explained,I love the idea of 40K but the cost has always kept me away. Is there a good place to get into the story (I know the universe is huge)?
Explained,Does this mean all the stuff from the games workshop streaming service will run on Amazon?  Hammer and bolter was fun and I would like to rewatch it and not have that service.
Explained,"Should they do the reunification of terra ?

Focusing on the reveal of th emperor and the thunder warriors the eventual betrayal of them. Laying the foundation for the Imperium of man.


Fighting against the techno barbarians.
On terra.

Leading up to the creation of space marines and maybe leading up to the bigger evil at the end the forces of chaos.

This can probably serve as a prequel series into the Horus heresy"
Explained,"I know basically nothing about Warhammer 40k, but it seems like HIGH high fantasy to me. Much closer to Warcraft than Game of Thrones.

Something this wild will be tough to pull off in live action without an absurdly high budget. And since Warhammer isn't exactly mainstream compared to other franchises, I can't imagine Amazon pumping a lot of money into it.

I don't see why they can't make it animated. Seems like a much better fit."
Explained,Spoiler alert: Gunna be dog shit.
Explained,"I'll pretty much watch anything with Henry Cavill in it. I don't know anything about Warhammer, but Henry is so genuine, such a good dude, plays a number of roles well, and to top it off he is a gamer."
Explained,Amazon have butcherd every major franchise adaptation they've touched. I have no doubt they'll do it again.
Explained,"I don’t want to gatekeep warhammer 40k but even if you read this article it won’t help because it takes many years of reading lore that may or may not be Canon in a giant mess of a universe filled with plot hole,plot armour and best of many years of fan theory that has been slowly widespread and accepted clouding what is and isn’t correct or accurate."
Explained,This is going to be one giant disaster
Explained,"I really hope this turns out well, not only because I like WH40k, but particularly for Cavill's sake.

Poor dude has been getting one rough work deal after another, that whole Witcher situation turned out just particularly sad."
Explained,Everyone is bad. There are no good guys...
Explained,I hope they link it to Event Horizon.🤞
Explained,"I think the real question is how they can work in a teenage sidekick. You know, someone the youth audience can identify with. 

Also, can the god emperor be a woman? This is so over time the emperor can grow and become socially aware."
Explained,"If his show pops off. It's gonna be interesting seeing 40k get popular in the mainstream. I'm still getting used to most ""nerd culture"" being so celebrated now I guess"
Explained,I just binged lore videos and this seems like a universe where a show could go anywhere or just be a new story. Allows for more creativity than Witcher maybe
Explained,I hope Amazon comes out with officially licensed cleaning products for the fans.
Explained,I feel like they can’t do 40k justice with a tv show. Seems a bit too dark. Not to mention the demonic stuff which will get politicized to the extreme.
Explained,"Inb4: ""WHY ARE THERE NO FEMALE SPACE MARINES!?""

I mean this is the setting that got attacked by PETA because one of their fictional factions has a boner for wolf-pelts and skulls.  The solution? ""They're not wolves. There are no wolves on Fenris."" - a cryptic sentence which was later revealed as ""yeah, those wolves are mutated original settlers of the planet"".

It is the most racist, bigoted, hateful setting ever where religious zealots actively hunt down and kill anyone who doesn't confirm to a preconceived standard or who, at least, doesn't agree to be dragged into indentured servitude over the course of generations.

It doesn't matter if you're black, white, Asian etc just so long as you're human. What matters is blind faith in the Emprah and even more millennia unreasoning hatred!

And no, the Omnissiah is the Emperor you degenerate cogboys."
Explained,This is going to flop so hard...
Explained,"Normally I would roll my eyes and toss anything coming out of hollywood into ""this is going to suck"" bin, but cavill supposedly having some control over it, is the only thing giving me any hope this will be good.  He is a true nerd and wants to be faithful to the source material.  Then the otherside of the coin we have Amazon, which has been a mixed bag, but lately their stuff has gotten worse, with the infamous LOTR for example.  So for once in a long while, I will hold a wait and see approach."
Explained,Ok but which sexy character will be play for us to thirst over?
Explained,"eh, 40k lore is so incredibly layered with dozens of factions, chapters, sects, sub-sects and sects out of sub-sects and renegade cults out of those sub-sub-sects it's gonna be some real hard work making a serie out of it BUT Cavill will not want to risk another Witcher disaster, so I'm hopeful for it to be at least decent"
Explained,Any bets on what role henry cavil is gonna play? My money is on a primarch or maybe a grey knight but i guess it really depends on the timeframe they want to set the show in.
Explained,Why is this article written with so much venom towards cavill? Did I miss something?
Explained,"Boy, sure hope we get to see a live action daemonculaba! 

:-)"
Explained,"""Before Henry Cavill explains it...""

Man, these people hate him."
Explained,I don’t trust amazon with this. Let’s hope it’s not adapted with modern themes and with the modern audience in mind and just be faithful to the story
Explained,Am I the only one that thinks a season (or seasons) based off Uriel Ventris and the Ultramarine books would be amazing?!
Explained,So.... howmuch does Cavill really know about Warhammer and WH 40k?
Explained,GW can suck it till they add clauses to keep parody fan animations safe.
Explained,One (1) Culture GSV > entire 40K universe
Explained,What I would like to see is them partnering up with Brava Alfabusa. Make a live-action ITEHATTSD show. DO IT.
Explained,Can't wait for Twitter to find out orks exist in this franchise too
Explained,[deleted]
Explained,The emperor protects… copyrights
Butt Detective,"Interesting. I'd never even heard of it, though I loved NYPD Blue back in the day. I only disagree about Bosson- I think the only reason she works is nepotism. 

But I love that you keep an eye on actors like this-I do too, and my husband thinks I'm a weirdo! I'll even IMDB someone to find out where I've seen them before."
Butt Detective,"Good write-up!  I was glad to see that it got a physical release

I remember Benzali on a CIA drama in the early 00s that started off more grounded than most spy shows but it got kind of looser and a bit ridiculous by the last season.  Aside from Benzali's character suddenly wearing Panama hats all i can recall is a running bit where every time Will Patton's character flirted with or even smiled at a woman she'd end up being murdered lol"
Butt Detective,"My 2nd favorite show from the 90's! (#1 will always be Twin Peaks.) The cast, writing, setting, and even Mike Post's soundtrack blend together so well in Season 1. It's an underappreciated predecessor to the serial drama that HBO popularized in the 2000s. Benzali and Tucci are the clear standouts of the cast, and their characters play off of one another so well. The inclusion of plot points like the jury selection do really help to make the whole thing more realistic. And although the resolution of the murder mystery is a tad bit underwhelming (>!I agree with the late Stanley Kamel that his character, the psychiatrist, should've been the murderer!<) it still ends strongly and the final shot of the season finale is perfectly dark.

Season Two... Pruitt Taylor Vince gives a good performance in the third story and that's about it."
Butt Detective,"I usually refer to season 1 of this show as being my all time favorite TV Show. 

Such a great arc, superb atmosphere (that I can appreciate to this day, but I like some retro vibes every now and again) and truly stellar acting. Tucci's performance to me is one of the best I've ever seen (and I'm not adding ""him do"". I'm talking ever, everyone.) In fact, close to all performances in this show regularly made me wonder ""Why haven't I seen those guys more often?""). 

I do agree with the ending being rather ""Deux Ex Machina""."
Butt Detective,"I'll grant that nepotism probably played a part in Bosson getting the role, but she was still a lot of fun in it,

Yes, I do have an eye for actors.  We also got a young Adam Scott in a couple of episodes, Brittany Murphy, and a pre-""Breaking Bad"" Dean Norris."
Butt Detective,"Yes, I believe the show you're talking about is called ""The Agency"".  Apparently, they ended up seriously changing the show after 9/11.  I got to meet one of the actors on the show (Gil Bellows) when I did background on a film years ago and he talked about how smart the show had been initially."
Butt Detective,"Oh, I love to catch 'em early in their careers :)"
Butt Detective,"And speaking of the West Wing, there's that one episode with Richard Schiff!"
Butt Detective,"Lucifer is the show that just won't die, and I'm happy about that.

It gets cancelled just to be picked up by Netflix

It gets announced that it will be renewed for a final season of 10 episodes

It then gets announced that the final season will have 16 episodes

And now it's up in the air whether it will actually get cancelled or not"
Butt Detective,[deleted]
Butt Detective,Netflix must have got some seriously good streaming numbers globally for them to push for this.
Butt Detective,"Has this happened before? Where a show publicly announces it’s wrapping up, but then they decide they want another season? 

(Revivals don’t count)"
Butt Detective,"Never watched Lucifer but I thought it was really cool that the powers that be let him cameo in CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover.  The way he and the actor playing John Constantine interacted I just assumed this dude was on his show (Constantine) back in the day.  I was shocked to find out this was a fox property, let alone one currently airing.  Sending good karma their way, hope everyone involved gets to keep working."
Butt Detective,"I just hope Tom is part of The Sandman universe/show Netflix is doing.  I did some session singing a few months ago for an episode coming up and the show runner was there,I asked her about the possibly and she said Tom’s people had reached out to Netflix about it because he isn’t ready to stop playing the character yet. Here’s hoping!"
Butt Detective,Nooice!!!!
Butt Detective,"🎶crime solving devil. It makes sense, don’t overthink it🎶

I love this show"
Butt Detective,"Oh hell yes! Article is on TVLINE right now, hope this gets confirmed by extra sources soon

Edit - similar article on Deadline now

Butt Detective,I hope season 6 is going to have Constantine then
Butt Detective,*cries in Bojack*
Butt Detective,"**FUCK YES**

&#x200B;

It's the only show on tv that truly speaks to me."
Butt Detective,Lucifer in Crisis was pretty awesome. Can't wait for season 5 and maybe season 6?
Butt Detective,YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! (Throws knickers at netflix)
Butt Detective,Hell yeah !!
Butt Detective,"So what are the chances that they'll use this opportunity to introduce the Sandman series? Last I checked Netflix had the rights to Sandman, and Lucifer was originally a Sandman spinoff.

Also I know that it'd never happen but I would love to see this Lucifer show up in Sabrina."
Butt Detective,Bring Constantine and I'm in.
Butt Detective,"Usually show runners right the show like it is the final season when they think it’ll be the final season. Won’t they have to rewrite things now? What if other actors already took on new projects, knowing already this was the final season. Netflix sucks, they saw how good the ratings are to this show and now wanna do this. I’m all for it if this season gets pushed back so they have time to rewrite it"
Butt Detective,LET'S FUCKIN GO!
Butt Detective,I binged all 4 seasons in less than two weeks. I can’t wait for some new episodes!
Butt Detective,"No season 5 yet, or even a release date. This is click bait junk."
Butt Detective,"Oh, god. Is this for real? Fuck yes! The Lucifer world has so much more to offer."
Butt Detective,Wells it's part of the Arrowverse now. I'd like to see it keep going.
Butt Detective,"Oh no, will Chloe be mad at Lucifer or will Lucifer be mad at Chloe this season?!?!?!"
Butt Detective,[deleted]
Butt Detective,More Eve please.
Butt Detective,Yesssss
Butt Detective,"They crossed over to Dc' crisis event 

Fingers crossed we see more cross pollination


Mostly cos I wanna see Maez flirting with Sara"
Butt Detective,If they leaned more on the fantasy it would be one of my favorite shows.  The crime of the week shit is so lame.
Butt Detective,Didn't even know season 5 was coming but I am so glad all those people who thought him accepting his fate was the end are wrong.
Butt Detective,CRISIS averted?
Butt Detective,Thanks Netflix
Butt Detective,"Oh shit, here we go again Luci"
Butt Detective,"Welp, this is why you double check to make sure you gild the right post. Oh well."
Butt Detective,"""Lucifer will wrap up with Season 5""

""Wait no..."""
Butt Detective,Fuck yes!!
Butt Detective,So I cant cancel my netflix yet? Darn.
Butt Detective,"wooohhoooo

great news!"
Butt Detective,He made a brief appearance in the crisis on infinite earths crossover. Made me miss Constantine too.
Butt Detective,Detective!
Butt Detective,Can’t wait
Butt Detective,"What I’d love to see is Chloe accepting everything about Lucifer and them becoming a power couple. She knows everything he can do and she encourages him instead of the boring old denial/suppression route. I’d love to see a show actually do this for once.

That’s what I’d love to see in Megamind 2 also. A power couple in love that works together and there’s no stupid bullshit insecurity/relationship trouble worked into the plot. That would be so refreshing and interesting."
Butt Detective,I wish they'd have focused more on the comic.
Butt Detective,Good the ending was crap. Like what was even the point of the show if it ended like that?
Butt Detective,I'll take another season if I can get one.
Butt Detective,My wife might be single handedly responsible. I don't think I've seen her not watching it in the past year.
Butt Detective,"This warms my cold, dead black heart."
Butt Detective,"Be smart Warner, accept only if Constantine is in Season 6!!"
Butt Detective,Yet Santa Clarita Diet couldn't even get a final season to finish the story
Butt Detective,"As long as we get more Mr. Said Out Bitch, I'm all for it."
Butt Detective,"It is good, but it follow a overused recipe : a cop is force to team up with a 'civilian' with unusual abilities to catch the villain of the week. Rince and repeat every episode with a overall narrative that unfold in the first and the last episode of the season. The main narrative is good, but the writers always returns to their confort zone. The last season was much more fast pace with less emphasis on the routine episodic vilain and concentrate much more on the main story and it was great. I hope they continue in this direction."
Butt Detective,"Terrible acting, terrible stories, terrible effects but for some reason I quite liked it."
Butt Detective,"Great, as long as we don't get another season 3. That shit went on way to long."
Butt Detective,"This show is a paradox. It shouldn't exist in more than 3 seasons because the 3rd season was an attempt to sabotage the show.

Nobody of them was seeing they were driving it against a wall? WTF? It was horrible!

And then the 4th season comes and everything got better. Where were these people for season 3? It was so much better.

And by the way: FUCK YOU hardcore fans who gave all episodes of the 3rd season a high rating! I nearly gave up on the show because of you!"
Butt Detective,"I tried to love this show. I really enjoyed the main character but could only make it through a season and half before the main female character/love interest just drove me away. She was SOOO annoying and boring. I assume since everyone seems to still enjoy it, that she must have improved. Should I give it another shot?"
Butt Detective,But we can't get Season 3 of The OA?
Butt Detective,Fuck Lucifer give me back Forever!
Butt Detective,But then cancelled the Santa Clarita Diet?
Butt Detective,"It was awful, cheese ball writing. I couldn’t make it through the first two episodes. To reach their own."
Butt Detective,"So much worse shit has been cancelled, how is this a thing."
Butt Detective,[deleted]
Butt Detective,as happy as this makes me it could potentially be bad if the finale isnt a cliffhanger they have to find away to undo some of the finality or if it is a cliffhanger but they dont renew the series is ending on a cliffhanger
Butt Detective,I thought this new season was the last?
Butt Detective,The awesome thing to do is use it too introduce the Sandman and really start to pop things off. Getting it closer to the comic book. It's a really good story but super weird.
Butt Detective,"Hell.. yeah
Speak of the devil.."
Butt Detective,Wait so how are they  going to have Season 6 i thought season 5 is the last season as Lucifer is back in hell?
Butt Detective,This looked like a huge hit for Netflix so not surprised.
Butt Detective,Confirmed ?!
Butt Detective,But where’s season 5?!?!
Butt Detective,Yes!!
Butt Detective,Yes! Loving this.the last episode with the song 'my love will never die' was heartwrenching
Butt Detective,"Happy to see Luci again. Still think the ending in the last season was a great one though, albeit very tragic. I still love that song."
Butt Detective,This makes me happy!
Butt Detective,This is what I desire!
Butt Detective,"This should have been so much darker than the typical ""non-police guy teams up with attractive female police officer, who doesn't need him, but then end up falling in love after 5 seasons and solving murders together"" aka Castle and Mentalist.

I enjoyed Castle and i enjoyed The Mentalist but it's only so many times the same idea can be reworked before it becomes repetitive.  The guy is literally the devil, at least make him dark and satanic with some elements of horror in it."
Butt Detective,I am very happy right now!! Also Altered 2 Carbon 😂
Butt Detective,"Good. Lucifer was always one of my favourite characters in Sandman, and Ellis plays it perfectly.

I genuinely looked forward to it as a show."
Butt Detective,And yet there is still no season 2 of Firefly. How much could that IP possibly be?
Butt Detective,I read Luther and became very happy. Now I’m sad.
Butt Detective,Thank goodness the wine sipping pta moms will have something to watch
Butt Detective,I’d like to see Disjointed come back too!
Butt Detective,The whole Chloe being created by Amenadiel on God's instructions has been forgotten. Maybe in season 5 but otherwise I'd love to understand why this wasnt elaborated on.
Butt Detective,"The show trying to shoehorn in a procedural-esq Monster of the Week narrative is getting old, though. If it is renewed, I hope it is refreshed as a more expansive drama with plenty of cute and dark humor. 

I remember reading something recently that Lucifer is one of Netflix's most popularly streamed IPs, outperforming even some newer buzz-y shows. Probably want to keep that going."
Butt Detective,Wait I thought the next season was the last?
Butt Detective,Lmao on my way to binge watch Lucifer and eat dark chocolate
Butt Detective,"So, six seasons and a movie?"
Butt Detective,This show seemed like an interesting premise but then it just turned out to be a fucking boring police procedural like fucking NCIS. God damn network television is an absolute joke. I know it's on netflix now but originally network tv.
Butt Detective,"I never did understand why Netflix renewed it and got all this great publicity for that, only to immediately announce that it would be getting cancelled again after one more season. I know that normally they don’t like their own shows to go on for too many seasons, but Lucifer seems really buzzed about and popular, and technically there’s only been ten episodes made by Netflix so far, so it just seemed way too early to be talking of final seasons"
Butt Detective,I could never get over the fact that the premise of this show seemed like such a rip off of the version of Lucifer in Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series
Butt Detective," I remember reading in an interview about the new season that one of actors said “We thought we had two seasons worth of story to tell, but it is awesome to get renewed for a final season”. 

Maybe the show creator is working really hard to persuade Netflix? I sure hope so, the 4th season was by far the best and I would love to see Netflix let it keep developing."
Butt Detective,Great show !!
Butt Detective,It was apparently their most watched or most binged show last year wasn't it? I remember them being at the top of some sort of list a few weeks ago and I was surprised they were at the top.
Dancing Angels,If only they had spent some of that effort on the storyline.
Dancing Angels,"I didn’t read the article, but I’m guessing someone shouted, “Action!”"
Dancing Angels,"Is it just me or could the entire supernatural subplot be eliminated? The storyline with the family, the cops, nazis should be able to stand up without the fantasy segment."
Dancing Angels,"Can I jump into this show without having watched the original series? More specifically, is there anything I need to know about Natalie Dormer's character?"
Dancing Angels,Thanks social media marketing team!!
Dancing Angels,"tits, thats why we watch this show...Billies were a lie and that made me cry but Eva mads me buy."
Dancing Angels,"Agreed. Nathan Lane is fantastic in this, but everything else about the show is... bad. I didn't expect it to be exactly like the original, but I don't think this version knows what it wants to be."
Dancing Angels,"Hadn't heard any buzz on this show so just looked up some reviews after seeing your comment. Yikes, that bad huh?"
Dancing Angels,"Loved the original series, but two episodes into this one and I'm bored out of my skull."
Dancing Angels,"But then who would watch it?

I only watch it for the supernatural stuff

I do not care about watching nazis"
Dancing Angels,"No, from what I can tell this is completely separate so far."
Dancing Angels,"It has nothing in common with the original, they're just using the name.

The original is well worth checking out, BTW. This one not so much IMO."
Dancing Angels,It's not special but it's solid enough those reviews are pretty over the top for the most part imo. A lot of them are far too hung up on the original show to not show bias
Dancing Angels,"Nathan Lane is the only saving grace so far, imo. I'm on the fence about continuing past episode 3. It's not very good."
Dancing Angels,"Cool, thanks."
Dancing Angels,"How could it not be compared to the original show? It's hard to look at it out of context. I just think that if it was meant to stand on its own, they would've just created a separate show"
Dancing Angels,"Because it doesn't have any actual impact on this shows quality. I'm not looking for a review of the first show.

And they did create a separate show it's this one"
Dancing Angels,"I think it's great that it doesn't impact the show for you, but that's subjective, isn't it? The whole idea of Penny Dreadful is apocalyptic horror melded with strong character writing, and if this show does not do this as effectively as the previous one, wouldn't that be a detriment to the show? 

Its like American Horror Story with new characters, storylines, and titles attached (or any show or movie that takes a similar approach), but viewers will compare each iteration to the others. They could've just created a show called 'City of Angels' without the Penny Dreadful tag"
Dancing Angels,I'm saying that I'm not interested in reviews that compare it to another show from professional reviewers. Review the show you watched or it's useless.
Dancing Angels,"San Junipero was beautiful, but the episode that most impressed me was Shut up and Dance. It was like a punch in the gut - extremely well done."
Dancing Angels,The true successor of *The Twilight Zone*.
Dancing Angels,"Love this show!

Lot of truly great episodes but 'Fifteen Million Merits' has got to be my favorite. Great on so many levels."
Dancing Angels,Black Mirror is absolutely fantastic and hope for a sixth season was the reason I held onto Netflix for so long
Dancing Angels,"Is that the show where the Prime Minister has sex with a pig?

(which of course later happened in real life)"
Dancing Angels,and rapidly went to shit once Charlie grabbed that boatload of American money
Dancing Angels,One of the very few times I got in early on a show. Heard about the first episode on a podcast and was hooked from then. I’m not from the UK either so I had to download all the episodes before they were available on streaming. I think I still have the files too
Dancing Angels,"With the World Cup on, it felt like I couldn't have chosen a worse time to rewatch Black Mirror lol. But I got through it and enjoyed every episode just the same. 😊

Dancing Angels,Best show ever.
Dancing Angels,"Hard to keep up the standard of those first few eps and some repetition was inevitable over time, but will say I think San Junipero is hands down the best thing the show or Brooker ever did, one of the best hours of television I've ever seen, and the Netflix deal was worth it for that alone. It's superb, if it were a movie I think I would put it up there with Eternal Sunshine.

I wish I could recapture how incredible ""National Anthem"" was to see ""live"" at the same time as everyone else, too,after the marketing campaign. The blurry meta between why you were watching it and why the people in the show were watching it was both thrilling and unsettling.

I consider those the show's two strongest eps, but each one was only really possible to get made for Netflix or C4 respectively, so the show's lifecycle has been interesting to watch play out. People think the Netflix move weakened it, but I don't, I think the show had gone as far as it could with C4, and the deal gave it a brief new lease of life beyond what it would otherwise have been able to manage. 

I firmly believe Black Museum was meant to be the last episode, Brooker metaphorically having his show burn itself down, and think it's a good note to see as its final statement."
Dancing Angels,why did i just think 11 years ago was like 2002..
Dancing Angels,"Black Mirror never vibed with me but apparently that is because I have a ""Reductive"" take. Every episode I watched or was reccomended to me fell pretty flat. Each episode gave the sense the show wanted me to be super impressed with this dystopian idea and every single time it was basically just ""What if technology, BUT BAD!"" 

&#x200B;

Don't even disagree with themes or ideas but like the show is much worse if it is not your first time coming accross these ideas. 

&#x200B;

Probably a great show for many. But if you read a lot of Scifi already or are even mildly depressed or are just generally pessimistic about the future of technology, then nothing in Black Mirror is going to blow your mind."
Dancing Angels,then netflix poured gasoline on it and lit it a blaze.
Dancing Angels,it could be here in a year
Dancing Angels,Yes that was the first episode
Dancing Angels,"It didn’t happen later, it was revealed to have happened in the past. Which is own can of worms imo."
Dancing Angels,"I wouldn't say rapidly, but more that it but the seasons had fewer good episodes as it went on. Not to mention the constant use of the digital clones of people. The fifth season used that three times. Three times, in a season of 6 episodes. 

I personally liked Bandersnatch, but the sixth season was it for me.  Three episodes, and each of them were crap. Two guys who were gay for each other as long as it was only in digital form and not IRL, an episode that's sole fucking message was ""Twitter bad"" (That was it. No real twist, just...Twitter bad), and an episode that A: Had a digital clone in it and B: made me appreciate Myley Cyrus as an actor. She was legit in that episode."
Dancing Angels,"The first time I saw or even heard of Black Mirror I was browsing Netflix while alone during winter break in college. I was like eff it I’ll put this on idk what it is. I almost turned it off immediately because the opening scene is just the phone ringing and him not answering, which annoyed the hell out of me. I almost shut it off then and there but the remote was too far away. Glad I didn’t and blew through the series that week lol"
Dancing Angels,"Well said. I agree with everything you said. Netflix allowed Black Mirror to grow. San Junipero is the epitome of that growth. As I said in the post, it's the best episode of Black Mirror if there must be one, and it being a deviation from what the show usually does shows that Black Mirror can still be so much more."
Dancing Angels,Black Mirror has a few really good episodes but I feel like most of them could have cut 15-20 minutes of runtime and been better for it.
Dancing Angels,how old are you? i find that people in their 30s often make this mistake for some reason.
Dancing Angels,"It didn’t happen at all. The sole source was Lord Ashcroft, who had a score to settle with Cameron."
Dancing Angels,Continuum with Rachel Nichols is a good example.  She gets thrown back in time and spends the rest of the series trying to get back to her time.
Dancing Angels,"You'd like 12 Monkeys.  Different timelines and time traveling.  

Most of the time I really like this sort of plot but ages ago there was a show that tried to do something new with it and it turned out very badly imo: Witchblade.  The first season was very exciting and cool, at the end of it ALL the characters died and it was devastating.  For season 2 they unraveled time back to the beginning of season 1 and redid s1 events (storylines) but with slight or sometimes big differences.  Sometimes it was like watching reruns but spot the difference.  Other times...like, she had found her love match in season 1, in season 2 they were apathetic to each other and it was very frustrating.  I had no patience for it.  There was a little of that in Fringe but not to the extent of Witchblade.  First season was still killer though."
Dancing Angels,"Happens again in Heroes.

Somewhat infamously a new character is introduced, taken to the “bad” future, left there, and never mentioned again.

Sometimes this trope is done really badly, when the setup means you know nothing matters because everything will be undone at the end. Stargate SG-1 disappointed me twice with this, in both the finale episode and the wrap-up film."
Dancing Angels,"You may need to rewatch the Fringe finale... Henrietta is still there. You may be thinking of Henry from earlier in the series, who was the son of Peter and Fauxlivia. He got erased and was replaced by Henrietta. Also, Peter and Olivia don’t have memories of season 5. Everything reset back to when the Observers first invaded."
Dancing Angels,I am super surprised that nobody has mentioned Travellers on Netflix. It's exactly this. Humanity is F'd. We live in Domes because of an ice age. We send people back in time to take over the bodies of people who are about to die. The future people take over their lives while trying to change the future.
Dancing Angels,The very last episode of Stargate SG-1 had a version of this trope where they are stuck on-board a ship in a time dilation field for 50 years struggling to resolve a seemingly impossible problem.
Dancing Angels,"In Agents of SHIELD's season 4, a number of characters get transported to a Matrix-like virtual reality called the ""Framework"", have all of their real world memories erased and new ones implanted so that they basically lived completely new lives. [Spoiler](#s ""The most tragic one being Mack, whose real-life daughter had died years before, while he lived a happy though complicated life with her in there. This goes so far that he absolutely refuses to leave the Framework even when it was in the process of shutting down and falling apart."")"
Dancing Angels,"The Star Trek: TNG episode that sticks out to me for different timelines is ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" S3 E15. 
We get to see the crew changed when a piece of the past gets removed. And later in the series we get to see some repercussions of the choices made in that episode.
 
For me it is alternate universes that really grab my interest. One of the reasons I loved Fringe. The Stargate series had several run-ins with alternate versions of themselves. 

 
It's fun to see the characters see the possibilities of what might have been. See them meet lost friends and wrap their head around this person who is yet is not the one they knew."
Dancing Angels,"Lost does not belong here. They went back in time, lived together and she eventually dies. Its all in the characters present. When they meet again its in the afterlife."
Dancing Angels,"On Angel there's an episode where he becomes human and can live a full life with Buffy, but he gives it up, turns back time 24 hours, and only he remembers what happens."
Dancing Angels,"There's a movie you should watch called Mr. Nobody,  which plays off this in a very compelling way. 

Also the pillow world episode of Adventure Time captures that feeling very well"
Dancing Angels,"You perfectly described all of the reasons why I hate this trope. I *love* time travel, but all “The original timeline gets erased and replaced with something else that is worse” is my absolutely most loathed outcome. Not because I think it’s bad writing or storytelling. I just really hate the experience of watching it."
Dancing Angels,"Did you ever see Felicity? The final season kinda has some of that; basically, series creator JJ Abrams Matt Reeves unexpectedly got an additional episode order when they had planned out a definitive series end with their initial order, so they got around that by using the last handful of episodes to basically imagine a what-if where Felicity made a different (spoiler-y) pivotal decision and how that would've affected her. 

The movie Sliding Doors is kinda the same way, it basically imagines two scenarios where either a woman narrowly misses her subway or makes it on, thus allowing her to catch her husband cheating. The movie follows two timelines, exploring what happens in each. Matt Reeves is also producing another series in that same style for NBC which imagines one guy's life going in three hugely different directions depending on one decision he makes. It hasn't been picked up yet but it's considered one of the strongest possibilities."
Dancing Angels,"Your reading of Fringe is very confusing to me. That is not what happened to Henrietta. She is very much alive at the end. There is the theme of the idea and experience from one timeline bleeding through to another in Fringe, but not with Henry or Henrietta. It happens with Peter for the others in season 4, and there is a tiny hint it happened with Walter for Peter in the last scene."
Dancing Angels,"I like how Umbrella Academy flipped this on it's head [Spoiler](#s ""and gave us an entire episode of plot resolutions, emotional growth and self actualisation, and two of the main characters resolving their sexual tension and finally getting together before Five reset the timeline and erased it all"")."
Dancing Angels,"Red Dwarf - Out Of Time.

The crew come across a time drive and, as soon as they install it, are met by their future selves. They have enjoyed years of gluttony and greed, having used the time drive to sample the best of what history has to offer (dining with the Hitlers, enjoying roast dolphin) but, now that their time drive is nearly broken, travelled to where their past selves would be in order to copy schematics.

The current crew are disgusted at their actions, and order them to leave. The future crew threaten to attack, deciding it better to die by causality (killing their past selves kills them) than live marooned in deep space, and get their wish - their future selves are victorious, and causality kills them and restores their current selves"
Dancing Angels,"“Supernatural” has an episode like this, where a character is hooked up to a sort of magic lotus eater machine that shows him a vision of what his life would have been like if his parents were both still alive and he and his brother never started fighting against supernatural beings.

There was also a somewhat similar episode of “Batman: The Animated Series” that had a similar plot; a villain traps Batman in an alternate dream vision where his parents were alive and he never became Batman. He ends up doubting it because it is too perfect."
Dancing Angels,"DS9's [The Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visitor_(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine\)) is one of my favorite examples of this, and also works as a great standalone episode so you don't really need to know the background (but I'd still recommend watching all of it!)."
Dancing Angels,Dark.
Dancing Angels,"There's an episode in The Magicians where this happens, pretty good"
Dancing Angels,The Magicians has a really great instance of this in the Season 3 episode *A Life in the Day*. It definitely has shades of *The Inner Light*. The rare instance of an undone future that has lingering ramifications in later episodes.
Dancing Angels,"What about The Sopranos when [spoiler](#s ""Tony gets shot""). It's not so much an alternate future but a [spoiler](#s ""coma dream""), and definitely not as extensive as others here, but it did last a big chunk of two episodes, enough so that we get a glimpse at what life he has in this world. Eventually though, it ends and he gets back to this world."
Dancing Angels,"Psych Season 7 Episode 8 **“Right Turn or Left for Dead”** does this trope really well, probably the most the show goes into full drama."
Dancing Angels,"What about The Visitor (S04E02 of Deep Space Nine).

Saddest episode I've ever seen of TV ever."
Dancing Angels,Oh my god that episode of Cheers had me so emotional especially since Shelly Long was actually leaving the show so it felt like a real goodbye...
Dancing Angels,The series Wolverine and the X-Men was about Xavier in the future guiding Wolverine in the past in order to prevent the 'Days of Future Past' future. At the end of the season they stop the event that causes that future and Xavier finds himself in the 'Age of Apocalypse' future instead
Dancing Angels,The SyFy show Eureka use this trope multiple times but in different ways and frequently used it as a way to do a soft reset of the series.
Dancing Angels,[deleted]
Dancing Angels,"You should check out Timeless, if you haven't already, since that's essentially the entire plot of the show.  A hastily assembled group has to stop a turncoat terrorist who has stolen a time machine and is using it to alter the course of history by changing specific events.   I went into it not expecting a whole lot, and came away really, really enjoying it."
Dancing Angels,Didn’t this happen halfway through the flash’s first season?
Dancing Angels,"Your Fringe knowledge is way off. Henry was Fauxlivia's son from the alternate universe. He was erased when Peter was removed from the timeline at the start of season 4 (September never pulls Peter from the freezing lake in 1984). Henrietta does dies in season 5. BUt the resolution of season 5 prevents the observeres from ever being created. So Henrietta is still born, but now never goes missing, and then ultimately never dies."
Dancing Angels,"One that makes me feel so much better sweet tragedy is Time Traveler: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2010)
Still think about that movie often."
Dancing Angels,Star Trek Voyager the episode where they have to stop a guy from 1996 from causing the destruction of the 29th century because he salvaged a time machine and was fucking up time.
Dancing Angels,"The Flash has an episode like this called ""Once and Future Flash"", where he goes to the future in which Iris West died. That was the last good episode of the show for me after that it's just ehhh"
Dancing Angels,Gargoyles had [Future Tense](https://youtu.be/vxgdZrrhTV0) what was incredible intense to watch as a child.
Dancing Angels,Happens in the last episode of The Runaways. A main character dies in the second to last episode and then they do time jump a few years into the future. Turns out another main character has been working on a time machine to bring back the dead main. Last scene of the show is the main cast ceasing to exist since time has been rewritten and it goes back to before the time jump.
Dancing Angels,"Check out the Hulu series 11/22/63. The whole premise is that the main character uses a time portal to go back in time to stop the assassination of JFK to create a new time line, essentially erasing the one we live in now."
Dancing Angels,"The Star Trek The Next Generation episode [""The Inner Light""](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Light_\(episode\)) was real. It was a probe sent into space by a dying race  to show they existed before their star went nova one thousand years earlier. The probe was putting Picard in the memories of someone that was living there, like a very intense VR game. He was unconscious for about 20 minutes but lived decades in the memory. ""We hoped our probe would encounter someone in the future – someone who could be a teacher, someone who could tell the others about us."" 


Maybe you are thinking of the episode [""Tapestry"" ](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tapestry_\(episode\)) where Q sent Picard back in time and changed his life so he never became more than a junior lieutenant."
Dancing Angels,"What made both ""Days of Future Past"" and ""Age of Apocalypse"" so great"
Dancing Angels,"Rick and Morty, the Vat of Acid episode. [Spoiler](#s Where Morty lives this relationship with a girl only to have it taken away)"
Dancing Angels,Final Space has a super dark episode with this. Their space ship hits a shard of time and half the ship lives 60 full years in what is just a few minutes for the other half of the ship.
Dancing Angels,"I just watched ""in the shadow of the moon"" on Netflix and in searching for it found this thread... but why did it come up in the search?!  I can't find reference to it in this thread... but now I'm putting it here...  

I was just thinking about the sadness inherent to good time travel movies and you nailed it, tragic and bittersweet.  

Watch In the Shadow of the Moon ASAP, and anybody have any explanation for how I got here other than predestination paradox?"
Dancing Angels,"Everybody got dreams bruh.
Then reality kicks in."
Dancing Angels,"Spoilers


The effects of time travel in that show are kinda terrifying. A timeline isn’t just overwritten. The old world literally falls apart, like amargeddon. Meaning that technically her actual son is dead (having met a horrifying death) and the the one in the finale is just a copy."
Dancing Angels,This!!!! The ending was fairly weak but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series.
Dancing Angels,"Not sure if i would like witchblade, i'd probably be like you and find the drastic changes frustrating

what i like about the examples i cited (for the most part) was how no matter how things shook out, the core feelings were the same, hence the tragedy of the loss. like how despite being strangers, Sawyer and Juliet still somehow knew they were meant to be or how Liz and Max were meant to be despite their concerted effort to be apart to save the future 

Being loving in one timeline but apathetic in another would feel.....unsatisfying"
Dancing Angels,"Writer's strike made Heroes chronology a mess, even more so than standard superpowers stuff."
Dancing Angels,"This is one of my favorite things to think about. That poor woman who they brought to the dark future, got deported, and then left there to be erased when they changed the timeline."
Dancing Angels,Peter was rocking tech that made him next to omniscient and Olivia's brain was flooded with cortexiphan. They totally remember. There's a reason why the penultimate shot of the show is the White Tulip.
Dancing Angels,"Stargate SG-1 has a few more:

2010: Set in the then(2001) future of 2010 a seemly hopeful future turns dystopian.

Absolute Power: Daniel is given a vision of the future that shows the dangers of forbidden knowledge.

Moebius: A quick and easy time heist leads to a present(so not exactly a future) without the Stargate.

Out of Mind: Seem like it at first but it's a Goa'uld trick as well as an infuriating way to end a season on a clip show.

Atlantis has more too.

Before I Sleep: Apparently a one way trip to another galaxy with 20 seconds of rover footage and data isn't a good idea. More alternate timeline than actual future.

The Last Man: Accidental time travel leads to future where the Wraith win and thousands of years have passed."
Dancing Angels,That was such a great finale. It was nice since they already planned to wrap up both storylines via the TV movies so they made the smart decision for the last episode to almost be a character study for the whole crew.
Dancing Angels,"Funny that you brought up AoS and didn't mention the entire season dedicated to this trope and how the characters all deal with the idea of seeing a future in which they exist [Spoiler](#s ""with Yoyo, Fitz, and Jemma all doing crazy shit because they think they're invincible since they've seen the future"")"
Dancing Angels,"> ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" S3 E15. 

YES, great example!

There were so many layers to that, how futures and pasts were seemingly phased out......so good.

My favorite scene is [Picard confiding that the war is going badly for the Federation than is commonly known and Starfleet command privately knows they'll lose in 6 months time........how paralyzing that must feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1z53QhFO9E&ab_channel=ChrisMurphy)

The alternate timelines/universes stories are by far the most interesting , the most heartbreaking."
Dancing Angels,This right here is probably my favorite episode of TNG. My only gripe is we never see alternate Worf although I believe the implication is he died.
Dancing Angels,"I did clarify that Lost subverts this trope - Sawyer and Juliet lose their shared life in 1977 but eventually reunite and somehow remember and realize they're supposed to be together 

Its one of the happy outcomes. Still pulls on the heartstrings"
Dancing Angels,That was one of my favorite episodes; so poignant.
Dancing Angels,This episode is devastating.
Dancing Angels,"> and replaced with something else that is worse

its not always necessarily worse, its just a tough, tragic acceptance in order to get to something better

take the shows i cited 

1. Roswell - granted, i'm still in the middle of season 2, so i don't know how it ends up *but* Liz and Max breaking up and not getting married, etc - hopefully averts a dystopian future. Yes, they potentially miss out on true love, but its for a worthy cause. 

2. Cheers - While Sam and Diane would've been great, ultimately one of the main points of Cheers is that Sam's true love is the bar and his bachelor life. So while its bittersweet to lose Diane and a potential life of love and companionship, for some people like Sam, its just not meant for them. Its an underrated aspect of the show.

3. Lost - Sawyer and Juliet are separated for a long time, but eventually reunite 

4. Star Trek - while Picard reflects sadly over the life he had, the positive is he'll carry on the memories of that lost civilization so they aren't lost to history forever."
Dancing Angels,I'm curious to know if you'd love or hate Dark.

Moving On,"I have my opinions about how off the rails they went after Change Your Mind (Even a slight reworking of Reunited to tie up some loose ends really would make a good finale) but the show at its peak really meant the world to me for awhile and a special room in my heart is reserved for SU at its best. 

Like I'm actually *not* a fan of how hindsight makes Pearl seem like a codependent mess here as opposed to someone who suffered a genuine loss that stings all the more because her feelings were unrequited, but as the latter it really is top notch. I was *heartbroken* for her when I first saw this, and Mr. Greg is still my favorite episode."
Moving On,"It's such a complex situation... Most shows couldn't do it well, if they dared even touch it... Most viewers probably haven't experienced anything like it. I certainly haven't. 

And along comes this kids cartoon that absolutely nails it with a 2.5 minute song and dance number. Wow. This episode gave me a whole new appreciation of Pearl. 

I almost decided not to watch the show at the last minute because it looked too childish. It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
Moving On,"That is my favourite episode. Live the entire show and future especially, but It's Over, Isn't It broke me. Outstanding song."
Moving On,"Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon, up to the Adventure Time Alzheimer’s allegory and Hey Arnold’s parental neglect in Helga’s therapy episode. This was the height of SU as a show, and was a major tearjerker in the context of the show."
Moving On,"My friend showed me this once, and having never seen the show, I had zero context for this song. And yet it still brought a tear to my eye. There was no way I was gonna pass on the show after that."
Moving On,That show as full of banger songs tbh.
Moving On,"What makes it worse is that she didn't really die, she's technically still there, just changed beyond recognition. This means Pearl has never been able to properly mourn or let go. Maybe she'd been hoping she'd come back some day, but every time she'd look at Steven all she could see was the crystal that used to be her friend."
Moving On,Wow. Never seen the show but this makes me want to watch. This is beautifully melancholy.
Moving On,It's my second favorite SU song. Pearl is so raw and real and open about how she feels. My heart hurt so bad for Greg and Steven but Pearl.... They had thousands of years together and then Rose was just gone and all that was left was little Steven. And despite all the pain Pearl was there for her son. Fricking love Pearl and Steven Universe.
Moving On,"“Now I have to be there for her son”

That line always hit hard. Even in normal humans, that situation would be tough. In Steven/Rose’s case, I can’t even imagine."
Moving On,I'm sad this era of animation is over thanks to HBO.
Moving On,I would like to point out that later episodes show that Pearl was literally Roses slave. So it’s a slave having feelings for her master and she’s so devoted to rose even after death and can’t get over it cause rose asked her to never stop feeling for her. I wouldn’t call any of this a good thing. I’m hindsight it makes this song seem really hollow.
Moving On,peak CN was dexters/cow/jhonny/pp girls/courage/eds not this
Moving On,"Steven Universe and it's sequel Steven Universe Future was quite possibly the most emotionally mature show in TV. Cartoon or live action included. It handled some incredibly deep issues so well that kis and their parents can both enjoy. 

The episodes of Steven Universe Future with the ""Steven Tag"" was heartbreaking from a parent's perspective and their kids growing up but was so good."
Moving On,"Wow, a lot wrong here.

First if all, it wasn't an unrequited love, they were together for thousands of years. Rose would love humans from time to time but eventually  she'd move on (or they'd die) and she'd be with Pearl again, as Pearl and Rose were effectively (barring an accident or murder) immortal.

Secondly, part of the uncertainty (""It's over isn't it? Isn't it? isn't it over?"") Comes from the uncertain status. Rose gave up her existence to create Steven, but is that absolutely the end? Might she return again, perhaps after Steven's life, if he proves mortal?

Died in childbirth and Pearl's love for Rose being unrequited, did you just watch like...that one episode?"
Moving On,Pink/Rose really messed Pearl up. Just so much damage and none of it hashed out before Steven was born. Poor soul.
Moving On,This show sucks.
Moving On,"Err... Pearl is a born slave with a toxic, almost pathetically dependent one-way relationship with a childish space Nazi. Steven Universe is a dark, inappropriate for children mess. The song is fine (some of them are good tbf), but Sugar's show is not okay in many ways. When Season 2 ended, it took an immediate nosedive. The series finale was the rotten cherry on top with the one-episode redemption arc of a genocidal villain.

Also... if fusion is meant to represent an... *intimate* bond between two or more Gems, what is going on between Steven and Connie (two underage kids) and Steven and Greg (father and son) when they fuse? ☠💀

EDIT: People downvoting en masse, but no one really seems to argue against my points mentioned here. Weird. :^)"
Moving On,I can't bring myself to watch Steven Universe after Steven implies that the Diamonds are family to him
Moving On,[deleted]
Moving On,CN stopped having any peaks about 2008
Moving On,[removed]
Moving On,"A pretty good quartet sang a pretty good arrangement of this at our international contest [this past summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiChRPulzdc). 

I still haven't seen Steven Universe, so at the time I had no idea what it was from, or that it was even from anything, but the lyrics are so heartbreaking even without context."
Moving On,"Honestly the last moment I remember being impressed and moved by Steven Universe. I dropped it soon after this episode, it was just really starting to make me sad. It's plot had run it's course, the 10 minute long episode runtimes were killing it, and I just didn't think it was as good anymore. But there were some really amazing episodes, mostly focused on Pearl, Rose and Greg, that I'll always hold close to my heart."
Moving On,This episode fucked me up for a while- because it made me realize i was hanging onto a past relationship. Im happy to say i was able to move on and find new relationships. But i still think about that person everyday like the one that got away.
Moving On,"I swear I have some kind of misophonia variant. Musicals and such irrationally irritate me. I like music (particularly early 90s grunge), but when a song becomes part of the plot of something, I can't bear it."
Moving On,"Didn't like how From Here to Homeworld played out so fast, but the ending of the SU movie and Future left a satisfied taste in my mouth.

Wait, hang on...bit of phrasing there."
Moving On,"I remember my father, brother and I were having a conversation while I was trying to watch this episode. We all got quiet when this part came on. I was on the verge of tears, and then the conversation picked up like normal. The power of art."
Moving On,"Well, I think Pearl IS a codependent mess.  After all, she's a pearl, ""bred"" to be obedient to her diamond. Love came into play for Pearl, which just made kind of a mess of her head.  Part love, part obedient servant."
Moving On,"I have no context for anything you’ve just said, but your description of its effect upon you has left me wanting to give this series a try."
Moving On,"Future was fucking stupid in how in sets up a bunch of new plotlines that dont get resolved. 

Volleyball was a super important Pearl development and then she disappears. 

Bluebird was a random ass new threat that just disappears after vowing to kill Steven. 

PERIDOT AND LAPIS DON’T HAVE ANY DIALOGUE TOGETHER. Don’t know what the fuck Sugar was thinking"
Moving On,Help an ignorant and dumb man understand. What is this dynamic she’s singing about because I am way off with my guessing.
Moving On,"The big ""reveal"" with Steven at the end of the show in front of the diamonds legit makes me tear up every time I see it

The show gets a lot of flak, but it's really really solid"
Moving On,They also had to redraw the animation for Pearl because the voice actress put so much emotion into it. Epic acting move.
Moving On,"Steven Universe is a show just full of those.  One of my favorites, and that's coming from someone who was already grey of hair when he saw the first episode.

I do have to admit it took a while to grow on me, and for a long time it was just background noise I'd occasionally overhear around the younger folks. But then I caught little glimpses of the end of season 1 and got hooked."
Moving On,">Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon.

Then we get to ""Steven Universe: Future.""

That whole series fucked me up, man."
Moving On,"Oof, coming to realize later that Helga's mom was an alcoholic, her dad was a workaholic, and the favored child Olga was always on the bring of breaking because she felt so much pressure on her.

Helga woulda been the most relatable if she didn't have the creepy Arnold statue made of gum in the closet thing."
Moving On,Regular Show also did a good job with this. Mordecai spent the entire 8 seasons chasing Margaret before realizing it was just a silly crush and that they are better as friends than lovers and that he needed to move on.
Moving On,They did do that in a later episode when Steven was a baby and she tried taking his gem out. Shit got dark.
Moving On,"Season 1 is a bit wonky, a little too childish, but it gets going by season 2. Season 1 is instrumental for certain things to be meaningful later (most notably the Steven/Connie relationship, fusion and what the monsters they fight actually *are*, Greg's lack of wealth until this very episode, etc.). But you could start with a hand-selected list of episodes, a bigger fan will probably tell you it's *all* important but you can skip around season 1 and watch maybe 10 of its 52 episodes. Just watch in order by the time you get to season 1 finale."
Moving On,"The emotional intelligence of this ""kids show"" is staggering. Made me cry more than once."
Moving On,"I've heard one other song from this show and it was pretty damn good but I still can't separate the knowledge I have of the fandom from the show itself. Every time I think about watching the show I just get echoes of ""you're whitewashing this character that we decided is POC-coded because she's purrrrrrppppplllllleeeee"""
Moving On,*Discovery
Moving On,"You're correct. I loved SU at its peak but they really dropped the ball with the ending. You can't make the villains fascist mass-murderers and just redeem them at the end ""bEcAuse thEy'Re fAmiLy"". It's why I don't recommend the series to friends."
Moving On,"Regular Show, Adventure Time, Over the Garden Wall, etc. all received near-universal acclaim throughout their runs. It petered out a bit for me by the time OK KO came out (I really hate its animation style) but I watched these as a teenager and in college, give them a shot. CN Real was a dumb experiment and Adventure Time in particular revived the network in the public consciousness. I remember seeing the t-shirts throughout high school and not just by the nerdy kids.

HBO Max's desire to kill its staggering animation history makes it all the sadder that the last real CN show for kids *and* adults, Infinity Train, is only available on iTunes now and a persona non grata to David Zaslav due to residuals to animators."
Moving On,"Lol but it's fitting for SU....loads of double entendre in it.

But it's precisely the movie and Future I don't like....but then anything doubling down on the anti Rose agenda and leaving the Diamonds unshattered/unpunished would've left me fuming. Oh well, I am glad the other half of the fanbase enjoys."
Moving On,"Your people gave SU at least a few moments of their time?!

I can't get anyone in my circle to, but still I aspire to it one day. That sounds like a perfect moment."
Moving On,"Yeah I feel like people forget that the gems have some pretty stringent programming in the back of their minds that is shown to still be extremely present throughout characters we know.

“Do it for her” is still a massive demonstration of this she conveys all her feelings about obligation to rose and her willingness to disregard her own safety and to die to protect her and try’s to transfer all of that baggage onto Connie who she sees as the equivalent for Steven. 

And those things are conveyed much earlier than it’s over isn’t it.

Most of pearls arc throughout the show is learning to be her own person with her own needs, wants and desires instead of the ‘servant’ for rose(as was her original programming) and a ton of that requires her breaking out from that dependence on rose"
Moving On,"My issue I suppose is the show reinforcing anything done on Rose's part to make her feel that way, which makes it seem worse, more noticeable, and invalidating of the love she feels. Now We're Only Falling Apart should've been the final word on Rose's feelings on it, where she's depicted as being extremely uncomfortable with it and tries to shut it down at every turn. 

Yes any leaning into those feelings is suggestive of her ""purpose"" and how much she needs to move away from it, but I like the greater mix earlier parts of the show had where the love feels genuine and something you can root for, but not the subservience. Taking into account the show as a whole it's made it seem *all* subservience and I just think this song is less tragic that way, more ""pathetic,"" and I don't like it.

Do It For Her has been mentioned but it's brilliant because it can be read multiple ways. People who didn't literally serve a loved one in real life would still die for them if they needed to and we don't call that unhealthy, and by that point in the show you feel Rose would too if Pearl would allow it, and speaking for her is the problem rather than her dedication to her. This plays out with Steven aka Rose herself in a sense where he doesn't want to stop Connie from having his back, but wants to fight alongside her. 

This part of the show depicts Pearl's relationship with Rose as complicated, but coming from a place of real love and clarity. Those ""silly games"" with Greg mentioned shows real capacity for self-reflection so she knows deep down she has issues, but maybe casting the sum total of her feelings as the issue weakens the power of It's Over Isn't It. Just my two cents."
Moving On,"If you do end up enjoying it, remember to shoot me a message if you want, I'd really like to hear about it. :)"
Moving On,"Its a very long story.  Trying to keep it as short as I can, she was the right-hand to Rose Quartz and she developed feelings for her.  However, Rose Quartz eventually developed feelings for a human (Greg, Steven's father) and, in order for them to have a kid, Rose had to give up her 'gem' to her child, which means her death. Pearl (and the other crystal gems) also had to raise Steven afterwards as they had no idea what a Human/Gem hybrid could end up like.

Rose and Pearl were together a long time.  So the song is about her still trying to move on from Rose's passing, as well as her jealousy towards Greg."
Moving On,"She dedicated and changed her entire life for a woman she loved only to have her fall for someone else. But because she loved her so much, she dedicated herself to her love’s son after she died. Steven is a constant reminder that Rose is gone forever and a testament to what Pearl lost when Rose died."
Moving On,"I love Steven Universe: Future so much. It's so rare we ever get to see cartoon characters age (anything more than a one-off scene in the future is almost non existent), and it really allowed us to explore Steven's life from a new perspective. I feel like the main show was very heavily focused on the story of a child learning about the failings of his seemingly-perfect mother and having to right her wrongs, while Future really started letting Steven become his own person. The updates in character designs and behaviors were just the cherry on top"
Moving On,"Oh yeah, and what would you make the statue out of huh? Ramen?"
Moving On,Broken people becoming obsessed with someone they view as successful and can solve all of their problems is incredibly relatable.
Moving On,"I can't comment about any race related aspect of the show, but I rarely hear good things about the fandom.

They even bullied a fellow fan-artist into attempting suicide."
Moving On,This era ended even before AT&T even involved.
Moving On,I mean you gotta admit that is all very much in brand for who stevens character is.
Moving On,The end shows that the diamonds are all working hard to be better. They're not just magically forgiven now.
Moving On,"I mean, it’s also pretty easy to recommend the show up through the wedding with the caveat that everything after doesn’t handle the antagonists well 🤷‍♂️"
Moving On,While it may not have been as satisfying for you you have to admit that Steven forgiving and rehabilitating the diamonds is 100% on brand for him.
Moving On,"The show had just reached its half-way point when it was cancelled following the wedding episode, everything else was concessions Sugar was able to get from Cartoon Network to wrap up loose ends.  They had no choice but to wrap it up fast :(

As for the anti Rose agenda, something they never got the chance to explore was how Steven had been learning about his mom's life in reverse, from how she was right before he was born to the spoiled monster she was when she was very young.  She had a fantastic character arc, just told in reverse.  I think there would have been an episode about realizing and grappling with this.  His mom was a wonderful person deep down, she just had to break from her toxic childhood household to become that.

Im super happy to see that the show has touched so many people, even when they didnt super enjoy the post-cancel stuff"
Moving On,"Yeah, I think when you include the movie and Future the show ends up having pretty great pacing.  Starts slow, builds in bursts of  expanded lore mixed with periods of downtime, suddenly you are going through a resolution you didn't expect, but then there's time to grow into it and move on."
Moving On,"I just found it this year, is there any other shows you’d recommend?"
Moving On,"I can't get over that the show's premise hinges on the fact that essentially a woman committed suicide in order to have a baby so the love of her life could be a single father, rather than just not doing that so they could live together as a couple. 

Like... does it make more sense in the show?"
Moving On,"I'm not sure about ""developed feelings for her"" is right. Because one of the problems of the show is that Pearl was specifically designed to obey her superior. In this case, Pearl was always supposed to be kinda obssesed with RQ/PD. By default, she was always gonna be by Rose's side no matter what. I think this is why some fans were upset by the big reveal."
Moving On,"So she’s Snape 2.0?

I feel like I’m right but Steven Universe Stan’s can’t take the comparison, oh noooo it wasn’t a totally original idea"
Moving On,Oh shit I had it right. That is a pretty complicated character for 2010 cartoon.
Moving On,Snape vibes.
Moving On,"I think the ending was fitting, but the way it was done in the ""shippuden"" was not great, also the villain of the movie was kinda reviving a plot that was already finished, which seemed like a ""do it for money"" type of movie."
Moving On,"I'm not sure if there would've been that episode or not, but I did notice the reason Steven and so many fans who eat up anything vilifying Rose is because her story was told backwards. But Greg nailed it when he said at some point, I forget when exactly in the story, that who she was then doesn't matter, it's who she was when they met that counted. I feel like more characters, including Steven and including Sapphire when she and Ruby split apart, should've taken that to heart more quickly.

But I'm not judging by the show by what they should've done or perhaps would've done, it's just I hate where they leave us with Rose. Big swatches of the early emotional thrusts in the series mean less when that person is depicted as being as bad as they would later treat her. Your last bit is spot on though, for my gripes and for how imperfect I feel the show is as a whole, it does mean a lot to me."
Moving On,"She-Ra definitely (Reboot), and Infinity Train. :)"
Moving On,"I second Reboot She-Ra.

Also the Owl House and Gravity Falls.  All 3 of these has some similar emotionally heavy themes as Steven Universe,  especially Owl House. These are shoes that both adults and kids love and get different things out of. 

Also another surprisingly emotionally mature cartoon is Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel on YouTube. The are adults only due to themes and language but are surprisingly emotionally mature in ways that adult shows like Family Guy are not."
Moving On,"BoJack Horseman.  Adventure Time. 

And Yes! Love for Infinity Train!!"
Moving On,"It does with...later revelations.

>!Rose Quartz wasn't actually who she said she was. She was actually Pink Diamond and was tasked with colonizing the earth for Gem kind...by wiping out all organic life. She refused and created an alter ego (Rose) to lead a rebellion (the Crystal Gems) against...well, against herself. She was playing both sides. Eventually she faked her death by making it look like Rose killed Pink. She figured the other Diamonds wouldn't care, and she could now live in peace on earth as Rose Quartz!<

>!Bad news. The other Diamonds *did* care. They launched an attack on earth that drove 99% of the Crystal Gems mad, turning them into mindless monsters. Only Rose and a couple others survived. For thousands of years they've been fighting these monsters, their own fallen comrades, to protect earth. And ""Rose"" knows that she's responsible for all of it. Giving up her life to create someone new, someone who can live free on earth as she wanted to, but without the centuries of guilt and trauma, is her way of finally achieving peace!<

Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff for a kids show."
Moving On,"Rose's feelings for Greg are questionable. She doesn't ever really understand human love.  Her love for Greg at least on screen is more of a fascination, like an alien studying what humans are like. She is an alien after all. 

She falls in love with Earth and the human race's ability to grow and change, since gems are born for a single purpose and are not meant to change. A human being growing and changing is the greatest thing she had ever seen, and that's what she wanted to experience and give to Greg and Steven."
Moving On,Yea I mean. I think rose knew that her cause was best represented and achieved by a half human half gem who is raised surrounded by love. She believed he could do what she couldn’t.
Moving On,"Just saying, some women go through delicate pregnancies, so this situation is very real, idk why you would think it's nonsensical."
Moving On,Except Pearl tale care of steven after the death of Rose
Moving On,"She was also created to be a slave and given to Rose (a member of the monarchy) who started encouraging her to have her own thoughts and feelings and talking to her like a friend... but still very much treated Pearl like her sidekick and assumed Pearl would do what she said. Most prominently and horribly when she made Pearl participate in faking Rose's murder, and gave a magically compelling order for it to be kept secret which was still in effect thousands of years later, even after Rose's death - like, we eventually see Pearl trying to break the order and tell Steven what happened, and she's repeatedly forced to shut herself up. It's kind of disturbing.

Pearl's love for Rose was all mixed up with the servant role she was created to play, and as much as she missed and grieved Rose, I also don't think their relationship was healthy and equal, or that she really got to be her own independant person until after Rose died."
Moving On,"Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children, and convincing Steven she hates him."
Moving On,"Damn, that's some real heavy shit right there."
Moving On,Holy fuck that’s indeed a show worthy of the praise it gets then. I always thought it was one of those things the internet gets insanely attached to for no apparent reason but that summary changed my mind.
Moving On,The sucky thing is Steven ended up inheriting all those problems.
Moving On,"I've seen enough anime to know this is not the most traumatic thing shown to kids through animation by a long shot 

But that's an interesting plot"
Moving On,Didn't Snape do the same of Harry after Lily's death?
Moving On,Sweet Jebus.
Moving On,">Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children

Not intentionally, hard to argue her training of Connie didn't at least border on abuse"
Moving On,"""Dang Steven, when did you get so mature?""

""Right around the time I learned my mom was a war criminal."""
Moving On,To be fair its not a perfect show. Pacing is off and too many deux ex machinas. But the plot and world building is fascinating.
Moving On,"The show really throws out conventional storytelling structure for a kids fantasy show (the central mystery of the show revolves around a deceased character who we only ever learn about from the incomplete pov of other characters revealed and foreshadowed across five seasons, and that’s just one story thread) and I think it mostly but not entirely succeeds."
Moving On,One thing I really appreciate is they don't shy away from how awful Rose often was. But it's not like you find out she was secretly a villain or something. She's just a very complex sometimes very selfish person.
Moving On,Generational trauma is a bitch.
Moving On,"Taking care as in building a house,living with and raising Steven."
Moving On,"No, she actually becomes one of his primary caretakers, the episode this song is from is also all about her bonding over shared grief with Greg, Steven's father who rose ""left"" Pearl for"
Moving On,Isn't this literally dialogue from the show?
Moving On,"It definitely isn't a perfect show, but also to be fair CN didn't exactly make it easy for them to manage their pacing"
Moving On,"Rose isn’t awful, she was a messed up child who rebelled and ran away from her family as a teenager and grew up to be a loving but flawed and regretful adult. She just lived in a society with no concept of childhood or growing up. Actually, now that I think about it, Greg had a pretty similar relationship with his parents (overbearing, ran away, estranged), just without the cosmic consequences, but it makes it more obvious why they made sense together."
Moving On,"Yes, hence the quotes."
A Love So Beautiful,I seriously hope this series isn’t cancelled in the future. It has some of the best short movies I have seen.
A Love So Beautiful,This episode reminded me a lot of that “100 artists created an animation from the same template” when she’s dragging the corpse behind her
A Love So Beautiful,it's moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,"The Moebius art style was really well used, too. It looks deceptively simple, but moments like the figure falling into liquid were absolutely spectacular to watch. 

The short story it's based on has none of that Moebius vibe, but they tweaked it just enough to lend it a kind of dreamy existentialism that benefits from it.

This is one of my favorite short form stories in a very long time, I think it's the best thing LDR has done so far, and I hope to hell Netflix gives them another season."
A Love So Beautiful,I had a septoplasty done the day this season dropped. I was on hydromorphone watching this episode. It’s cemented in me now.
A Love So Beautiful,its morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"Good and interesting, yes.  Most beautiful, nah.  It's maybe top ten but my vote goes to Ice from season 2."
A Love So Beautiful,What episode is this?
A Love So Beautiful,"I disagree. I thought it was Night of the mini living dead. And I mean that whole heartedly. The rendering was gorgeous. That is if we are talking season 3 only.

Pop squad has some of the most incredible images in animation I’ve seen."
A Love So Beautiful,Bad Traveling is one of the best things I’ve seen hands down
A Love So Beautiful,This show is fucking epic
A Love So Beautiful,"I heard it was the first episode that made over a hundred moebillion dollars.

Edit: first one to make a morbius pun and it’s gets out-morbed by lazier comments :("
A Love So Beautiful,"I just heard about this series on Corridor Crew’s YouTube channel last night and checked it out…

Utterly PHENOMENAL!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who’s a fan of animation and/or short-form storytelling."
A Love So Beautiful,"I didnt like this 1...why was it so popular?

Edit, the ship 1 with the crab was by far the best this season imo."
A Love So Beautiful,someone say morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,I just saw this episode. It was fantastic.
A Love So Beautiful,Jean Giraud’s inspired illustrations influenced so many artists including me
A Love So Beautiful,Definitely my favorite artsyle in the show
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorite episode, possibly of the whole series, and I love the Moebius influence.

I like that this season has leaned into some comic book style storytelling, with this and the bear episode."
A Love So Beautiful,"thought so , sweet"
A Love So Beautiful,"That was definitely my personal favorite however tied with Jibaro.

I loved the spiritual element of the character coming to terms with the totality of their death that was assuredly coming in the context of the ecosystem around them done in such a fantastical way. 

Also the animation and the warping environment was just jaw droppingly poetic and beautiful."
A Love So Beautiful,"I have the ~~incel~~ Incal out of the library and need to read it. 

Edit: wow that was a weird typo/autocorrect"
A Love So Beautiful,Its morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"Most beautiful? I really can't agree with that, there are a lot of beautiful episodes of this show. I also found this episode to be quite weak, probably bottom 5 of the entire show."
A Love So Beautiful,Definitely Heavy Metal movie influence see the aspect in the art 1980 movie
A Love So Beautiful,"It's crazy how one French man inspired or help visualise so many iconic sci-fi movies.  Blade Runner, Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element, The Abyss."
A Love So Beautiful,"If I’m going to die, might as well do it high … 😎"
A Love So Beautiful,If was eh imo. Cool but nothing crazy
A Love So Beautiful,No it isn’t.
A Love So Beautiful,This was the worst episode of the season imo.
A Love So Beautiful,This one was my favorite as well.
A Love So Beautiful,Love the art
A Love So Beautiful,This entire season had some excellent episodes. The final episode was some of the most gorgeous cinematography I’ve ever scene.
A Love So Beautiful,She has a grief trip while losing her love.  It was well written but like… no.  It’s on par with the others
A Love So Beautiful,"I thoroughly enjoyed this episode, but in now way did I see as deep into it as they are describing"
A Love So Beautiful,[deleted]
A Love So Beautiful,"I got heavy vibes of Andrei Tarkovsky’s ‘Solaris’, anyone else?"
A Love So Beautiful,Jibaro left me feeling uneasy to say the least.
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorites were bad traveling, masons rats, and jibaro."
A Love So Beautiful,"This is series is so under appreciated and i love that people continually keep on ""discovering"" it.   It's sort of a spiritual successor of MTV's Liquid Television, which i loved back in the day."
A Love So Beautiful,This episode is the perfect example of a plot that will do well in a novel but bad in other media.
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't understand why people write articles with titles like these about a show that is so vastly different episode to episode, and which clearly divides people who watch it.

I don't remember all the episodes, but I found that one pretty unremarkable, and definitely not the most beautiful."
A Love So Beautiful,Agreed.
A Love So Beautiful,Nothing beats that first season
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius
A Love So Beautiful,Crazy how Morbius tends to inspire so many people around the world!
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius* haha silly typo in the title
A Love So Beautiful,Yes. I also though it said Morbius. I need to cleanse my brain… with another viewing of the hit masterpiece Morbius.
A Love So Beautiful,Watching this episode and Jibaro when I was high was the weirdest beautiful experience ever and I didn’t even realize what I was watching after a while
A Love So Beautiful,Stand back! Im gonna morb!
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't know, I stand by 'beyond the aquellen rift'. Man, that's a good one."
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't really enjoy this season. too much 'monster and alien' type of episode for me. I prefer when they actually explore scifi concept like Pop squad, Snow in the Desert or when it's just artist having a blast imagine scifi concept like The Witness.

That being said I really like this episode more than I though I would. And the fact that this is the only episode that quenching my thirst for scifi make me enjoy it even more. My favorite of this season easily. (That and David Fincher episode because duh it's David fucking Fincher.)"
A Love So Beautiful,PSA: not everything has to be a “love letter” ffs
A Love So Beautiful,"I watched it this week as my first viewing experience of the show and I was not impressed, to say the least. Very little substance and the awful, pretentious poetry didn't do it any favours.  I picked this episode based on several top 10 episodes rankings where it showed up. If this is the best this show has to offer, I guess it's not for me."
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorite part was when she started dragging the body and said ""It's moebin' time!""."
A Love So Beautiful,"You misspelled Morbius, but ok"
A Love So Beautiful,It’s meobin time
A Love So Beautiful,When Morbina says “i think we should Morb” I lost my mind. Beautiful episode indeed.
A Love So Beautiful,"For a sec I thought It said ""a love letter to Morbius""




.....Worst part is I got super excited..."
A Love So Beautiful,It's Moebin' time.
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin’ time
A Love So Beautiful,"Mobius, Moebius. But we all know the best one is Morbius."
A Love So Beautiful,Moeb sweep
A Love So Beautiful,It’s morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"No, no I don’t think so."
A Love So Beautiful,Don’t tell me how to feel
A Love So Beautiful,"Nah, it was definitely the crab one."
A Love So Beautiful,No it wasn't. It was the deaf knight one.
A Love So Beautiful,I didn't make it past the first few lines of dialogue. Oof.
A Love So Beautiful,It's morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,A love letter to Morbius :)
A Love So Beautiful,It's Morbin' time!
A Love So Beautiful,It’s morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,time to morb 😂
A Love So Beautiful,Why does everyone love Morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,"Yeah, but there were no men in it, so it's the weakest episode of the season.


-Every halfwit on the internet crawling out to review it."
A Love So Beautiful,some apex legends animation
A Love So Beautiful,It’s moebin’ time
A Love So Beautiful,Lucky it wasn’t a love letter to Morbius…
A Love So Beautiful,Its moebing time
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius
A Love So Beautiful,"It’s moebin time

Edit: kill me"
A Love So Beautiful,"Sorry, misread that as “Morbius.”"
A Love So Beautiful,It's Moebin' time
A Love So Beautiful,Love letter to Morbius? Nice
A Love So Beautiful,It's moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin’ Time!
A Love So Beautiful,I thought this said “a love letter to Morbius” and now I am very disappointed.
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,Morbious
A Love So Beautiful,Imagine how great it could have been as a love letter to Morbius…
A Love So Beautiful,Wish it was a love letter to Morbius.
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius? ITS MORBIN TIME!!!!!!
A Love So Beautiful,This show is like a  cyberpunk fantasy for stupid people
A Love So Beautiful,A love letter to morbius
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius🗿
A Love So Beautiful,They spelled morbius wrong
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius*
Devils Line,She also became a serial killer for a while in the early 2000s or so.That was wild.
Devils Line,"My mom was obsessed with this show when I was growing up! She used to say ""if you're quiet and let Mommy watch her shows, you can watch bananas in pajamas."""
Devils Line,"It was fantastic! I was in college during this time in the show and we’d get high and watch it everyday! It was so fucking great. She was a succubus and she would turn into a black panther, not a member of the radical civil rights group, and stalk men. I miss those days."
Devils Line,She was saved during an exorcism performed by Dr Drake Ramoré
Devils Line,"Marlena possessed, the Woman in White, John put on death row by Tony only to survive in the last minute, Kristen, Susan, Penelope, Thomas, and Sister Mary Moira all played by the same actress culminating in the ""Elvis"" themed wedding, Sami lying about being pregnant with Austin's baby to try to break up his relationship with her sister Carrie, Marlena kidnapped by Stefano and held in a giant bird cage in the catacombs under the streets of Paris after surviving the exorcism... I watched the shit out of this show in the 90s. They had some insane storylines, but it was great."
Devils Line,"If you like this check out passions. Someone uploaded full episodes on YouTube and I had forgotten just how wild it was. I watched an episode last night that had the witch, a puppet boy, an angel that shoots bees out her hands, ben the soldier from always sunny and nobody to edit out background noise so you constantly hear their footsteps or their hands running over fabric"
Devils Line,"My mum used to record Days of our Lives and we’d watch it together after school and fast forward through all the other stories to get to Marlena, John, Kristen/et al and Stefano. Pure art 😂"
Devils Line,"I loved this, and watched the whole thing. It was ridiculous as hell (pun intended) It was a good double feature with the soap opera 'Passions' with Juliet Mills. Even more insane for daytime TV."
Devils Line,"Are soap operas still a ""thing"", and if so where can I watch?"
Devils Line,"I remember being around 10 and being so creeped out by Possessed Marlena. 

Does anyone remember a storyline where a woman was buried alive and then somehow kept alive for an extended period of time? She was in a coffin but had costume changes? I think I found that even creepier!"
Devils Line,"This shit terrified me as a child. I would watch soaps with my mom, and I haaaated this."
Devils Line,My sister and I still joke about the Marlena posession arc. We watched the shit out of Days of Our Lives that summer. It truly brought us closer.
Devils Line,"Salem Stalker. Thaao Penghlis(Tony DiMera or Andre, because he was impersonating Tony for decades, because Stefano held them both on an island)) revealed it on his way out. They had to do a lot of back peddling, but then they admitted it."
Devils Line,Carlie in the coffin. Still squicks me out.
Devils Line,Wasn’t this also the same time that Jensen Ackles was playing her son?
Devils Line,"Days of Our Fucking Lives

God where does one even start?  It's too much to comprehend.

Drake Hogestyn's jaw acting maybe?

Stefano Dimera's mysterious pan flute entrances?"
Devils Line,Is that Matt Mercer @[4sec](https://youtu.be/tOhSYgDMLmw?t=4)?
Devils Line,Still remember the sleepless nights coz of this biatch
Devils Line,"School started for me, just when that arc started. We didn't know how to program the VCR, so my mom tried to fill me in with all the details. I was seriously thinking about making a post myself. I didn't know anybody remembered it! Good job, op. 👍🏽🙂"
Devils Line,Yeah well Steve Mcdonald is Emma's secret Father on Coronation Street so take that.
Devils Line,"To be faaiirr, weren't all soaps creepy as hell."
Devils Line,Apparently her son was played by Jensen Ackles who is now Dean Winchester on Supernatural.
Devils Line,Theres a reason all the American Soaps died off.
Devils Line,And she came back from that? No prison time needed?
Devils Line,"My mom watched the show back then and me being a horror fan as a kid, that whole arc had my interest piqued."
Devils Line,Fair trade.
Devils Line,"Holy shit, I was in middle school at the time and was home for two weeks because of strep throat, watching this show every day during this story arc. 

From what I remember of it, Marlena was possessed, Father John had feelings for Marlena, and Stefano was the evil mastermind behind *everything* bad that happened on that show."
Devils Line,"That was my prime time, too! Come back from class and watch the creepy glowing eyes!

What a weird story line."
Devils Line,"And people say that right now is the golden age of television, pshhh."
Devils Line,My mid day high show in college was Las Vegas. Still salty how they just cancelled it on such a cliffhanger.
Devils Line,I was in high school when Marlena was in her prime. And I would have given my soul to have her succubus on me.
Devils Line,How **YOU** doin'?
Devils Line,And Passions had a witch I believe!
Devils Line,"Days of Our Lives, The Bold and the Beautiful, Young and the Restless, and General Hospital are still current and airing weekdays on NBC, CBS and ABC. I think you can probably stream the episodes on those networks respective apps."
Devils Line,Pretty sure many of them are some of the longest running shows on tv
Devils Line,"So I watch General Hospital (one of the 4 left) sometimes when I'm home but this show has gone downhill. It used to be really good though GH was prime in the 90s to early 2000s in the 90s we had unique characters, powerful storylines and family moments."
Devils Line,Vivian was drunk in Chinese herbs and buried Dr. Carly Manning alive.
Devils Line,I think Vivian was buried alive by maybe Stefano?
Devils Line,"Not necessarily creepy, but definitely weird. Iirc, *Passions* had this alien subplot or something back in the late 00’s. Just fucking crazy."
Devils Line,That is correct. Jensen Ackles played Eric Brady back in the day
Devils Line,"I don't think anyone actually died, it turned out they were all actually on an island or something. Then there was some other thing I can't remember like she got amnesia? I stopped watching around then."
Devils Line,"She did go to prison and then died during a prison riot. 

Then she woke up on an island with all of her victims, who were not dead but had in fact had their deaths faked by the same guy who had brainwashed her into thinking she was a serial killer.

The island was called Melaswen, which is New Salem spelled backwards. 

I think this was around the same time Lost started, so when they decided to bring back all the character they'd killed off they decided to do their own version of Lost."
Devils Line,\*piqued
Devils Line,"Hot take:  Stefano DiMera is one of the greatest villains in the history of television.

I used to love watching that dude command the screen."
Devils Line,"Father John was John Black, who for a long time was thought to be Marlena's formerly missing husband Roman Brady.

I watched Days every vacation from middle school through the end of high school. Except when I had something better to do. Which was often."
Devils Line,"And a weird Chucky like doll. (That I think came to life, if I remember)"
Devils Line,"*The Bold and the Beautiful* is finally getting interesting again, too. There was a baby swap storyline that dragged on for too long, but those dominoes are finally falling. (The baby swap setup was great, though - the doctor who swapped the babies was played by Wayne Brady.)

I like *B&B* the best because it's a half hour and has a smaller, more focused cast as a result. So it's not much time out of your day to watch it, and coming in fresh it's easier to learn the characters and their relationships."
Devils Line,Ugh GH used to be so good
Devils Line,How could you talk about soapies and not mention Home & Away or Neighbours?
Devils Line,"Yup, *General Hospital* is going on 56 years now. Even the youngest current network soap, *The Bold and the Beautiful*, is 32 years old."
Devils Line,"The definition of soaps: it's not a marathon, it's a hamster wheel. :)"

When Marlena was transported to the island, screaming and falling through bad green-screen fire, I thought, ""this can't get any cheesier.""

Devils Line,Ah man I used to love B&B. I really got back into it when Oliver and Brooke got together at that masquerade party but haven’t seen it in a couple years. I loved getting back just in time for it during my lunch every day.
Devils Line,I was only referring to American soaps because OP posted an American soap.
Devils Line,"How long ago was that? I don't even know who Oliver is, so it must have been at least a few years ago. The main couple on the show lately is Liam and Hope. Brooke is with Ridge now and they seem to have settled into a fairly stable marriage."
Devils Line,Fun Fact back in the day the BBC had to choose between Neighbours and an American soap they went with the Ozzie soap because it had better production values.
Devils Line,"I want to say sometime around 2010.. gee I had forgotten how much time had passed. Liam, shortly after all this Oliver mess, had just met Hope and discovered his connection to his real father and started on the path to taking over the company. [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mC3LEaqKJHg) is the episode where Brooke and Oliver hookup. Happens near the end of the clip. I guess I should also say, Oliver and hope were dating at the time.."

Devils Line,"This is so depressing. I really liked his personality. Just goes to show that if this is true, predators can be, and often are charismatic and likable. Very frightening."
Devils Line,"As someone who coached in the collegiate and all star cheer industry, I can tell you that stuff like this happens alot. Not just talking underage or same sex but college age males (and males on coaching staffs) are put in a position of power/authority. Young males and females look up to them. Listen to them and respect them. Those same guys are most likely tasked with recruiting for gyms and college teams because coaches are not well compensated (not an excuse just reality) and they take advantage. I've seen 40 something year old guys invite freshman in college to their hotel rooms at competitions at night to talk about getting jobs on staff or judging or to talk about what schools they want to go to etc. Many of them get to travel around doing this at many different gyms/colleges/high schools. Many coaches around my area of influence are nervous about hiring choreographers or outside help as they think more people are going to be outed and don't want their school/gym mixed up in anything
When I was coaching in a cheerleading haven, a competition promoter/choreographer who was probably 50ish told one of my guys on my team he would pay him 1000 extra on top of his normal pay if they could snort coke off each other's dicks. He was 18. He told me about it months later. Never worked with him again. 
I knew alot of people in that documentary. Hearing that about Jerry was no surprise to me. Very sad about this and glad it was exposed."
Devils Line,Fuck he was one of my favourites on that show
Devils Line,no one will miss him 🖤
Devils Line,"I thought Jerry was such a likeable part of the Cheer series, which is child exploitation in its own right--these kids working themselves ragged for *community college cheerleading*, getting constantly injured (many with risk of long-term health issues), frequently lying about being in pain or needing medical attention, and working through it because they ""don't want to let down"" their teammates and coach, who was so razor-focused on winning trophies for her own personal redemption...I was rooting for Jerry to be the real winner of this series after overcoming all of the hardships that he did. My heart goes out to his victims and their families."
Devils Line,I wish he could’ve sought therapy or other psychiatric help before giving in to his urges. Sad to see. :/
Devils Line,"> The complaint alleges that Harris had contacted one of the boys on Instagram in 2018, when he was 19 and the boys were 13 years old. 

Not a simple Romeo/Juliette case... The guy was a 19 year old adult preying on 13 year olds."
Devils Line,He seemed so nice in the documentary. I can’t believe someone like him could do something like this
Devils Line,"They're praying *hard*.    
""Our hearts are shattered into a million pieces,"" the statement read. ""Our children must be protected from abuse & exploitation, & we are praying hard for the victims and everyone affected.""

Netflix said in a statement that it was ""shocked by this news."""
Devils Line,This so depressing...
Devils Line,A 13 year old looks like a baby to me. High schoolers look like kids for the most part. I just don't see how folks can see something sexual in that....but obviously that's why there's laws against it. That should be the ultimate deterrent
Devils Line,"This felt like an extra punch in the gut if you saw the doc because he was widely beloved by many of the fans and everyone on the team. He came across as a very insecure, sweet person. In retrospect, it put a different light on his insecurity and tendency to feel that others deserved a spotlight more than him. He was probably aware of having a deep secret that would repel people if they knew."
Devils Line,Damn he was a gem on the show. That’s fricken terrible
Devils Line,Fucking piece of shit.
Devils Line,I remember when my friend told me he lost his virginity to his friends brother when he was 12. The brother? 18.
Devils Line,"I thought maybe it was like he was 19 and they were 17 kind of deal...but nope - this is pretty bad and sign of a sick mind.  

The good news is that he was caught and can’t harm anyone right now...and can get the help he needs."

Devils Line,"Netflix and pedophiles, name a more iconic duo."

Devils Line,It seems like we see more and more rich people/actors/celebrities get in trouble for this sort of thing now. Has it gotten to a point where we should just automatically assume that these people have something awful to hide like this? I’ve come under the impression that most celebrities and wealthier people are like this guy.
The Minimighty Kids,"Because of a law passed by the US putting [regulations on children's TV shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulations_on_children%27s_television_programming_in_the_United_States) during the 90s.  The real effect of this wasn't quite a thing until the late 90s and got solidified shortly after in the early 2000s as all the broadcasters were on board and business models had changed.

Basically, children's TV was a free for all of all types, local, national, acquired overseas content, lvie action, cartoons, just bonkers and go crazy with it.

This lead to tons of kids programming on broadcast since it did pretty well, especially in certain hours, like before school and saturday morning.  Animation became the go to here, for lots of reasons, but they aren't important.

So while the 80s and 90s were absolutely filled with all types of childrens animated shows, some good, bad, for younger kids, or teens, experimental or classic -- lots of options and the ratings were good so things were good, keep watching! Its doing great, we can take chances, and we can invest in this.

But then in the mid-late 90s a law passed earlier was more cracked down on-- it forces broadcast networks to make a certain amount of 'Educational & Informative' (called E/I) content, airing roughly 1-2 hours per day.

So this content can be anything, but it was mandatory conent, and most cartoons and stuff didn't meet its needs. Instead you'd often just purchase some shit syndicated show (like some guy with animals, or an educational cartoon). And really the only place for this, was the same time as kids TV.

So you basically cut out a big chunk of kids TV every single day.

Lots more happened, but it gets technical and less ELI5... but suffice it to say, a lot of content in kids areas got pushed out or FAR more highly selective for the same time slots, and thus, the boom shifted away from kids animation on broadcast networks more to cable nets that could content with lower ratings and more niche content. Broadcast just didn't need to recompete to regain that audience, it wasn't worth it."
The Minimighty Kids,">What happened to high quality TV-Y7 cartoons that could be watched without cable?

They're still around, they just aren't being marketed to you."
The Minimighty Kids,Changes to laws in the late 90's made kids programming far less profitable.  In addition sports programs turned out to get just a good of ratings and are far cheaper to produce.
The Minimighty Kids,"On Saturday mornings we used to get up and watch the Saturday morning shows that were for kids, some of these shows went on into the afternoon especially in the 80s.

In fact, Saturday Telly was a big event for all in the 90s in the UK. The Saturday cartoon shows with live action studios would have adult themes running through them with 'wink, wink, nod, nod' bit of blue for the dads jokes running through them.

From 2pm onwards, it was likely you'd be outside playing with your mates, then back in to watch Baywatch, You Bet, Gladiators then bed. Dad's would be glued to the telly for the slow motion boobies, and mums didn't seem to mind because they had the Hoff to stare at. 

Now kids get up and it's straight to an online game, content on the internet and everyone in the family is largely doing the same. I'm not critical of this, times change, but that's why you don't have the kids shows of the 90s etc."
The Minimighty Kids,People seem to have missed also saying that channels also began popping up that were literally just cartoons. Most of those quality shows went there.
The Minimighty Kids,YouTube. Kids will still choose to watch shitty minecraft let's plays
The Minimighty Kids,"Simple answer: Kids prefer YouTube, Netflix, etc and nearly everyone has high-speed internet now. Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney, PBS, etc are all available on one streaming service or another and those are getting new shows all the time, but maybe not as often.

It's not as financially viable to air a show on TV these days, not like it used to be. The commercials that keep these shows on air are not getting the viewership they would if they just advertised online."
The Minimighty Kids,"There has never been more variety in children’s programming across streaming and cable and without the advertising inherent with broadcasting.

Broadcast were fighting a losing battle."
The Minimighty Kids,[deleted]
The Minimighty Kids,"You download Gargoyles, Swat Kats, and 2 Stupid Dogs. What more do you need?"
The Minimighty Kids,"There are other real reasons for this happening people laid out, but part of it is that...the prevalence of ""kids"" media in whatever forms are available is a generational trend that ebbs and flows. Not to say there wouldn't always be something kid-friendly, just how bigger picture trends shake out. 

90s parents were bigger on ""subversive"" entertainment where the appeal was pushing boundaries they'd realistically not want kids in on. But my parents would scoff at a fellow adult watching Pokemon with their kids. This era's been more about legit ""fun for the whole family"" content like Marvel, etc."
The Minimighty Kids,"In addition to the legal changes, it was a cost savings measure. Animated shows are expensive, live action educational shows like ""Jack Hanah"" and similar ""critter"" based shows were much cheaper to produce. There has also been a shift in entertainment consumption since the 90s. Young males, the target audience for many of these shows, are much more likely to be playing video games on a Saturday morning than watching TV or streaming."
The Minimighty Kids,Adult centered commercials paid more moneh
The Minimighty Kids,I've really only noticed educational cartoons for children that are younger than six or seven years old. Am I just missing the ones for older kids?
The Minimighty Kids,"It was also the end of the era in which most children watched their cartoons in Saturday morning, because broadcast television was becoming less of a big deal and there was always cartoons on one of the cable channels."
The Minimighty Kids,"One interesting thing is that Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego was part of the 90's push for educational content, but unfortunately it disappeared because the information given by the show would quickly get outdated. There are some episodes where they actually had to put up a disclaimer,"
The Minimighty Kids,So did a show like Hysteria fall under the E/I category since it was educational ?
The Minimighty Kids,"I'm pretty sure PBS Kids (not a cable channel) still produces new shows to this day, so yeah they're still around. We just don't know as we're adults and don't pay attention. Whether or not they're high quality, I wouldn't know since I don't watch them anymore."
The Minimighty Kids,"I did some checking, they do but no Y7 shows just TV-Y shows, in the 90’s you could watch stuff like Batman Beyond without Cable"
The Minimighty Kids,">They're still around

Maybe on some obscure channel like 62.8, but I think OP's question was more of why all of these blocks got canceled:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids%27_WB

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Kids

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Kids_(TV_programming_block)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubo

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_on_CBS"
The Minimighty Kids,"Oh the end of Saturday morning TV hit me hard even as an adult. Born in 78 with older siblings, Saturday morning TV (in the UK) was a staple TV viewing before I could understand what it was. And as I grew older, I was their prime target audience as an 80s kid.

Then into the 90s it was just what we did. Even later, waking up still hung over from the night before it became something to sober up to. Come in to my 30s, it was background TV as we did the chores. 

Then one day it was all gone, replaced with some shitty cooking magazine shows. For years after, I would still find myself waking up, head still clouded with sleep and putting on the TV out of pure muscle memory and being disappointed that the piece of my childhood was gone."
The Minimighty Kids,"Streaming and youtube weren't a thing until after saturday morning cartoons died. What killed saturday morning cartoons was cable channels that catered specifically for kids like Nick, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel."
The Minimighty Kids,"This is the answer. It's not like there's some conspiracy to stop production on kids show, it's just that they weren't a viable option. 

As a kid in the 90s, there used to be tons of programing blocks for kids on every channel but over time, people just stopped watching. CBS kids used to have some classics but then Fox News, Kids WB, and ABC's One Sautrday Morning got all the quality shows and no one cared about Muppet Babies. Same thing with after school blocks; Disney Afternoon was huge but then Kids WB and Fox Kids got Animanics, Batman, X-Men and whatnots and no one cared about Bonkers or Snoochums and Meat. 

My niece is 14 so I've gotten to see the current generation's connection with cartoons and they don't need a 6:30am airing of Beast Wars or a 4pm airing of Mucha Lucha when they watch something on Netflix, YouTube, or OnDemand. They don't need saturday morning blocks because they have their favorite episodes of the Loud House or Steven Universe available instantly. 

Let's be real, if we had HBO Max with every episode of Adventure Time, we wouldn't still choose to watch it on broadcast tv and sit through commercials. Cartoon Network and other kid-focused channels are struggling because kids just aren't watching broadcast tv so if they aren't watching, why would other channels like ABC, Fox, etc continue to waste money?"
The Minimighty Kids,"Maybe my kids are the anomaly, but they will watch the same series over and over again (usually rotating between 2-3 different shows)."
The Minimighty Kids,What legal changes?
The Minimighty Kids,"Carmen Sandiego, and like op mentioned, there were a ton of animal shows.  I didn't watch them regularly, as I was basically in middle/high school when the shift really happened, but I remember them being on for the first hour or two before cartoons started."
The Minimighty Kids,"Well, at least for PBS, some of their shows leaned a bit older than six or seven. 

As far as PBS is concerned, *Arthur* and *Cyberchase* were perfectly fine for six year olds to watch, but their more complex story-telling made them more popular with older children. For a while, they were even part of the ""PBS Kids Go!"" block, which was specifically marketed to older elementary schoolers."
The Minimighty Kids,"A lot of the ones on broadcast claimed to be educational because of the morals taught. If you ever watched Disney's One Saturday Morning, that's what the light bulb coming in at the end of the theme song and the announcer saying ""in illuminating television"" was about."
The Minimighty Kids,"I’m pretty sure Hysteria was created as a direct response to the new E/I regulations, same with shows like Science Court"
The Minimighty Kids,"I'm not familiar with that show.  If you want references, today they must be labeled E/I, so you can look at tv guide and see what types of shows count"
The Minimighty Kids,">some obscure channel

Random wikipedia links aside, television networks still produce children's programming."
The Minimighty Kids,Why did networks stop airing children's programming from 3-5 everyday is the question and you got links.
The Minimighty Kids,"That’s what hits the hardest, not being able to relive childhood experiences as an adult / parent because they’re just not there any more. We’re not the first generation it’s happened to and it’s a part of growing up, but damn it stings. 

Of course if you told 9 year old me who’s just missed that weeks only airing of Batman TAS that in the future every episode of every show will be available on demand I’d think you’d be living in a utopia. The reality is that convenience erodes the charm and it all blurs together. But I don’t know where I’d be if I couldn’t bring up the specific episode of Bluey that my girls want to watch."
The Minimighty Kids,"I assure you, 80s and 90s kids content boom was long dead before youtube, netflix, streaming, or any of this other stuff came about, instead those were the beneficiaries of their demise on broadcast as they could pickup shows cheap and many networks would offer kids content streaming free on their websites, as their value was basically zero on the network"
The Minimighty Kids,"Other Redditors commented on it. Basically, there was a change in regulations with regard to children's programming that lead to more live-action, education-oriented shows."
The Minimighty Kids,"Heck, Jack Hanna's old show is still in syndication in my area."
The Minimighty Kids,"Not random links, if you read the post they’re the cartoon blocks OP was referring to and they’re all listed as discontinued"
The Minimighty Kids,">Of course if you told 9 year old me who’s just missed that weeks only airing of Batman TAS that in the future every episode of every show will be available on demand I’d think you’d be living in a utopia

The Minimighty Kids,Johnny Bravo was pretty wild.
The Minimighty Kids,"*Animaniacs* felt like wall-to-wall grown-up jokes at times - not just dirty jokes (like the infamous >!“finger Prince”!< gag), but also lots of references to media and celebrities that adults would probably be most familiar with. One episode had a Martin Scorsese reference inside of a *West Side Story* reference inside of a *Goodfellas* reference, for example."
The Minimighty Kids,IIRC Rugrats hinted at the Grandpa being eager to get the kids to bed so he could watch porn.
The Minimighty Kids,"Arthur had a Deep Throat (Watergate, not the porno) joke that twenty years later I still think about. 

Who was that joke for? How many people under 40, let alone children, would have caught it when it first aired? It wasn't dirty but it was definitely a joke for the parents watching.

Edit: Arthur also did a Howard Dean yell at a pep rally. It turned people against him."

DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"It is peculiar that they still fly, with traffic cams and such. And not a traffic reporter, but a meteorologist?

The one traffic copter here was called a different name by each station that shared it, and eventually, they just started cutting to a guy sitting in it on the ground."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,It strikes me as odd that the meteorologist was on board. I worked at a CBS affiliate in the late 90s and we had a chopper but no reporters were allowed to fly in it for insurance reasons.

DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I remember something similar happening in Denver in the early 90s, helicopters are dangerous."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Nope, no helicopter rides for me thank you.  I prefer vehicles that are inherently stable."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Sounds like a good time to switch to drones
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Just drone it
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Yep, that’s why I’m terrified of helicopters."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Misleading headline: the craft and deceased were from a CBS afilliate, not the network proper"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Cbs somehow : this was elons fault


Very tragic though, thoughts with his family I hope they get big compensation. A family loss from an accident no less is a very heavy one"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Weather Report: It’s Raining Men!

(I’m going straight to hell)"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Never ever ride in a helicopter folks. Not worth it
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Rip Kobe
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,[deleted]
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,This wasn’t a CBS News chopper; it was a CBS local affiliate’s helicopter.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,I thought this said North Korea... I'm an idiot
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Now he’s a meteorite-ologist.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,What's a drone?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Misleading headline - the helicopter did not belong to CBS News, it belonged to a CBS-affiliated station."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Did someone click on it with the SimCity centering tool?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Meteorologist crashes into earth. Poetic.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Fake news bites the dust.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,[removed]
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"This is just terrible, take his pilot license away!"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Wait? It wasn’t the traffic guy?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,CBS is having a bad week.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,How’s the weather?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Helicopters. Not even once.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"It's a shame, the news copters put in a lot more work than they're given credit for typically."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"One helicopter crashes and Reddit wants to replace them with drones? 

What happens when we have the inevitable mid air between a commercial drone and an airplane, or a commercial drone falls on someone’s house killing their dog.

Aviation has risks, those risks are outweighed generally by the benefits. Sad accident is sad - let’s leave it at that."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Yeah. News choppers are slowly being retired or stations are joining forces sharing them due to the costs.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"They don’t do it because it’s necessary, they do it because of marketing. 

They think showing the traffic from a helicopter will bring in more viewers than showing a map Roth traffic data, or showing feeds of the state’s traffic cameras."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Charlotte resident here.  No idea why, but helicopters are surprisingly popular here.  Every news station has one, CMPD had a couple, and it's almost abnormal not to hear at least one in the sky once a day.  Plus medivacs flying over the city taking people to the Atrium trauma center.  You kind of get used to it, but pretty weird.if you've lived in other cities.  Maybe this accident will spur some change, or at least rethink switching to a different helicopter type if they are going to fly so much (apparently this was yet another deadly Robinson R44 crash)."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Couldn't businesses like news stations get some sort of special permit to just be allowed to use drones under certain heights? I mean, it's not like you really *need* to be as high as a helicopter to get a good idea of what traffic is like in the area they're talking about."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Seems like drones would be safer and cheaper
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I find it useful because they can usually find out the cause of the accident and give helpful foreknowledge instead of just saying it's backed up.

Like, ""Blue Pickup in the ditch 5 miles north of exit 56, left lane closed""

Let's me know I probably want to be in the right lane beforehand, and let's me decide if I want to take the side roads off exit 56 or stick it out for 5 miles which is a lot better than 10-15miles that it could be past a stationary traffic cam."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"It's crazy it is used so much in US, in my country TV stations don't have helicopters."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Viewers like to see video from above on news in an area. Drones could do the job but airspace is not easy to launch a drone at a good height anywhere. Why a meteorologist was there is a good question. But traffic reports and covering news from the air is always popular. Look at how many people disgustingly watch car chase stories all recorded from helicopters.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,I don’t know how they all haven’t been phased out for drones at this point.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"No kidding, just drone that shit"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,I'm gonna jump in here but can anyone explain why the best new copter footage always seems to come from LA?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"""We're in the helicopter as most of you can see from the ground it's Grey skies and windy today *beep beep beep* .

*We're going down skies are still Grey, if I survive this just use a weather app next time you asshooollleees*"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,The radio stations near me just stand outside in the wind and yell into a mic since they have access to exactly zero helicopters.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,And fucking drones
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Seriously! Drones can easily replace those dinosaurs.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Charlotte has such a big area to cover the 3 main stations WBTV and WSOC and WCNC all have separate choppers all have hangars at Charlotte international airport and all have different areas of the city they cover. Sometimes there's overlap if something major happens and yes meteorologists and traffic guys fly in them regularly here.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"> The one traffic copter here was called a different name by each station that shared it, and eventually, they just started cutting to a guy sitting in it on the ground.

The funny one to me is cities that don't have traffic copters even share the 'traffic guy' on all the radio stations. Sometimes it's fun to follow him on the dial around the stations, branded as their own traffic guy, as he's cued up at each one right after each other."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Chip was the pilot, super nice and experienced.  Feel so bad for him and his family.  I flew tours with him almost 10 years ago"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"The meteorologist had a wife and four kids too. To lose your father just before thanksgiving is just brutal; that poor family.

A salute to the pilot too, witnesses say it seems like he did his best to guide the chopper away from the highway even as it went down. In his final moments his focus was on ensuring nobody else got hurt."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"On top of losing their dad, the holidays are basically ruined for these kids forever."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Last year my mother in law was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer a week before Thanksgiving.  She died 4 days before Christmas. Additionally her birthday was 6 days after that.

It's def hard.  My SO has been having a hard time with it.  A few days ago he mentioned it was a year from the day he was told the diagnosis.  Visiting family tomorrow that he usually wouldn't since it's the first Thanksgiving without her.  I know he's really gonna feel it on Christmas day and her birthday.  And then I've got my daughter and stepdaughter.  Tried my hardest to keep Christmas normal for them last year while taking the time to remember her too.

It can def leave a cloud hanging over holidays."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Your comment reminded me of an episode of M * A * S * H called ""Death Takes a Holiday."" Basically the main characters are trying to keep a severely wounded soldier alive long enough so that his children doesn't have to remember Christmas as the day that their dad died. [Here's a link to part of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QQjPum463M)."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I’m sure it’s still under investigation. They’ll issue a report once it’s done, but I don’t think anyone is willing to speculate"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Most of the aircraft with flight recorders and cockpit voice recorders are going to be large commercial aircraft and military aircraft, not a Robinson."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I know nothing about planes or helicopters but I've heard people call Robinsons ""Doctor killers"" because they're cheap, and not designed well."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Almost universally no.   That's more for airliners.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Why doesnt every thing that flies have a giant fucking parachute is my question.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Probably not here, but they'll do things like look at flight path, impact angle, speed and direction it impacted, measure fuel levels and test it, observe blades to see if they were spinning or stationary at impact, and take the gearboxes apart and inspect them. They're very thorough, but they may not have an official answer to what happened for a year, sometimes more."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Looks like ABC is gaining market share of traffic and weather market.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I drove by the crash site last night. It’s a miracle no one else was hurt, the spot where he put it down is fairly small and the only open area that’s not road about half a mile in either direction."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,More than likely the pilot landed in the grass to try and increase their chances of a softer landing versus landing on pavement.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Is that a HIMYM reference?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Didn’t his pilot ignore conditions that most other pilots said was too dangerous?
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"The day Kobe died was extremely bad for visibility. I live in SoCal, and I couldn't believe anyone would try flying a helicopter that day. Completely foolish."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,As a pilot I can tell you celebrities don’t tend to pay for the “best pilots” they also don’t pay for a copilot. They are more risky than typical airlines. Less qualified pilots. Not the best.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,">Kobe had one of the best pilots money could buy

He definitely did not. That crash was 100% human error."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"the pilot and Kobe knew each other well and were friendly because of how often he’d flown Kobe. i don’t think this was a good idea because the pilot likely felt extra pressure to please Kobe because he didn’t want to lose the opportunity to keep flying this big star around. he made some reckless decisions in flying that day with the visibility. i think a pilot who didn’t know Kobe and his family so personally would have felt more comfortable telling them no that morning.

the air disasters episode on it is done really well."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Good pilots are the ones that say ""no"" when it's too dangerous to fly."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"He flew that day, so he definitely wasn't one of the best pilots."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"> Kobe had one of the best pilots

He in fact, did not."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I paid for a Grand Canyon helicopter ride. Didn’t really think that much about it until I was strapped in. Then I wanted to quit, but didn’t.  You just have to convince yourself *I’m going to die, but it’s fine.* Then you can relax and enjoy it."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Never going in a helicopter. I know a family that died in one, Kobe, and now this. There can’t be that many helicopters out there that won’t eventually kill me"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,Kobe had a dumbass pilot and that dumbass pilot got Kobe killed. I don't know how you have so many upvotes for this comment.
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,">Kobe had one of the best pilots money could buy

Huh? Where are you getting this? The guy didn't even have an instrument rating."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Kobe hired a helicopter to beat traffic, and killed his daughter."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"Self-admitted rapist Kobe should not have been flying that day due to poor visibillity. It was, by all accounts from other pilots, absolutely unsafe to fly. I'm not sure if self-admitted rapist Kobe pressured the pilot into it or not, but regardless, he (and his child) died from someone's stupidity."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"lol, helicopters are death machines?"
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"""death machine"" is pretty disingenuous when travel by helicopter is still statistically much safer than car."
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone and Masotan,"I was in one to be flown to a hospital once.  I was there with a degloving injury and a chunk of my arm gone cracking jokes about how it was the only time I'd ever be in a helicopter and I couldn't sit up to look out the windows.

Cuz, yeah, no.  I'm grateful for the one that got me Medicare asap but have no desire to ride in one if not necessary, lol"
Troy,"Larry gets something stuck in his ear which impedes his hearing. On the way to his doctor's appointment to have it removed, he notices he can no longer hear Susie screaming, car horns honking, panhandlers asking for change, and decides maybe he'll keep it in. He says Deaf people can get through life without hearing so why does he have to hear. This prompts umbrage from the Deaf community who feel he is coopting and belittling their identity. Larry is confronted by an an angry Kotsur at the golf club, who strikes Larry with a five iron, knocking the blockage loose from his ear."
Troy,"Larry hits the ball and Kotsur will get hit with the ball because he couldn't hear Larry yelling ""FORE"".  Of course everyone will blame Larry even though the guy is deaf and can't hear.  But at the end of the episode when no one else is around Larry will say something behind the guy's back, and he will turn and wink.  Cue music."
Troy,"Larry dates a hearing impaired woman, way out of his league. Larry tells her he understands sign language even though he doesn’t. Larry asks Troy to translate her sign language to him via an earpiece. Larry gets caught and she dumps him."
Troy,>Kotsur will appear as himself in one episode as a member of Larry David’s golf club.
Troy,There better be multiple references to Larry's crypto commercial this season.
Troy,"CODA was a nice movie with a couple of fascinating scenes, and the one where he's with his daughter trying to understand 'singing' was one of them."
Troy,"Troy is playing himself. Larry is at a dinner party where Troy Kotsur is also a guest. (Susie's house). Larry doesn't recognize Troy (And isn't introduced to him at first) and Troy is silent for the dinner until Larry's soapbox: Discussion comes up about Best Picture Winners.  Larry goes off about how Best Picture Winners these days aren't absolutely amazing films worthy of winning Best Picture, and uses CODA as the prime example.  He goes off about how it's just a schmaltzy tearjerker, but in no way near worthy of ""Best Picture."" (and MAYBE Larry notes that Troy shouldn't be nominated for an Oscar because he's just signing ASL, which he does in his normal life, and, thus, isn't an oscar-worthy acting performance)

Then Susie points out that this here IS Troy Kotsur, then Troy starts going off on Larry, and Susie piles on.

NOTE: I'm not saying I agree with all of this. Certainly not anything re: bashing Troy Kotsur, I think he's great. But I think the stuff about CODA not being Best Picture worthy is something that many people believe (including myself, I think it's good, but in no way worthy of Best Picture), and it would be classic Larry to make that argument at a dinner party where unbeknownst to him, a main actor from that film is there."
Troy,"Oh, god. I can’t look."
Troy,"The real question we all want the answer to, is when does season 12 debut?  Is there a date yet?"
Troy,"God I hope this season turns out better than 11. Never thought the day would come that I’d refer to a season of curb as “bad” but there it is, season 11. Garbagio. 

Especially coming after the absolute perfection that was season 10 Latte Larry"
Troy,"Oh wow, completely out of left field"
Troy,Prediction: Larry interprets some of his ASL as obscene gestures or insults.
Troy,"Gotta also have the lack of hearing backfire on him once or twice. He insults someone important by letting them think he is ignoring them, when he has no idea they are trying to talk to him. After he gets his hearing back, he could try to defend himself by claiming to have been deaf, but it would sound like a lame excuse.

After he regains his hearing, he could miss it so much that he decides to not tell anyone he can hear again. At some point he'd be caught pretending to be deaf."
Troy,🤣
Troy,Prettaaaay good
Troy,This is very plausible! very good!
Troy,Decent chance it’s accurate lol
Troy,"Have to have a scene where Larry tests him and everyone is appalled and Larry pulls back ""okay...okay...okay"" while suspicious looking Kotsur over."
Troy,Didn't this kind of happen in Seinfeld? The mother from CODA (Marlee Matlin) was coincidentally the deaf girlfriend from Seinfeld.
Troy,I could watch 50 seasons of this show.
Troy,"As someone with a mostly-deaf parent, the medical appointment translation part had me rolling.  It was so spot on."
Troy,Even when Larry was putting bad miles on his Johnson?
Troy,"It was mostly just Maria Sophia that made season 11 so bad, and her plot didn't really make sense. Why would the brother of someone who died in the pool blackmail Larry? The police were already there and saw what and that he didn't have a fence.



Season 10 isn't perfect either, the assistant that Larry hires is someone who he would never have agreed to hire in the first place."
Troy,Cream shaming episode was good though
Troy,"I hate being mean, but I really do not want to see Maria Sofia pop up again. Something about that actress. Might work for some people, not for me"
Troy,Unfortunately this is too similar to an episode from last season. He goes to a concert for a band with one of the Young Larry actors and doesn't like the music so he sticks tissue paper in his ears. He does it again at the dentist's office because he doesn't like the music he plays and misses several conversations that were pertinent to other plot lines from the episode.
Troy,This was a Cleveland Show episode. The last paragraph is exactly the second half of the episode.
Troy,"In that episode I think they got her to read lips for them, right? I don't remember the relationship being in focus very much. The main scenes with her are when they are trying to hide their lips form her to discuss their plan at the table, and at the end when her lip-reading goes wrong, and George is told ""sleep with"" instead of ""sweep with"".

The story Owasso suggested is more of a Cyrano type plot."
Troy," I only remember them using her to reas lips at a party, not Jerry claiming to know sign.  Maybe Kramer did as a one-off joke at one point though?

(Also, Marlee Matlin is an Oscar Winner and was/is pretty much THE definitive  Deaf actress for decades, especially in the 90s; not terribly surprising she was in both Seinfeld and CODA.)"
Troy,"It's hard to pull off the ""funny character that's bad/annoying"" without the actual character being annoying, e.g. Janice from Friends."
Troy,What was she in 5 episodes and took up 20 minutes total time. Get over it.
Troy,There was also a past episode where Larry loses hearing because of a too loud toilet flush
Troy,"Ahh, I have not seen any of the recent seasons yet. Yeah, that's very similar to what I was suggesting."

Troy,"I'm expecting a grim atmosphere, zombies and violence.

So I guess it's going to be a lighthearted sitcom."
Troy,"I guess literally no one in these comments actually watched and listened to what he said. ""It introduces you to the world if you have no idea what it is. It takes all your expectations and just gets rid of them."" Clearly he is saying this for people who have never played the games and that the story will blow away your expectations, not that they're just somehow abandoning the source material of the game.

Edit: and if you want to actually watch it here is the [time stamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8C_eRUxtE0&t=3577s)"
Troy,"Just so you know, the last 10 minutes or so is where they talk about the show. The main things Troy said are as follows:

He might prefer it to the game & he's thankful that the game is good enough that it can be interpreted and still stand on its own legs as a show 

He's watched up to episode 5. First 2 focus on world building then episode 3 is when shit goes down

He was inspired by Pedro's performance & wishes he did certain bits differently for the game

Bella Ramsey is terrifying"
Troy,We’ll see. It can’t be worse than the Halo show.
Troy,This is one of those times when I hope the show isn’t a blow by blow of the game. If they want to take some “creative liberties “ with it I’m not opposed to it. As long as the spirit of the game is there.
Troy,"The last time something got rid of all my expectations, it somehow managed to make me hate *Star Wars*, so this is not as ringing an endorsement as you might think."
Troy,I remember this being the tagline for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation...
Troy,Historically this has always worked out well!
Troy,"I don’t even really care about The Last of Us but that headline makes me angry in relation to all the screwed up game adaptations recently. 

“Here’s the base story, the game did a lot of the set up work for you.”

“Nah bro, we’re doing our own thing.”"
Troy,"I'm fine with them changing up the story as long as it's told well.  
Although it's nice to see a moment come to real life, a drawback from watching adaptations is that you already know what's going to happen.  
I think some fans hoping for an exact carbon copy just want to be able to tell newcomers *""see see did you see that wasn't that crazy! I knew about that years ago already""*."
Troy,Sigh
Troy,"Oh my God, just adapt the story. I swear to God there's gonna be a Batman movie made in the next 20 years that ""subverts all expectations"" because Batman dies in the 1st half hour and surprise it's a story about Barbara Gordon. Fuck you."
Troy,"IT SUBVERTED EXPECTATIONS!!!

remember what happens every time that phrase is used."
Troy,I am so sick to death of things “subverting our expectations” can we just for once have something be what the fans expect? It’s so tired at this point
Troy,imagine if people don't like the show. that would be wild.
Troy,"The typical problem with Hollywood and their shit writers!  They have great source material, and a huge dedicated fan base drooling to see it, and they go:  “Nah!!! You know what? I can tell a way better story!""... No!!! No you can't!!! There's a reason everyone likes it, and it's because it's not written by you, or has whatever stupid take on the character you want.  Just tell the fukn story, and don't make it about you or reimagine it.  You want to reimagine it? Great!  Make up your own story and your own characters, and go to town!  But leave our characters and story as is!  There's a reason we like it, and NO, you cannot do better! Ffs!  F u Hollywood!"
Troy,"That’s not exactly a good thing. I know the source material, I don’t want a reinvention of the wheel nor do I want my expectations subverted. This doesn’t fill me with confidence."
Troy,What does that even mean?  I expect a lot of great stuff from this show.
Troy,It means it's going to be like that Resident Evil Netflix series.
Troy,"Joel doesn’t save the kid in this one, by episode 3 he’s dissecting Elly himself for the plant aliens who he is now allied with who originally spread the virus to save the planet from the greedy humans who were set to destroy it. After dissecting her and giving her organs to the aliens Joel continues on his journey with a weight now lifted from his shoulders and joins a merry traveling troupe spreading news of the alien saviors across the North American continent.

Honestly my expectations haven’t been so subverted since tlou2"
Troy,[deleted]
Troy,"Oh yay, subversion of expectations. That never goes wrong."
Troy,expectations subverted? well this is going to go well...
Troy,I'm just returning from the Festering Cove right now
Troy,"Somebody tell these people *this isn't the selling point you think it . We already knower it's an adaptation, and we're tired of other shows fucking up their source material. For once, just take what is already a great story and do it verbatim. There are hundreds of millions for whom it'll be brand new."
Troy,It always works well when Hollywood takes a beloved property and subverts our expectations...
Troy,"Modern writers: We subverted your expectations therefore we are smart.   


Their audience:  Actually... By constantly subverting expectations I have caught onto your bullshit and am not at all surprised anymore. Get new tricks."
Troy,So it’s more like Wheel of Time or Rings of Power? Gotcha.
Troy,Goddamn redditors are so bitter lol
Troy,"I’m ok with this.

There are YouTube videos for watching video game playthroughs."
Troy,"Ooomfph, poor choice of words.  It’d be funny if this sucked"
Troy,Oh dear. That's never a good sign
Troy,"The daughter isn't going to die, will turn up angry that she was abandoned, die by the end of the season trying to kill Ellie."
Troy,yeah... that worked so well for p2 lmfao.
Troy,This is gonna be so mid.
Troy,[deleted]
Troy,"Ah, so it pulls a ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" or ""Final Fantasy 7 Remake"" where it pretends to be an exact remake of the original thing, but actually deviates from it at one point

Kinda wished Troy didn't spoil that though, wouldn've been a pleasant surprise"
Troy,Have they mentioned if they’re adapting the second game? Is this just a miniseries like Chernobyl was?
Troy,Do we know how much this first season is going to cover in terms of story?
Troy,"honestly surprised how anyone thought that was a great way to promote the show, lol"
Troy,"I feel like half of the comments here didn’t watch what he actually said and just go with op’s quote. 

What he meant was that the show is amazing and unsuspecting even for fans of the game, btw"
Troy,"So what I’m guessing is they’re just borrowing character names, origin of how they meet, world, & no other plot line will be followed."
Troy,Sounds like it’s gonna suck like every other video game adaptation
Troy,"It'll never be ""the best video game adaption"" like Druckmann stated here, with the Ellie actress they've chosen:
[This article.](https://www.eurogamer.net/druckmann-says-the-last-of-us-tv-show-will-be-the-best-most-authentic-game-adaptation)"
Troy,"Ok, I'll watch until 3rd episode, so far not impressed. A bit above average show, Pedro is great as always...but there's a bunch of shows to choose from now."
Troy,Ellie's joke book will be a main character.
Troy,To be fair that describes the show iZombie pretty well. Lol
Troy,"Kinda annoys me OP got that far in the podcast, heard all the info Troy dropped about the show & just went for the buzzword"
Troy,Click baits at their worst
Troy,"Hey, fuck you for trying to bring context into a situation where I only want to be outraged."
Troy,Tbf I actually wanted to hear his whole statement about the show here but there's no timestamp and I'm not gonna watch the whole hour-long video to find it
Troy,Thank you. I just read the title and didn’t know how to feel about it. I’ve been raving about this game for years to anybody who will listen and the show will be a lot of my friends and families first exposure to it so I REALLY hope it lives up to the games standards
Troy,"i was kinda hoping they did change the story for the tv show so we could see something different. i feel like their story has been told perfectly already in the games.

of course this show is mostly for people that didn't play the games, so i guess it's good they will keep the original story."
Troy,"This is on HBO and not Paramount+, so at least there’s that"
Troy,"If Chernobyl is any indication, Mazin is a bonafide storyteller. I know he only really has  one prestige show on his resume, but I’m optimistic. I’m excited to see what changes they make."
Troy,We actually find out in episode three that this is the sequel season to the halo show
Troy,thought it was fine
Troy,People defend that crap…all i can think is “these people get to vote”.
Troy,"> We’ll see. It can’t be worse than the Halo show.

Hand to god I'd somehow suppressed the memory that they made a Halo show not too long ago. Tbf that came and went in the conversation real quick didn't it?"
Troy,Halo show was pretty good
Troy,Was the Halo show better or worse than the Resident Evil show on Netflix?
Troy,Learning about Ish would be a great episode.
Troy,"I do want to see some of the major tent pole moments from the game (Sarah’s death, Sam/Henry, Bill, etc), but a lot of the stuff in between? I’m okay with changing that up. The game is a balancing act of focusing on the relationship between Joel/Ellie and showing the brutality of humanity, so as long as they can nail both of those then I’ll be happy"
Troy,Why shouldn’t it be? Isn’t the story the main reason this game is remembered so well? It’s not like people are asking for a cinematic translation of crafting.
Troy,Nah I want to watch Pedro push pallets around water for 15 minutes at a time. I want to watch them backtrack and root around for collectibles. They should die six times in that tunnel until the zombies magically get a fifth as aggressive.
Troy,I just hope we get the same ending.
Fastest Car,"Netflix suggested it because I watched all of Hyperdrive.  But after watching all that drifting, leveling craziness, ""go in this direction and whoever travels an arbitrary distance first wins"" seems like kind of a downgrade."
Fastest Car,The guys with the super cars are  as you would expect..... . Douch bags.  But non the less it's fun to watch.
Fastest Car,Was really pushing for that Donk guy to slug the douchebag with the lambo
Fastest Car,"It's a shame it's still persisting with the drag concept, but if that's what the sleeper culture is about I guess they have little choice. European supercars aren't at their best on a drag strip."
Fastest Car,Has anyone same as me finished season 2?
Fastest Car,I enjoyed the first season but honestly I could do without the shitty attitudes. I love being competitive and wanting to win but the super car people are always shit bags and just when I start to like the gear heads they say some stupid shit that makes me face palm. Watching the first episode of season 2 so we will see how far I get into it
Fastest Car,"The most anti-climatic end I have seen on Netflix. The winner just got the race because of an accident and another car without gears. I felt it was won by sheer luck instead of skills.

It also feels like a big downgrade from Hyperdrive."
Fastest Car,The guy who drove the Tesla has a racing channel and was surprised when I saw him show up in one episode. His Tesla is nearly unbeatable in the 1/8 mile but the 1/4 mile is a different race altogether when going up against drag cars. Would be fun to see a Tesla Roadster appear on the show. I think overall Lyle probably had the fastest car out of all of them.
Fastest Car,"Presumably being able to spell ""douche"" correctly enabled some of the douches to afford supercars"
Fastest Car,Why was this season so short? I was hoping it would be as long as the first season
Fastest Car,"Thing is with hyper drive you can see the skill as they drift and slide about the place(or use their door) and hit targets, where as with drag racing you don't see the skill much unless you are a drag expert."
Fastest Car,"I didn't really think that Manny Khoshbin was much of a Douch Bag. But the first guy in the Lamborghini definitely was. 

#"
Fastest Car,The Atlanta Wraps guy isn't a douche
Fastest Car,Yeah but the attitude that the rest of the people have towards the super car owners is simply disgusting. Not all but most have this massive chip on their shoulders and I think it stems from pure jealously. It’s just hard to watch.
Fastest Car,"Heh. I think the show tries to humanize them, but the douchey rich vibes still cling."
Fastest Car,Just finished it. And as someone from FL I've seen that Honda do a couple races down here. Pissed that it wasnt able to really compete because I'm sure it could've at least came 2nd.
Fastest Car,Just finished it. I thought the finale was great!
Fastest Car,"Yes, I’m a little annoyed because we all know who the real winner was... that mustang is insane."
Fastest Car,It really gets better and better as the season goes on.  I wonder how many viewers they lost by starting with episode 1's cast instead of 3/4/5/especially 6.
Fastest Car,"Different than Hyper for sure.. I wasn't a fan of the gimmicks in Hyper. But not a fan of the spread out drama in fastest for a 10sec race. Damn shame Lyles car broke loose at that speed. 
Just glad they didn't race on dirt for the finale like last season."
Fastest Car,"Yeah, I felt the same way.  Even the driver that came in second might have done better if she didn't get distracted by a car hurtling at her in the last part of the race.  I wanted a do over.

If they based the titles on the final races, the second season should have been called ""The luckiest driver""  and the first season should have been called ""Traction control for the win."""
Fastest Car,Literally every single episode of the show. I wish they'd do best of 3 or something.
Fastest Car,For sure. Lyle had the race until his crash.
Fastest Car,[deleted]
Fastest Car,"Glad to hear it gets better, at least. Netflix suggested it to me and I started on season 2 (didnt even realize until after the episode) and god did the lambo owner make my blood boil. “Theres no reason to be in the United States and be poor.” Okay asshole lmfao. Also cannot STAND the misogynistic civic driver lmfao."
Fastest Car,"PJ runs one of those stupid, ""let me show you how to get rich, just buy my book, or buy a ticket to attend one of my seminars"".  He is clearly an entitled asshole with his bought instagram followers.  You can tell people like him do not have actual friends.  I can't imagine anyone willingly would want to be friends with this douchebag."
Fastest Car,"I almost didn't go past episode 1 with how shit all the drivers and their personalities were. I'm glad I stuck it out.

Episode 2 was a complete 180 from the first. Everyone (Manny included) in episode 2 was generally enthusiastic and supportive of their competition and their cars. I wish I could have seen all of them go on to the finals."
Fastest Car,"Justin is his name, hes got a youtube channel called WrapLife. He actually brought a more tame car of the ones he owns. He has a 1300hp twin rear mounted turbo c7 vette and I believe a 2200ish hp GT, along with a few more cool cars."
Fastest Car,I enjoyed that guys demeanour.
Fastest Car,"I just watched episode 1 and even though you may be technically right, the supercar owner has a chip about 100x bigger on his shoulder, and for no reason. He was the textbook definition of an asshole, not just his overall personality but he specifically talked shit about the other racers and their vehicles because they were poor. He deserved every bit of negativity from the others, and then some."
Fastest Car,"I mean, if you can afford a super car, in almost certainly going to be shooting at you once the revolution starts, so best not to get too friendly with you."
Fastest Car,"Maybe its just me but it think most of it is fake. I get that ppl can be assholes but unless youd wanna let the entire world know ur an asshole, you wouldnt be one on cam."
Fastest Car,"Agreed. I tend to root for the super car owners because of their attitudes. They place a stereotype on rich people as if they all were just handed money. It may be the truth for some, but not all."
Fastest Car,"Yeah kinda feel he got lucky, it would have been way worse for the driver, the honda lane was right in the middle"
Fastest Car,"Watching it now and came to reddit to see what they thought too.  


It's sad because his mom literally escaped war, and he has the audacity to call people losers and poor. Like you fuckin know what that's like to be poor and be bullied. What a tool."
Fastest Car,Wow he has def pulled a string or two. Why u hurt so much?
Fastest Car,Yeah but those other two cars wouldn't have been supercars. Cool cars though.
Fastest Car,Remember the guy in season 1 who was a rich old dude with the plastic surgeried asian wife? He was arrogant and all but he was cool to all the other competitors and i even remember saying he was going to host a party for everyone after the race
Fastest Car,"Well i think were casting "" a rich douchebag"" type"
Fastest Car,True. He could have clipped or worse t boned him.
Fastest Car,"He's a disgrace for all people that escaped horrible situations and managed to achieve something out of actual hard work and not dumb luck and pure ""luck bias"". And it seems like he was making money by ripping people off by being an ""entrepreneur influencer"". What a pice of human garbage."
Fastest Car,"Weird that 2 of the ""rich douche bag"" types were guys who escaped from Iran"
Fastest Car,"Because I don't like con artists.  He has a shitty attitude with his fake till you make it style.  The house he lives in, doesn't even belong to him, it belongs to his mother.  It's a $1.1 million home in Florida, which truthly, isn't that much considering where it's located, and he supposedly have over $2 million worth of cars.  For someone who talks about safe investments and get rich schemes, having cars worth double your real estate isn't a good investment."
Fastest Car,Why should anyone like douche con artists?
Fastest Car,[deleted]
Fastest Car,"""Just buy my course and be rich like me in 3 years"", that's 100% a lie to catch gullible fools."
Fastest Car,cringy as hell
Fastest Car,Discount Motor Trend's Roadkill/Hot Rod Garage
Fastest Car,"I like it.  I could do without the manufactured drama.  

The Lamborghini driver in episode 4 is hard to listen to."
Fastest Car,Looks like a fun (read: guilty pleasure) show. Thanks for posting this.
Fastest Car,Thanks for sharing this. It looks like it should be fun to watch. 
Fastest Car,Watched the whole season in 20 mins thanks to FF. Douche with rented lambo wins. Save yourself the time.
Fastest Car,"The salamone guy? Yeah I've seen him here and there on different youtube videos. He's really like that, at least on camera he is."
Fastest Car,Ok.  I'm on the McClaren episode....I just can't watch anymore....
Fastest Car,"I watched the first episode and it fits in with shows like Pawn Stars, 60 Days In, Naked and Afraid, etc. "
Fastest Car,Is this a TV sequel to the Tracy Chapman song 'Fast Car'?
Fastest Car,"Those sound fun. I don't know from cars but enjoyed Fastest Car even though [spoiler](#s ""the accident"") broke my heart. I don't need to eat prestige TV every day; potato chips are good too."
Fastest Car,[deleted]
Fastest Car,"No the sequel was the PS1 game “Faster Car”

Edit for [reference](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JsvPUCNTjVc) "
Fastest Car,How so?
Fastest Car,That's exactly what I was referencing!
Fastest Car,this looks like something the History Channel would do
Fastest Car,"Are they just drag racing, or do they actually go on a track?"
Fastest Car,how could you shitpost like this on christmas?
Fastest Car,If The Boys and Witcher came out at the same time which would have more posts?
Fastest Car,"""Mentally ill person destabilising the global economy while working with terrorists who have a transgender leader who believes in the possibility of a multiverse"" is by far the best description of Mr Robot that I've ever seen."
Fastest Car,Joe Pera Talks To You should be the most talked about show on TV
Fastest Car,[deleted]
Fastest Car,"This is a beautiful shitpost. In fact, I am stickying this."
Fastest Car,Because im still not done watching Expanse season 4 100 times
Fastest Car,I already tossed a coin to my Witcher.
Fastest Car,"/r/television isn’t exactly a cross-section of America... Reddit skews male, is overwhelmingly younger, more interested in genre content, more likely to watch streaming series over network or basic cable... not a surprise people here are talking about it!"
Fastest Car,"You mean you're not enthralled by multiple daily posts saying the same thing? Picky.

I appreciate that the mods have been deleting some of the more ""low effort"" threads. And the Mandalorian noise has died down a bit.

But honestly, a sub this large doesn't really lend itself to users finding and commenting on older posts because the discussion has already moved on. Though it would be nice of people would scroll through the last couple of days of content before submitting a new topic ... as it turns out, other people HAVE noticed!"
Fastest Car,You got me in the first half.
Fastest Car,i liked the Witcher a lot but i couldn’t make it past the couple episodes of season 2
Fastest Car,"But did you know Henry Cavill was a gamer? 

Have you heard that song from the Witcher? Omg its so funny and catchy"
Fastest Car,NTA
Fastest Car,"As a die hard Mr. Robot fan, your synopsis of the show is spot on and I hate you for it."
Fastest Car,This post is such a great example of people not reading something before they comment. The amount of attacks and defensive posts are even funnier than OPs shitpost.
Fastest Car,"I feel singled out and insulted by this awful, awful post.

By the way, have you seen Mr. Robot?"
Fastest Car,"It's a contest. I was like ""should I really post another Mr. Robot article?"". Then I saw the 25 TW threads on /r/television and was like ""ah fuck it, I'll post it"""
Fastest Car,"Because we have to let go, so Eliot can go on."
Fastest Car,"Well, appropriate username I guess. I'll be amused to see who comments without reading.

Though all these ""shut up about show X"" threads probably make up a good chunk of why some shows feel like they're talked about so much."
Fastest Car,Thank you for this. This sub has been unbearable for the past two weeks and I’ve been cussed out at least three different times by Witcher fans just for commenting on the amount of Witcher-related posts lately so I left for a while. The Cavill worship is also a bit cringe and everyone is taking this show so seriously. I needed this laugh.
Fastest Car,I rage downvoted before reading the first line. Well done.
Fastest Car,"At least OP has seemingly watched The Witcher and Mr. Robot. Just imagine the sub for someone like me who hasn't watched even one episode of The Witcher, Mr. Robot, The Boys, The Mandalorian and Stranger Things so far and has also only seen season 1 of Game of Thrones."
Fastest Car,"The wire is one of the best shows of all time in most list BUT it's what, 15 years old now? I don't sit around watching back to the future everyday."
Fastest Car,"Mr robot and the Witcher are just a microcosm of the bigger issue on this sub where people here just make self posts about the same shows over and over and over again talking about the same things thinking they are making a novel post. Did the same thing with the leftovers and succession as well. Unless moderators remove them it will happen with some show or shows next year as well

The thing that surprises me is when a self post about one of Reddit’s non-circlejerk shows blows up. Like I made a post about PBS frontline a few years back that hit /r/all"
Fastest Car,"Joe Pera should have the viewership that Witcher does.  For all that reddit loves wholesomeness, Joe Pera should be right up its alley.  It's like if comedy was wholesome ASMR.  This clip, [the perfect Egg Bite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktVIQZ7tiag) is good, but you should really watch Joe Pera Reads the Church Announcements.  [This interview with Colbert is pretty good too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSZTjLYDJ0)"
Fastest Car,"So glad Mr. Robot is finally over. Fuck that show and all the constant posts about it and, most of all, its cringe fanbase."
Fastest Car,There is currently no show more people talk about than The Witcher.
Fastest Car,"It's only a week since its full and only release, you won't be bothered by it for another whole year."
Fastest Car,I hear that Mr Robot series is actually ok. Also did you know that the Witcher was based on a series of books?
Fastest Car,Joe Pera just needs to figure out why jack-o-lanterns scare him so goddamn much.
Fastest Car,I just started watching the Witcher last night. I’m really liking the story. Some parts have shit cgi but some of the bloody battles look really good. I’m starting ep 4 tonight
Fastest Car,"Take an upvote. Between those shows and anything from Disney+, the post and articles with superlatives is almost suffocating."
Fastest Car,"Sir, how dare you! Forged in Fire is awesome lol. But I can tell you this much... The Witcher imo was meh. Acting was decent for the most part, dialogue needs improvement. Practical effects were good when it came to some of the creatures, CGI was facked. Hopefully, it improves in s2, that way more ppl will talk about it."
Fastest Car,"Thank you

I'm So Sick of it"
Fastest Car,One of the best shitposts I've seen in months.  Oh and of course hoes mad.
Fastest Car,"I'm a huge MR fan. I think it's just not for everyone, unfortunately. Although, most people that I got to actually sit down and watched it, loved it.  

I've said this before on the MR sub, I really think the name unfortunately throws people off.  It threw me off for 2 years.  I didn't start watching until season 3, bc people kept telling me about it.  When I finally watched the trailer, I was like holy shit.

The name is something that could be got across in terms of diagloge, if more people were talking about it.  Not sure why it's not, I think I remmeber hearing a lot of people fell off in season 2. I think season 2 was phenomenal, as were they all, but my favs are 3, 4, 1 and 2 in that order. 

I think also, as much as this frustrates me too, bc I feel like it's a show people should watch as it educates on so many issues, and has an amazing way of connecting with so many of us, I also kind of feel like maybe if it was as popular as something like game of thrones, maybe it wouldn't have been the perfect masterpiece it's been.  There would've been a bunch other politics involved, and whatnot.  

I think over time, more people will discover it and it'll be a classic.  It's by far one of my favorite pieces of art of all time.  Truly a masterpiece.

Anyway as Sam says, [most] critics have shitty taste (or rather, Elliot says).

As for people specifically on this sub(which I think is for who this question is intended) I don't frequent here too often, so not sure with the exception of some of my overall pop comments above."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,The looming threat of a WGA strike was also a motivation for getting scripts in early I'll bet.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,If only they had that foresight with the sequel trilogy. Can you imagine writing a script knowing that it had to relate to other projects? Crazy.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I do not want to watch 4 other trash shows just to understand the one I kind of like
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Question is does it ""fit perfectly"" without watching ahsoka and ""more star wars series""?"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Long time ago in a tiny galaxy far, far away..."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"FFS why. The MCU model is absolutely exhausting, I don't want keeping up with characters and shows I like to be a full time fucking job."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Considering how heavily Favreau relies on improv, and how sparse I found any of the dialogue in Mando season 2 or Book of Boba Fett, I'm gonna take ""already written"" with a grain of salt"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Is anyone pretending it is a particularly elaborate show to write. The show just repeats itself ...
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Please stop Marvel-izing Star Wars.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Meaning it's going to be further bogged down by having to connect to the Skywalker storyline. I'm one of the few who did not enjoy the Luke revelation at the end of S2: Does every single piece of Star Wars have to be bound to the OG Story?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,">  So That Its Story Fits Perfectly With ‘Ahsoka’ and More ‘Star Wars’ Series

BWHAHA and by fits in, they mean works in an add for that other Disney shit thing."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I'm kinda annoyed because I only want to watch Mando. Didn't see Boba and now people say that is important for season 3, now they say I need to watch even mlre shows. Might drop it completely"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I guess that means we won't get back to the simple (in the best of meanings) and fun space western version of ""lone wolf and cub"" that was the first season."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,But will it entertain?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Unless the ""More"" is Andor, I don't care, I'm not watching other lazily produced shows just so I can understand what is going on in another.  I'd rather just read about the plot connections on a wiki or skip it entirely."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I love this sub because of all the miserable people who watch these things and then claim to hate it or call it pedantic but then they keep watching it.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Aha yes more product placement written into the show instead of you know telling a fucking story.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,The whole universe is an inconsistent mess at this point. Making this little piece fit makes little difference.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,So Ashoka will be another Book of Boba Fett and become Mandalorian season 4.5?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Instead of 1 great show,they'll milk this into 5 ok shows."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,imagine caring about this baby shit after Andor
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Just stop.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Oh great more shows that connect together for no reason just because they're in the same franchise
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Star Warzzzzzzzzzz…
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"""Stop! Stop! He's already dead!"""
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Please just no more putting other shows randomly within others like they did with BoBF
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Already stopped watching Mandalorian when the Bobba Fett filler shit started. Why does everything need to be connected. its a story about a GALAXY far far away. give me more of the galaxy and less of the same ol shit
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Am I the only one who is not a fan of having to watch other series so that the series that I am watching makes sense?

My wife and I used to watch The Flash and every season they'd do a crossover episode with the various other shows on that network. It was awful to have to watch those other shows to know what was up so we just started skipping the crossovers altogether. 

I like the Mandalorian but not interested in the other shows so I hope that while it will fit with other shows, I won't have to watch those others just to have an episode make sense."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,How about writing it so it fits with original series episodes 4-6?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,But Andor is still the only one worth watching…
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"No more Ahsoka, please..."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Fuck the haters, I’m excited. Mando is going to mandalore. There’s going to be a big conflict around the mandalore title since Bo wants it too. Ahsoka is going with Sabine to find Ezra and Thrawn. Thrawn is likely going to be the big villain, which should be awesome. Or will Ezra have turned him? Or will he have turned Ezra? Will the next mandalore reunite the Mando clans against Thrawn? Will Bo become mandalore and fail again, this time siding with Thrawn? Who knows, but I want to find out."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This is such a miserable sub.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This sucks
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,So will we have to watch Ahsoka to understand season 4?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I have no hopes for Ahsoka. Dangling Thrawn in front of the old fans is not enough, and Ahsoka as a person is the most boring, straight-lacedm personality-free White-Hat Cowboy heroine in all of Star Wars. No sense of humor, no undercurrents. Leia had oceans more personality because she actually gets angry and is a good strategist."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"That sounds like a lot of fucking Star Wars, maybe too much"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,They’re setting up Ezra to take over Grogus Jedi training.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Too much stars wars content.  Burned me out
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I don’t know why they’re doing this. I liked the mandalorian but I’m never gonna watch season 3 because I can’t finish the Boba Fett show. Would likely be the same with Ashoka tbh.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Weird, it’s not like SW fans are anal about lore or anything…"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I feel like I’m the only person happy with everything so far, BOBF was the worst show, but I still enjoyed it, and I love how the shows come together. I also completely don’t understand how people think there are too many shows"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,The hype is utterly dead for this and anything else Star Wars related
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Why can’t Disney ever just a Star Wars series be it’s own separate thing. They always have to ruin it by mixing it with others or by bringing back the sky walkers. Really annoying tbh.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I thought they were supposed to just make that shit up as they go along. Somehow Grogu returned….
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I don't want to watch anymore Starwars or Marvel and its sad as they used to be some of my fav universes.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Too bad none of them even come close to being as good as Andor
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This should definitely be the way.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Let's a go!
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Quality over quantity people Liam Neeson was right about the franchise being watered down
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Only a Sith Deals in Absolutes
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"It would be nice to see on the news

“The Mandalorian Season 5 is already written so that it’s story fits perfectly with the season Premier of ‘Luke Skywalker’ series” !"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Ugh
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Kind of wish they did a trilogy of movies or hell, even a single movie. Star Wars has always thrived with the spectacle of a theater experience. Avatar and others have seemed to fill in that gap in the theater and now Star Wars shows are designated to a Disney+ MCU knock off without the character development that you'd think a long form format would contain. Mandalorian is alright, but all the others have been subpar at best."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Here is hoping for time travel / dimensional shenanigans to reset the world ..lol.

Yes i know it wont happen they are going to another galaxy to build a new world/ story they control outside of all existing history ...."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,So they have a…plan.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Something I had zero concerns about
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,…so why didn’t you do this for the sequel trilogy?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Will probably go Mando 3 -> Ahsoka -> Boba Fett 2 -> Mando 4

A potential Obi Wan 2 would be mostly stand alone at this point. 

I for one am excited to watch all these."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,It would seemed they have learned something from the sequel trilogy
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This is the way.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"This is the way. Not like the travesty the sequels were. Like them or hate them, no one can argue that they were well planned in advance."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Just so long as I don't have to watch another show to get Din's story. I hate this tangled web of crisscrossing shows because some are good and some are garbage. They should stay separate.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This is going to turn into a Star Wars Averngers two movie ending.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,But the fact that it didn’t fit perfectly with other shows is part of what made it great 😞
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Star Wars fatigue.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,What episodes of Boba Fett do I have to watch to understand Mando season 3?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Star Wars should always have a fucking plan I’m not applauding them for starting to do what they’re suppose to do in the first place
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,[Endless trash!](https://youtu.be/Ut5sk0RUlS4)
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Boooooo!
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Ok but I'd rather not watch those.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I hope Andor S2 doesn't fit shit.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,This… is concerning.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Just like how “Kenobi” fits perfectly by having Obi Wan hang around 10 year old Leia and then that’s never mentioned again in the movies? Gtfo here. Nothing is connected antmore
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,I know people hate it but I love that The Book of Boba Fett and other 1-2 season short stories are baked into the storyline. It makes the system seem very dynamic with lots of these little things going on at the same time.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,They’re taking more care planning the Mandalorian/Star Wars TV verse than they did the damn sequel trilogy.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Ron burgundy: “ I don’t believe you.”
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Still processing GOT trauma, this head line soothes a tv loving soul."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Oh my god who fucking cares. Can we please be done with valuing our entertainment by how well designed it is to suck us into a brand
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,*sigh*
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I have lost all hope entirely for disney and star wars.

Literally the only thing i enjoy besides the mandalorian is bad batch"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Please don't make Ahsoka be The Mandalorian season 3.5  

I like Mando and Ahsoka and it was cool they met a few times, but they don't have to have interlinked stories. Ahsoka's meant to be in the unknown regions with sabine finding Ezra and Thrawn, Mando's got his own stuff. The universe is huge.   

Have the Jedi academy be a kind of hub, characters from all shows might pop in or out but don't do serious plot progression like Grogu and Mando reuniting, or getting a new ship, in a different show and expect everyone to have watch the book of boba fett"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"what is the problem? of course they should be connected, that's the whole reason why they are having so many shows in the same timeline. Would be weird if they would never met again."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Is it going to be more or less boring ?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Trying to connect all the properties just ends in a mess. Learn from marvel Phase one and quit while you're ahead.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Another show where I have to watch a dozen hours of a different show to understand what's happening. Yay!
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,retcon retcon retcon
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"The proliferation of all of these TV shows is how you deplete the hardcore fans. They can’t keep up, and because of it they lose interest. Their communities fall apart."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"Oh good, I was losing sleep."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I do not care how any of this “connects”. That isn’t entertaining, it’s just a shallow way of placating viewers who care more about “consistency” than good storytelling. They are infantilizing their audience. 

The Mandalorian has never been an amazing show (it’s repetitive and stake-less), but the first season was a harmless distraction. Now it’s become the lynch pin for a bunch of other lazily made Star Wars “content”. This is all made more baffling if you’ve seen Andor which operates at a level of quality extremely far beyond the scope of the other shows.

Disney is so terrified of making any big moves with this thing that the stories now operate in this suffocating pressure chamber of bad “lore” it feels it has to adhere to and reinforce. It’s like sewing a seam but just keeps sticking the needle in and out of the same couple of centimetres of fabric and trying to see how many stitches it can fit in there."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I’m glad I don’t let Reddit dictate what I should like or not like. This comment section is hilarious, I swear none of you actually like anything, you just use things to shit on other things. This show was gods gift to star wars, wasn’t it? Or was it just because you liked it more than the last jedi? Is Andor garbage too? Because you guys are saying that it’s better than mandalorian."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"man, the strike in 07 wreaked havoc on so many great shows."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,There's a strike about to happen?
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Considering that Jon Favreau just pretty much writes all the scripts by himself idk how much that would’ve even effected the Mandalorian lol.
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"I was 10 at that time, would you mind doing an ELI5 for me on what that strike was about?"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"The honest truth is: I want everything to be part of a plan in a movie trilogy; and I want every show to be its own separate thing in a TV universe, with *maybe* the occasional character crossover but never critical to either show's plot

They're completely backwards on everything"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,Even an outline would have been helpful in that instance
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"It certainly would have helped. But the original trilogy was written without a definite plan as well, and it worked for the most part.

I think two bigger issues were:

1. Relying heavily on mysteries without having any answer to them. Who are Rey's parents? What happened to Luke? Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? I believe the only mystery in the original trilogy that was thrown out without a plan was Yoda's ""there is another"" line.

2. No interest in following the story that came before it. Abrams just threw away everything from the original trilogy on an unexplained reset where we're somehow back to Empire vs. Rebels, the Empire is still being lead by an evil Sith lord, and the original characters are all split up. Johnson threw out what Abrams was building up to do his own thing, and then Abrams threw out what Johnson was building up to do something else.

The only one who actually seemed interested on following up on the story told by the previous films was Trevorrow. Whether or not people liked his script, it was the only one that seemed interested in turning the sequel trilogy into a coherent story."
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,"You mean they should have spent a weekend writing an outline for a trilogy instead of just spending billions on the idea of a trilogy? 

Whaaaaat?!"
Gold Stars: The Story of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments,That’s how the OT was written.
Pokémon the Series,Wow. Never thought i would see the day where disney got control of pokemon. 
Pokémon the Series,Cartoon Network shoots itself in the foot again. They're obsessed with getting rid of any cartoon that could be seen as targeted towards boys
Pokémon the Series,"Wait, does that mean Disney XD will be the only kids channel to air two animes? "
Pokémon the Series,Having broadcast rights to Pokemon in America hardly means they have control over it.
Pokémon the Series,Disney had the rights to the older Pokemon movies (the Johto ones) back in the day.
Pokémon the Series,"Or heck, ANY action/anime content on their daytime schedule. 

I don't remember the last time I saw a promo promoting Saturday morning (or any morning). Does Bakugan still exist? "
Pokémon the Series,Incorrect.
Pokémon the Series,Unless something changed CN/Toonami has several. 
Pokémon the Series,"No, NickToons airs Yu-Gi-Oh and LBX."
Pokémon the Series,I know. I meant control over when and where it airs on television. I remember when pokemon was a saturday morning cartoon on channel 11. Then it moved to cartoon network. Now disney is its home. 
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,They got the rights thru Miramax
Pokémon the Series,They did? 1-3 were the best ones. 
Pokémon the Series,"I looked it up recently. Turns out, after the first I think 2 seasons it was released straight to the US because in Japan the ratings tanked so bad. It had 4 seasons and was cancelled in 2012."
Pokémon the Series,What's the last specifically boys show that aired on the network?
Pokémon the Series,Pokemon barely even counts as it is.
Pokémon the Series,"Adult Swim technically, which owns Toonami, and not part of CN."
Pokémon the Series,How so?
Pokémon the Series,"I believe they had the rights starting from Pokemon 4Ever up to Destiny Deoxys, so I guess they had some of Johto and some of Hoenn."
Pokémon the Series,actually 4-7 from miramax a part of disney
Pokémon the Series,"Yikes! Well that series is now dead.

How about transformers? Or has that migrated to somewhere else? I know CN UK has it."
Pokémon the Series,"Ninjago?

Not the point though. Going with a broader appeal is just good business sense."
Pokémon the Series,Iirc The Hub has broadcasting rights to Transformers and other Hasbro IPs like MLP.
Pokémon the Series,Disney is managing to appeal to both boys and girls.
Pokémon the Series,Hasn't Cartoon Network been airing Transformers: RID?
Pokémon the Series,"To be honest, I'm not so sure. I remember watching all of Transformers Prime so I assumed it was the same for RiD."
Pokémon the Series,"So this proves (again and again) that HBO has the recipe for good television drama.

Why can't any of the other networks figure this out?"
Pokémon the Series,Nothing to add besides: I’m just really glad this show ended up in the right hands. Could have turned out very differently somewhere like Netflix or Paramount
Pokémon the Series,I knew it was going to be big but jesus it could potetentially become HBO's biggest show if it keeps this up.
Pokémon the Series,"I hope the success behind TLOU will give us better adaptations. Seriously, there’s no excuse in bad shows with high budget."
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,"I don’t love everything HBO makes, but most of the tv I really love is made by HBO"
Pokémon the Series,"I started watching it alone, now I watch the episodes with a group of 6. Definitely spreading through word of mouth because I tell everyone I know to watch it"
Pokémon the Series,"Details

>The penultimate episode of “The Last of Us” Season 1 reached an impressive 8.1 million viewers on Sunday night.

>According to Warner Bros. Discovery, that makes Episode 8 the series’ most-viewed thus far. Previously, that title belonged to Episode 3 with 6.4 million viewers, though the company did not make data available regarding the audience size of Episodes 4-7.

>The 8.1 million viewers who tuned into Episode 8, titled “When We Are In Need,” contributed to a 74% increase from the viewership of the series premiere, which drew an audience of 4.7 million people and was HBO’s second-most watched debut in over a decade."
Pokémon the Series,Can we just note fungus in the end saved him. Penicillin?
Pokémon the Series,"HBO treating The Last of Us as prestige television. Great writers and creatives on board to adapt the game properly

EDIT: Praise Druckmann!"
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,"I've never played the game but I'm enjoying the show and it's been moving, but ""I got you baby girl"" is what finally made me burst into tears."
Pokémon the Series,"I am watching this show with MY GRANDMOTHER. It’s so crazy to me that in this day and age we can bond over something of a shared interest! Me, knowing exactly what happens and seeing her watching in suspense is always a great feeling for me. She adored Sam and Henry and was like “I hope they make it through” when they approached the sniper on the street. I was just sitting there silently and she’s like, “you know what happens don’t you?” She was devastated but the >!bloater ripping the head off!< had her so intrigued, also realizing >!David and his group were a bunch of cannibals!< had her so hooked it’s amazing. Thank you HBO for creating something we could bond with in a way that I never thought!"
Pokémon the Series,Bella Ramsey crushed it this episode. What a powerhouse.
Pokémon the Series,That episode was INCREDIBLE!!!
Pokémon the Series,I’m so glad Amazon or Netflix didn’t get ahold of this show. So refreshing seeing people actually give a fuck about the original material.
Pokémon the Series,"Ever since I played the game for the first time way back in 2013 I knew it was one of the best stories I’ve ever been told and it just makes me so happy that so many people are experiencing this amazing story for the first time, I certainly didn’t expect that it’d come close to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon which is arguably the biggest TV show of all time."
Pokémon the Series,"Damn amazing number, shame it has to compete with the Oscars for the final episode."
Pokémon the Series,"It was nearly a 1:1 of this section of the game, and masterfully acted. A+"
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,"It's pretty good, I'll admit I had my doubts but the 74% is for sure word of mouth. Everyone around me told me it was 🔥 and now I'm suggesting it to others. It makes sense."
Pokémon the Series,"I haven’t watched a single episode, I haven’t seen a single spoiler, and on March 12th I’m binging every fucking episode and I can’t wait!!!!"
Pokémon the Series,Wonder how long it’s gonna be until other networks/streamers announce their own zombie/zombie-adjacent shows to ride the hype.
Pokémon the Series,"This was a great episode.  I ended up rewatching the [video game playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AaaGoWfOhY&ab_channel=CouchSoup) with commentary from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.  They did a great job capturing the story.  

Fun fact!  Troy Baker makes a cameo as James in the tv show!"
Pokémon the Series,I remember the time when 8.1 million views meant cancellation of the show
Pokémon the Series,ELI5: are people not watching the rest of the season and just watching episode 8?
Pokémon the Series,Happy for Sony and Naughty Dog.
Pokémon the Series,Been such a great show so far. The best video game/movie adaptation.
Pokémon the Series,"As someone who was wildly impressed back in 2013 with the game and the story. I’m just as excited to see the show doing so well, people that worked on the show seem to have enjoyed their time together, and it has kept the heart of the story. Well deserved praise for The Last of Us."
Pokémon the Series,Video game dialogues are top but I like how ‘sort of close’ they are to it compared to the game.
Pokémon the Series,Netflix totally gonna pivot some shows to one episode a week. Their shows hit and the conversation is gone in a week.
Pokémon the Series,"Amazing production for both fans and those new to the series. Not only did they stay true to the story’s themes but the deviations they’ve introduced seem to augment them instead of reduce them.

I can’t help but imagine if Henry Cavrill and Sapkowski were able to work with HBO instead of Netflix…"
Pokémon the Series,And this isn’t even counting all the people pirating it!
Pokémon the Series,"I was in the real town they filmed that in a few weeks ago, was cool to see it."
Pokémon the Series,It’s sooooo good! Like sautéed portobello good!
Pokémon the Series,It’s a good show
Pokémon the Series,"That was an intense episode.

Having Joel up and running and killing 3 men seems a bit of a stretch when he was bed ridden minutes before."
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,Good stuff
Pokémon the Series,Best episode yet
Pokémon the Series,"Forgetting the game exists, after watching the walking dead for however many seasons I got through I absolutely got worried they were going to stretch this ""villain"" out and then remembered it's the last of us lol. It was nice not having a drawn out enemy that just gets worn out too fast."
Pokémon the Series,"I just want to throw out there that between episodes of TLOU, I started watching Station Eleven, another post-apocalyptic drama and I’ve never seen anyone mention it but if you haven’t seen it, it’s excellent. Very different from TLOU; slower, less action but engrossing. The base story is about an acting troupe that makes a living circling lake Superior going from one small community to the next performing Shakespeare. 

Maybe I just missed it when it first came out and I’m late to the viewing party or maybe it just got overlooked. Either way, if you are looking for something to watch when the credits roll on Joel and Ellie, it’s out there."
Pokémon the Series,"Any recommendations for single player PS games that focuses on story and isn't open world?

I don't really have time anymore to sink it big open worlds, I love TLOU part 1 & 2 because the story is so good and so tight. Would love to play something similar."
Pokémon the Series,"My only complaint with the show is I think they're going too fast. Instead of 9 episodes, it should have been at least 15. A lot of the moments in the game that in my opinion are crucial to character development and the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie have been skimmed over, or cut entirely, and honestly I don't think the point their relationship is at in the show makes sense within the context of what's actually happened in the show. I think it would have benefited from a slightly slower pace that told more of the story. But that's just like my opinion man."
Pokémon the Series,Ellie was a BOSS in this episode!
Pokémon the Series,"Bella Ramsey did an awesome job this episode. Lots of high emotion and fight choreo scenes.   
  
And then I watched Pascal take care of a different, greener adopted child right after. Dude’s having a dad year."
Pokémon the Series,The finale few minutes were pretty amazing in that episode 👌🏻
Pokémon the Series,Some people are going to be real upset when it doesn’t drag out for 11 seasons like TWD.
Pokémon the Series,This episode was the most intense 50 minutes of tv. Absolutely marvellous.
Pokémon the Series,"As much as I wanna see the new ep so bad, I really thing weekly premiers are the way to go"
Pokémon the Series,[removed]
Pokémon the Series,RIP to all the haters that said Last of Us was B-tier story at best if it was filmed.
Pokémon the Series,I am trying so hard to like this. apparently I'm the only one who thinks it's average.
Pokémon the Series,"Every week, a friend texts me that The Last Of Us must have been one interesting game… almost as if he’s insinuating that what’s in each episode wasn’t part of a pretty rich series of games. And every week, I reply “yup, it’s a fantastic story that they’re adapting brilliantly!”"
Pokémon the Series,"So lucky to have had such a wonderful adaptation of such a treasured game and story to so many people. I have my own nitpicks and I agree that they are having to speed through some sections but I genuinely don’t think people realize how good we have had it. Brilliant acting all around, showrunner who loves the source material, original creator heavily involved, original composer doing the score, beautifully shot — a dream come true compared to most adaptations (let alone game adaptations)"
Pokémon the Series,Yeah I mean it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise.
Pokémon the Series,"I love it. Theres a lot of content out there, a lot of good content even, but this show is great."
Pokémon the Series,I love this show!
Pokémon the Series,I'm ready to be hurt again...
Pokémon the Series,what delicious numbers
Pokémon the Series,10million by the end! Let’s do it!!
Pokémon the Series,"I can't get the original game out of my head, but when they use a similar scene, it's incredible."
Pokémon the Series,She went into beast mode and I loved it!
Pokémon the Series,It was a great Episode!
Pokémon the Series,Crazy good episode
Pokémon the Series,This is by far one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. I love what they’ve done with it and how they make things a little different from the game to keep you guessing. Everything about this show is amazing. I’m so glad they knocked it out of the park.
Pokémon the Series,"Bellas performance in episode 8 was incredible. 

“Tell them Ellie is the name of the child that broke your fucking finger!”"
Pokémon the Series,Last night episode was so fucking good
Pokémon the Series,Its really not that good..but i guess enjoy?
Pokémon the Series,Episode 9 is gonna have more than 10M and gonna surpass House of the Dragon season finale numbers.
Pokémon the Series,Why tho? That dialogue is ass
Pokémon the Series,"Anyone else think it was way way over rated? I quit pretty quick. Episode one was good and sad. After that I thought it was lame and felt really cheap for HBO. 

Just my take"
Pokémon the Series,Shit is so good
Pokémon the Series,"my biggest issues with it are the 

1) goofy ahhh kathleen episode and the ending action scene

2) the time skip being in the new spot was altogether worse for the pacing and character development

3) the impalement scene was weaker in the TV show"
ViR: The Robot Boy,Definitely give it a shot.
ViR: The Robot Boy,You should definitely watch at least the first season. In a way it’s a complete story that really pays off and isn’t that much of a time commitment and you can decide from there if you want more.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"As everyone said, fantastic show. But, in particular, 407 Proxy Authentication Required in season four is one of the greatest television episodes of all-time, IMO, with a huge payoff. The writing, the performances, everything was perfect."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Ugh, I want to watch this to the end but I’ve already tried twice (once as it aired and again right around when it was finishing) and life just got in the way. 

I feel like if I watch season 1 again it will be too familiar."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"These questions are so stupid. ""Hey guys this show is widely regarded as one of the best tv shows of all time. Is it good?"""
ViR: The Robot Boy,Mr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery and satisfyingly so. Watch it.
ViR: The Robot Boy,Not until you've finished your chores!
ViR: The Robot Boy,"""I keep hearing it's one of the best shows ever yet here I am still stupidly asking this question.""

FTFY"
ViR: The Robot Boy,Yes.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"You prefer shows with good writing, good acting and  character development.....?

&#x200B;

FUCKIN WERIDO."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Severance and Mr. Robot are both among my favorite shows ever made, I would recommend anyone who's a fan of one of those to watch the other.

The thing about nobody in this thread elaborating on what makes this show great is that it's like dissecting a frog: you understand it better but it kills it in the process. Comparing the show to its influences absolutely ruins the plot. I'll lift the veil a teeny tiny bit, but only in spoiler tags.

>!To me, the story unfolding itself in highly unexpected ways, something something unreliable narrator, and the exquisite cinematography really pull you in!<"
ViR: The Robot Boy,"My all time favorite show, I made the mistake of dropping it at the beginning of season 2 after thinking it wasn't nearly exciting as season 1.  Only came back to it years later when I heard people saying that season 4 was even better than season 1, which I had a hard time believing.  Seasons 2 and 3 can be slow at time but they are all necessary to build up to season 4, if you can make it there you won't regret it. Every episode of season 4 is a banger, I consider the best single season of any TV show.  

The Leftovers is probably my second favorite show and while I wouldn't consider the two show similar, they definitely explore some common themes regarding human connection/loneliness."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Yes 100%. It is a zeitgeist show. In 20 years, someone will ask what was 2017 like. Just watch Mr Robot. It’s not the plot points or anything like that. It is the style and the tone. Some of the best television ever made."
ViR: The Robot Boy,yes. it is one of the few shows that rewards you handsomely because the whole thing was planned out from start to finish. season 4 has payoff after payoff that was set up YEARS in advance. tbh it's everything TV should be
ViR: The Robot Boy,"If you like Kubrick, then for sure. Esmail loves artistic long shots (in a good way) with heavy and well written dialogue. 

I honestly regard it as one of my top three shows of all time. The other two being Dark and The Wire."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Based on your favorite shows and your preferences I would say yes. My only caveat would be if someone might be triggered by raw elements like the depiction of mental illness, violence, trauma or if they’re looking for something that has lighthearted elements to reconsider it.

Edit for clarification: this was the case for me, love the show but when I binged it I found myself to be more anxious because I got an insight on the things I mentioned above even though I can typically handle darker elements."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Yes, you should watch it."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It's one of my favorite shows of all time. If you love Severence, there's no way you won't like it."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I've tried three times to get into it,   I watch the first few episodes and tap out.      The main character is just so unrelatable,  unlikable,  and uninteresting to me....  and I like Rami Malek.      FTR  I loved Severance too."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I think it was an amazing show.

However, while the show grabs your attention with its initial vigilante hacker plot, the story is fundamentally about the MC making peace with his mental trauma (which is incidentally why people tend to find season 2-3 weaker, since the vigilante hacker stuff takes a bit of a backseat), so if you enjoy great character development, an unreliable narrator (due to mental trauma) that makes you question what's real and what isn't, shrouded with a gripping vigilante hacker story line, then I do recommend this show.

Also, I'm a big fan of all the shows you mentioned (happy to see Le Bureau des Légendes get some love), and also a big fan of this one, so take that as you will.

I think the struggle with a lot of people is that while the show starts off as a vigilante hacker story, it starts to focus more on the psychology of the main character, which some people enjoyed less.

The final season is fantastic and the show has probably one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen."
ViR: The Robot Boy,">I really like shows with great writing, good acting, and character development

You'll get those.

>What I don’t like is a ton of Flashbacks and OTT visuals, etc.

It has some flashbacks, but they're not a large focus from what I recall.

As for over the top visuals, any examples of what you would consider as such?"
ViR: The Robot Boy,Great show; the cinematography is second to none. I am debating a rewatch.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It's not the fastest show, but it's one of my favorites. The mystery, the intensity, the characters. I personally never got bored with it. It's such a weird show but not in a bad way. I was curious to see what Elliott did next. I will say season 2 is way weaker though. Wouldn't say bad, just a bit annoying at times."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Just watch it. Everything leads up to an amazing finale.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I personally loved it. Best shot show in all of television (particularly seasons 3 and 4), takes a lot of risks that have huge payoffs, emotionally satisfying, tense, and the literal best last 5 seconds of any show I've watched. If you like severance there's a very good chance you'll get into Mr robot. It sucks it didn't get the recognition I think it deserves outside of reddit."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"One of the best/satisfying finales in my opinion, whole series is a trip."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Something real quick I'll add to this conversation. I love Mr. Robot for many reasons, most already listed in this thread. But a certain character that suffers from panic attacks is the only character I've come across the represents them in a way that feels accurate to my own experiences and I freaking love this show for that."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"yes, it is"
ViR: The Robot Boy,It's fine if you like tedious monologues about how people are sheep for drinking Coca Cola
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It’s a great show.

It’s not one of my best shows ever but it is definitely one of the best looking shows."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Great show. Hated the ending personally. Some people loved the ending. Worth a watch.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"IMO, it was alright. Way overhyped & pretty meh. Some parts of Season 2 are just cringey, such as the money burning in public and some other parts. Other parts are really great though."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I normally like shows that Reddit likes and Reddit loves the show, but I hated it. It was so edgelord cringe that I had to stop watching."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It's remarkable and totally underrated.  The ending is good, too."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Season one was good. But it went off the rails after that.
ViR: The Robot Boy,I thought it was pretty bad. I tried to sit through it because I was bored and sick at home or during lockdown or something. I finally gave up halfway through S2.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Would definitely recommend. The first season can be a bit cringey in a few parts, specifically the first and last episode. It's a great show overall, season 3 is my favorite season of television. It's also one of the best directed shows I've seen"
ViR: The Robot Boy,I fucking love Mr robot. Go in completely blind. It's better than sopranos breaking bad and the wire imo.
ViR: The Robot Boy,It's good but it gets a little too up its own ass at some point. You can definitely tell when the awards started pouring in and the writers got a little too ambitious for their own good.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I LOVE Severance. Cannot stand Mr. Robot. 

Personally i hate shows that go all-in on the unreliable narrator. Ret-conning events because the narrator lied does not mean you are being clever, it just means i shouldn’t trust anything i see, in that case why tf should i care.

I like using a puzzle analogy. A good mystery gives you puzzle pieces but doesn’t tell you what the picture looks like. You can tell which obvious pieces go together but not exactly what it means, as the story goes on the picture becomes more clear and you get an earned “ah-ha”. A bad mystery gives you pieces and the picture but when you start putting it together it flips the board and says “hah got you! You’re so confused right now!” Then you just sit there staring at a giant mess until they just explain what the puzzle was all along."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"A counterpoint to the popular opinion. I liked the first scene, after that I lost interest pretty rapidly. I forced myself to finish the first season and even started season 2 but it's not a show you can watch while on your phone but because I wasn't engaged I was never giving it my full attention. Its simultaneously confusing with whats actually happening while the season 1 twist is very obvious."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I mean it’s good.  I kinda get the feeling it’s what the boondocks saints was to my generation.

I think everyone would enjoy it more if they didn’t try to contextualize it with their personal plights.  But 🤷‍♂️"
ViR: The Robot Boy,It’s the best show I’ve ever watched. Season 2 can be a bit of a slog but thats because it’s putting the pieces in place for season 3/4 which absolutely nail it out of the park. If you decide you just can’t make it through then that’s fine but you should still check out season 4 episode 7. Perfect filmmaking.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"season 1 is fantastic 

the rest completely miss the mark tho"
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I couldn't stand it. It's initially interesting, but got boring fast."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Was one of my favorite shows when it was on the air, but I don't think it quite stuck the landing with it's final season. Most people complain about the 2nd season not really having a straightforward plot which didn't bother me at all. But regardless of whether it was that or the death of tv it had really bad ratings for the rest of the series and there were two actors that were probably not included in the last season for issues that happened off set that I haven't seen any coverage of even a comment from Sam Esmail or Rami Malek about."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Season 1 was probably the best series I ever saw- season 2 lost me
ViR: The Robot Boy,Started watching it. Guessed a big reveal about 2 episodes in. Checked to confirm if I was right and I was so I called it there.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Familiarize yourself with Linux, and give it a season 

Once you see White Rose storylines, , give up."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I enjoyed the ride and it was certainly pretty unique. It gets a little too convoluted which hinders the storytelling and not all the twists land as hard as they could.
I don't know if it ever is as purely fun as that first episode but it gets pretty close.
But worth the watch for sure."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Mr. Robot is great, just be warned it's not happy in the slightest, as in ""we'll give you a puppy dog, shoot it in front of you, and then immediately move on like it never happened to rob you of the grieving process,"" type not happy. Not to mention all characters are fundamentally lonely and/or desperate to their core which doesn't make things any better. As a work of art and as a story the show is amazing, but just make sure you're in a good space before watching it.

I made the mistake of watching it right when the pandemic started. I was like ""Wow, the school I work is closed down, now I have time to catch up on all the shows I've been wanting to watch,"" and it really didn't do much good for my emotional state during that time."
ViR: The Robot Boy,If you can stand the main character (which I personally have a really hard time doing) it's worth a watch
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It's not bad, but not even close to being one of the 'best shows ever'."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"If you take your time with the show, there's so many rabbit holes and easter eggs in subreddit discussions. Just search by season and episode like S1E01 or S01E01.  


**There are no spoilers**, but the one I think about all the time is that the creator rendered an image as a sound at the beginning of a really intense episode. The image was the ""Hang in There Baby"" cat image. A fan's boyfriend was an audio engineer and immediately recognized what the sound was, and processed the audio back into an image.  


""There was a strange squiggly noise at the beginning of this episode. My boyfriend is an audio engineer and knew right away that it was the sound of an image being rendered as audio. He grabbed the audio and processed it and found the ""Hang in there baby"" cat. But what does it mean?"""
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Definitely. The story can get really confusing sometimes with all the subplots, but the atmosphere, acting, twists and the big reveal at the end are absolutely phenomenal."
ViR: The Robot Boy,I tried but it was so slow and boring as shit.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Why are you seeking Reddit's opinion? If you're interested,  give it another chance!"
ViR: The Robot Boy,"yes, but the depressing outlook is contagious."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Absolutely. It’s one of the greatest shows ever done. S2 is generally regarded as the weakest but press on.
ViR: The Robot Boy,I binged a season or two of it. But it just got too weird for me so I dropped it.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Sam Esmail knows what he's doing. This show has it all: killer cinematography, a superb soundtrack and score, delicious acting from amazing actors, a plot that hooks you from the start, memorable characters, innovative visual storytelling, a satisfying ending and incredible social commentary. Mr. Robot knew what it wanted to do and ran away with it. There is some growing pains on season 2 because season 1 was the buzziest show of the season, but the show is very good. One of my favorites."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Yes dude! I had a completely similar experience. I watched the first few episodes back when the show was fresh and it kinda didn’t grab me. Also a lack of attention probably.

Then last year I gave it another try and wow. It is one of my TOP series of all time. It’s amazing."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Mr Robot overall was a good show with moments of absolute brilliance and a slow start.  It was worth watching, though personally I think its a little overrated.  Particularly on this sub."
ViR: The Robot Boy,If you want to watch the performance that made a virtual unknown one of the most lauded actors in the world then yeh
ViR: The Robot Boy,Second season is a bit weaker but overall it is a great ride with some episodes being the best stuff made on TV.
ViR: The Robot Boy,It's a great show in my opinion due to the complexity of the characters and strong overall writing. As long as you don't long up the plot you'll definitely won't see some of the plot twist. Also by and large pretty accurate depiction of hacking and hacking methods. I would also mention that it's not a feel good show ie you'll feel the stress the characters go through.
ViR: The Robot Boy,Does it have less mistakes than Breaking Bad? No. Is it better? I think so. Cinematography and music are better than anywhere I can remember. It has a perfect one shot episode in season 3. It has a perfect silent episode in season 4. There's 407 which is probably the best episode on TV ever. Season 4 overall was amazing.
ViR: The Robot Boy,Why do you think it’s so good?
ViR: The Robot Boy,What makes it so good for you
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I recommend starting from the beginning. First season lets you familiarise with the world,  the characters and ends in an optimistic place. Season 2 is when I feel the show stops holding your hand and trusts you enough to go darker and weirder."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"And guy really wants to be convinced in the comments, lmao. Just use this time to watch the first episode, which is a very good pilot."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"tbf, reddit gigapraises the leftovers and to me it is not that good at all.

at a lot of times it made me go ""really? this is so stupid"" like when i was watching season 7-8 of TWD

im fully prepared for the downvotes."
ViR: The Robot Boy,LOL Ok. Didn’t ask if it was good. Asked if I should watch it based on my preferences. Completely different question
ViR: The Robot Boy,"That’s my first thought, like, just start the show, watch a few episodes and then you’ll decide if the show is for you, I could understand this question regarding video games cause you have to buy them, but movies or TV show, it’s just silly"
ViR: The Robot Boy,*Tyrell Wellick has entered the chat*
ViR: The Robot Boy,agreed. Sam Esmail planned the whole thing out meticulously from the start
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I really don't know how people were satisfied with how White Rose and The Dark Army plot resolved. After spending so much time on White Rose outmaneuvering every other major player in the show, it was insanely disappointing to have her arc and the mysteries surrounding her plan to be answered with essentially that she's just crazy.

Elliot's personal trauma and how his mental health felt like it had been planned from the start, and was a very satisfying wrap up. E-Corp, White Rose and a lot of the mysteries felt like they never had a plan behind them."
ViR: The Robot Boy,">level 1Mnemosense · 1 hr. agoMr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery 

I don't think it's necessarily a good thing for all questions to be answered. It's best that some questions be left unanswered. See The Leftovers."
ViR: The Robot Boy,I’ve heard ppl say The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever & I hate it. So what’s your point? Lol
ViR: The Robot Boy,"That's it. It laid out mysteries through its run and it manages to answer many of them, while leaving others unanswered but that don't feel frustrating."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Counterpoint: It *is* one of the best shows ever.
ViR: The Robot Boy,I thought it was one of the worst endings I've seen. It felt like a cheesy cop-out to me. But I seem to be the minority on that opinion.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Yeah I said in another comment seasons 2 & 3 really detracted from the series overall. If I could I'd condense the series into 2 seasons. There's a good story tucked away, it just gets dragged out way too long."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I tried to watch it twice, once alone and once with my gf (she was also trying a rewatch). We both enjoyed season 1 and couldn't remember why we stopped watching independently of each other. The season 2 happened...  We had to keep pausing because it was killing our spirits..  Eventually we quit. I'm sorry, but if I need to slog though hours of boredom just to enjoy the later parts of your show, it's not a good show. I won't be attempting a third rewatch to finish"
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Maybe I'm misremembering here, but I'm pretty sure it only seriously retcons one thing and that one thing is possibly the greatest twist in the history of television. Mainly because it's something we all should have seen coming and was right in front of our noses the entire time, but nobody actually figured it out. That's the mark of an excellent twist."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Great writing with a lot of different plot twists, they're actually correct with their tech, and it's just a good show overall. 

I was hooked from the first scene and spent a week binge watching the entire series during the first lockdown."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Some of the best cinematography I've come across in a TV show. Even ignoring the great characters, acting, music, and story, it brings me joy just seeing the amount of creativity and passion put into the camera framing and movements."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It's a show that seems to be about a very narrow topic at the beginning, but progresses to be about almost EVERYTHING. Even characters that are introduced as flat stereotypes are rounded out into complex humans trying to do the best they can, and the show explores big questions about the various crises of the modern age and what we as individuals can really do about them, if anything.

It's one of the rare shows where each episode builds on all the ones before to become even more thought-provoking."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Don't ask or read more about it. It fits with your favorites but knowing less is better for the full ride.
ViR: The Robot Boy,Very suspenseful and it felt like each episode had a distinct climax which kept my attention
ViR: The Robot Boy,"Not OP but I'll give you a break down of my thoughts on what makes it good:

1) Narrative format. Elliot ""breaks the fourth wall"" by speaking to the audience in voice overs, which results in some interesting dynamics and plays an important part in both the plot and his character development. It's probably one of the most effective uses in voice over narrative in TV since Wonder Years.

2) Direction. The direction of the show is just unique and also very effective. The camera shots, framing, angles, are all used to help influence our views, feelings towards characters, and understanding of what's happening. After season 1 there are some very well done scenes that make use of long shots and revealing of scenes as things unfold on and off camera.

3) Characters. Like Sopranos, these characters are treated very much like real people. They get into crazy situations and it *effects them*. We see how it effects them over time. They change, their relationships and dynamics to one another change, and all of this effects their choices and the larger plot. It's a psychological show, with a psychologist as an occasional character (like Sopranos), so it takes into consideration how the psyches of people work. And there are some *fascinating* characters, some who aren't even main characters, and they all have complicated depth.

4) Plot and story. Mr. Robot is a show that moves forward while still returning to past effects. The plot develops with each season, though season 2 is a little more character focused, and it kind of just keeps unfolding. But, essentially, the plot and story is all really about Elliot and Mr. Robot, which is why 1, 2, and 3 of my list here are handled so carefully. It needs those elements to work well for its story to be good. And so there's an attention to all of it that helps it become a well crafted story.

Overall, it's good TV because it's aware of its medium and craft and how to use those effectively. This also makes it a bit too ""pretentious"" for some, because it very much is trying to make an art out of it, it's aware of what it's doing. That's not for everyone. But I think if you enjoy character driven stories it's still good even if it feels a little too meta or pretentious at times.

It does use similar fantasy scenarios as Sopranos, where it delves into the mind of the protagonist like we do with Tony, but it really pushes on that farther and takes it up several notches. That can be too much for people when it happens, but it's not every episode either.

Anyway, that's what I think makes it good. It's firing on all cylinders and fits the genres I like. But your own tastes may differ."
ViR: The Robot Boy,"It pulls you in harder than just about any show I've watched. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire series, kind of like breaking bad but much more engaging and fast paced. And it doesn't even have a massive buildup, it hooks you from the first scene and will keep you guessing the whole time."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Control is just an illusion!
ViR: The Robot Boy,"I agree with the OP. Season 1 was a thrill to watch. Personally seasons 2 and 3 get progressively worse, I'd call them boring and rudderless. Season 4, the final season has a lot of payoffs but I honestly don't know if it's worth it getting to that point slogging through the rest of the story. 

That being said all the characters feel very human. They're not simply plot elements, even the side characters. Everyone reacts according to their own beliefs and characteristics. There are consequences, intrigue and hidden agendas behind every action. At times the intrigue goes a little too deep as you can tell the writers got a little over their heads at times. 

It's really hard to say much about the series as it's kind of chock full of spoilers, though. Even making comparisons to other media feels a bit too leading. You really need to go into this show with blinders on. Just watching the first 15 minutes should give you a good feel for the vibe of the rest of the season though."
ViR: The Robot Boy,This is what I'm saying. How is spending all this time thinking about consuming media or shitting on media you haven't watched productive? Is your life just not meaningful on its own? Watch the thing and move on. Or don't watch the thing and move on.
ViR: The Robot Boy,You’re putting more effort into a Reddit post about watching it than it would be to just watch it.
ViR: The Robot Boy,People like different things though. I absolutely love some of your preference and don’t like others.  Only way to know whether you’ll like the show is to check it out. There’s a chance you will like it but only you would know for sure.
ViR: The Robot Boy,Based on your preferences I'd say it's a MORE THAN definite yes.
ViR: The Robot Boy,"If you like hacking, unreliable narrators, thrillers, twists with payoff and breathtaking cinematography then yes you should watch it. The show doesn’t hold your hand though you do have to pay attention to it."
ViR: The Robot Boy,Me when I find the mystery box in Call of Duty Zombies
Nailed It,"Really depends on the show, but I think people would be surprised at how little some crew members make. On some of the biggest reality shows, teams of producers are non-union and get no benefits.

Production companies like Magical Elves, Kinetic, World of Wonder, World Race productions that make Drag Race, The Amazing Race, Love is Blind all of have teams of producers who are non-union and it's reports like these where networks would rather shut down production than work with crews trying to unionize that continue to make it difficult."
Nailed It,WES?
Nailed It,[deleted]
Nailed It,"Bummed not to get more holiday episodes, which are my favourites, but obviously I support the staff and they deserve to be treated and paid fairly."
Nailed It,"And then people go and celebrate when actors successfully lobby to get paid 100k per episode, meanwhile the people who actually MAKE the show get like minimum wage while also putting up with unsafe shit depending on the show (like I'm sure animated shows don't have much of an issue with safety violations, but reality and action shows probably have a lot)"
Nailed It,Sounds like he couldn't take it any more.
Nailed It,It seems to be more than $$. There were apparently practices that were not necessarily safe.
Nailed It,"Na. It’s just a big message to the industry. We don’t care if we make money or not, you can’t exercise your rights, if you do so, we will invest elsewhere."
Nailed It,They probably don’t want to set a precedent.
Nailed It,Hah hah hah... they make a fortune.
Nailed It,"Last I heard, Nicole Byer, who hosts this and also Wipeout still has a damn roommate."
Nailed It,same
Nailed It,We won't get to see his golden locks anymore.
Nailed It,"You mean covid safe or something else? Baking show can't be that dangerous, well maybe for the contestants."
Nailed It,Aren't large portions of the industry extremely unionized? That's what the Screen Actors Guild and company ARE.
Nailed It,"Has she shared thoughts on this? Last I heard, which is couple years ago, they just inform her like few weeks before hand to come and host, like she was barely made aware if the show was cancelled or not. Seemed pretty shitty."
Nailed It,"I listen to one of her podcasts & the roommate moved out with his partner last year. 

Since then, Nicole has picked up some extra dollas from NBC for the first session of 'Grand Crew', plus she's co-hosting the critic's choice awards with Taye Diggs so she's doing a-ok."
Nailed It,She has said on her podcast she likes having a roommate.
Nailed It,I heard that there was an accident one time with the liquid nitrogen and a crew member that shouldn’t have been handling.
Nailed It,"Correct, but they don’t want new ones."
Nailed It,Not for Netflix productions.
Nailed It,HAWESSSSSSSSSSSS has had enough of this shit.
Nailed It,Honestly shocked a show with this viewership and this many seasons wasn’t union already. These “New Media” shows need to stop getting away with stuff like this
Nailed It,I stand with IATSE.
Nailed It,HWES needs to unionize
Nailed It,Can someone give us the highlights of why it matters either way?
Nailed It,I worked for Magical Elves as the interim IT administrator in 2009 for a few weeks so this hits really close to home.
Nailed It,It's not a great loss. It's such a cringe show it's hard to watch.
Nailed It,HWES!
Nailed It,"I don't even think it's a new media issue (though it is an issue), I worked on newer seasons of reality/doc shows in 2016-2018 and those weren't union."
Nailed It,IATSE is the union for grips and other off screen workers. Essentially they announced they are going to try and unionize
Nailed It,"Unionization provides the technical workers with pension and health care benefits and other guarantees to break time, and daily turn around time. Striking a show with the support of the union prevents any union member from working on that show and makes “scabbing” the show as non union worker a bad idea if you ever want to join the union. On the flip side it costs the production company more money. Much of the time these shows flip union without any fan fare."
Nailed It,"The workers unionize: The world literally becomes a better place.

The rich fucks win: The world's oligarchs have even more resources to rape children with."
Nailed It,This was such a cringe comment that was hard to read.
Nailed It,I’m tired of opening these crappy “secret” doors  on this crappy “secret” show!
Nailed It,“Fall” isn’t setting a Netflix premier for Great British Baking Show. We already knew “Fall” it’s always “Fall.”  I’m looking for a date. Or at least a specific month.
Nailed It,Next month for Nailed It! Hell yes
Nailed It,I wish Netflix would get The Great Canadian Baking Show (Dan Levy hosted first two seasons and was terrific) and the Great Kiwi Baking Show. I was briefly able to get them in nefarious manners but would watch again. With Dan Levy being so popular it’s surprising TGCBS isn’t available outside Canada.
Nailed It,I really dont like the new comedian guy on bakeoff :( Noel is amazing but the other guy is just too strange for me
Nailed It,[removed]
Nailed It,[deleted]
Nailed It,I live for the GGBO! I wish we could get the celebrity versions on Netflix too.
Nailed It,"I had a dream that Ted Lasso was a guest judge and they had to make his biscuits, Paul Hollywood giving him a handshake with the sample, Ted spitting tea into someone’s face"
Nailed It,Either way it's not soon enough. I need that wholesome baked goodness now
Nailed It,"Oh Wes. Wes. Wes!!!

Yippee I need my Wes🥰"
Nailed It,"I definitely prefer the first couple seasons where the challenges actually looked like things I thought I could do, even though I probably couldn't, but they at least LOOKED doable. Now it's just stuff you know NO ONE could even come close to."
Nailed It,"Yeah, Lucas is clearly struggling with the format. As much as I despise his work with Walliams he's funny but he's awkward as hell on Bake Off."
Nailed It,same :( I miss sandy
Nailed It,"Same energy as saying ""I PAY YOUR SALARY"" to public service workers. 

The $15 a month you pay isn't enough for them to close the millions of dollars they'd need to get the license back for this stuff.  I know Hunger Games used to be on there, I assume the viewership numbers were too low to justify them continuing to pay for the streaming rights. 

Just buy the DVDs."
Nailed It,"Seeing as how I also pay them, I say they do the opposite of what you say."
Nailed It,I can't tell if you're trolling or just incredibly young with terrible taste.
Nailed It,"The term exists, but in this case the show would then be called ""The Great British Face-Off."" Not exactly a fitting title for a friendly baking competition! And ""The Great British Baking Face-Off"" just doesn't roll off the tongue, so we settle with Baking Show. 

It's because Pillsbury, an American baking company, holds its own baking competitions and owns the trademark for the term ""Bake Off."""
Nailed It,Crime Scene Kitchen isn’t quite as wholesome but it’s a pretty fun twist on that Baking show format.  Plus Joel McHale is far less creepy than Matt Lucas.
Nailed It,"Yeah at first it was people who could at least get close.  Like you could at least usually see what the end goal was.

Now it is like, which slop mountain tastes the least bad.  I liked it better when it was more of an actual competition feel"
Nailed It,Gonna check this out. I'm on a cooking show binge
Nailed It,I love this show and everyone involved.
Nailed It,"This show is so stupid and I love every minute of it.

And Nicole Byer has the sort of overly loud personality that I usually hate but *I love her so much* it doesn't matter. She pulls it off and her chemistry with Jacques is legendary.

Just...everyone involved in this show is so great."
Nailed It,WES!!!
Nailed It,This show is a shot of pure serotonin into my brain
Nailed It,"This show is hilarious. I know it's not for everyone, but I love it for what it is. I'm glad Netflix has kept it going."
Nailed It,Yes!!! I love this show and Nicole Byer. But apparently she has a whole section of Reddit that hates her or something? At least that's what she said on Conan's podcast.
Nailed It,"Never heard of this show before, what is it about?"
Nailed It,Heck yeah. This show is great.
Nailed It,"Wow, I didn't realise reality TV could have that quick a turnaround."
Nailed It,I don't like reality style shows but my kids love it and Nicole Byer is dope
Nailed It,So excited for this to be back!
Nailed It,Fingers crossed for more Earwolf-adjacent guests this season too!
Nailed It,Show is just stupid fun to watch. I wish they wouldn't spoil the episode with the intro. And they could lower the levels of Nichole's mic a tiny bit. I still hear her right before I go to sleep.
Nailed It,"> This show is so stupid and I love every minute of it.

literally this, I usually can't stand cooking shows and I hate baking, but this show is just so dumb in all the right ways, also self-aware...that episode where the guest judge just like left to go pick up their kid from school? like...no words, this show is a trip and the perfect sunday hungover watch"
Nailed It,WHESS??
Nailed It,My sisters and I have the biggest crush on that guy
Nailed It,One of the few shows that makes me literally laugh out loud.
Nailed It,"She's a woman, black, and fat. Of course there's a substantial portion of reddit that hates her"
Nailed It,"I like her, but I know a few of my friends think she's over the top. She has a huge personality, that kind of thing tends to polarise a lot of people."
Nailed It,"Imagine one of those baking shows. But the people sucks at baking.

Basically /r/ExpectationVsReality"
Nailed It,They have home bakers try to make something really elaborate.
Nailed It,The Jason Mantzoukis episode was one of the funniest things I've ever seen on tv. The cameramen were laughing so hard that they were falling over.
Nailed It,yeah get the Doughboys on there!
Nailed It,You speak to my soul.
Nailed It,They better put the boys on it if they do
Nailed It,"I never noticed any spoiling in the intro. Do you mean when one of the judges shoots the money gun? Also, I would prefer they turn her mic UP."
Nailed It,"My favourite guest judge was the woman who went around the studio to take things home. Just never know what is going to happen next on this show, just utter chaos."
Nailed It,What happened to your hair!?
Nailed It,Not to mention outspoken about her identity and sexuality.
Nailed It,"That was kinda the gist of what she said. That sucks. She's pretty damn funny to me. Every time she has a really bad baked good, it's the best reaction. The spanish version is completely lacking her personality even if it's still fun to watch."
Nailed It,I almost didn't watch passed the first few episodes because her voice was so annoying and she was A LOT to watch. People I've had watch the show with me have had a hard time getting into it because she's really obnoxious. She definitely calmed down later in season 1 and season 2. So I think it may be for of her personality turning people off instead of her being a fat black woman.
Nailed It,"The genius is in the editing and the self joke at reality tv shows. 

""And now act all surprised like if you didn't know your family relative was gonna help you today!""."
Nailed It,"Other than the final challenge, most of the things I've seen on pinterest and literally thought to myself, I can make that. I probably can't because it's obviously harder than it looks."
Nailed It,That sounds like something I’d like to see. Any idea what season/episode that was?
Nailed It,We know Nick is a bit of heat seeker but is he a *Sweet* seeker? Find out this season on Nailed it!
Nailed It,"When they show the cakes they'll be doing. ""The show where they have to create *this*, but it ends up like *this*""."
Nailed It,She does that on Nailed It! Mexico as well
Nailed It,"Only knowing the Nailed It! show but not knowing much about her comedy, I was surprised to hear her talk so much about loving dicks and sex on Conan’s podcast"
Nailed It,That's the point of the show. You really need to be an artist to pull off the sculptures and what not.
Nailed It,"It’s from Nailed It: Holiday, episode 6."
Nailed It,Doesn’t help that they have bakers on who don’t bother reading instructions
Nailed It,"Awesome, thanks."
Nailed It,I love the guy who used salt instead of flour
Nailed It,"The girl who plays Ruth was amazing, too. She deserves an Emmy."
Nailed It,"Knocked it out of the park, or nailed it."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I've always thought that if it's dangerous enough, they should interview the person, rewrite the answers so their mannerisms don't show, and have an actor read it while being disguised."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I’ve wondered about this as well.  Not just for drugs/scam etc. cases but for informants and whistleblowers too. 

For example, if someone was a mob informant on a documentary and covers their face, I think people they knew for years would probably realize their identity from their body shape, gestures, or style of dressing."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I've asked someone familiar with such things, and his answer was there are certain topics that involve very dangerous people and they might be willing to answer some questions, but only thru a trusted intermediary (who is also trusted by the crew).  Often they won't meet the subject at all simply because it is far too dangerous to do so. 

Some interviews are on paper only, or they might be audio recordings. The questions are often laid out ahead of time, with restrictions on certain topics/lines of questioning which allows the interviewer to know how far they can press with follow up questions.  This is especially helpful if there is a language barrier, as the intermediary will also be an interpreter and will know when to shut down a question without translating it.

The responses are then acted out, blurred video/masks and distorted audio. This allows for the interviewee to speak a little more freely then they would if being recorded, and also allows some level of plausible deniability should the interviewer get pressed by authorities over who they met and where they met them. Plus, it means that anyone who tries to correct the footage (descrambling the video, adjusting the brightness, or correcting the audio) isn't actually going to unmask the interview subject."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I have interviewed a lot of informants and also did a major  newspaper series about a couple who were living in the Witness Protection Program. 

""Reformed"" criminals go from exciting adrenalized lives to anonymity in podunk towns and a decent number of them simply get bored and want attention. 

They also delude themselves that they will get paid enough to be consultants on other projects as a result of coming forward and they can spin those gigs into being some kind of producer themselves. 

Also I don't know what the percentages are for how many remain on the straight and narrow under their new identities but the ones I dealt with all ended up getting their hands dirty again.

Bear in mind that if these were criminal geniuses, they probably wouldn't need witness protection."
Bad Guys: Vile City,some of them are fake... most maybe?? i remember watching one a while back which featured my home country. it was a mix of obviously fake interviews and *seemingly* genuine ones.
Bad Guys: Vile City,https://youtu.be/vJki8XXqVws
Bad Guys: Vile City,"With money and ""bad guys"" like to brag about their crimes so they can have what called clout or street cred. For a whistleblower or informate it's to get the truth out there."
Bad Guys: Vile City,">illegal trade so how much can they be getting paid to make it worth the risk of death should they be recognized??

but they're not ""unrecognized"" IRL are they? so is there really any additional risk compared to ""day to day life"" in the illegal drug trade?

&#x200B;

i don't think ""nat-geo"" does anything more than record evidence that could be used against them.. (the cops are not UNAWARE of their IRL identities, either).

&#x200B;

risk of getting shot already exists.

risk of getting arrested already exists.

not sure risk is that much worse."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Y'all do understand that Pyromaniacs have been known to have orgasms at the scene of the fire they set themselves, right?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,I guess some use proxy
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Some UK shows announce that was done. I assume the rest, and some US shows, do it but don’t say."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Yeah, there is no way those people would ever go onto television as themselves. Besides a persons stature, the mannerisms and speech patterns alone would be enough to recognize a person well known within their networks."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Exactly. It's SO risky for them, what's the incentive?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,I dont think you're right here. They could be putting themselves in more jeopardy especially if they were like moles or informants that infiltrated drug rings or whatever may have you. I think its more about what they say that will be more dangerous for them after the video ends because someone always knows someone.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"It seemed to be another NBC sitcom that thrived because of its initial time slot between Seinfeld and ER. When it switched nights, it did well enough to make it to syndication but wasn’t anything spectacular. MadTV also did a pretty funny sketch called “Test Pattern”, making fun of NBC’s Thursday night 9:30 shows. 

Early on, they started every episode with a brief animation related to the episode. Then they switched to the cold open with the really generic sax theme song.

EDIT: I forgot to add forced relationships are an NBC sitcom staple dating back to Sam and Diane."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Turning a running-joke character relationship dynamic into a romance is one of the most desperate “jumping the shark” gambits, and more often than not sounds the death knell for a show. See also: Frasier, The Nanny, and arguably even Friends."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Hmm- I don’t recall that show EVER having potential.
Bad Guys: Vile City,All I remember is Lea Thompson was a smoke show from way back
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I did, but I personally wasn't a big fan of it. I thought it was more style over substance (some lines seemed taken straight from memes that are popular in Italy and I couldn't help but cringe). Definitely above average when compared to most Italian shows (which is not surprising since our public TV is still very much into soap operas with low production values), but at the end of the day it's yet another TV show about mafia, and our TV is over saturated with mafia shows.

Loved Slevin by the way, it was totally unpredictable and fun."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Yes I watched and I loved it
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Tell me more., I'm not seeing it in Canada"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"That makes sense. I'm watching in the US so that now makes me curious how the show has been received in Italy vs other places. 

For us it was more of a fun watch for the same reasons I might watch a show like Only Murders in the Building."
Bad Guys: Vile City,I haven't watched this show in years but the theme song has never left my head lol
Bad Guys: Vile City,Says content unavailable to me.
Bad Guys: Vile City,What about Hangtime?
Bad Guys: Vile City,Wow tubi also had one world
Bad Guys: Vile City,Do Hangtime and California Dreams.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"its been on there for about 2 months. one world has been on there since this week i believe. how can i request to get hang time, sk8, just deal, name your adventure, all about us and running the halls on there?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,why the hell did they remove city guys from tubi? i'm big mad right now !!!!
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Is this the ""C. I. T. Y. You can see why"" song?

I have a vague recollection of it being on Trouble channel in the UK. Can't remember anything about it but the second I read the post that tune sprung into my brain"
Bad Guys: Vile City,I still sing it to myself. Can't remember much else from the show.
Bad Guys: Vile City,Are you in the USA?  If so are you using a VPN?  Cause Tubi does not cooperate with VPN's like at all.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Not on there yet, but I did contact Tubi requesting that show to be added."
Bad Guys: Vile City,They did?  Sucks that it's not there anymore.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I contacted Tubi and requested Hang Time soon after I found out about City Guys, here's hoping they listen."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"“C. I. T. Y. You can see why” has been stuck
In my head for YEARS"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Yeah apparently seasons 1 and 2 aired in the UK(as that's where the uploads of those seasons on Youtube are from).

And yes that is the song."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I am not in USA, so I think I'll give up on watching this. Thanks for the reply."
Bad Guys: Vile City,It's still there but not all the episodes. Bummer
Bad Guys: Vile City,Don't forget malibu ca and usa high!
Bad Guys: Vile City,City guys POSE! those looks and street clothes...
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Ah OK, a bunch of episodes are on Youtube."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Yeah I saw there's only a few episodes there, I contacted Tubi about putting the rest of them on."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Someone told me that all of the episodes are actually on there(except for 2x11 for some reason, though that one is thankfully floating around online already) they just simply do not display correctly."
Bad Guys: Vile City,and California Dreams!
Bad Guys: Vile City,Usa high was repeated last year in the uk so wonder if someone capped them?
Bad Guys: Vile City,Thanks I'll check YouTube.
Bad Guys: Vile City,They are missing episodes of city guy and the synopsis is out of order for most of the episodes in season 3 and 4 and 5. Please have them fix that.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"The only episode of City Guys I can find that's missing is the season 3 episode ""Party Like it's 1999""(though seeing as that's a clip show episode I don't consider it's absence a big loss especially seeing as it's on Youtube anyways)I did notice the synopsis being out of order in season one, as one of the synopses is for an episode that i'm pretty sure does not actually exist called ""The Movie""(I did some research on this and looked at the page for the series on the old TV Tome website via Wayback and that episode was the only one to have no synopsis or anything, not even a production code, and the synopsis that's there now wasn't added until the 10s, which is highly suspect to say the least, so I think someone submitted a fake episode on there by mistake and every website since then has been piggybacking off that one, this kind of thing isn't unheard of as the Nick show Kablam had a fake episode listed for years that people swore was real).

I will try and ask them about fixing the synopsis and see if they can put in that one episode."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Lol the synopsis is out of order for episodes in season 3,4 and 5. Tell them to go through all the synopsises for all episodes to make sure they are correct. And im pretty sure more than 1 epsiode is missing,unless they added more episodes. Idk tho i haven't watched city guys in a couple weeks to confirm."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I think they did add more episodes, because I remember someone last month mentioned the episodes ""Dance Fever"" and ""Subway Confessions"" were missing, but I watched Dance Fever on there a few days ago and Subway Confessions appears to be on there.

I did mention to them about the synopsis being out of order so we'll see if they fix it."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Bingo! Those are the titles i remember specifically! I emailed them and I asked them specifically to put all tnbc/peter engel shows on there lol
Bad Guys: Vile City,I know I am late but I just found out about City Guys being on Tubi like 2 days ago since I am not really on it I just recently started watching things on it again I am hype they have it  also the episode missing from City Guys is The Movie that episode is not present at all so maybe someone can email Tubi about it.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Bad Guys: Vile City,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Bad Guys: Vile City,This was a great read.
Bad Guys: Vile City,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Bad Guys: Vile City,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Bad Guys: Vile City,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Bad Guys: Vile City,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Delta state was the shit!
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Bad Guys: Vile City,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Bad Guys: Vile City,It was on both actually
Bad Guys: Vile City,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Bad Guys: Vile City,what happened to the constantine sequel that Peter Stormare posted an instagram about? Like he was returning to his character or something
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Will it be Con-stan-teen or Con-stan-tIne, though?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,I was so incredibly happy until I read the description. I want Matt Ryan to have his own show again :(
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Ryan is legit perfect as Constantine.  No disrespect to whoever else they may pick, but Ryan nails it.  He can do serious moments and lighthearted, as shown on Legends."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"My reaction was ""Oh!..... oh..."""
Bad Guys: Vile City,"So they had Matt Ryan which was the perfect casting then got HBO max so they can make a proper adaptation. DC is like no let’s make him young, no religious elements ( it’s called hellblazer) and do everything opposite. Why can’t you just keep the guy that works and actually make a HBO level hellblazer."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"So he'll be young, from London, won't look like Sting, and there'll be no religious elements. Why not just create a new character at that point?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Was hyped until I read that Matt Ryan wasn’t involved. 

Fucks sake"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"JJ Abrams but no Matt Ryan? Well that's an almost guarnteed shit pile.

Look the NBC show with Matt Ryan was actually pretty good. Just do that but make it rated R and let it get real fucked up and gory. Boom there you go. Done. Give me a producer credit."
Bad Guys: Vile City,">>The character is set to be cast as a diverse lead, a departure from the  one played by Matt Ryan in the NBC series, which aired for one season  between 2014 and 2015.

Also a departure from the actual character in the comics, why not mention that?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"It's impressive how Hollywood just constantly finds ways to repeat the same mistakes over and over and to bail on the few times when they happen to nail it (like with casting). Make him young? ""Diverse"" casting? Dumping Matt Ryan (literally perfection for the character). Changing the character (no longer an exorcist, series will be horror, seemingly no religion elements)... 

I mean, it'd be surprising if it wasn't so incredibly predictable. Hollywood gonna Hollywood."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Even the animated DC universe movies acknowledged Matt Ryan as Constantine. For continuity sake, just let the man play him. And what does ""diverse lead"" mean anyway?"
Bad Guys: Vile City,"“A diverse lead”

So not Constantine, then."
Bad Guys: Vile City,Who is better at fucking up things you love - JJ Abrams or Alex Kurtzman?
Bad Guys: Vile City,Oh cool another franchise for JJ to ruin
Bad Guys: Vile City,">The character is set to be cast as a diverse lead, a departure from the  one played by Matt Ryan in the NBC series, which aired for one season  between 2014 and 2015.

Not interested without Ryan."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"Dumping religious elements? Horror centric? “Diverse” lead? No matt Ryan?

Why keep the Constantine name exactly? 

At least I applaud the transparency, so I won’t be bothered to watch it."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"One of the few, if not the only, mainstream Northern English Superhero is going to become a Londoner in a move that is supposed to make him a ""more diverse"" character. 

Because of course if there is one area of England that is lacking representation it is London... For god sake Liverpool is one of the most diverse cities in the UK, if you want to have a non-white casting then you can still, easily, have the character still be scouse, and you can certainly have him be northern. 

Hell considering how much of the magical lore is often based in Christianity, a young British-Asian Constantine would be a great way to expand the mythology, and I would be entirely in favour. As long as he's from Liverpool or Newcastle or Leeds etc. But don't turn the one Northern superhero into a Londoner DC. Please."
Bad Guys: Vile City,"If JJ is involved, it’ll be hollow trash. Trailers will look great. Art design will sell the hype. Story design & forethought will be nonexistent. 

JJ is equivalent of the Chinese manufacturing of toys. The commercial will grab you. The box will be an outstanding vision of imagination. Inside will be a mass produced piece of plastic with the ink already starting to fade. “Instant trash!”"
Bad Guys: Vile City,Not interested if it's not Matt Ryan
Bad Guys: Vile City,[removed]
Bad Guys: Vile City,"""a diverse lead""??

Wtf that mean"
Bad Guys: Vile City,Oh God. JJs gonna ruin it.
Bad Guys: Vile City,J.J Abrams? Fuck that
Girls Incarcerated,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Girls Incarcerated,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Girls Incarcerated,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Girls Incarcerated,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Girls Incarcerated,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Girls Incarcerated,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Girls Incarcerated,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Girls Incarcerated,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Girls Incarcerated,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Girls Incarcerated,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."
Girls Incarcerated,"I loved DP, Welcome to Utmark, and Anna"

Girls Incarcerated,That Arcane isn’t on this list is really sad - but each to their own!

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Girls Incarcerated,Yellowjackets?
Girls Incarcerated,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Girls Incarcerated,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Girls Incarcerated,Why?
Girls Incarcerated,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Girls Incarcerated,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Girls Incarcerated,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Girls Incarcerated,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Girls Incarcerated,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Girls Incarcerated,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Girls Incarcerated,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Girls Incarcerated,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Girls Incarcerated,Ted Lasso anybody?
Girls Incarcerated,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Girls Incarcerated,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Girls Incarcerated,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Girls Incarcerated,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Girls Incarcerated,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Girls Incarcerated,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Girls Incarcerated,Nordic shows are great
Girls Incarcerated,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Girls Incarcerated,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Girls Incarcerated,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Girls Incarcerated,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Girls Incarcerated,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Girls Incarcerated,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Girls Incarcerated,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Girls Incarcerated,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
Best Lover,I don't understand why so few people are talking about this series when it's some of the best tv/movie out at the moment. It's barely even mentioned in the 'what are you watching' sticky threads.
Best Lover,Is there a reason I can't find the small axe series on dutch Amazon prime? It's An original right?
Best Lover,"Yep, can't recommend this highly enough. The first two in the series have been excellent. *Lover's Rock* was hypnotic and the best thing I've seen all year. Tomorrow's episode stars John Boyega, so very much looking forward to that."
Best Lover,"It's not available to watch legally in Canada until some time next year. Which sucks, because Mangrove (only one I've seen so far) is fantastic."
Best Lover,It's a fantastic show but as far as I can tell can only legally be watched in a few countries. Not sure why Amazon didn't buy full international rights.
Best Lover,"It's a BBC series, and available on BBC iPlayer, if you have any way to access it."
Best Lover,I'm assuming a lot of people on here are from either the US or the UK so why is it getting ignored by them.
Best Lover,"My comment history in the past few days is filled with this show because I genuinely enjoyed it and discussing theories, jokes etc. brings me joy. Yet I still haven't devoted time to write so many words. 

Why are you wasting your time on things that do not bring you joy? The original trilogy was also a fanfiction. Arwen saving Frodo is 100% something only a fanfiction writer could come up with. Yet now it is a beloved part of an alternate retelling of the story. If the show could fill vast blanks of space of the Second Age with similar 'fanfictions' I am fine with it. In fact for like 90% of what I was seeing in the first episodes, I was fine with it as well. You should just let it go. Find things that makes you happy."
Best Lover,"I appreciate the sentiment. But the people enjoying the show, the general casual viewer, hasn’t taken a second thought why anyone else doesn’t enjoy it. Most people accept some people like things and others don’t. Most humans are too selfish to give pause to a differing opinion and in this case it’s so trivial who cares? It’s a tv show. Like it. Don’t like it. No one cares except for a those share the same viewpoint or are toxic and looking to argue over trivial matters."
Best Lover,This would all be valid criticism if we weren't 2 episodes into a 5 season story. But we're only 2 episodes in. This could all still go either way.
Best Lover,Reason being that some people *live* to use the internet to shit on new content.
Best Lover,"As someone who is enjoying the show, I actually really appreciate this explanation. And the argument is totally valid. To each their own 🙂

PS: the hobbit movie genuinely angered me"
Best Lover,Lol so many words for a thing you don’t like - learn to value your time m8
Best Lover,"I think you really like complaining about the show, looking at your history. A little too much, actually, it's not healthy to spend so much time on something trivial and not enriching your life. That's not to say you don't have some valid points, I didn't love the first episode but I didn't hate it and I'll be hanging in there because I dig the genre."
Best Lover,I haven't even read your post and I don't really care about it either. Can't the mods just limit posts about this show? Most of them have extremely toxic comment sections and it's just the same shit over and over again. Like can't the mods make a thread to discuss this? For the last few days it's just been posts about this show.
Best Lover,"They most definitely could have made a decent LOTR show and they still might - but only if they change course for season 2.

You are right - Galadriel as the main character is not working.  She comes across as an arrogant brat at times, nothing at all what Tolkien wrote.  You have to have a likeable lead and atm she is far from likeable.  

There are also a few issues i have with characters appearing when they shouldn't, or where the casting is off - and i am not talking about race swapping.  Galadriel for example is Celebrimbor's aunt and is portrayed by a 25 yo while Celebrimbor looks 70.  Just small things that break immersion.

I still have hope for the show though."
Best Lover,Amazon decided they weren’t serious about quality story telling the moment they decided to hire show runners and head writers whose sole credit was part of the committee that wrote Star Trek: Beyond.
Best Lover,After reading most of this to me it just sounds like y'all needa get of Tolkien's dick. 🤷‍♂️
Best Lover,"What made LotR movies good was that they threw out a lot of what Tolkien wrote and made a good movie.

What made the Hobbit bad was that they told the story Tolkien wrote and it is stupid.  It is a child's story with Bilbo taking the place of the child in the story.  The dwarves are near idiots and no one else is much smarter."
Best Lover,"My 2 oldest brothers lived on the books. I was much younger than they were & would always go & check out their ""library"" & try to read through these volumes.   Never made it through. Not to say I didn't love books, love them. And quite a many that my oldest brother & I share. Funny thing is, my two oldest brothers-one loved the movies(LoTR), the other thought they were crap. I loved them, never having made it through the books.  I think you're generalizing every other individual's likes or dislikes. If it were that easy, & it was accurate-don't you think there would be far more success in creating these movies/tv series?"
Best Lover,"Because I find it valuable to discuss art and how you feel about it, even art that you don't really like. 

Passionate criticism is not anathema to good art, in fact no passion at all is probably the worst possible outcome."
Best Lover,That's why my post is directed at people who say they can't understand why some people don't like it and to explain why.
Best Lover,"It's also written by someone who decided they didn't like it before one second of the show was aired.

> many of us were never going to like this show

That says it all right there. The whole post OP made sounds like someone trying to justify being on Team I Hate This."
Best Lover,What?
Best Lover,"Hey, I'm glad you are enjoying it. Don't let anyone take away from that."
Best Lover,[deleted]
Best Lover,"I have made [another reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/x52jeh/lotr_the_rings_of_power_forges_biggest_premiere/imyxlwb/?context=3) somewhere about the lore changes. Summary: there was nothing negatively surprising, the show marketed itself to fans with no misdirection and fans have received what they hoped or feared they'd receive.

So I do agree that if you had decided this was not for you before the show aired, the show wouldn't have provided a thing that would have changed your mind."
Best Lover,"No one is going to take you seriously because you're judging a book based on the first few pages. Reserve your judgment until you see where it's going.

> Seeing how they chose to introduce the world, its characters, and seeing the newly invented scenes and listening to the dialogue, I'm afraid they failed at the monumental task that was set for them.

This is ridiculously premature judgment."
Best Lover,I understand. Those people don’t care.
Best Lover,"I despite how much reddit criticism is based on this thinking.

Or people who claim they hate it fairly but you can see were intensely negative prior to release. 

It's like people don't understand hating something before it comes out invalidates your opinion on it"
Best Lover,"I hate fucking teams, man. It sucks you think that of me, someone you don't even know. Teams are the whole reason why everything on the internet gets polarized and people upvote/downvote based on if they agree or not, instead of if the post is attempting meaningful discussion and is not trolling or just flat out false information. Evidently you are only allowed to have an opinion of the show if it's a positive one.

I didn't say I decided I didn't like it before watching it. In fact, I really wanted to like it. I gave my reasons why I thought disliking it was almost inevitable, but also gave specific reasons why I thought many of the writing decisions were not good and how it could have been better.

I'm still going to keep watching it, and I hope I'm wrong. Because I want to like it."
Best Lover,"Well it’s only two episodes in, so I reserve the right to unleash my hatred as the season progresses. But seriously, I totally get your point. I’ve seen plenty of book and manga adaptations. Filler is usually pretty garbage. Let’s hope this is one of the exceptions."
Best Lover,Especially in a race that lives for thousands of years.
Best Lover,Totally agree. That doesn't mean it's not worth discussing.
Best Lover,"You specifically said you were never going to like it.

I did not shut down dialogue, you did. I also never said you are only allowed to have an opinion if it's positive. You were clearly butthurt about this show before it ever aired, whereas I have no opinion because I have not yet watched it.

It's hilarious that you complain about polarization, and yet, this is you

> many of us were never going to like this show

> Tolkien fans agree on why these movies were vastly inferior to the original trilogy

> Tolkien, a literary giant and one of the undisputed masters of the fantasy genre

So, point 1, you pre-decided.

Point 2, I agree but your tone is implicit bias and more or less says if you like those movies, you aren't a fan. There is a big different between ""I thought the movies were poorly made and didn't hold up to the previous trilogy"" and ""fans agree this is garbage"".

Point 3. I dispute it whole heartedly. I found the LOTR books to be really boring. I think he had a fantastic imagination, he knew how to create compelling narratives, but his prose I found to be just boring and overblown and overstuffed. The fact that the movies excised a lot of material and much of it was not missed supports my point. Generally, when the story ends, you should stop the book and not continue for another 300 pages. 

YOU made biased implications. YOU inferred people aren't real fans if they liked it. YOU made this a team based discussion."
Best Lover,">I found the LOTR books to be really boring.

Well, there we go. That's all I needed to hear. The show is good for people who found LoTR boring. Pretty much the entire premise of my post. Really nothing else to say to each other past that point. Have a nice one."
Best Lover,"Right. I must not be a real fan, which is why I will like the show. 

Keep playing for that team.

Edit: Plus, you claimed you were interested in actual discussion, but when I dared go against the one true opinion, you don't want to talk. You don't want a conversation, you want an echo chamber."
Best Lover,I really enjoyed the first two seasons and then it went off the rails for me.
Best Lover,"I enjoyed the show up to its end. Say what you will about the final three seasons, but they were not quite as repetitive as the conflicts that kept repeating themselves in the first four years. The body-swapping and time-jumping reinvigorated the series in my opinion. Season 5 also introduced Diyoza, who was one of the best characters in the entire series, and I found the Blood Reina stuff also fairly interesting. What I personally liked about The 100 was that the show was always willing to get very dark, whether that's characters committing genocide or eating human flesh.

The Bellamy thing in the final season is likely impacted by some behind the scenes stuff with the actor, same way as Lexa had to die when the actress became unavailable. Personally, I also wouldn't say that The 100 was a character-driven show. It was primarily a plot-driven show. That is why characters like Bellamy shifted alliances various times through the series, not because it made sense for the character, but because the plot required it."
Best Lover,"The sky people vs grounders conflict kept me invested for the first half of the show. When that conflict resolved my interest started to dip. 

It was almost like the creators thought there had to be 2 warring factions at any given time. Oh grounders and sky people are living under the same roof? Here's some space prisoners. Space prisoners and former characters escaped earth together? Here's some body swappers."
Best Lover,"The last episode was crap, but otherwise I enjoyed all seasons."
Best Lover,"We've seen the seasons leading up to prima fyre.  We started the season after that with the prisoners crashing to Earth.

This season feels too much like a reboot.  Like most of the past doesn't matter anymore and they are wholesale introducing new characters.  I've just lost interest."
Best Lover,"The 100's greatest sin was how it killed off some of its biggest characters 


Spoilers ahead, I get that Lexa's actor had to be killed off because she got a leading role in Fear the Walking Dead and couldn't do both parts, but the way it happened was not good. The same goes for Bellamy. He died for no reason and it all ended up feeling like a very cheap way to shook the audience


The first season was a bit too much teen drama for my taste, but the show kept me interested throughout all its seasons. The final season didn't go down in history as the ""best final season ever"", but it was good enough. 


The 100 is also some of the darkest and most brutal shows I've seen om American network TV. I don't know how they managed to keep the TV-14 rating on all the episodes. Some of them had some seriously mature content"
Best Lover,i didn't make it past season2 IIRC. it started strong but i feel that they took a left turn with the concept
Best Lover,I would say to the end of season 5 was fine even if this season wasn't up to par with the rest. Season 6 was the nail in the coffin for the series with the Sanctuary storyline. The final episodes tried to fix the last couple of seasons but by this time it was to late. Was the final eradication of the valley a Earth apocalypse or just the valley? If it was the valley only why not travel somewhere to the other side of Earth?
Best Lover,"The first season was increasingly good as it went on, season 2 was excellent, and then it completely fell apart in season 3 with horrendous writing full of plotholes and characters not acting according to their established characterization, forcefully writing in scenes purely for shock value regardless of how it hampered the plot or wrote them into a corner, expanding worldbuilding in spots only to fail in filling it out afterwards, leaving it shallow and at times nonsensical. It only got worse from there on out, even after they rebooted and effectively gave themselves something of a clean slate. It somehow managed to even get worse instead of them figuring out how not to repeat past mistakes.

It's not surprising when the behind the scenes stuff leaked that the showrunner's grudges were ruining the writing room's work, with Rothenberg sometimes axing whole scenes last minute, cutting out all the lines for some characters even if that material would have made the scenes worthwhile, etc. (one clear example is Ricky Whittle's character Lincoln, but there have been other characters impacted similarly)"
Best Lover,[deleted]
Best Lover,"Eh I loved pretty much the entire series, despite its flaws lol.  I generally felt s6  was better than most of s5. The ending was dogshit, to the point that it was almost comical lol.  Still one of my all time faves tho."
Best Lover,"The 100 was my favorite CW show until Season 5. The heart of it was them dealing with the Grounders, once they all became one tribe it was all downhill there.

Season 5 was bad, especially when it came to Octavia. Season 6 was good but it should’ve ended with the Primes going away and them truly getting a fresh start to end the series. Instead we got Season 7 which was a real disaster, that finale was one of the worst I’ve ever seen.

I need to rewatch it soon and I like those later seasons better now."
Best Lover,Every subsequent season of this show miraculously made the previous season look genius by comparison..
Best Lover,"too long; didn’t read

But I did watch six seasons and it was a complete turd. Truly the worst thing I’ve suffered (and often laughed) through."
Best Lover,"Was that the show where they were literally killing people off in the first episodes on the planet, where everyone had lots of things like assault rifles, and where their ""survival"" for even 24 hours was in question because they were so useless and at war with each other from the start and didn't have the brains to properly defend and/or move?

I got pissed off with it very quickly, because it was similar to a story I'd had in my head since I was a kid, and it started off (for a very short time) as really promising and pretty much the same story, and within literally one or two episodes (less than 24 hours of ""real"" time) it just was about blowing each other away and being in a war that was totally avoidable.

I couldn't work out if it was a kid's thing or a teenager thing or an adult's thing.  It was too pathetic for any one category in any given episode."
Best Lover,"Up to season five, the show was fine. It declined after season 3, but it was still serviceable. And they could have stopped it there. There was even a nice ending for it.

But then season six happened, and I wanna die. That season (and season 7) were so abysmally terrible that I cannot for the life of me recommend them to my worst enemy."
Best Lover,This is true for most cw shows
Best Lover,[deleted]
Best Lover,I didnt like some bits of it but overall was good
Best Lover,"I read a few of the books - which were good.
I watched the first few seasons but stopped. I saw prima fyre and then stopped watching."
Best Lover,"I also enjoyed it, but I think it went the same way as other sci-fi shows. Gets better each season, peaks, tries to switch up drastically to keep audience engaged but ultimately fails. In the end, it embraced the wackiness and went off the rails, but it remained good fun."
Best Lover,"I actually really enjoyed the entire thing. I can recognize that people will find the final season controversial. But for me it drove home the themes of the show and wrapped up some of the dangling threads from earlier seasons. It's not a perfect show, but it took risks. And I'll take that any day over a show with a writing team that just phones it in."
Best Lover,The last season still makes no sense to me after a few watches
Best Lover,The last two seasons were just a crappy Stargate SG-1 ripoff.
Best Lover,"Season 4 was the perfect ending but thankfully the later seasons didn’t ruin the earlier ones, like some other shows…"
Best Lover,[deleted]
Best Lover,Lasted too long
Best Lover,"What!? Some pople actually liked The 100?

Whats wrong with you?"
Best Lover,"That’s pretty much exactly where I bailed on the show. It mixed teen drama, post apocalypse, and sci-fi pretty well. You’re absolutely right about it treating the audience like adults."
Best Lover,More and more I’m just watching the first season of something and then moving onto something else
Best Lover,"I don't like season 5 but season 4 ending was not a proper ending for the show, season 5 ending was the perfect point even if the season itself was lackluster.

Though, even though I don't like the real ending of the show I find it admiring. It is such an anime/manga ending, it was refreshing on that regard. Western shows don't go that crazy with their endings usually."
Best Lover,Never watched it because I was and still am pissed about The 4400
Best Lover,"Five was fine, they should have quit while they were ahead. I’ll defend Book 1 all day and say Book 2 needed to be all about Cadogan and more spaceship visiting those colonies without portals. Spin-off attempt was a mistake, couple critical errors in B2 means it’s never getting watched again, again"
Best Lover,I feel like this can be said for majority of The CW shows they are great or good for about 1-5 seasons and then they should have ended or been canceled.
Best Lover,I’ve been trying to finish it up but it just keeps changing directions.
Best Lover,"I enjoyed it to until Season 2 or 3.  I forget which.  It started very CW teen drama show, then improved.  Then I felt became way to teen drama again.

But it was good for a CW show.  Shorter seasons really helped."
Best Lover,My people
Best Lover,"Huh? Some of the best moments in that show were way after Season 2 and I think the reviews reflect that.

Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8rPw2V_Vg)."
Best Lover,I'm pretty bummed they didn't pick up the prequel
Best Lover,"Its the CW. 

nothing else to add.

I both happy and sad they didnt pick up the B5 pilot."
Best Lover,"God awful????? What are you smoking??? Smallville(although didnt start on cw), Arrow, flash, legends of tomorrow, supergirl, the 100, Nikita, supernatural, originals, TVD, charmed, beauty and the  beast, izombie, black lightning, containment. All great shows!!. 

Ones that were great that sadly cancelled/ended too soon are: frequency, Valor, tomorrow people. 

As for the 100 id more so say it got bad mid season 6+"
Best Lover,"Um you could maybe say that season 7 was a step back but everything up to then was awesome. I am one of the  less heard parts of the extremely toxic fanbase that actually thinks that season 5 would have been a terrible place to end the show. There simply were way too many plot points and un resolved character conflicts (Octavia and Kane/Abby) for the show to end there. Same with season 4, you can't tell me you didn't want to see what happened to those in the bunker. I think ultimately the reason why the very vocal fans scream that the show should have ended after season 5 is because of the tonal shift away from the central themes of 1-5. 6 is still dark but it does feel like a slightly different show with how colorful Sanctum is, but just it's different does not make it bad. The main conflict went from being Clarke and friends against some big bad and ended up as Clarke and friends against each other because of the shifting priorities in season 5. And this bled into seasons 6-7.

Also, the fandom is what creating the shipping. This is not nor was it ever about who gets with whom. This was a survival, sci-fi television show. Frankly the shipping in The 100 fandom drove all of us non-shippers insane. We actually got to discuss interesting topics about life, ethics, and morality before all the shipping took over everything. 

Season 7 was still good. There were just some writing decisions I didn't like. As for Bellamy's death, I honestly couldn't see his story ending any other way. All the death and violence around him really messed him up. He thought he was saving his friends, and he was, and he did. Also I applaud you for mentioning him dying because of Madi, but Madi gave herself up without knowledge of how far Cadogan would go. Clarke shooting him was for the same reason she left him to die in season 5, he chose his priorities over his promise to protect Madi."
Best Lover,"I enjoyed the whole show. From start to end. I was actually depressed when it ended, after that many season I was fully invested."
Best Lover,Season 7 episode 4 might have been the best episode tho
Best Lover,"Same sentiment for me, I watched those first two seasons eagerly week to week and was pleasantly surprised again and again. Season 3 hit and I struggled to keep up but eventually sat down and finished it after it aired but it was a grind. A couple of episodes in to s4 I couldn't watch anymore, just felt like a drastic drop off when compared to the first two."
Best Lover,"I totally agree.  I honestly watched it because it was mostly filmed 20 minutes from me , which I found cool , and the leads were hot.  But it was a good story and interesting , I kind of wish , now , that I stuck with it for a bit longer after hearing some stuff about it."
Best Lover,After season 2 it became soft core porn.
Best Lover,I wholeheartedly agree
Best Lover,"The minute the AI showed up at the end of S2, my expectations tempered for S3. I was subsequently disappointed by s3, held on until s4, and finally gave up. It was apparent it was going to keep hitting the same beats over and over again. Should have stopped after S2, when it peaked."
Best Lover,I love how the slow time planet got used as a prison. Like the same cabin could serve hundreds of years worth of sentences and never have two groups there !
Best Lover,Diyoza was a wonderful character and I sincerely hope that actress gets more work. She helped create someone you hated for a season in a half and then became an empathetic individual.
Best Lover,"Yeah, though there are character based reasons for Bellamy shifting loyalties so much. Most of the vitriol toward the show is because the fans perceived his death as pointless because Clarke killed him over Madi's sketchbook that she didn't end up getting (the running out of ammo thing was a bit tropey) when the whole point was the tragedy of shifting priorities. After season 4, their whole dynamic was totally different because they were no longer on the same page"
Best Lover,"The last season was pure ""fuck it hold my beer"" and I appreciate that"
Best Lover,"I know, the show felt like a reboot after season five, that killed my interest in the show. A thing about the show that bugged me, was previous major characters who died not matter to the characters or the show anymore, there a few exceptions like Lexa, Lincoln, Monty, and Jasper But I think Roan and Gabriel a king and the man who introduced the anomaly (a confusing plot point in season 6), who are both leaders who did what was best for their people, would be remembered and celebrated by the characters but by the next episode they are just forgotten about, like their choices didn't help the characters."
Best Lover,"Bellamy died for the same reason Clarke left him behind, he chose to put himself between Clarke and her priorities after he had already betrayed her twice. It's very consistent with her character and it really messed her up. Do you wish we could have gotten more time to see her deal with that though."
Best Lover,"This was true for me too. My sister in law recommended it to me and my wife. From the start I found the show tolerable at best, but my wife enjoyed it. But I started finding the show just worse and worse as the season progressed. They turned the most level headed character into an incredible irrational idiot until it got him killed. Then the whole plot line with the mountain people was just dumb. Why hold the people captive? Why not ask for volunteers for the marrow, or whatever the hell it was they were trying to forcibly extract? Sure it would take longer to reach your end goal, but you wouldn't have to be an evil bastard in the process.

After the season was over I told my wife I was done."
Best Lover,"I agree completely with it being good through season 5 and then falling off a cliff. One of the best qualities about The 100 was its ability to not look cheap despite being on a CW budget. Season 5 was the first season where you could tell there had been cuts or they had stretched their budget too thin but the overall storyline was good enough I could get past it. 

Then of course you had seasons 6 and 7 that seemed to have sets supplied by a dollar store and the story was garbage, there was no coming back from that."
Best Lover,The valley was the last green place on Earth
Best Lover,The Eartb was pretty much dead and gone after season 4. Just the valley. After season 5 there was nothing left. Add in the time dilation from the black hole in season 6 and 7 as well as the 125 year time skip in cryo and you cod see how it might possibly be back to being livable again.
Best Lover,The only thing we actually have evidence for is Ricky Whittle. Everything else is conjecture
Best Lover,Just because your expectations were subverted in season 3 doesn't mean that it was done for shock value
Best Lover,"Tbf, the only people who did transcend were those who weren't main characters. Except for Madi, every living main cast member chose to be with Clarke knowing full well they would be going to their eventual death."
Best Lover,"wanheda on the red button again, killing immortal space jesus. :D"
Baby Ballroom,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Baby Ballroom,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Baby Ballroom,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Baby Ballroom,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Baby Ballroom,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Baby Ballroom,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

Baby Ballroom,"Tbh heard some bad things about Prince of Tennis especially with the super powers on display, tried to aim more towards the grounded shows."
Baby Ballroom,"Yeah there's tons more football ones, it actually gets a bit overwhelming so thought I'd limit it to the more interesting ones. Personally I found Clean Freak! to be really hard to watch."

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."

The Lady in Dignity,Stunt people get hurt all the time. That’s what we pay them definitely not enough for.
The Lady in Dignity,"I dont have an answer but thanks for reminding me of Raising Hope, Ill need to binge it again soon."
The Lady in Dignity,"Just watched it. Not a doctor, so I don’t know, but that fall looked rough. The stiff arms seemed to happen really fast, but maybe that’s normal. I hope they were ok."
The Lady in Dignity,Looks like she's wearing a soft helmet under the wig.
The Lady in Dignity,"If anyone wants to see the scene, Raising Hope is on Hulu."
The Lady in Dignity,Jeez this gave me chills
The Lady in Dignity,"i hear ya, but this seems like a monumentally simple thing to fix. 

fall frontwards, lay a mat down, change the camera angle, etc etc"
The Lady in Dignity,"thats what i thought too. 

i figured if it was a stunt fall (which i am sure it was), there would have been some protections in place to make sure the head didnt slam onto concrete."
The Lady in Dignity,"interesting, didnt think of that! I will rewatch and take a look. 

seems like the helmet didnt do too great of a job"
The Lady in Dignity,"Is this just a sneaky way to get people to re-watch Raising Hope?

Because I am 100% for it!"
The Lady in Dignity,"me too, pretty rough bonk of the noggin"
The Lady in Dignity,"Fwiw, and I forget the source, but I've heard stunt people take pride in the pain shots. I'd imagine it's  a ""if I'm gonna fuckin break an arm for you you better use it"" mentality"
The Lady in Dignity,"We rewatched *Back to the Future* a couple nights ago with our kids and the part where Marty’s grandfather hits him with the car and you see and hear Marty’s head hit the rough road surface … it gave me chills. I don’t like that sound. I was trying to figure out how they did it. The medium shot is certainly Michael J. Fox’s double. But the close-up is all Fox. They either used a semi-soft surface made to look like road, or maybe some kind of plate in his hair or under a wig. Or Fox just let his head hit the payment, which seems unlikely. Whatever protections should have been in place for *Raising Hope* must have worked for *Back to the Future.”"
The Lady in Dignity,"lol as soon as i posted that, i was like ""this sounds like a raising hope ad"""
The Lady in Dignity,"oh thats an interesting point i hadnt thought of. like a ""dont let this massive concussion be in vain"" type of thing"
The Lady in Dignity,"I believe in the commentary - which I listened to quite a while ago, mind you - he drops his head onto a safety mat painted to match the road and the sound is an egg hitting a table."
The Lady in Dignity,"oh MANNNNN. i know that scene very well, as BTTF is one of my favorite movies ever and it gets me every time. the sound when his skull hits the pavement is bone chilling for me. 

I guess back in the 80s it was a little more ""put some ice on it and laugh at the stars circling around his head"" and now its more - yikes thats a brain injury, but it still gets me pretty bad.

EDIT: to be clear, im talking about him hitting his head on the pavement in the movie, not the stuntman."
The Lady in Dignity,"If that makes you cringe, you won't like the scene where he is dragged by a rope on his neck in the 3rd movie."
The Lady in Dignity,Oh thank you! 38 years later and I can rest easy for poor Michael J. Fox’s head. The hairs on my neck are still going to stand up when I see that scene though.
The Lady in Dignity,The sound was added in post-production. He landed on a mat.
The Lady in Dignity,"I saw the third movie in theaters as a kid. I’ll be ok. Something about his head on the pavement has always made me recoil. I’m blaming the sound, which someone else said was the sound of a cracking egg."
The Lady in Dignity,"knowing that will have zero effect on my reaction lol

(but it is still good to know, thanks)"

Jesus fucking Christ"
The Lady in Dignity,"I don't think 1950s-style gender and relationship dynamics will translate well into 2022, and since we're seemingly incapable of viewing things as ""of the times"" there will almost certainly be an effort to update its sociopolitical messaging. 

In short, **we don't need this**. 

Also, I really love how one of the songs is misnamed as ""Grease Lightning"". Journalistic standards!!"
The Lady in Dignity,Honestly thought #3 in the photo was Aubrey Plaza
The Lady in Dignity,Jesus Christ. Not *every fucking thing* needs an origin story.
The Lady in Dignity,"This is so unnecessary. We already have Grease 2, a perfect film."
The Lady in Dignity,I thought this was going to say Grease: Rise of the Pink Panther and I was like is Inspector Clouseau going to go undercover as a 1950s greaser?
The Lady in Dignity,The Bottom: Rise of the thing We're Scraping.
The Lady in Dignity,"This probably could have been its own TV show, and it may have even been quite good, but instead they slapped the name ""Grease"" on it so it would sell. The irony of it all is that the constraints of putting this into an already established franchise are probably going to make it a worse show that, by the looks of this comment section, could potentially garner more criticism than viewership. I truly do not understand why networks and studios believe that new IP is somehow not marketable, when by all accounts consumers are ready for something new."
The Lady in Dignity,But we still can’t get a Dredd sequel?
The Lady in Dignity,[deleted]
The Lady in Dignity,Hard pass.
The Lady in Dignity,Goddamn Hollywood sucks these days

""Three Stooges: Rise of Shemp""

""Roundhay Garden Scene: Return to the Garden"""
The Lady in Dignity,"Can anyone come up with anything new anymore? I’m shocked how commonplace and acceptable it’s become to just rehash shit over and over again. Especially some of the crap I hear on the radio, just taking a hook from an Elton John hit and babbling over it is top 40 material now?"
The Lady in Dignity,"I'm curious what vibe and tone they're going with this: a 1954 Mean Girls, Heathers, or something else entirely?"
The Lady in Dignity,Diversity based on reality!!
The Lady in Dignity,"This is going to be fucking stupid and will probably have the same level of story telling as *Riverdale* and I'm going to watch it until it gets cancelled.

Admittedly, nothing could be worse than the Fox live version."
The Lady in Dignity,"""Oakes was initially skeptical about creating a prequel to Grease for television.""

And then she saw the salary and said ""Lets do this!""

People are baboons, they hate that they love all the sexist stereotypes that the 50's embraced.  

Its going to be a random teen drama with empowered women.       While wearing pink jackets.

it will be boring."
The Lady in Dignity,Is nothing sacred anymore? Please stop with the remakes and reboots and revisitings.
The Lady in Dignity,"let me see: asian, probably jewish, black, white. Indian and mexican in season 2, if we're lucky. Native Americans? lol get lost once again. White girl is a closeted lesbian in a toxic relationship with the greaser leader, will fall in love with black girl, who is also a closeted lesbian, and both will become strong and empowered ladies who will turn the patriarchal sexist and racist and homophobic society of the 50s upside down. Can't wait, yummy !"
The Lady in Dignity,Did we completely run out of original ideas already?

The Lady in Dignity,no thanks
The Lady in Dignity,NO!!  Grease is sacred.  I will never ever watch this prequel.

The Lady in Dignity,Derivative
The Lady in Dignity,Hilarious they made it multi racial when the school they went to probably was the most segregated ass school in movie history. They were not rocking with the current day liberalism. Shit was set in the fucking 1950's.
The Lady in Dignity,Grease sucks
The Lady in Dignity,What's the #WOKE score on this one?
The Lady in Dignity,"Everyone is mad at the historical accuracy and the lack of need for a sequel, but I’m just fucking sick of every 80’s IP being turned into a fucking teen drama show. We’ve got Willow, Wednesday, Chucky, Ash vs Evil Dead(good but young adult drama) Boba Fett had the gang of teenagers, the list goes on. Can’t something be made for us instead of using our nostalgia to sell shit teen drama to young kids?"
The Lady in Dignity,No one under 60 actually gives a fuck
The Lady in Dignity,"How much ""revisionist"" history will be forced upon us??"
The Lady in Dignity,Another female-focused reboot? What could go wrong?
The Lady in Dignity,"As with most of these nostalgia grabs, who wants this?"
The Lady in Dignity,Not everything needs an origin story.
The Lady in Dignity,If it's centered around 4 girls and made in 2022 it's almost certainly going to be shit
The Lady in Dignity,Another reason why I’m liking streaming services less and less…
The Lady in Dignity,Wow. I’m actually interested in this. Some of y’all are really cynical. Lol
The Lady in Dignity,Why though?
The Lady in Dignity,“And the award for the most anti-Reddit show of 2023 goes to… *drum roll* … Emily in Par… no! Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies!”
The Lady in Dignity,"Admit it, everyone complaining that this exists wouldn't want to watch a ""girl show"" anyway.  Not everything is made for the reddit gamer bro demographic."
The Lady in Dignity,"At least its on Paramount+, the same network that gave us Yellowstone. Hopefully that means the story telling and character development will be front and center, rather than pushed to the back in favor of some nonsense political agenda."
The Lady in Dignity,"Jesus Christ, why?"
The Lady in Dignity,Why
The Lady in Dignity,"In what way is this a ""look at""?"
The Lady in Dignity,"Hollywood is legit running out of franchises to reboot or sequelize.

Still can’t believe this year we got a sequel to A Christmas Story and Enchanted. From the 70s to 2000s, major films are no longer safe from destroyed legacies."
The Lady in Dignity,After seeing the shitshow that was Grease2 I have no interest in revisiting this story accept the original bc Travolta and John made it what it was.
The Lady in Dignity,Calling it now. It’ll be cancelled within the first season.
The Lady in Dignity,"What’s next, an origin story on Damone from Fast Times?"
The Lady in Dignity,"First of all, this show is totally unnecessary.

Second…

“RISE OF THE ____” SUBTITLES ARE FUCKING LAZY"
The Lady in Dignity,"It's amazing how the most offended ""fans"" are the ones who don't know the first thing about the franchise. 

""Grease"" is a *stage musical* that has been running and evolving for decades, with at least one other filmed adaptation besides the famous one. 

And hearing people complain that the new ""Grease"" installment ""isn't realistic to the time period"" is like someone complaining that the new ""Star Trek"" doesn't have realistic science. Yes, this new show should've had the realistic flying cars, 30-year-old high schoolers, and complete lack of a Cold War that the 1978 film had. 

My favorite historically accurate detail of the film in during the race at Thunder Road, when the 48-year-old-looking high school bully's car has a Mad Max spike contraption spinning out of it. My grandpa's 1954 Cadillac has one of those. 

I think this show looks like a vaguely interesting take on a long-runningfranchise. 

These snowflakes freaking out are worse than Ariel stans who shit their pants any time someone besides Disney dares adapt ""the Little Mermaid."""
The Lady in Dignity,Look how they massacred my boy
The Lady in Dignity,I think I might kill myself
The Lady in Dignity,Thought you were referencing The Thing (1982) for a second and was confused
The Lady in Dignity,Cannot fucking stand that “rise” is used so damn much in titles. Lazy assholes can’t come up with anything else.
The Lady in Dignity,RISE MOTHERFUCKER RIIIIISE
The Lady in Dignity,Return of the Mac
The Lady in Dignity,This could be another Addams Family spin off
The Lady in Dignity,One of the actresses is Asian. I appreciate trying to be inclusive but a girl gang in 1954 high school would not only be racist as fuck but the school would be probably segregated.
The Lady in Dignity,"Then people will vocally complain that it's inaccurate to have the changes, then others will vocally complain that those first people are racist, then there will be 1000 click bait articles and YouTube videos on whatever side they feel will get them more clicks, and that will become the entire discourse about the show."
The Lady in Dignity,"1950s style gender and relationship dynamics didn’t translate well in the 1970s either. **Which is why the musical Grease is a satire of the sort of cultural values expressed by the parents of the contemporary youth and of their hypocrisy.** Sandy changing everything about herself to be a better partner for Danny is meant to be seen by the audience as a sad and self destructive thing to do for a relationship. The way they treat sex and pregnancy scares is a shot at adults in the 70s who were railing against promiscuous teenagers while pretending they weren’t exactly the same but with worse education about it. We’re supposed to on some level be disgusted by the characters and their choices by the end of the musical, because it’s a send up of 50s nostalgia rather than an uncritical celebration of it."
The Lady in Dignity,Cuz this original movie was so realistic?
The Lady in Dignity,"They known that we don't need this, and on some level they know that it is going to suck. 

It is a well known cinematic universe that is guaranteed to get viewers for at least a season or so. 

It is vastly easier to get viewership for something established than for something new. That is why every old ""hit"" show and movie is being reborn. Most stink it up also, but they make money."
The Lady in Dignity,"I don't understand why we can't use aesthetics from a certain period of time and leave out its political issues, as well as not shoehorn in modern day issues."
The Lady in Dignity,"It's going to be that kind of historical revisionism where a character makes a speech about how things should be more just and then everyone just kind of goes ""oh, I never thought of that"" and society becomes more just"
The Lady in Dignity,"Oh gosh, when watching bits of that League of their own tv show, it's doing this exact same thing, its insane."
The Lady in Dignity,Agreed. The whole point of the musical was “change yourself and people will like you.” It’s gross.
The Lady in Dignity,You're funny if you think they're going to use 1950s gender dynamics in this show.
Drug Lords,"Looks promising. Sure, we all know the stories of the rise and fall of drug kingpins (spoiler alert: none of them end with a “happily ever after”), but im interested to see where they take the season. The drug culture in mexico is very different to the one in Colombia, and is more of a tale of corruption than blood bath. Or at least it was until the new millennia, which is when shit started getting extremely dangerous. "
Drug Lords,Wasn't he supposed to be Scarface in the Scarface reboot reboot?
Drug Lords,Rinse. Repeat.
Drug Lords,"Knowing that it’s about their downfall is a huge comfort to me, since the reality of the current drug trade is depressing enough. "
Drug Lords,"Well, el chapo and his lawyers reportedly [said they have proof 2 mexican presidents took millions in bribes](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/nepbmx/el-chapos-lawyer-just-claimed-mexicos-president-took-millions-in-bribes-from-sinaloa-cartel) .

If they come up with proof, it could show why the drug trade in mexico has been able to operate how it has these past couple of decades. It could also lead to further investigations and be the pebble that starts a massive snowball effect of information.

I know that trusting a drug kingpin is hard, but never underestimate someone who only looks after himself "
Drug Lords,I'd recommend all Bowden's books.  The dude is probably one of the greatest journalistic storytellers of our time.
Drug Lords,*colOmbian
Drug Lords,Excellent book and a great companion piece to the show!
Drug Lords,I would also strongly recommend watching [The True Story of Killing Pablo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sGD5PFRmI).  The interviews with Murphy and Pena and many of the big Colombian players really help clarify much of Narcos.
Drug Lords,"Love the part where Pablo had his guys bury weapons and tools in a prison yard while it was being built, then dug them up and escaped (or maybe the guards decided to take a nap)."
Drug Lords,"Spoiler alert!

(To clarify, this is a joke. I hate when people get upset because I ""spoil"" TV/Film that's based on history.)"
Drug Lords,Absolutely agree! 
Drug Lords,You mean he didn't work for the north face competitor?
Drug Lords,"Absolutely. Great documentary for sure.
Cheers"
Drug Lords,"Haha you know I deliberated on that, but I figured it was essentially common knowledge as to what happened to him. Hopefully that's the case for most! "
Drug Lords,Some people dont have that much time to waste
Drug Lords,"If you don't like the first few episodes of NCIS, you won't like NCIS. 

If you don't like the first few episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you still might like Buffy because it doesn't really find it's voice until the last episode of season 1 (my opinion) or even up to the middle of season 2 (a fairly common opinion). 

Some shows are all they are from the get go, others take time to evolve into what they wind up being, in which case you might like later episodes when you didn't care for earlier, or even vice versa sometimes.

And not all shows get ""better"". I thought the first season of the (original) L Word was a really good character driven drama. In season two it switched to a plot driven soap, and I grew increasingly frustrated with it until I quit watching it sometime later after a couple seasons of hoping it would go back to what it was the first season."
Drug Lords,"I bet I can name more shows that had bad/slow starts that NEVER got better than you can that did.

That's probably why."
Drug Lords,"A lot of people have very little free time to really ""discover"" tv, and some shows are pretty apparent from what they'll be from the get-go, whereas others need a few episodes to really get going. Particularly, the first season of Bojack got fairly weak reviews because only the first few episodes, where it was mostly animal puns and traditional sitcom tropes, before it showed what it was *actually* about.

However, not every show does that; a lot of shows early episodes are pretty indicative of what you're given for the rest. So it's pretty reasonable to ask, if you're someone with not a lot of time to spare, if a show you might be interested but aren't feeling quite yet does a Bojack and ""finds its legs"", or if you what see early on is exactly what you'll get for the run of the show."
Drug Lords,"Because free time is valuable and people don't want to waste it watching crap.

Remember it used to be if ratings fell hard enough on network shows they would be pulled from the schedule within 6 episodes or less never to be seen again."
Drug Lords,">Literally one of the greatest shows of all time according to critics and viewers alike. But the first season was really ""slow"" and ""boring.""

Rewatch the first episode, and to an extent, the first season, and revisit this statement. Breaking Bad was screaming out of the gate.

There's a huge difference between something that starts slow and something that needs to ""get better"". Slow is fine if it's interesting. But if the show isn't good for a few episodes, regardless of pacing, I'm not going to waste the limited number of hours I have on this planet watching trash I dislike in the hopes that it will improve."
Drug Lords,"The shows that I absolutely enjoy are the ones that had me from the start. I am slow to start and I always miss the trends, so after years of dismissing Naruto as ""kid stuff,"" I tried it out a few weeks ago and have already gone through 100+ episodes.

I know what I like better than anyone. People recommend these newer shows to me all the time, but they never bother to understand what I like as an individual. So, I will watch a few minutes, or one episode, but my joys in life are so specific to me that it doesn't take hours for me to know if I am enjoying myself.

I am the same with video games."
Drug Lords,"I do ask this from time to time, I just wanna see if it's worth my time continuing. For example, I watched the first 6 episodes of Mad Men. They weren't bad, but I asked someone when does it pick up? He said, ""you've watched 6 episodes, it's already there, if you're not into it, then it's not for you.""

I appreciated his response and didn't continue. Some things just don't hook you right away, it's nice to know from viewers if things do pick up at a certain point or even if you get to episode X and you still aren't invested quit. It's all about not wasting my time so I can move on to a show that will hook me."
Drug Lords,"Breaking Bad wasn't slow for me. The premise was interesting enough to keep me watching.

I hate slow paced shows. Reality is I've already watched too many movies and TV series in my life, a show murking around and being dull is annoying/ It's often not unique or ambitious enough to warrant the slow start. I've wasted a lot of time on shows that didn't get any more interesting after the 3rd episode.

A show being easy to watch or fast pace and interesting from the get go is a valuable quality in itself.

There are also shows where the show genuinely get significantly better after x amount of episodes."
Drug Lords,"I liked Breaking Bad's first season. Couldn't get into the Leftovers but I assume other people liked the quiet gloominess of the opening episodes.

Seems to me that you're just a pretentious douche that didn't really appreciate either shows openings but instead see sticking through them as some sort of admirable feat of endurance. Like a twelve year old bragging about eating a spicy pepper."
Drug Lords,"breaking bad season 1 wasn't slow or boring, and big action or conflict aren't necessarily interesting

people ask because they don't want to gamble their time on whether a show will improve or not. A lot of the time the first episode of a show will serve as a synecdoche for the whole thing, so if it's bad or mediocre it makes me assume that the whole thing is bad or mediocre in a similar manner. Episodic media should still be good on an episode to episode basis.

Good/bad will mean different things to different people, but what they experience is what they will use to make a decision, if theyre asking others then theyre just trying to make a more informed decision influenced by people who have already invested time into a show.

Lately I've felt like mediocre shows are putting the meat of their stories into the beginning and end of seasons, with middle episodes serving as just meandering diversions that don't really serve to forward any thesis/concepts. I would like to avoid these shows in the future so I'll look to reviews I trust"
Drug Lords,"I think better call Saul is the best show ever made. Blows breaking bad out of the water. But no one I know wants to get into it because it's so 'slow'. 

Like that's part of it. It has a heavy focus on character development. And it does it flawlessly."
Drug Lords,"nothing wrong with that question, honestly. People wanna know if it's worth the time investment"
Drug Lords,"Social media is melting people's brains.  There was a post the other day of someone saying they loved the pilot of a show and if they should keep watching.


People are bored, lonely and insecure, so they look for validation on the internet."
Drug Lords,[deleted]
Drug Lords,All the “free time is valuable “ make me lol. I’d hate for it to interrupt your 23 hours scrolling Reddit.
Drug Lords,"A lot of the time, it feels like they don't actually want their question answered. They just want to let people know, that they don't like the show."
Drug Lords,They almost never ask that question in good faith. It's a precursor to shitting on the show under the guise that they gave it an honest try.
Drug Lords,"Low mentality / short attention span and RAMPANT ADHD spectrum type shit because are food stream and plastics are contaminated with hormones, PCBs, DDTs and by products of pharmacy that noone pays any attention to, and has been for multiple generations now. We are an evolution of mental deformity that wont change until people start believing it. But hey, I'm no Chicken Little. I wont say ""the sky is falling"" or ""there is no hope"" because I happen to know that the evolutionary path we are on now is wholly reversible. If it weren't we would all already be dead."
Drug Lords,"Instant gratification, social media (tiktok, snapchat, Youtube shorts, FB stories) making people only want to consume 30 seconds of entertainment before moving on to the next funny video or whatever. Not to sound like a grumpy old man, but I feel like a lot of people who ask this question are younger and need to be entertained NOW. But I also understand that some middle aged people might ask this too because they don't have much free time and need to be more selective in what they watch in their spare time."
Drug Lords,"> People whining about how such and such episode was boring, how this character sucks, how they're going to stop watching, etc. I almost feel sorry for them if they indeed gave up after 2-3 episodes.

People's enjoyment of shows is above all else subjective. Someone could just as easily come along and say they feel sorry for people who care that much about TV, or put their time into shows they aren't even enjoying, or people who get sucked in for season after season just because of sunk cost (I've personally been there, and I'm on guard about it now.)

And there's a difference between slow and boring. In good shows, even the slow set-up scenes of exposition can be compelling. I think TLOU does this well, just look at the episode intro scenes, or the scenes where Joel is explaining the old world to Ellie.

As a counter-example, I personally think the main plot of Andor does this less well, and makes for a feeling like I'm waiting around for the actual story, and that isn't totally excused by some good pay-off episodes, or the more interesting B-story set-up with the Empire. Even some good shows are kind of boring some times, and that boredom can still be a legit complaint even after the show gets good. We do kind of expect these things to entertain us, after all.

I don't agree with the ""what's there to look forward to?"" sentiment. TLOU also start with an episode of >!balls-to-the-wall action, unfolding ""slowly"" but still within the first episode,!< and it certainly doesn't seem to me (or a whole lot of gamers who respect this as one of the best stories told on the medium) to interfere with the pacing of the story overall. LOTR comes to mind as another movie that utilizes this pacing, and those are by no means the only examples.

People can enjoy shows however they see fit, and there's gonna be a lot of different fits. As long as people aren't getting nasty about it, they can be as bored by a character or episode as they like. They're not wrong for having that reaction, no matter how ""good"" a show might be."
Drug Lords,People need validation. It's the same thing with books and movies. People will watch half a movie and come ask if it's worth finishing.
Drug Lords,It's usually a statement masked as a question.
Drug Lords,"Everyone’s viewing preferences is different and how they’d prefer to spend said time is also different.

Here’s the thing: some ppl don’t want to wait on their own to see if it gets better and that’s their right. Why watch a show that potentially stay mediocre or get worse when you can either ask if it improves OR just quit it altogether? There’s so much tv to watch that you don’t need to waste it on show you don’t enjoy.

I’m all for people giving things a chance, but I don’t understand people who watch shit they don’t like or actively hate. And if that means people asking if it’s get better to avoid it or quitting in advance, I’m all for it.

There’s a difference between slow and engaging v slow and boring (or poorly written). But once again, everyone has their own preferences. Some ppl don’t like slow paced shows and that’s their right.

I just picked up Fringe and it’s not really grabbing me, but I’m staying with it because people say it gets better in the second season. I never asked, it’s just a popular sentiment I’ve heard a lot without prompt. Comparatively, shows like the x files, 12 monkeys, pitch, the good wife, Chuck, etc all grabbed from the first eps even if they wobbled and stumbled a bit throughout the first few eps/first season.

Sure, some shows need time to find their footing, but there are others who have a sense of identity better than others and that counts for something even if the quality is inconsistent.

Better Call Saul starts slower and different than people expect, but the quality was supreme. The Americans is a show that’s a mix of dragging and action—great show."
Drug Lords,"This 100%.

I only have a certain amount of time most nights to watch TV, maybe an hour or two before bed.  Unless a pilot is complete trash I'll at least give a show a few episodes before checking out.  I'm not going to waste 7 or 8 hours for a show to ""start getting good"".

I think also streaming services opened the door to a million more options of shows to watch as opposed to 15-20 years ago when it was your standard cable networks and premium channels.  So a lot of people's attention spans with ""slow burn"" shows isn't what it used to be as a result."
Drug Lords,"Exactly and on top of that, what’s exciting to OP may be boring to me, doesn’t mean I’m wrong, just means I’m feeling bored and need to watch something I’ll find entertaining or more engaging.

I don’t get the point of debating people’s honest feelings about a show, why and how?

Do people need to all love the same thing? 

I disliked breaking bad because I was bored, same for mad men and a slew of other shows people seem to adore."
Drug Lords,Name 20.
Drug Lords,"> Rewatch the first episode, and to an extent, the first season, and revisit this statement. Breaking Bad was screaming out of the gate.

I agree. If you notice I put *slow* and *boring* in quotes to reflect what others have said. Not me."
Drug Lords,">People are bored, lonely and insecure, so they look for validation on the internet.

lmfao"
Drug Lords,"> The Leftovers is just so fucking boring.

Did you even watch it."
Drug Lords,Why even watch a show if their time is so valuable? They need to be doing all that valuable stuff instead.
Drug Lords,"Totally.

When I was a teen in 90s, I used to get pissed at my friends who had cable when they would complain that their wasn't anything to watch. On a Saturday I could watch TV from when I woke up, till when I want to sleep with just free over the air TV. Granted, it was not all great, but I was able to find it an enjoyable enough way to spend the day if I didn't have anything else going on.

But now there are so many great shows from the last 30 years that I can stream at any time (not to mention interesting YouTube videos), there just is not time to watch things that don't hold my interest."
Drug Lords,https://www.tvguide.com/galleries/51-worst-tv-shows-of-the-century-ranked/
Drug Lords,"Because value is relative. If someone loves trash reality tv, that’s value well spent FOR THEM. If a show is a slog for me to get through, no matter how much others love it, it’s a waste FOR ME.

Value isn’t just measured by “important” things. And important is in quotations because importance’s and value isn’t always centered around what people think it should be. Entertainment can be and is important too."
Drug Lords,"We went from bad/slow starts to 'worst tv shows', with a list full of reality shows and dating shows, which even include some fan favourites that never had any such issue."
Drug Lords,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.
Drug Lords,"Lilyhammer, one of the first! Also personal fan of Hemlock grove"
Drug Lords,"My top 10

- 1st Dark

- 2nd Russian Doll

- 3rd The Queen's Gambit

- 4th Narcos

- 5th Stranger Things

- 6th Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (BBC America coproduction)

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 8th Sense8

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Drug Lords,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Drug Lords,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Drug Lords,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Drug Lords,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Drug Lords,Dark should be top this list

Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.

Drug Lords,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Drug Lords,[deleted]
Drug Lords,I see you haven’t watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Drug Lords,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Drug Lords,[deleted]
Drug Lords,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Drug Lords,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Drug Lords,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend “the last kingdom” one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show “russian doll” had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it’s 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Drug Lords,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Drug Lords,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Drug Lords,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Drug Lords,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Drug Lords,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Drug Lords,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Drug Lords,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Drug Lords,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Drug Lords,[deleted]
Drug Lords,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Drug Lords,Because it's bad
Drug Lords,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Drug Lords,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Drug Lords,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Drug Lords,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Drug Lords,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Drug Lords,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Drug Lords,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Drug Lords,Man the first season is peak television
Drug Lords,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Drug Lords,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Drug Lords,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Drug Lords,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Drug Lords,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Drug Lords,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Drug Lords,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Drug Lords,I feel like those sorts of things work way better as throwaway lines than they do full premises. Everything we heard about Schrute Farms and the Schrute family is better than the backdoor pilot they aired during the last season of The Office
Drug Lords,"I kinda want them to do a mockumentary version of the teased ""A Little Bit Alexis."" I don't know that I'd want to see more than 1 season of it, but it would be fun."
Drug Lords,">""I didn't go missing, David. The FBI knew where I was the entire time.""

You could write a whole season about this line alone, and there were dozens of them."
Drug Lords,"Maybe a one of holiday special or something.  But what made SC so satisfying was watching those characters grow, Alexis especially.  It would be hard to watch her be stuck where she was before Season 1 started."
Drug Lords,Ew
Drug Lords,"All the hints of Alexis' past exploits remind me of Cheryl from Archer, minus the pyromania."

Re:Mind,It's not like a full run-through of Firefly is a big time commitment.
Re:Mind,"Not as creative with good writing though.  It's also not intense like some scifi shows, such as BSG."
Re:Mind,Firefly is also like 13 episodes. It’s not that much of a time commitment. You can watch new and old show as many times as you want to.
Re:Mind,Why would they?  The late fan following spawned a movie to tie up some of the loose ends.
Re:Mind,"Joss and Nathan here, you're welcome!.. "
Re:Mind,"Wow!  This is awesome, if what you're saying is true.  Just watched you on Graham Norton's NYE show the other day.

In any case, the cast looked like a pretty good bunch and Joss seems like a pretty down to earth guy.  He's also sci-fi geek like the rest of us too... haha.  It's too bad they couldn't bring you back in more episodes, but I guess it didn't help that the show was cancelled before its time.

Glad to hear Joss and Nathan were able to help you out during your difficult time.  Nathan's actually from my hometown, and he seems like a pretty down to earth guy too.  It could explain why Joss casted him in multiple projects over the years."

Re:Mind,"You know, it's always a great time with Graham. One of the few hosts with a real solid timber. A lot of them have a slate of questions, but with Graham there is a better focus on less wooden. 

Joss too is also a great guy, Nathan was always a joy, and had a lot of nice things to say about my dad, but I spent the most time with Joss. They actually had a multi-ep arc planned, if I am remembering correctly, that I was brought in for but this was in the last stages of the show and my parents, ultimately the script wasn't picked up."
Re:Mind,Firefly is terrible and so is Joss. Firefly is confederate apologist nonsense.
Re:Mind,Sorry that you're being downvoted for asking an honest question. I had never heard of this either. Just another reminder to not put people on pedestals.
Re:Mind,He cheated on his wife or something.  I don't remember exactly what it was.
Re:Mind,"long story short his ex-wife made a statement that he's been constantly cheating on her their entire relationship. Specifically with young actresses on his shows. Here's a quote from his according to his wife:
>“When I was running ‘Buffy,’ I was surrounded by beautiful, needy, aggressive young women. It felt like I had a disease, like something from a Greek myth. Suddenly I am a powerful producer and the world is laid out at my feet and I can’t touch it.”

So that right there is abusing his position of authority over his actresses to conduct affairs with them. That really isn't appropriate behaviour.

All that doesn't fly with his feminist preaching (I still however believe he is one, he just likes the implicit and explicit power he has over women in his employ to sleep with them.

He didn't depute the claims made by his ex-wife but said they mischaracterised events. Whatever that means."

Finding these ""bad messages"" in more grounded dramas would be a better talking point for you imo. Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay."
Part-Time Idol,">It is better for 100 people to regret not having kids than even one person regret having kids.

What the fuck."
Part-Time Idol,If you are looking at TV for a “message” you are probably a loser. Fact.
Part-Time Idol,"Everyone always talks about how horrible Ted is, but no one calls out Lilly on her problematic behavior, for some ungodly reason."
Part-Time Idol,[deleted]
Part-Time Idol,"Why is everything numbered ""1""?"
Part-Time Idol,I liked how the author cited the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a complaint about iCarly
Part-Time Idol,"> Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay.

I think this is more a judgment on certain members of the audience than it is the show. In Gilmore Girls, all of the various characters make errors but they still remain protagonists. Nor does the show flinch from showing the negative consequences of their actions.

So when you hear people who are re-evaluating the characters, they're not really making statements about the show so much as their own failure to understand it on first viewing. Even worse, they're re-evaluating on the naive and simplistic premise that good people can't also be flawed people."
Part-Time Idol,"Having messed up messages is more problematic when the subject matter at hand is  family/kids shows since kids will actually take the messages to heart many times. While messed up messages in adult programming is still bad because it's meant to be taken more seriously and should have more complex stories and messages, I don't think it's as much of an issue there because adults typically don't carry as many messages from shows as kids do, and they can usually use their own logic to identify when a message is bad and why it is bad. 

Many of these examples are from kids/family shows so I think they're reasonable arguments to be made."
Part-Time Idol,People constantly talked about how Lily is literally the worst and Marshall deserves better when it was airing.
Part-Time Idol,"I do not think that any of these shows are inherently bad, they are good shows that have bad moments."
Part-Time Idol,What are you talking about?
Part-Time Idol,"Your list of 10 things are all numbered ""1"", instead of 10, 9, 8..., I assumed it was intentional and had a meaning I was missing, or it was an inside joke on the sub or something."
Part-Time Idol,"From my end it looks like they are numbered 1, 2 ,3 ,4 in that order. 

I do not know why it isn't that way on your end."
Part-Time Idol,"Huh, that's weird af. Maybe it's because I'm on mobile. Idk."
Part-Time Idol,"People have gotten tribalistic about stupid things and the internet allows them to vent about it anonymously. It's a real issue. Everyone needs a ""take"" about everything."
Part-Time Idol,"Jesus Christ, do users here love to downvote anything? There is no way that anyone has been able to have already read all I wrote!"
Part-Time Idol,"I think the world would be a much better place if no one was arrogant. Because arrogance is at the core of why so many people enjoy shitting on other people and what other people love. Art is very subjective. Any individual's emotional connection with an work of art is never gonna be fully explained with logical reasoning. No show will be loved by everyone. No one should be bashed for liking what they like. Art should be as diverse as possible, for the mainstream and for the niche. Including art that is not for me, not for my sensibilites, interests and preferences. Art is worthy if it is able to emotionally touch and move other people, no matter how many or how few people.

If everyone understood all of that, we wouldn't have flame wars, and we wouldn't have people labeling as ""overrated"" what others love. We wouldn't have people being judgmental of others."
Part-Time Idol,That's why. It's rambling and obviously overanalyzing.
Part-Time Idol,"> flame wars

Haven't heard that term in sooo long.Trust me,this here is not a flame war,or at least we may have a different knowledge of what it means.


Anyway...this is another reason why you get downvoted.You get too emotional for something that should be fun,and you honestly made me laugh asking in the weekly thread why you get downvoted,and after I refreshed the page you had another downvote.Plus you mentioned it twice...even funnier for some reason.See ? It's the simplest answers.

I got downvoted for asking people what shows they think have a good rewatch value,and I know why : because most likely there was another post similar to that that I haven't seen,and those that saw the older post didn't like a new one.Or maybe they where looking for the same thing as me,and saw that most of the replies where shows that people liked,which wasn't what I asked.A show that you like may not have a great rewatch value,because since you already saw it you know what happens next.Where a show like LOST that I've seen many,many times,still has lots of small details that you can notice."
Part-Time Idol,"I put so much effort, deep thought and care in this text."
Part-Time Idol,"I'm passionate about art I love. I don't judge anyone, I want art plurality, I try to be as open-minded and understanding as possible to what other people that I may not, and yet people are still jerks. What did you think of all I wrote in the OP? You'll see why I'm so passionate.

All you talked about are stupid reasons to downvote a post. You just asked for recommendations, you didn't criticize anything, why downvote your post? People are such frustrating jerks."
Part-Time Idol,"This is Reddit, on a default sub. Deep, well constructed arguments get you nowhere here."
Part-Time Idol,":(

I'm sad. I worked so hard in my whole argumentation in this post. And I defend so much art plurality, including art that is not for me."
Part-Time Idol,"I think the thing is that this post is mostly about you: *I, I, I. I this. I that. A lot of people do this and that, but this is what I do. This is how I think… and I’ve prepared several examples!* But no one asked you about you. If you asked *other people* why they are the way they are, and how they think instead of just assuming, and why they think the way they do, instead of telling us how *you* (apparently) already know how so many of us think, and then explaining *so verbosely* how different (and supposedly better) your manner of being and thinking is by contrast (with examples!,) you would get a better response. You seem like a quality person and you are obviously very thoughtful. But it’s your demonstration of regard for others that will earn you the same in return."
Part-Time Idol,"The problem isn't your writing, it's the forum. People here like digestible fluff and things to argue over but not actually discuss.

It's not you, it's us. Keep on doing you, and hopefully you find a group of like-minded people with whom to have more in-depth discussions."
Part-Time Idol,"Thanks for the comment. I may be very poor in my argumentation, and I can lose my head and become rude and aggressive in some topics. The fact I'm Asperger also doesn't help. 

Ultimately though, what I'm trying to advocate here is open mind and respect of everyone towards each other. If someone loves and is genuinely and emotionally moved by a piece of art I don't love, who am I to bash that person and invalidate the type of art that person loves? I want art diversity, for all niches and tastes, including art not for me.

I think this whole discussion below summed up my thoughts.

https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/sciqsa/when_does_avatar_the_last_airbender_get_good/hu87i0x/"
Part-Time Idol,"Are you being sincere in your comfort? I also fear your comment might sound like you are saying I'm better than most people here. I'm not better than anyone.

Sorry for asking, but I'm Asperger, and terrible with catching sarcasm and/or irony sometimes."
Part-Time Idol,"For sure, yeah. I think your second paragraph summed up the gist of what that big long original post said. That’s really all you needed to write IMO. Your more detailed thoughts could have been replies to anyone who responded, as appropriate. Additionally I think the problem with specifically talking about ATLA at the same time is you can automatically turn off people who don’t like it, or who don’t know what ATLA is. Plus anyone can look through your post history and see that talking about ATLA can get you worked up, which can be something of a red flag and dissuade positive feedback. A passionate mind is an emotional one. People in strong emotional states tend not to be fully rational or logical. That’s easy to pick up on by most of us and a lot of the time we’ll either avoid those people, or confront those people. In the end your post comes across as written by someone who is passionate about ATLA and wants to evangelize for it by couching the message in a post that purports to be about open-mindedness. I don’t doubt your open-mindedness in general but you don’t necessarily seem open to the minds of people who you think don’t properly appreciate what you like (i.e. ATLA) based off that conversation you linked. Plus (and finally) you used the word “hate,” which honestly you should avoid in the future at all costs. Do not use that word. Anytime you want to use that word, explore and articulate what’s prompting that feeling instead, but never sum it up with that word, ever. It’s a strong word that’s both loaded and empty at the same time, as well as a mental and verbal cop-out that does nothing but admit a sort of intellectual defeat."
Part-Time Idol,"Yes, sincere. And not necessarily ""better,"" since that is entirely subjective. Just different perspectives and priorities."
Part-Time Idol,"Oh, I agree about the word ""hate"". I know I'm not a good example, but I think people use it banally.

Thanks for the insightful comment. I personally used ATLA as an example not only because I love it so much, but because I'm specially familiar with the ins and outs of it to argue about."
Part-Time Idol,"Thanks for the support. Maybe I shouldn't try anymore to post these long essays in this subreddit. It's not the type of subject and discussion that most people really want to have here. And I consequently also easily lose my head and become rude and aggressive in certain topics (animation and kids' shows) because they feel like such a part of me. I talk about these topics in this conversation.

Part-Time Idol,">I wish you the best

And I, you. 👍"
Part-Time Idol,Thanks!
Part-Time Idol,"I'm wondering if, in like 25-30 years, when people will be watching shows, they'll wonder why certain shows in the 00's have like 10 episode seasons.

And then someone will make a ""TIL that in 2007, the Writers Guild of America had a strike. This is why many television shows during that year had extremely short seasons."""
Part-Time Idol,"I still mourn for Pushing Daisies, whose ratings momentum was cut off by the strike and it never recovered in season 2 and was canceled without a properly-filmed finale.

Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog also came out of the strike, and there's a [song on the musical commentary track about the writers' strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfwElBO-gQ8). "
Part-Time Idol,And Heroes never recovered as a show
Part-Time Idol,Was zack and Cody really cancelled tho? I thought it was because there 3 season contract was up (as what most Disney shows have.) And  on deck aired soon after and lasted another 3 seasons.
Part-Time Idol,Who Made Huckabee? Might be one of my favorite bits ever done on Late Night TV.
Part-Time Idol,Something that isn't mentioned as much - the strike was the end of strictly regimented TV season starts/finishes and sweeps weeks.
Part-Time Idol,RIP pushing daisies
Part-Time Idol,Am I correct in thinking that the Writers' Strike successfully prevented the Deposition and Dinner Party episodes of the Office from airing one after each other?
Part-Time Idol,The Writer's Strike is what made Misha Collins' career. The original SPN storyline got scrapped in favor of 'an angel raises Dean'. 
Part-Time Idol,"Writer's Strike Conan was the best string of television that late night television has ever produced. Sure his remote episodes done in other cities/countries are still the best stuff on late night TV now, and his final few weeks of shows on The Tonight Show after falling out with NBC were awesome, but the writer's strike showed how much better Conan is when he is freed from the shackles of archaic late night television bullshit of being forced to do monologues and sketches. It's just like how his current TBS show is unwatchable on a daily basis, yet suddenly he does a remote segment or a remote episode in another city or country and that is immediately must-watch."
Part-Time Idol,And I'm still bitter about Pushing Daisies
Part-Time Idol,That's a really nice write-up. Great job! Let's hope that will never happen again.
Part-Time Idol,Desperate Housewives wasn't a reality show
Part-Time Idol,"One show that got cancelled and it bugs the fuck out of me is “The Riches” I saw it on Netflix a few years back, finished season one, then season two ends abruptly with the bad guy calling to tell the main character that he has his son. "
Part-Time Idol,"I don't think anyone has mentioned, ""The Riches"":

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches

It was hit by the writers' strike in season 2 and only half of the planned episodes ever aired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches#Season_2:_2008).

I thought it was quite clever but I could see how they'd likely run out of good story ideas fairly quickly."
Part-Time Idol,The writers strike was a weird time for tv. 
Part-Time Idol,Journeyman TV show from NBC. I am sad.
Part-Time Idol,"The great late night madness will always be the most memorable thing from this. Conan was the best comedy on TV during the writer’s strike, late night or otherwise. "
Part-Time Idol,"I loved the 4400, it was heartbreaking to see it go."
Part-Time Idol,"Only 3 shows which debuted that season got to a 3rd season; Gossip Girl, Chuck and The Big Bang Theory. "
Part-Time Idol,Do non-union people suffer after union people are back in the industry? Are they placed in a blacklist or anything like that?
Part-Time Idol,"I remember being a journalist visiting the set of a lot of those series and talking to the cast. They all seemed happy as they got to have a break, but it was tough on the other people like lighting, make-up, catering etc. 

"
Part-Time Idol,it's insane that it's already been ten years. Quantum of Solace had shitty writing unfortunately.
Part-Time Idol,[deleted]
Part-Time Idol,Since the last writers strike gave us Dr Horrible I am anxious for another one!
Part-Time Idol,And new episodes of The Office finally came back! I remember when this happened It was torture having to wait.
Part-Time Idol,"Wait, why is Desperate Housewives listed as a reality show?"
Part-Time Idol,I know it's not television but Quantum of Solace basically didn't have a third act because of the Writer's Strike.
Part-Time Idol,I remember how annoying that time was. 
Part-Time Idol,RIP Pushing Daisies. 
Part-Time Idol,Pushing Daisies never recovered.  Such a shame.
Part-Time Idol,"Other than 30rock and the office having shorter seasons, I remember Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During this time he grew a beard and during the show he would spend time flicking his wedding ring. Each episode he would try to beat his previous record. Now, this does sound boring but Conan made it hilarious. "
Part-Time Idol,[Always worth watching the South Park episode making fun of the strike.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_on_Strike)
Part-Time Idol,RIP Drawn Together. 
Part-Time Idol,Aaaannnddd....all we have now is remakes of old shit.
Part-Time Idol,I was so excited for The day the Earth stood still too.
Part-Time Idol,writers strike ruined Battlestar Galactica
Part-Time Idol,And the industry never recovered. Movies have largely been shit rebrands ever since. Movies are dead. Series are the future.
Part-Time Idol,Essentially it saved breaking bad. It cut season 1 short and thus resulted in Jesse not getting killed off 
Part-Time Idol,RIP Reaper
Part-Time Idol,"After being introduced to the GEICO cavemen show in that thread about worst reviewed shows of the 2000s, I have to say its cancellation was a tragedy. What a hilarious trainwreck of a show. "
Part-Time Idol,I took the time to watch all seven seasons of the West Wing.  I've been a fan of Sorkin ever since.
Part-Time Idol,Quantum of Solace
Part-Time Idol,"...and gave rise to Netflix, reality unscripted TV and cord cutting, which is directly biting them in the ass in the latest negotiations (2017 expiration).

Talk about short sited. They got their little contract, but their value will never be the same."
Part-Time Idol,Spoiled whiners should just have been replaced
Part-Time Idol,TIL Steve Buscemi was a volunteer firefighter during the 2007-08 Writers Strike 
Part-Time Idol,Look at the '88 strike.  Mission:Impossible remade episodes from the 60's series and Star Trek TNG did a clip show.
Part-Time Idol,Life also got screwed in the writers strike. S1 was great and then just huge mis step in S2. 
Part-Time Idol,"I watched Dr. Horrible in my junior year English class when my teacher put it on, took a Xanax, and fell asleep. We quoted it for days"
Part-Time Idol,"I loved Pushing Daises but it’s ratings were dropping *fast* before the strike, it shed **half** its viewers over the first season. There was no momentum."
Part-Time Idol,And Jesse Pinkman's life was saved.
Part-Time Idol,Came here to say this. After season 1 the show just spiraled downward into a horrible mess.
Part-Time Idol,"Honestly I think the show was doomed  after season 1 anyway. 

They started drifting away from what I felt like the show was meant to be: human characters from different backgrounds dealing with super human abilities. These days that sounds rather generic but at the time it was a great concept that worked really well. But as the show went on, it seemed like it became less about humans dealing with super powers and more about just the fact that people had super powers. I honestly think season 1 was lightning in a bottle. There were good characters all circling around this mysterious event as well as a really cool villain.

Then there is the fact that they started fucking with their powers which really doesn't do anything but break the immersion of the world the whole story works to build. Some say they had to nerf certain characters' abilities but I say that's a lack of good writing and creativity. I could go on about Heroes. A damn shame it turned out the way it did, and the revival certainly did not make any improvements. "
Part-Time Idol,"Save the cheerleader, save the world! RIP."
Part-Time Idol,"Yeah thats true, shame they couldnt get back to their glory days not even once. "
Part-Time Idol,it was a lost cause before the strike
Part-Time Idol,Every time Stewart and Colbert did something with Conan it was gold
Part-Time Idol,Streaming (and the rise of HBO and other cable networks) also contributed to that.
Part-Time Idol,Can I get an EILI5 style explanation. The business of TV fascinates me.
Part-Time Idol,Eh...I dunno. I know that the original plan was for Sam to save Dean but that doesn't mean angels wouldn't have entered the picture anyways. I think Kripke added them in more to have balance with demons than to have an explanation of how Dean got raised from the dead.
Part-Time Idol,"Misha's performance is what made Misha's career. I'm pretty sure the angels were planned anyway, Kripke claims he had a 5-year plan from the start. It's just the manner in which they were introduced that came out of the strike. "
Part-Time Idol,"It was really great for late night television.

But as an actor and someone who worked behind the scenes it essentially meant there was basically no work for almost a year.

Made me leave the biz....which ended up probably being a really good move seeing how much the industry changed post streaming."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Mucha Lucha 2 ?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,# [WHO'S THAT JUMPING OUT THE SKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnBqJr3QBdk)
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Did anyone ever watch Mucha Lucha as a kid? That show’s theme somg was awesome: https://youtu.be/31NxuMrtWsk

My Guatemalan baby sitter would always be so excited to see my brother and I watching a Latin American-influenced cartoon"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,This sucks. He just lost his eye and he won’t be able to fully appreciate the show.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,I'll have to keep an eye out for it.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Awesome! I wonder if a.) WWE’s gonna collaborate on this in any fashion, or b.) if we’ll get an English dub too. Might just watch the original version and use it to pick back up on my Spanish.

In any case, this is cool because it seems like CN’s wanted to do a lucha show for a while, they had an El Santo show lined up for a U.S. release (after a microseries did well in the LatAm market), so this is really cool to see."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,The description of that show is amazing lol. If I was 7-12ish id be hooked.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,I always played as him in the WWE games!
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Last I heard about rey mysterio he had that terrible accident in the ring with the other guy. How's he been doing from that?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Considering Rey is popular in the rest of North America I'm hoping they do an English track also. Not sure of much in terms what's playing on CN nowadays, but this would seem like a minor hit with Pro-Wrestling's re-growth, not to mention a lot of fun as well."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Rey Mysterio's Rock 'n' Wrestling?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Good, when I was younger Rey was my idol I'm glad he's still being a good role model for kids"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,This sounds right up my alley
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,booyaka booyaka!
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,He's been around a while. I worked for TBS as the video projectionist for WCW Thunder and Nitro in the late 90's and 2000. The acrobatics these guys performed impressed everyone. Push back from lumbering wrestlers overcame their early popularity. American fans prefer mutant giants that flex the deck when they hit it. We tried working them into vignettes but the language problem and their small size made things complicated.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"They should go the [Adult Swim] route and have him solve mysteries like the Mike Tyson one.

“Rey’s Mysterios”"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Does the villain coincidentally end up laying face-down across some ropes every episode?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,La Parka or GTFO
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Maybe he can go around solving crimes and unmasking other luchadores in a van called the Mysterio Machine
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,[Here's hoping we get a storyline where he beats his kids.................in WWE 13.](https://twitter.com/reymysterio/status/263061905764151296?s=20)
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,That's fucking awesome.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,So like the Santo movies?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Good for him! Haven’t watched WWE in a while but Rey is a legend. Pretty sure he went to the Lucha network a few years back.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,love rey mysterio so cool
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Thats cool
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,He’s the man
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,He killed a guy once from his 619
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Luchq Dora the Explora
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Keep searching boys we gotta find who the fuck asked
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"It should be like Rock N Wrestling, where Rey has a team of technicos, and he battles a team of rudos, led by like Andrade."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"How did this guy get his own show, but not Bat Manuel. This is clearly racism against bats, due to that whole COVID thing."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"This seems about 15 years too late, but nonetheless congrats to Rey."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Mascara Magica tribute when?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"The industry is ugly. 

It's carny bullshit, and we routinely watch women and men take decades off their lives one match at a time. The McMahons routinely cross the line between everyday villainy and cartoonish supervillainy.  No matter what strides are made in human/worker's rights in society, the Wrestling industry is routinely/habitually years, or decades, behind the curve.

But. 

Pro Wrestling and the Olympics are humanity's best ongoing showcases of what our bodies and brains can accomplish with training. They let us see people do the impossible. Sometimes those people look like us. Increasingly, more of them look and act and love like more of us. Rey has been a literal superhero for decades. I'm so glad he gets to canonize that in the proper medium. 

I don't know if I want more kids to dream of putting on tights and backflipping onto their necks for our entertainment; I don't know if the current industry makes that trade-off worth it. But I'm happy kids will see Rey, a guy who looks and talks like them, as a capital-H hero. He'll do the impossible. And I hope they'll find an impossible and do it too."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"makes me think of Mucha Lucha obviously but also Guacamelee, hope it turns out well"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"OMG... This is great news... I grew out of my WWE maybe in my 16-17...I'm in my late thirties now... And Ray Mysterio was the last wrestler in that industry I remember. 

Short, but man those moves stuck in my head for so long."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Yo jo, yo jo a pirate's life for me!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Rey has always been my favorites wrestler. The Mugsy Bouges of wrestling.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Who's that jumping off the sky R E Y Mysterio here we GO
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Would have worked really well in the 90s with Biker Mice From Mars and Mmmies Alive.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,That’s nice
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,619
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,61999999999
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Not surprised, in the ring he was always so animated!!!!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Mr T pities the fool who rips off his 80s cartoon.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,That’s mad
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,The greatest of all time gets his own cartoon!
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,He’s still at it?! Damn
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Imo Mysterio was always the coolest WWE wrestler.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"I loved rey mysterio growing up, this is kinda disappointing knowing i won't be able to watch this"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,BOOYAKAH
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Me yelling “Booyaka booyaka 619!” As I jump off my bunk bed in a flying elbow position headed right for my sisters dome piece
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,dude wtf is that website. toxic ads
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Holy shit!! Used to watch WWE as a kid but stopped watching it Rey Mysterio is in my top 10 favorite wrestlers i was so bummed when he retired but had no clue he RETURNED?! Good for him on both those things!! That makes me extremely happy for him
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,nice
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Wow Is he still practicing ?? How old is he now anyone know ?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,The animation is...eye popping
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Living the El Santo life
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"One of the most recognizable pro wrestlers has finally got his own Animated show, which sounds pretty awesome really."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,I'll keep an eye out for it.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"This guy came to my new startup school when I was in 4th grade and I still don’t really know who he is, but yeah! Good for him!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,The Flea can take down Mysterio any day.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Still the best character on wcw vs nwo
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,What is it about
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Nice
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,This is how I enter the bedroom with my wife
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Booyaka booyaka
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Eddie Guerrero can basically be Mexican Dick Dastardly.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Remember when he killed a guy
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Is this that Rey Spider-Man villain I keep hearing about?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,I hope they talk about how he killed someone
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,[deleted]
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Will they have the episode of him killing someone in the ring?
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Saw the title and thought it was Star Wars. Got my hopes up for nothing.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Who still watches wrestling....
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Dude killed a guy in the ring, but okay let’s give him a kid’s show

72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Much lucha was so great! Variety of characters, each with their own special move."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,You just conjured the memory of that show from the deepest corners of my mind. One of those shows you totally forget about until it gets brought up.
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,si si
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Yes! I was thinking that too.  It was on the WB on Saturdays then went to Cartoon Network and was cancelled, which sucked cause it was way better than a lot of what’s on now."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,That show always reminded me of Rey
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Twocha Lucha
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"Ay, basura¡"
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,That show was amazing. I always hoped they’d bring it back
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,God I loved that show. It feels like there were many more diverse shows as a kid in terms of setting even if characters today might be as diverse
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,"My dad always brings up that on an episode of Mucha Lucha, Rey Magnifico shows up to save the mini luchadors. Any knock off masked wrestler to him, is therefore Rey Magnifico."
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,RUTABEGA!!!
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,Muchisima Lucha
72 Dangerous Animals: Latin America,DAMN NOBODY EVER REMEMBERS THIS SHOW WHEN I BRING IT UP

Erased,"I love Twin Peaks. Even season 2, which is better on rewatch. That middle section is a bit rough, but it all pulls together in the end, and there are no fully bad episodes.

That being said, the Evelyn plot can go to hell. It's completely pointless.

I've always felt that it was the victim of a last minute rewrite, possibly due to Lynch and Frost returning for the final few episodes.

It's structurally weird. James rides off from Twin Peaks on his bike leaving Donna behind, meets Evelyn, gets in over his head (not easy with that head), and Donna saves his ass. So James...rides off on his bike leaving Donna behind again. What exactly was achieved here?

The logical thing would be for James to realize how much he needs Donna, and for them to leave town (and the show) together, getting a mutual happy ending. Buuuut then someone decided that Donna had to stick around so she could be one of the decoy victims in the beauty pageant and also a prop in Ben Horne's arc where it turns out she's his kid. So she needs to stay. So James just leaves, which he was doing anyway. So the subplot might as well have never happened.

Just my theory."

i know he’s in the books, but at that point in season 7 we’re already beyond them, so who cares. shoehorning him into the dany storyline, creating this fake love triangle, etc.

Erased,Stranger Things - X-Men episode
Erased,"I'm rewatching The Mandalorian to get ready for season 3 and I think the answer for this show is easily Boba Fett. All the other character reappearances make sense for the overall plot of the season of Mando tracking down a Jedi to hand Grogu off to... except Boba Fett. He inexplicably pops up out of absolutely *nowhere*, has nothing to do with the plot other than promising to help Din track Grogu down (which Din does via Bill Burr without much help from Boba Fett anyway) and then he leaves.

And then yeah, Book of Boba Fett was weirdly bad. His motivation throughout is unclear and not a whole lot *really* seems to happen. He takes over a town in Tattooine for some reason, I guess relating to him wanting to have some kind of clan? Family? I have no idea. It has nothing to do with Din or Grogu though.

It'd be pretty easy to retcon him out of the episode where Grogu gets kidnapped, simply not make Book of Boba Fett, and then start Mandalorian S3 with the two (incredible) episodes of Book of Boba Fett that are entirely focused on Din and/or Grogu... and don't feature Boba Fett at all."

Erased,The leviathan arc from Supernatural. I'd miss the Charlie character but maybe they'd find another way to bring her on.
Erased,"How I Met Your Mother - the entire ending storyline.  Throwing away the character growth from Robin and Barney, turning The Mother into a way for Robin to not want kids but still end up with Ted, ignoring the years of storytelling that Ted and Robin just don't work together, etc.  All so they could use the ending they filmed 8 years earlier that no longer fit the story they had told."
Erased,The X-Files: Whatever chunks of vomit Chris Carter strung into a failed attempt at a coherent mythology post-Season 7. *Especially* the Seasons 9-10 mytharc.
Erased,The theater troupe in season 3 of Deadwood. Might have worked if s4 had happened and it had been capitalized on in some way. But as it is it's the one part of the show that feels entirely pointless on rewatch. Brian Cox is quite a talent to waste on that plotline as well.
Erased,"Gilmore Girls - Rory and Dean getting back together when he was married to Lindsey.  Dean was so pathetic by this time, and it was completely unnecessary to the storyline.  Also putting it in the same episode when they finally put Lorelai & Luke together."

Erased,"Doctor Who and the Timeless Child. Over time I have started to accept it, but it wasn’t handled well, blatantly broke the “show, don’t tell” rule, and was literally chucked down the garbage chute in the end."
Erased,"I’d adjust the ending of White Lotus season 2 to be a huge misunderstanding between Tania/Portia and the gays. This would require erasing Jack’s drunken ramblings to Portia and the picture of Greg in the villa. I’d want Tania to be coked up and paranoid that the gays were trying to kill her, so she’d kill them just like in the show, but in fact they were just fabulous and trying to show her a good time. Then she’d still get away with it because of her wealth."
Erased,The fake serial killer plot in the Wire season 5. That plot weighed down an otherwise fantastic season.
Erased,Person of Interest: Removing any of the out of nowhere romance between Caviezel and Taraji P Henson's characters. They were a great duo without any romance needed. Having Reese profess his love for her just as she dies was ridiculous and unearned.

Erased,I also hated the storyline in Orange is the New Black with the panty business
Erased,Brooklyn Nine Nine's baby storyline. Just felt like they threw it in because that's what the average viewer expects as the natural progression of love between two people.

Erased,"Season 4 of Prison Break. Even if they kept doing the show, and they shouldn't have, the whole Homeland Security stuff was just dog shit."

Community: The stuff with Jeff’s dad. It never goes anywhere til it does, and when it does, it’s a wet fart. Maybe it would’ve been better if s4 was run by Harmon but we’ll never know. 

Sopranos: Janice’s presence post s2. This one’s kind of unfair and overall I’m fine with it, it’s my favorite show ever. But I would’ve much preferred to see the rumored plans for s3 if Nancy Marchand didn’t die. Her ghost looms over the rest of the series by her personality playing out in AJ and Janice but it’s not the same and not done as well when they try to hit those points. Additionally, again while it’s all well and fine, there’s not a single storyline Janice is in from s3 on that she couldn’t have been replaced in OR that couldn’t have been just scrapped altogether. 

The Wire: The entire newspaper story in s5. Bad. Awful way to end the series. Wire deserved better. 

The Shield: I have two here. First, basically anything with Tina in the later seasons. Pointless character. Second, Julien’s personal life. What started out as arguably the second main story line of the show kind of just gets swept under the rug and barely mentioned later in the series. It ends up being a complete waste.

What they did instead was pretty unforgivable."
Erased,"How I met your mother — Barney and Robin never should have fallen in love with each other. That single decision basically ruined the last 2 seasons. That’s a little dramatic, there were still a bunch of good episodes, but it ruined the big story. And it also ruined a bunch of episodes.

Idk maybe the writers were so hacky at that point they wouldn’t have been able to write anything better. 

God I also just remembered Ted trying to tear down a building and the girl from house trying to stop him. And the captain. Fuck that guy sucked. Why did this one-note joke character play such a huge role in the last couple seasons, it wasn’t even a funny note. What the hell were they thinking"
Erased,"I'd erase Season 6 of LOST. There are some excellent moments (Terry O'Quinn throughout, Sun and Jin's acting on the sub, Jack's last scene), but overall it's a mess. The flash-sideways reality gets hyped up when Desmond wakes up from it, but it doesn't impact the main storyline *at all*, then you have a new faction of Others introduced that brings nothing to the table (even with Hiroyuki Sanada involved, the Temple episodes are a snooooze), and a bunch of seemingly important characters sidelined at the last minute (Widmore's plan doesn't matter, Sawyer gets nothing to do in the last season, etc.).

If the show ended on the season 5 finale, I think it would've pissed a lot of people off a la Sopranos, but it's an interesting ambiguous point to end the story on, and I think a lot of folks' headcanon endings would be more interesting than what we ended up with.

I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this, and I don't begrudge them. But I've always felt like a man without a country between the people who never liked Lost to begin with and the superfans who to this day see nothing wrong with the complete abandonment of the science vs. faith dichotomy and lean on the ""it was always about the characters!"" refrain when discussing plot failings."

Based on the image and description I think under 20, so I didn't try it"
Blazing Transfer Students,"I agree. It is ridiculous in a good way. Like it is not supposed to be that good. It doesn't take itself serious at all. It's a shame that Netflix didn't do any promo for it. (At least in Italy, where I am visiting.)"
Blazing Transfer Students,"It's basically a live-action show, but everything is done as if it's an anime. Not really sure what the target audience would be for something like that tbh. It's not a kids show though."
Blazing Transfer Students,I'm 33 and I'm enjoying it just fine. Just depends on your sense of humor and whether you like anime.
Blazing Transfer Students,"I'd say if you're a big fan of anime/manga and its tropes you'll absolutely enjoy it, especially something like Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo or other satirical series.

Age-wise I'd say it's actually better if you're over 20."
Blazing Transfer Students,"It’s kinda boring tbh. 6 episodes in and I don’t care about the characters, the writers aren’t doing a good job trying to establish friendships, the drama and conflict can be dull, gossip girl was revealed in the first episode and it’s creepy and weird. It’s just so disappointing because I was really rooting for this reboot. I really loved the og show. I’m still going to finish the season to see if my mind is changed but if it isn’t and the show gets renewed (which it probably will) I don’t think I’ll continue pass that point."
Blazing Transfer Students,Trash
Blazing Transfer Students,"Completely rudderless and uneventful.

There’s nothing to this. 

I appreciate the modernization of the show and making it more diverse but I really don’t understand why there needed to be a reboot

I was for the reboot at the start hoping it would have a similar flair to the original but after watching the six episodes. There’s nothing to this. 

The “I’m a bully” scene was just cringeworthy and none of the characters are likeable even in the original you could like Chuck, Blair and Jenny despite their general awfulness. There’s also no iconic-ness to the reboot. 

Serena entering to high society to “What goes around/comes around” with Chuck saying “well it’s about time, things were getting a bit dull around here” was instantly iconic. With the reboot, there’s nothing to care about here. 

The reboot is just boring.

Blazing Transfer Students,"LOL!) Thank you for visiting this thread

but I think the patterns don't have to do much with the show itself"
Blazing Transfer Students,You’re examples are hilariously extreme but I agree. I’ve watched the show since the first season and am watching the second season on Netflix now. The dialogue is so clunky and awkward. But it has so many good moments that you can tell the writers aren’t awful but just aren’t great.
Blazing Transfer Students,This sounds like every CW show
Blazing Transfer Students,"yeah, i watch a lot of the terrible CW shows, mostly the Arrowverse stuff and Riverdale, but on the whole, they usually suffer from a lot of the same issues that you mention, so i'm not really surprised. it's probably a demographic thing, or the fact that they can pretty much be as bad as they want to be, since the deal with netflix ensures that they can stay on the air as long as the showrunners want. the CW doesn't cancel anything anymore. 

the only shows on the network that i could say are actual quality would be The 100 and In The Dark, but your mileage may vary on those even"
Blazing Transfer Students,Completely wrong. All American is best new age teen drama. Black leads teen drama at that. They cover material other shows won’t.
Blazing Transfer Students,its a lame show...tired cliche stuff and WOKE liberal crap...its so far from reality its pathetic
Blazing Transfer Students,Facts
Blazing Transfer Students,Have you seen Roswell? It's actually really bloody good for a cw show. I avoided it for the longest because i thought it was gonna be like the 90's version and just be about straight up sappy romance but it's actually really good writing imo and the romance is second to the paranormal plot and everything. You should check it out
Blazing Transfer Students,"The material that they cover is fine, it's just a horribly written show. The dialogue is terrible."
Blazing Transfer Students,I disagree.

The Little Nyonya,Would love some bloopers
The Little Nyonya,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
The Little Nyonya,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
The Little Nyonya,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
The Little Nyonya,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
The Little Nyonya,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
The Little Nyonya,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
The Little Nyonya,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
The Little Nyonya,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
The Little Nyonya,Gotta get my fix!
The Little Nyonya,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
The Little Nyonya,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
The Little Nyonya,Cool advert
The Little Nyonya,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
The Little Nyonya,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
The Little Nyonya,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
The Little Nyonya,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
The Little Nyonya,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
The Little Nyonya,The Laughs Of Us.
The Little Nyonya,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
The Little Nyonya,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
The Little Nyonya,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you’ll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it’s ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it’s a story worth experiencing via it’s original medium first."
The Little Nyonya,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you’re not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
The Little Nyonya,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
The Little Nyonya,Play Part 1 as it won’t spoil anything and it’s an incredible game. Don’t play part 2 if you don’t want the rest of the show spoiled
The Little Nyonya,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
The Little Nyonya,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
The Little Nyonya,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
The Little Nyonya,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
The Little Nyonya,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
The Little Nyonya,Maybe they’re saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
The Little Nyonya,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
The Little Nyonya,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
The Little Nyonya,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
The Little Nyonya,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Prove me wrong."
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
The Little Nyonya,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
The Little Nyonya,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
The Little Nyonya,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
The Little Nyonya,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
The Little Nyonya,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I’d prefer
The Little Nyonya,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
The Little Nyonya,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
The Little Nyonya,That’s too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
The Little Nyonya,"Unfortunately it’s not on PC until the end of this month, and it’s $60 so probably won’t be cheap for a while."
The Little Nyonya,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
The Little Nyonya,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
The Little Nyonya,The easiet gottem of all time
The Little Nyonya,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The Little Nyonya,"In case this is serious, no it’s not a spoiler lol. Just happens in video games a lot"
The Little Nyonya,"It’s a joke, bro. They both die a lot while playing the game."
The Little Nyonya,"Games been out almost 10 years.  If you missed it that long, that's on you."
The Little Nyonya,Let's put a pin in that.
The Little Nyonya,"Yeah as people have pointed out, when you take out all the slow sneaking, puzzle solving, and random combat out, the actual plot of the final chapter of the game is only like 15 minutes"
The Little Nyonya,I would have liked a little more of the connective tissue between sections of the game. I think we probably could have gotten 12 or 13 episodes while giving us little asides during their trip to KC or the three month gap on their way to Colorado.
The Little Nyonya,"The show doesn't need to be constrained by the game, as they showed with episode 3 (an example i liked) and introducing the Kathleen character (an example I liked less)."
The Little Nyonya,By using the episodes to show more of a relationship between Joel and Ellie. 8 episodes so far and 2 of them were basically standalones.
The Little Nyonya,"well they already added stuff into the show that wasn’t in the game, so they could’ve just idk, wrote more into the storyline.

i dont care either way but its not like they couldn’t have done it."
The Little Nyonya,They could have easily flexed their writing chops and added more episodes. Develop relationships properly to have better payoffs instead of introducing a character and killing them off the same episode.
The Little Nyonya,"Yeah, not two seasons, but I think 10 or 11 episodes would have been better. The quality of TLOU isn't in the Joel and Ellie story alone. It's that they exist in a lived in world. They spent an episode on Bill and Frank. Everyone loved it. It had a very limited connection to the game, outside of them existing in the game. They gave KC residents two halves of two episodes. They gave the DLC an episode. They opened with that couple living in the middle of nowhere. It's the world building naughtydog did that gave TLOU a foundation to tell a great story.

Give me an episode on ish and kyle getting people together, and their downfall... Hell, that's easily two episodes with ish writing on the wall to no go inside, and wandering off closing the episode.

I think they really missed the best part of the game by hiding an Easter egg for ish.


I also dislike how little time we spend with Joel and Ellie just talking, but I don't see how that extends episode count vs making episodes unbearably longer."
The Little Nyonya,"Doesnt have to be just the game look at ep3 and the whole bill thing, couldve ran s1 to the end of the city or even joel getting injured if you want to add some story beats to the cannibal arc. Point being it doesnt feel like joel and ellie have the same relationship they had in the game, even abit forced at times, and thats not going to make me care when xyz happens in a s2 based on a game that hit pretty 'meh' to begin with.

And thats a mild take, imagine those that are still seething about xyz happening at all"
The Little Nyonya,"The last ep could have been 2-3 eps easy. And with one episode left, it really doesn't feel like there's enough room to finish the story properly. (I hope to be proven wrong, but expect it to be rushed)

And theres a bunch of stiff that could have been in there, that just isn't.

There was easily enough content for 15-18 eps"
The Little Nyonya,"Was thinking the same, but they can be angy and enjoy their subpar seasons 2 & 3, god forbid 4

S1EP3 best itll ever be"
The Little Nyonya,"Well get ready for that with 2nd game, i could see two 8 ep seasons doing just fine for the first"
The Little Nyonya,No one's reading all that. Don't watch if you don't like it🤷‍♂️
The Little Nyonya,[removed]
The Little Nyonya,"I played the game...and the fakeouts are very obviously fake outs, otherwise the story ends"
The Little Nyonya,"That’s why I was having a hard time seeing people say ep 8 & 9 needed to be longer when they saw their run times 

Like, take out all the gameplay and combat and plot wise I can see how the creators said we don’t need a full hour"
The Little Nyonya,Yeah. They did that entirely anyways. Imagine being ok with them not spending at least 1 episode on it. Or injected as 5 minute set pieces each episode.
The Little Nyonya,"Kathleen was fine, I guess. I just find it weird that they spent two episodes with her, Henry, and Sam. Henry and Sam have an effect on Joel and Ellie, sure, but a lot of Ellie’s development comes from her time with David. We saw a lot of it, but something was missing. I don’t know what, but if KC can have two episodes, there’s no reason they couldn’t flesh out David & James more, or alternatively expand on what the ending is. 43 minutes is short to wrap it up, regardless of if there’s so much gameplay."
The Little Nyonya,"It's both really, episode 3 was great but looking at the season as a whole it feels like each episode is an ""arc"" and it's missing some connective tissue. There's a lot of talk about how the game is about 14 hours anyway and they can use all that gameplay time to flesh out other characters, which is great, but it's during the gameplay that Joel and Ellie's relationship builds. The show is still really good but I think they could've struck a better balance with another episode or two."
The Little Nyonya,"The rest of the game from this point is under 30 minutes even including all the gameplay, stopping to listen to the recorders, reading the notes, etc. So they could cut to an actual play through of all the remaining content and it would only fill half the time slot, being rushed isn’t a concern. (I checked a play through on YouTube for the actual runtime. 28 minutes from David’s death to the end credits.)"
The Little Nyonya,"who says i dont like both of them? 

i just say that are the same story, with the same principal character."
The Little Nyonya,That's why they're saying they would be funny post show behind the scenes bloopers. Not something seriously used in the show.
The Little Nyonya,"8 could have been longer. We definitely missed out on David and Ellie having to fight off infected , that would have been a great 10 minute segment in the show as it was important in the game"
The Little Nyonya,"Episode 3: universally lauded for all the extra material added by the show runners.

Episode 9: let's just rush through it as fast as possible because it was all gameplay."
The Little Nyonya,"The show has fallen into the trap if ""its a zombie apocalypse with no zombies"" 

A brief aside where they encounter infected, like the tunnel section of the game, is kinda needed for world building.

That and a few more moments of actually showing us the relationship they've forged. (Including the DLC, instead of showing us in the present, was absolutely a mistep).

And a little more space to let the ending breath, and possibly even a moment to set up the next beat, wouldn't go astray.

But there's not the runtime for that now.

I dunno. I guess we all find our tomorrow night how they go with the finale."
The Little Nyonya,"You say this as if this isn't an entire subgenre of content - a kid and a father / parental figure. You'll find a lot of other shows and movies like this, I think you're basing most of your opinion on the fact that Pedro acts in both and both are airing simultaneously."
The Little Nyonya,"Craig Mazin has a podcast with Neil Druckmann where they explain that things like that are combat for the game. They work for the game. It would not necessarily translate for a show. Repeated infected would get old, fast. See: TWD. 

I also would watch the show for what it is, and not always compare it to the game. It keeps the core story but does its own thing

I’m grateful for Craig and Neil’s adaptation/translation"
The Little Nyonya,Both episodes were very highly reviewed. Episode 8 has the second highest user score of the series and received largely positive critic reviews. It’s not like it got trashed
The Little Nyonya,"I never said that at all.

And the scene I mentioned isn’t repeated infected and a slog of a scene. 5-10 minute scene of them fighting off a hoard would have absolutely worked on the show."
The Little Nyonya,"The combat section with David was what causes him to eye her. How the fuck David saying Ellie has a ""violent heart"" even makes sense when he and the audience didn't see her engaging in violence in the show?"
The Little Nyonya,The title of my sex tape!
The Little Nyonya,"I enjoyed it.

Waltz is playing the kind of person that got him Oscars. That he outshines the rest of the cast is the biggest problem.

There’s a lot of loose strings too.

Still kept me guessing while binging."
The Little Nyonya,"I enjoyed the show, it was fun and had me guessing on all the weird stuff...but LITERALLY NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED.  The ending to the show SUCKED ASS."
The Little Nyonya,The “prime video” curse
The Little Nyonya,It was so weird I kept watching it but I agree ultimately it was just meh.
The Little Nyonya,Kinda weird review to lead with not having watched past episode 3.
The Little Nyonya,"Did anyone read the book?  I really don't want a season 2, but is there more to the story?  I feel like they got everything wrong that Severance got right."
The Little Nyonya,Could've *Consulted* someone on how to make a good show that's for sure 🥁💥
The Little Nyonya,"Binged it. It's not bad, just expect a weird dark comedy. The worst thing about it is that it doesnt explain everything at the end, and there's way too many loose threads. They didn't own up to the mystery that was set up at the beginning, and that brings it down a major amount for me to the point that I wouldn't recommend it."
The Little Nyonya,"Watched it all this afternoon. It was ok.
But so many holes..inconsistency in the character development. The main 3 all changed so much without much reason.

Plus there was next to no resolution in the end other than the ""what he's made of"" bit. Also seemed like the consultant had done much worse stuff previously.. and towards the end outside of the what the show presented in general.

I mean its entertaining but some really poor execution in character building and the story itself overall"
Beyond Stranger Things,I cannot find these pics anywhere. Maybe its possible to grab some frames from the intro and clean up the graphics. Did anybody already do this?

Beyond Stranger Things,"Grace Van Dien:
>“Here’s the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,” Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

>Van Dien added that though she’s sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon — and on her own terms.

>“I’m happy here, and I’m developing my own projects,” she said. “I’m hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I’m not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.”"

Beyond Stranger Things,who was she on stranger things?

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
Beyond Stranger Things,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it’s getting really hard to see past it.
Beyond Stranger Things,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
Beyond Stranger Things,She should name the projects and producers.
Beyond Stranger Things,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
Beyond Stranger Things,Good for her.
Beyond Stranger Things,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I’m happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don’t usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that’s just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Beyond Stranger Things,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Beyond Stranger Things,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Beyond Stranger Things,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Beyond Stranger Things,Chrissy woke up!!!
Beyond Stranger Things,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Beyond Stranger Things,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Beyond Stranger Things,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Beyond Stranger Things,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Beyond Stranger Things,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Beyond Stranger Things,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Beyond Stranger Things,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Beyond Stranger Things,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Beyond Stranger Things,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Beyond Stranger Things,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Beyond Stranger Things,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Beyond Stranger Things,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
Beyond Stranger Things,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Beyond Stranger Things,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Beyond Stranger Things,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Beyond Stranger Things,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Beyond Stranger Things,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
Beyond Stranger Things,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Beyond Stranger Things,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Beyond Stranger Things,"Understandable, have a great day"
Beyond Stranger Things,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Beyond Stranger Things,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Beyond Stranger Things,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Beyond Stranger Things,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Beyond Stranger Things,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Beyond Stranger Things,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Beyond Stranger Things,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
Beyond Stranger Things,Name them!
Beyond Stranger Things,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."
Beyond Stranger Things,Wait… that jawline. I just realized she’s Rico’s daughter.
Beyond Stranger Things,No idea who this is
Beyond Stranger Things,Hollywoods gunna Hollywood
Beyond Stranger Things,"Common Hollywood L

Sadly doing so puts their career and money at risk"
Beyond Stranger Things,"A producer asked his girlfriend to ask Grace if she would like to have a threesome. 

She decided not to. Then cried about it. Then left 

What a load of overblown hysterics."
Beyond Stranger Things,"""star"""
Beyond Stranger Things,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn’t still the case.
Beyond Stranger Things,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Beyond Stranger Things,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Beyond Stranger Things,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Beyond Stranger Things,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Beyond Stranger Things,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Inaccurate title: ‘Stranger Things’ Star

‘Stranger Things’ Actor more like it - she's in 1 episode, and 2 flashbacks (uncredited)

Regardless - why is this still happening? Did Hollywood ignore the Harvey Weinstein crap"
Beyond Stranger Things,[removed]
Beyond Stranger Things,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
Beyond Stranger Things,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Beyond Stranger Things,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

Beyond Stranger Things,Totally understand. I wish she would name names. These animals need to be outed.
Beyond Stranger Things,"I'm a bit confused. Inapptiateness withstanding...is she turning down these roles because those several offers were associated with said producer? If so, I totally get it. But to turn down all work indiscriminately? Idk...sounds like we are missing some info here."
Beyond Stranger Things,She needs to get her dad to kick some ass.
Beyond Stranger Things,The number of people defending the dude as just asking her out is pathetic.
Beyond Stranger Things,Chrissy wake up!!! I don't like this!!! Chrissssssy wake up. I didn't know who she was in Stranger Things from the picture without looking her up. Fyi she is Chrissy from S4. Too bad she has to deal with creep producers but it looks like she has been streaming on Twitch so at least she is enjoy still making content.
Beyond Stranger Things,Wait til she finds out about the people on twitch too
Beyond Stranger Things,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Beyond Stranger Things,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein … you of all people can somehow get away with it …

Good for her honestly. She’s making money and she doesn’t even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you’re mad you’re just jealous because she’s living the dream."
Beyond Stranger Things,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Beyond Stranger Things,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Beyond Stranger Things,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Beyond Stranger Things,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Not the point of the article, but: Does anyone else not remember her in Stranger Things?"
Beyond Stranger Things,So who’s the producer? Get the name out and hopefully he’ll never produce anything again
Beyond Stranger Things,"Apparently if you want to bang women while in a position of power and authority over them, but are dumb and can't become a teacher, you become a sleazy EP."
Beyond Stranger Things,The two Coreys took a huge hit for talking about what happened to them. They were mocked reviled and blacklisted. All because pedos make money for Hollywood.
Beyond Stranger Things,"""Stranger things star""

Bit generous, that."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Hollywood is friggin gross. Always has been always will be, until there’s no more Hollywood."
Beyond Stranger Things,"Awful through and through.

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It’s arguable she’s laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

This scum bag probably has a reputation for doing it much the same."

Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Letterman Carson and Ferguson are the only hosts I ever enjoyed watching.

I am enjoying how no one here seems to care about Leno, which is good IMO"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Ferguson > everyone else.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Everyone>>>>>>that fat cunt
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Johnny Carson did it better than anyone. Any list without him is worthless.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Letterman's the only one I've ever really liked.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Born in 95, these are the ones I've watched over the years and how I rank them

Letterman

Conan

Stewart

Colbert (TCR)

Leno

Meyers 

Ferguson 

Fallon

Kimmel

Colbert (TLS)

Noah 

Corden"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Carson, Snyder, Letterman, Ferguson, Conan (on his 1st show).

Absolutely the best of the best, and I feel like the others won't really be remembered. Snyder doesn't get mentioned too much, but his show had the best late night feel to it due to not having an audience.

Carson, letterman, and Ferguson shared the same producer, Peter Lasally. He must have been great at his job."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Myers for Corrections and A closer look.

Colbert for monologues...sometimes.

Conan for pure chaos and his remotes.

Trevor for some smarter commentary and jokes, plus Klepper is a stellar remote / interviewer.


The rest, meh."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"1. John Oliver - completely hilarious (bonus of HBO and cursing) and delivers genuinely insightful political commentary. A nerdy but sincere and likable guy.

2. Conan (pls bring him back, he is the funniest on the list)

3. Trevor Noah - I think he’s really funny and the show has some great bits (Jordan Klepper is great). I always like the monologues rest is pretty solid too.

4. Stephen Colbert - probably a little high, but gets some bonus points for Colbert Report. Very hit or miss. Sometimes this guy is pretty unfunny, but when he hits, I think it’s as close to Conan as we get.

5. Kimmel - don’t really understand how he gets any hate, but, calling him boring is more than fair. Pretty plain guy but always seems like he is genuinely having a great time. The best bits in the game (mean tweets, street interviews) and a usually good monologue

6. Meyers - haven’t watched a lot but what I have seen made literally no impression on me. Not good. Not bad. Meh.

7. Fallon - certainly the inferior Jimmy. So ugh. I don’t really like much of any of his stuff. Often crosses into downright annoying.

8. Maher - unfunny and mean

9. Corden - is James Corden"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I can remember the age of Carson and I still think Conan is the GOAT. Unlike the bulk of those who followed him, he doesn't rely on mean-spirited mockery of those he believes his audience will hate as much as he does. He can engage anyone in an interesting and funny conversation, knowing when he needs to take the lead and when he needs to let the subject do their own thing.

I like Trevor Noah as a standup comedian, but his stint on the Daily Show was largely as a mouthpiece for a writer's room that doesn't seem to speak with his voice.

Craig Ferguson is always a great interviewer and keeps it light, but he's more of a personality for interviews than the kind of full-featured host in the vein of a Johnny Carson.

I'm not sure it counts as 'late night', but Graham Norton has some of the better interviews out there as well.

Letterman I thought was great when he started out, but slowly morphed into cranky-old-man territory near the end."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I guess based on overall how much I watch their clips on youtube and/or made a point to watch episodes in the past.


Conan > Stephen Colbert (CBS, not the Report) > Seth Meyers > Trevor Noah > Jimmy Kimmel > Letterman (didn't really watch him) > James Corden (above Fallon because the multi-guest format is at least more interesting) > Jimmy Fallon

Some have better strengths than others though. I like Seth's interviews better than Noah's, but I like politics so I enjoy the Daily Show focus more."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I am from Slovakia so we didn't get to see many late night shows. The only one that I can remember broadcasting(replay) when in high school was Letterman, so used to watch that every morning 7am when eating breakfast before school(me my brother and my dad) and we always had a good laugh. 

10 years later, I started exploring YouTube and late night shows, and I've watched tons of clips from Kimmel, Fallon, Ferguson, Colbert, Norton, Conan, Ross....

So I've seen pretty much all the biggest clips from those, but I'm not waiting for each show to air. Just jump on YouTube and if there's a clip with some actor/celebrity that I like I watch it. 

As I am getting older the funniest to me are older clips of Letterman and whatever Conan does. Conan's sketches, trips etc. are legendary. Also Norton has some amazing clips. But that's just my opinion."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,I’m trying to remember who the tv show host was around 1996 late at night who was a European blonde male. The show was like a jerry springer type show
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Who's that at the door!?!?!
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Totally. Was spoiled by him so much, I can't even really get into these contemporaries."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Agree. The question should be who's #2?

Throw Dick Cavett and Arsenio Hall in there, too. And would Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen count?"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Lassally is a legend, but Letterman did his best work before Lassally came on board for the CBS show."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"The pioneer of the late night talk show was actually a woman, actress Faye Emerson, who hosted interviews and gave her own political commentary in 1949 on ""The Faye Emerson Show,"" often from a couch in a living room. It was a 15 minute show. 

Steve Allen really developed the format about 5 years later, bringing more entertainment value to the format. Allen brought the desk onto the set, and it's been the centerpiece of most talk shows. Arsenio certainly is on the list, and he didn't really use a desk. 

Carson did it for 4 decades, an inimitable feat in today's world. Cavett may have had the best guests of any of them, so he gets bonus points for that.  

Sullivan really was a host of an entertainment show. I wouldn't put him in this group."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Good stuff. Thanks for the info, I enjoyed the read."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"That new guy, Lorne, sure seems to know what he's doing!"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"the success is due to Kyle ""The Franchise"" Mooney"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"That's because almost nobody is watching late night broadcast tv. 

The viewership has fallen off a cliff in the last 10 years. Jimmy Kimmel made a meal if this fact at some ABC event he hosted a couple weeks ago. 

“[Networks] need to stop trying to be cool. We’re like a grandpa in skinny jeans. We’re not cool. Isn’t there something to be said for dying with dignity? Somehow, with everyone stuck in their house and nothing to do but watch TV for the past 14 months, we still managed to lose ratings!” 

So great news for them but the ratings standards these days are extremely low. It also doesn't help that SNL is no longer the place to be for the best comedians. They all get better exposure on YouTube and podcasting."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,">That was enough to edge Fox’s The Masked Singer and NBC’s This Is Us (both of which are at 2.0 ratings) for the top spot. It’s well clear of the second-highest-rated comedy, CBS’ Young Sheldon (1.2 rating).

Masked Singer, This is Us, and Young Sheldon.  That was the top 'competition', lol.

Good for SNL, you can only beat who you play, but with not only streaming eroding that demographic but almost no original programming competing with NHL and NBA playoffs.....well, congrats SNL."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,No one in that demo watches TV...
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,The bar is set pretty low already.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Probably because everything else people watch in that demographic is on streaming.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Every moment of this intro felt like a hostage situation.

Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I’ll be honest I didn’t particularly find SNL funny for a long time. There were a few things that I laughed at like the game show skits but that’s about it. Lots of things that made OG SNL funny was the overacting and silliness but comedy changes with time and I don’t think that type of skit would get the same reception now. For a long time the comedy just wasn’t there, for me at least. As I’m sure you’ve figured out it wasn’t a show I particularly enjoyed. Now though, I really do. I think a lot of the cast can be so funny. Some hosts come on and really make it their own now too. I don’t watch the show but I certainly enjoy watching the skits when recommended on YouTube. I don’t hate SNL. It’s gotten a lot better."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I know a lot of people that watch it because of Jost/Che, weekend update has never been better - except the Norm/O.J. years, and even that is debatable.

I'm still pissed about the Chris Brown thing though."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,They low key helped me to see the funny in a lot of the shitty parts of the pandemic.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Maybe this will stop the periodic “SNL’s ratings are terrible threads” over at that sub.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,What is it competing against?
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Haven’t watched in years. Are they funny? Used to be a day when they were great.
I saw Kevin Nealon at a comedy club. Actually hated him but gf talked into it. He was insane funny but didn’t show on snl. Same goes for others. The show is too. ??? Confining."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Football is king
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,maybe now being live in primetime on the west coast might helped with that
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Going into the SNL subreddit is like going into bizzarroland. It's full of people who get offended by everything which is usually the antithesis of a comedy audience.

I guess that explains why SNL is so bland and inoffensive now and why they have to preface actually funny bits with ""these aren't jokes we'd usually tell""."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"because people 18-49 still watching TV are lame, not because of the quality of any given programming"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Is that because no one between the ages of 18-49 are watching late night non-sports shows because they are all garbage?
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Only so much cringe and ads a person can take.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,SNL hasn't been funny for years.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Still crap
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,I find this hard to believe.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Insane, I’ve watched snl past couple years for pretty much just the awkward cringe factor.  Every episode I always catch myself saying “man snl has gotten bad” lol.
I still watch it though, kinda like tradition almost so maybe that’s why they stay relevant.  But it’s FOR SURE the worst it’s ever been in my opinion."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Milk toast comedy reaching the lowest common denominator is nothing to cheer. It’s an average comedy show with outsized self-worth and reverence, and staffed by “comedians” who come across more like dinner theater actors."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,To bad they didn’t keep Shane Gillis it would possibly be watchable.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Are they making Biden/Harris skits? Funny how ripping on the current president suddenly ended despite being a staple since its beginning.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"This probably speaks more about NBC's other shows than it does SNL.   Not only is SNL arguably bad,   this is less than half their ratings of only a couple years ago."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Not a good season... 
hope next year brings some good stuff"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Probably helps that it’s live on the west coast now. I can watch at 8:30pm instead of the middle of the night.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Oooookaaaaay...
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Well I can see how SNL manages to stick around despite having so little going for it anymore, at least in my personal opinion."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,But I was told the show would tank after Trump left office...
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,SNL is low IQ entertainment. I have never even laughed once watching that bullshit.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,SNL is so played out. Hasn’t been good since the 90s early 2000s. Put a fork in it!
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,It only took a pandemic. Congrats! /s
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,ever since their first show after the pandemic hiatus SNL has been soo funny. i also really love this cast and the guest list has been really good.  i don’t watch broadcast tv tho lol- i can not stand the commercials. i watch snl on hulu - i hope that helps the show.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,People still watch that shit?
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,And the show couldnt be any worse than it is right now.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Congrats, SNL. You're the top of the heap.

A very short, flat, broad heap... but top."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,If only SNL was still funny.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"They lost me as a life-long viewer years ago. It's too bad that they have to be so hateful towards a certain group. I won't go back. I quit TV as a whole, and don't regret it."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"SNL sketches are unwatchable. Weekend Update is okay, not great, but looks fantastic by comparison. They gotta stop aiming for the Lib audience, their humour is the joke equivalent of a twitter wine mom. They should take some notes from the latest Bo Burnham special."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,[deleted]
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Best eps of the season.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Good season!
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,I don’t usually watch the full show but the weekend update is pretty dam funny. Just YouTube it
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"On a tangent ratings in general are becoming increasingly less meaningful over time as streaming services get an increasingly larger share of revenue versus live broadcast channels. The rating for SNL for instance doesn’t include people who watched the show later on, say, Peacock or watched sketches from it on Youtube. And Netflix and Disney+, for example, aren’t rated since they aren’t live broadcasting but obviously the top shows on those services earn quite a lot of money. In a landscape where more and more people watch whatever they want whenever they want on increasingly fragmented services the notion of “best in time slot” is less relevant every day."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"The current season has to compete with satellite TV and the internet streaming, netflix, hulu, HBO, etc...that being said...

The top five-rated seasons of SNL (Nielsen household rating in parentheses):  
  
1979-’80 (13.5)  
1978-’79 (13.1)  
1977-’78 (9.8)  
1980-’81 (9.5)  
1992-’93 (9.1)"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Election year was good to them.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,i bet this is to do with drews video.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"People complain about SNL being rote or predictable, but I gotta say, I think Lorne knows something we don't. The man has stayed relevant in American comedy for 40 years at this point, and still printing out new generations of A-list talent. Say what you will about SNL but I think that's an achievement."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,All they are doing is pandering to the Gen Z and alphabet audience.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Didn't Bart Gets an F get like 32 million viewers. Insanity.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I don't think network TV will ever go away, and this kind of proves that. There will always be a market for live and alternative entertainment that just doesn't fit in the streaming game. Netflix has tried time after time to make variety shows work, and outside of comedy specials it just doesn't. Only some reality shows do. Sports and other live entertainment certainly don't. There will always be a market for that stuff and it will always be the easiest and cheapest to access it via a network TV-like structure. 50 million people might watch a given Netflix show on the weekend it premieres, but a few million sitting through ads to watch something live is very valuable too."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"They do get money from Hulu and YouTube though I think. I don’t think that 2.06 incorporates those numbers, but I really don’t know how streaming works with it. I don’t think the streamers report numbers either, except YouTube."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"And yet they still won’t pivot. Looking back I have no idea why we were perfectly OK with spending hundreds of dollars on some thing and still had to put up with commercials. And not just a little, have you watched TV lately? Commercials play nonstop. It’s like every seven minutes they cut to a commercial."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Yep.  It's truly amazing how almost no one under 50 is watching Broadcast TV.  You can see why a lot of networks have just given up, and are going to the NCIS folks and Dick Wolf to just bury themselves in the type of by the numbers procedurals the senior citizens love.

That's pretty much the only folks watching network anymore."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"even in the 90s, a show that airs at 11pm on a saturday wouldn't exactly be the highest rated lol."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,Not disagreeing because I legitimately don’t know - so I ask this earnestly. What YouTubers or podcaster comedian in their young 20s has nearly the notoriety as a comedian as people on SNL? Are there a bunch of people who started on YouTube and podcasts who are getting high profile comedic acting roles now?
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,This isn’t just for late night tv. It’s all non-sports television.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,">That's because almost nobody *under 50* is watching ~~late night~~ broadcast tv.

FIFY"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Not to mention that ratings don't necessarily equate to people watching later on DVR or other platforms. I personally haven't watched an episode of SNL or later night in years, but do wind up looking to the best segments every week on YouTube."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"I'd be curious how frequently late night TV does well with these demographics. Like was Carson big with 18 year olds? The only late night I can think of that seemed popular with that demo was Conan and maybe Ferguson or early wilder Letterman in the 80s. Then also MadTV and Living Color. But those have all now been gone for a decade or more. It seems like most late night these days is for people 40+. I imagine it's partly because most younger people, even those in their 30s, are predominantly streaming."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,That was really well said.  Damn!!!
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,YouTube and podcasting?  The market is flooded with those.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Masked Singer used to be really big (*and This is Us used to come up every now and then*), but the fact that they're not really flying either is not great for them."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"It may sadden you to hear this but those three shows are the biggest shows airing right now. This is us is the biggest drama, young Sheldon the biggest sitcom, and masked singer the biggest competition/idol type show. Only a couple streaming shows like the mcu ones are bigger"
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,These shows air at that time slot on Saturday nights? I always figured they were prime time shows.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,The joke swap bit is the best thing to happen to Weekend Update since they lost Steffon and Bill Hader
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,A bigger part is no competition whatsoever.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Blue lives matter...more. 

That is the hardest I've laughed in years."
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,I wish I laughed at Jost & Che’s jokes half as much as they do.
Siffredi Late Night - Hard Academy,"Pretty much the main reason I tune in. I love the chemistry they got, and the jokes are usually pretty funny."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Gomorrah is far superior but that being said I also loved Suburra. Love Spadino in that.

Gomorrah is a Top 3 show for me personally."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Started counterpart when it was originally on Starz. I didn’t finish it actually but heard a lot of good so might need to circle back.  I like sci-fi but I would say my #1 genre would be crime/detective/thriller types especially foreign. I rarely watch shows from US and mostly always subtitled stuff.  The tunnel is very good. Actually just finished this week. Stephen Dillane (Stannis from Game of thrones) is excellent.  It is a “remake” of Bron/Broen which is one of my all time faves too. Bron has been “remade/inspired” into 5 shows and for me I’d rank them Der Pass/Pagan Peak (Germany/Austria), the Tunnel (UK/France), the Bridge (US), and then there’s a Russian/Estonian and a Malaysian one. I have not seen those. Der pass is amazing but only one season but a 2nd is coming and I cannot wait!"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"1992 was made by the people behind Gomorrah, it's really good."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Giri / Haji on Netflix - v good , stylish ! Japanese ."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I’ve been a Sopranos fan ever since the show started airing in the mid-late 90s, and Gomorrah just blew me away, it’s become quite probably my favorite TV Show of all time.  I’m gonna start watching suburra and see how it goes."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Gomorrah became my all time favorite TV Series, even above the Sopranos; Suburra grew on me, quite a great TV Show. 

Gomorrah 10 out of 10

Suburra 9 out of 10.

Gomorrah is just brutal, raw and magnificent, and Suburra great drama and has some great great characters."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Gomorrah is great, especially when that ominous theme kicks in and the camera flies above the cars, but any character I warmed to usually didn't survive the episode let alone get a story arc.  I enjoyed Suburra more, the criminals were more likeable and honest than the corrupt citizens.  I'd like to see another season or a movie spin-off; how about Samurai's back story?

I'm now enjoying ZeroZeroZero; it reminds me of McMafia.  The look of the show is very reminiscent of Gomorrah.

As for the Sopranos, I felt totally cheated that there wasn't a Scarface ending where Tony goes to war with that AR10."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Oh man. Pumped. What else rounds out your top 3?
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Bro, you're my tv soul mate...hahahahahaha. On the real though. I'm the exact same way. Crime/detective/thriller is king! Watched everything good American well before quarantine and like to think I've seen 90% of all the good tv ever made to this point. Der Pass was fucking solid. Closest I've gotten to The European ""True Detective"" narrative.  Alright this will be fun then. Hit me with 5-10 shows (we haven't already mentioned) you watched lately and enjoyed...or shows that aren't talked about much that you personally consider a hidden gem). I'll hit ya with my 5 and let's find some gems the other hasn't seen yet. I feel like we'll have seen like 4/5 things together so we'll be patient. Haha. 

1. Gangs of London (fucking modern day peaky blinders.) Loved it. Not the greatest show, just what I needed at the time. 

2. City on a Hill (never even heard of it till I started watching. Kevin Bacon is phenomenal as a shady Boston FBI agent)

3. Line of Duty (Never heard of this either, binged all 5 seasons in 3 days. For me personally, it's a 10/10). 

4. Little Drummer Girl (Different kind of good. Hard to explain. It's a hate or love it kind of show. I've never heard anybody in between. 

5. The Break (Love the psychotic main character. Solid mystery too. One of those shows where you won't know who did it until the last episode. Keeps ya bitin those nails.)

6. Got an oddball here. I was born in Russia and spent my summers there as a kid and that's where I fell in love with crime/detective fiction tv. The show that sparked this interest was called ""Kamenskaya"". Idk if that shit even mother fucking exists in English audio or subs, but if you're ever like completely clueless what to watch next and want to try something new. Why not."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"It’s just my personal opinion. Definitely the Wire and then #3 would be between Dark, The Leftovers, and Bron. Just depends on what day ya ask lol  

I can’t explain why I love Gomorrah so much but I do. It’s just so brutal and gritty and just love the characters.  Check out zerozerozero on amazon too. It’s also based on a Roberto Saviano book.  The suburra movie is also good."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Lol Awesome!!! Of your list I have actually only seen The Break (good) and Little Drummer Girl which I only found to be ok.  Mostly the lead actress bugged the shit out of me and as we all know when the lead is annoying it can hurt the entire show.  I really want to see Gangs of London and its def on my list to do its just finding a proper way. Looks like it will come stateside on AMC at some point.  I have heard of 2/3 for sure but havent watched yet.  I have not heard of Kamenskaya but did enjoy a russian show called The Method.  As far as 5 for me hmmm...

1.  Paatal Lok (Indian on Prime, had to start here...show blew my mind. Brutal)

2.  Engrenages/Spiral (French on Prime, police procedural.  Just finished S7 and it was pretty good)

3.  Trapped (Iceland also on Prime...beautiful location)

4.  Signal (Korea on Netflix...touch of sci-fi added in but mystery detective show and case is based on the real life Hwaseong serial murders which is a fascinating case as is)

5.  Sahsiyet (Turkish.  I was browsing the IMDb top 250 and it was listed at 22 soooo I had to watch.  Freaking good.  Basically a guy who finds out he has alzheimers decides to take out criminals)

6. Fauda (Israeli.  Not the usual genre but basically a show about the Israeli special forces.  The lead actor was actually in the real life elite undercover counter-terrorism unit and later Arnold Scwarzeneggars bodyguard.  I loved it.  A little over the top but plenty of action, tension, and good characters)"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Wire yes. I got lost in dark. Need to come back eventually. Loveeeee the bridge. Zero x 3 was good af. Praying for a season 2. 


So do I watch the movie after all the seasons...? Or. What's my play here?"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Alright so here's my thing...I'm hesitant on the Israeli, Indian shows. Still getting used to like the vibes of their film culture kinda...not a racist thing. Fuck. Idk. I'll try it in the coming week. 

Signal... please tell me it's not like that corny Asian acting bullshit...? Hahahah. 


Oh dude. I'm lazy right now. But I can send you a 720p w/ subs link for Gangs of London that's dope. Assuming you're a somewhat practiced online streamer? Hahahah."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Nah the Suburra movie came first actually.  Don’t think it matters all that much. I’m caught up on Gomorrah and cannot wait for the final season. There is also a movie for it called The Immortal featuring Ciro. Heard mixed reviews on it but I definitely have to see it but haven’t had the chance. Saw HBO got the Gomorrah rights so it’ll be on there soon hopefully.  Ciro is a great character but I love Genny.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,For sure give Dark another chance. It’s mind blowing for sure but just give it attention and find a handy family tree/chart as you go but without spoilers
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I get that to an extant but alot of the new stuff these countries are putting out is very western styled.  

Fauda definitely revolves around the Israeli/Palestinian issues but I feel doesnt try to go to far albeit the main characters are Israeli.  I think it shows great point of views and I felt for both sides.  

Paatal Lok, man I dont know Im American and cant begin to understand the social classes and religion issues there and from my experience and I can only speak for myself I just enjoyed it as a solid story and crime show.  The plot is awesome and some of the character stories are just heartbreaking.  A convo for future as I cant spoil stuff.  Most negativity come from Indians who say it makes Hindus to be bad.  Again as an outsider I didn't really even see that...just a very entertaining show.

Signal is awesome and it's funny you say the corny stuff.  My wife is Thai and watches some seriously corny Korean stuff but this not that.  I don't know.  I actually watch a lot of Korean shows but none compare to hers (Stanger and Kingdom be two other good ones.  Mr Sunshine is amazing but might fall in to your more corny type but is an epic period piece and beautiful show)

I personally love learning about other cultures and languages and seeing the settings of other places.  My personal travel list contains many places from these shows lol"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Yo, question for you actually. Meant to ask you but replied to the kid below you by accident. 


I'm so confused about one thing...What effing mob is everyone part of?!

Spitballing about Samurai, I'm assuming he's Cosa Nostra? I read this scandal was based on a true story and something about him being a neo-fascist (btw if this is legit based on the real life scandal...shit bout to be so wild!) So I don't know if he's like in with the skinhead crew, Cosa Nostra, or other mafia all together??? So confused.


Now the gypsies...would these be just a gang of Turkish/Persian gypsies...or is this essentially the Albanian mafia? 


Thanks brotha"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I love the show but the characters are all despicable.  Except Prince.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Also I take it you're a big sci-fi kinda guy...Have you by chance seen counterpart (I think it's on prime video)? Had it on my to-watch list for a year, just haven't chatted with anyone who's actually watched to affirm whether it's good or not so haven't pulled the trigger.

Also, I know we chatted about Gomorrah. But if you've seen any on my watch list lemme know what you loved and hated. 

Current to watch list:
1. Suburra (watching)
2. Gomorrah (next)
3. The last Panthers (if I can ever find a 720p streaming link with accurate subtitles.)
4. Counterpart
5. Pure (Hulu)
6. Hunted (2012 English Tv show)
7. Tunnel (heard this is essentially the bridge or ""Bron"")"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Hahaha dude I'm totally with ya on culture exploration. In text it probably came out ""Trump like"" which disgusts me in itself. Hahaha. And I'm stoned. Toss me a fricken bone! Haha. 

Damn Thai wife! Get it brotha! Haha! I have a 3rd generation Pollack lady. That all got that bitchy little thing about them. Hahaha. 


Giri/Haji i forgot to mention I just watched. Poetry like beauty bro. Honestly. Another rare 10/10 for me. Britain - Japan setting. Whoever directed it is about to get some fire Oscar like nods in coming years. MUST WATCH. Slow build though. So be patient."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"It’s the Camorra hence the shows name that it’s based on. The show mainly focuses on the Naples goings on but through the season many rival clans and families come into play

The wiki would prob help you [Camorra Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra)"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Shoot thought you were asking about Gomorrah not Suburra. My bad.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I like it as a drama, but I need some more action and murder man. Btw, I'm confused. Maybe you can clarify. Is Samurai head of the Cosa Nostra? Or is he part of a different gang all together? Because the gypsy's are obviously their own thing. They seem maybe Turkish or Persian? Or are they the Albanian mob?"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Add McMafia to the list
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Haha ya Asian culture obviously has my interest.  Traveled in SE Asia quite a bit as her family is there and gone by way of Japan and Korea so always love seeing the culture.  Been learning French as we were to have been in Morocco this month but well we all know what destroyed that trip.  So ya love the foreign stuff and seeing whats out there.  No closed mind here.

Giri/Haji is elite.  That show also blew my mind.  Total under the radar viewing as obviously I was interested just by reading the plot but never thought it would be like that good."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Few others I recently watched that might fit for ya if haven’t already watched would be Wisting, Public Enemy, and The Bureau."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Absolutely stunned by Giri/ Haji ❤️
no one talks about it - till I saw this !"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"OMG. I'm a fucking idiot. Thought the Gomorrah and Camorra were 2 separate gangs. Christ Almighty man. Italy is a mess. Between these assholes, Cosa Nostra, Ndranghata, Albanian mafia and numerous other gangs...There's no way not every single politician and cop are already bought...Insane!"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"My bad, I was talking about Gomorrah.  Prince was the dude with the panther.

In Suburra, Samurai, well I don't recall who he is exactly but he supposedly did a big job back in the day that got him a ton of information to leverage people with.  From what I remember, he was acting as a sort of broker/middleman between the Mafia and the landowners and clergy.

The Gypsies are their own thing.  Their nomadic history goes all the way back to the middle east and India, I believe.

I watched the movie before I watched the show (still talking about Suburra here) and the show is a prequel.  Idk if that matters to you but I think show goes first if you don't want to see how everyone ends up.

If you like these shows, you'd probably like McMafia.  That goes all over the place, from London to Moscow to Prague to Mumbai and to Israel.

Also, The Americans.  It's spies, not gangsters, but there is a ton of subterfuge and gangster ass shit going down.  It's one of my favourite shows of alltime."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Wisting had my attention. Like the brief little American connection they made there.


Dude Public Enemy looks fucking riveting...Hell of a find. A European Hannibal type show from the description?


Bureau sounds right up your alley of Fauda, Paatol Lok and that jazz! Haha.  Out of all the middle east shit we discussed. If you had to pick one show for me from there to check out...? 

Additionally. We share the same favorite category...Out of curiousity how do you feel about True Crime docs and Gareth Evans type action shows? Or action in general I should say like ""Banshee""? Btw, tried that show 3 times before being convinced it's epic after the first ep...and holy shit it was."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Ya it’s kind of hard to keep them all organized especially as an outsider so I just basically enjoy what it is I guess.  While most of the characters are obviously criminals and terrible people for the most part they do have amazing stories and struggles. The shows I feel are just really interesting and regardless fascinating to no characters.  I like spadino in Suburra and Genny and Enzo in Gomorrah quite a bit
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Dude Americans is...my number one. The Russia connection and the story just being like a livable fantasy for me. Hahaha.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Public enemy was pretty good actually got it off recommendation on here.
The Bureau is a french spy show so wouldn't put it with Fauda or Paatal Lok.  Not sure which one I'd go with...Paatal Lok I still think about as one of the better things I've seen this year.  The story I found to be second to none.  Fauda is definitely more focused on action and gun fights etc.  And if I'm being snarky not sure I'd include India as Middle East lol.  Sacred Games and Delhi Crime are two other Indian shows that were excellent.  Dehli Crime is actually based on a true crime case.

I have watched a few true crime docs and for the most part I do like them and also true crime podcasts I listen to from time to time.  Havent seen Banshee as I've never had Cinemax...same why I havent seen Warrior which I'd prob be into with the Asian element in there."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Spadino was tremendous
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Yes- some terrific Indian detective shows !
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Gomorrah is even better but the third and fourth seasons aren't available on streaming services as far as I know. There's also a spin-off movie called The Immortal.

Zero Zero Zero is another great show that's based on a book by Roberto Saviano, who wrote the book that Gomorrah is based on.

You should also check out Romanzo Criminale, The Name of the Rose (English language but very Italian), and Maltese."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"if you loved suburra, you're going to love gomorra"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,On my list to watch. I love the first 2 seasons.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Romanzo Criminale is great and is about some of the same gangsters that Suburra was based on.  Plus it was the first series made by the creators of Gomorrah.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I love it.  I do agree that Gomorrah is technically better but Suburra just has more likeable characters, Alessandro Borghi and Giacomo Ferrara knock it out the park in their acting as well."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Gomorrah is in a class of its own. You're in for such a treat. 

The 1992-93-94 trilogy is really great, based on real events. This is my second favorite Italian series. Both Gomorrah and 1992 inspired me to do a lot of background reading afterward, most of it stemming from wikipedia entries.

I also liked Maltese - Il Romanzo Commissario/Mafia Detective. Romanzo Criminale is another good one.

For some reason, I just couldn't get into Suburra. I think that I was jonesing for more Gomorrah at the time and those shoes are just impossible to fill. I keep meaning to go back to it sometime."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,[deleted]
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I didn't realise it was the final season! Hopefully it goes out on a high, at this stage I'm happy to see some shows finish up in their own time."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,It is unreal. Sad it’s ending.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Wasn’t really outstanding - I only watched the entire series out of massive respect I have for the film. I had the impression that the series would somehow align with the movie but I felt that the creators wanted to cut the story short. Disappointing really.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,This show is no longer a prequel to the movie lol
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Supposedly seasons 3 and 4 of Gomorrah will be coming to HBO max sometime.  Not sure when, but saw an article about it the other day.  I found season 3 and watched it online awhile back but haven't seen season 4 yet.  Prob should just rewatch it all again.  Seasons 1 and 2 are some of my favorite seasons of a show ever.  So many crazy and badass moments in it!"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Great recommendations -- Zero Zero Zero is in my list but haven't gotten to it just yet. Had no idea it came from the same person from Gomorrah, interesting!"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I agree the 1990's trilogy is good and Gomorrah is on The Wire, Sopranos, Fargo, Better call Saul and Breaking Bad level. Top of the cream TV."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I too watched Suburra after Gomorrah and struggled as I just couldn’t stop comparing the two. I then came back to Suburra after some time and have loved it. Season 3 had me hooked.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I watched with English subtitles and Italian audio.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I wholeheartedly agree. Gomorrah stands out for me in how they don't allow any romanticism. Sympathize with whatever character but then sonething unforgivably brutal happens and you just can't. Plus the cinematography, locations, casting, etc. it's really something."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I'm definitely going to try it again. It was just bad timing.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Suburra got better as it went along... The first season didn't do the show justice
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Yes, I absolutely loved the first season and currently I'm at episode 6 of the second season. "
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Is this a good show to watch in the meantime while I’m missing Gomorrah? I know its based off of Solima’s movie and all that.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"the second season is fantastic! I love how they committed to their stylistic choices, like keeping the soundtrack same and the format of each episode. Gorgeously shot, and this season has even more action packed into each episode. I was devastated when I watched the season 2 finale, not just because of what went down with the characters, but also because I didn't want it to end."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"for those wondering what the sad music that plays around every emotional scene, here it is:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGogtdArH7Y&index=1&list=PLVO1FSb3QOoWKyWejnh8n-LU04FWXUQq2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGogtdArH7Y&index=1&list=PLVO1FSb3QOoWKyWejnh8n-LU04FWXUQq2)"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Best ending song ever, of any show.

But the show went off the rails too much. Started out nice and realistic but became too much of a cliche shitshow in the second half of the first season.

I wish someone would make a show about Rome with a slightly nicer tone. Because the photography in Suburra is gorgeous, just hard to watch with the bad plot."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"The writing isn't very good in this season at all. It's very mediocre to be honest. However this is a guy who just finished watching all seasons of Gomorrah
"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Is it in a different language? 
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"It's interesting to read people thinking Suburra is inferior to Gomorrah -- I couldn't disagree more. Suburra's plotlines have more depth, the character arcs are considerably more believable (spoiler alerts: Genny goes from never firing a gun at someone to becoming, weeks later, this badass, effective crimelord, all because of one traumatic visit to Central America? Seriously? Ciro's baby mama suddenly can't handle The Life? &c. ), as is the compelling trinity (forgive me) of crime, politics and religion. I'm not done with Season 2 of Gomorrah yet but it feels like much less of a crime drama than Suburra, whose Season 2 is not nearly as good as its first but still easily qualifies, for me, as one of the best dramas on Netflix."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Thought the first season was great while the second season was lacking. Honestly so much of the second season didn’t even make sense to me.   From the character motivations to the plot  narrative. I also was not the biggest fan of the occasional flashback to Aureliano’s past to foreshadow the death of yet another of his loved ones. It was too on the nose in being a death calling card in my opinion.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Thanks u Netflix bot I’m gonna check it out ASAP.  
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Why are they all using razr flip phones. Every time someone is on the phone in that show (which is a lot) it breaks immersion.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,In my opinion....no 
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Definitely, yes. It's less profound, shocking and sophisticated than Gomorrah, still a good show."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,So impactful... The first 3 times. My god did they use this a lot 
Suburra: Blood on Rome,[deleted]
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Italian yes subtitles my friend 
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Who Is Samurai in real life? -> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Carminati
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Clearly the show isn't set today
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Never seen it, is it good? I mean would you say the writing in that show is very intelligently written? I'm not trying to sound pretentious, but that's the kind writing im used to with the shows I watch. "
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I’m good with that! I watch Babylon Berlin and appreciate shows from a different language.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"It's very camp, almost cartoonish, I liked it because I love crime thrillers, especially ones with many factions weaved together, and the action work was pretty fun, but I recognized it for what it was. Suburbs had better writing than Dogs of Berlin

A better German show on Netflix assuming you've seen Dark is Babylon Berlin or Parfum."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Give a try to Pataal Lok, McMafia, The Family Man (all on Prime). Seeing your list, I have a feeling you'll like these."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"vouch for ZeroZeroZero the way the episodes are structured and shot were just incredible, really blew me away at points"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I'd definitely recommend Der Pass (also known as Pagan Peak), despite being the latest foreign spin off of Broen Bron (this time being between Germany and Austria) its an incredibly well made, well written series that plays very cleverly with the source ideas and features a lot of the beautiful scenery of the alps."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"dude watch paatal lok, simply the best thing to come from indian web space. it's on prime. much much darker than sacred games."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Babylon Berlin?
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I honestly haven't watched this one, but Cocaine Coast (2018) could be a another series in your list. It is a Spanish series set in the 80s about how tobacco smugglers in Galicia turned into narcos. It is also based on real events."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,The Chalet is a six-episode French mystery series on Netflix that's wonderfully suspenseful.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Exellent list. And while it's not a crime show per se, but rather a spy thriller, I'd like to add [Le Bureau des Légendes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), which is simply the best series French TV has produced in the past 20 years."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Amazing. Thanks very much. Great suggestions on the thread as well.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,Try Broen / Broen or The Bridge on Hulu
Suburra: Blood on Rome,You should watch Hotel Beau Sejour
Suburra: Blood on Rome,My dad loved The Sniffer. The premise sounds ridiculous but he really enjoyed it.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Thanks for the list! Will check out ZeroZeroZero and a few others, once I finish Money Heist."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,ZeroZeroZero is like if Gomorrah and McMafia had a baby.  I think you'll like McMafia very much.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"In addition to *Spiral (Engrenages)* which you mentioned, I also enjoyed:

* 1) *Varg Veum* - A (mostly) serious Norwegian crime show, but some light humor mixed in with it.

* 2) *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (this is more of a light hearted, ""whodunit"" one, but I really like the humor and the cast, though fair warning, they do keep the sexism of the era in there, so you may find the main character a bit off putting at times, but that's kind of the point too). It is titled as *The Little Murders of Agatha Christie* in English. Almost forgot to mention it, but there are 2 separate shows under that name. I'm talking specifically Series 2, which is the one set in the 50s/60s. There's an earlier one with the same name in the 30s that I didn't get into. 
* 3) *Witnesses (Les Témoins)* - Another good, serious French show."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"GREAT list!!! 
Gomorrah is a top 3 for me. Can’t get enough of it. 
Completely agree on Suburra, zerozerozero, spiral, sacred games. 

As others said I highly recommend Pataal Lok and Der Pass. Two of the best shows by far I’ve watched this year."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"If you enjoy dirty cops, you might enjoy the film *Bad Lieutenant* with Harvey Keitel."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Thanks for all the recommendations, I feel I might spend a lot of this month sat in front of a TV, well, slightly more than the previous two months."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"I loved Gomorrah, but I'm having trouble finding seasons 3 and 4 in the US. Does anyone know how/where I can watch it?"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"You should watch De Dag (The Day), its a 12 part series about a bank robbery. The odd numbers are from the perspective of the cops and the even numbers from the perspective of the robbers 

It's a german series i think, really liked it"
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"McMafia was a really water-cooler show when it came out in the UK. Compelling series with James Norton as a fantastic lead.

Although, there is a lot of Russian and Hebrew dialogue - this is predominantly an English speaking show."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"This will be my next watch, sounds great."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,I really like the sound of this one.
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Good film, Keitel is brilliant in it."
Suburra: Blood on Rome,"Yeah, other than torrents or kodi, you might struggle.

Unless its on the new HBO platform?"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,This was a great read.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Delta state was the shit!
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,It was on both actually
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Decent watch. Not great, but there are many worse shows that get pushed around here daily."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I'll take it off my watchlist then. Shame, I loved Justin Theroux in The Leftovers"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I've stopped comparing books and adaptations long ago. Adaptations almost never do books justice. But it doesn't mean the show is bad. It's its own thing, separate from the book. They wanted to do a Hollywood flick, so what. It won't win any awards but it's an ok entertainment."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I've watched it all.. poor writing. I could say a lot about the show, but its simply written poorly and has no point yet. We're 6 hours in and there's no point or stance or meaning and most characters and issues are ""this problem could have been solved if all the characters weren't complete morons"""
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I've not read the novel yet, but had seen the 1986 film as a teenager and it left a real impression. Interestingly I was just reflecting on that movie, and not long after I see ads for this series (yes, the irony is not lost on me that it was probably the other way around). I was excited at a proper extended treatment; the film had to compress so much it seemed like a fantastic story to tell as a series, perhaps as a single season miniseries like ZeroZeroZero.We got five episodes in and the writing just kept getting more wildly detached from the source, which has now regressed into an implausible spy chase thriller and at this point feels like it's just withholding basic plot information because the writers never figured out what to do. 

It comes across as if Damon Lindelof wrote a mashup of Breaking Bad, The Americans, and Jason Bourne (and more so, the sins that they just barely got away with). Even as a chase thriller it is exasperating. [Spoiler](#s)

I could understand a new setup for the characters. At first, I thought we were we going to see Allie revealed as a sort of borderline paranoid schizophrenic convinced he was being watched by a government agency or corporation trying to suppress his work. It makes sense to update his personal war on the corrupting influence of modern western culture to include the expanding surveillance state and decay of privacy. It's a great contemporary justification for a quest to abandon society and forge a utopia, maybe some crypto-commune in a haven state where we see him come into conflict with evangelists, anarchists, criminals, free-staters, etc.

There's so much potential. Instead, from the moment that his boogie men are confirmed as real, it all collapses into conventional formula. Any character motivation or purpose is replaced by simply reacting like pinballs to (often hidden) outside forces and one deus ex machina after another. What's bizarre about the series is the involvement of the original author and familial connection with Justin Theroux. It's their work and legacy, I guess. I just don't understand what they were thinking."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I think it's the weakest of the Apple TV+ shows and dropped it after the third episode. Nonsensical plot and character decisions. He could have gotten his family killed multiple times in just the first few episodes. He should have just gone on his own but he's wife is a classic enabler.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Evidence #3535450 that people are wrong when they say novels are better off being adapted to television series format than to film.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"It's a stupid premise of a story.  Perhaps ""interesting"" as a book, but the movie..sucked zombie muscles. No amount of star power can overcome a stupid storyline."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I've not read the books, and I probably won't watch another season. So much of the show is driven simply because the characters don't *talk* to each other. The hitman is absurd and cast terribly."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"I really enjoyed the first 3-4 episodes, but by episode 7, I’m just annoyed with Theroux’s character."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Cant believe Theroux was a part if this nonsense. Watched all the way to the last episode and am done.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,We’re getting season two that addresses this. Relax.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"OP i logged in just to say based on what you wrote below, you might really enjoy the movie ""Captain Fantastic."" It has similar living off grid, plus the tension against modern society. 

Also i agree this show is so disappointing."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Completely agree, but this is one that shouldn’t be remotely bad considering the source material and quality of people involved"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,The greatest sin for me is that they strayed waaay off the original storyline. There was simply no need. What they've filled it with seem like tired and overused Hollywood tropes.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Yeah, I was surprised to learn about the family connection. I've no idea to what extent Paul Theroux was involved, if at all, with the script, but I can't believe he let his original story to be butchered to such an extent. Surely he would have had some say."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Just read the book imo
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"If we're talking about the original novel, I think it's a very compelling story. But the rewrite is ridiculous."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Yeah, I did too, just waiting for them to turn it around. I'm not going back for season 2."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Cheers for the reccy.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"It is one long chase scene so far which has absolutely nothing to do with the book.  

In the book they weren't fleeing, they were striking out with purpose.  The entire first season was contrived, unnecessary and could have been so much more interesting."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,cheers mate! feel free to share your thoughts on the movie w me. i haven't had anyone to chat about it with.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,'Contrived' sums it up perfectly.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"The Harrison Ford movie? Jesus, been a long time since I seen it. Can't recall it too well. Would rewatch it before the series, though. I appreciated the fidelity to the book."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"it's not Harrison Ford, it's Viggo Mortensen"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Never knew there was a movie with Viggo Mortensen. I thought we were talking about the 1986 movie.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Hooch is crazy

Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,that's a lot of content
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,[deleted]
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Any specific dates to go with this?
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."

Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,It’s pretty genius
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Paul Hollywoods Big Continental Road Trip,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Sometimes I just want TV that coddles me and this is very happy to do that. Pleasant and undemanding. See also: Better Late Than Never.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Awesome, I should finally finish season 2. For whatever reason, I have an odd way of watching this. I just watch a segment or two, then won't watch for weeks or months. Then watch a little bit more and repeat.

This is not at all a slight on the show, I really enjoy it. It's just how I have ended up watching it."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I watched the first season of this and so much of it was so cringy bad and scripted. It was a little bit too bad because the father and son seemed to have some real moments of hilarious back and forth banter, but then they would throw in stuff like the creepy doll and Steven Seagal and it just drags the show down so much."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Holy fuck I’m beyond excited this is coming back
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Ayeee! Another season
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"i love these, glad jack is blowing up"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Awesome
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,I can't get on board with Jack Whitehall he's just as insufferable as James Corden.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Hate this cunt.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I find Jack Whitehall to be super cringey to begin with. Fair play to him, he's done well for himself, but this show just isn't for me and I cant find the entertainment in it no matter what."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I kind of agree, but you know what?  This show showed areas/aspects/features/people of the countries that I’d never seen before.   The father and son right from the start were also an excuse to put together an incredibly diverse, patchwork of culture together in one place, that gave me a sense of just how little I know of these places, despite seeing them on television many times before,"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I totally agree. Loved the more authentic heartfelt parts, but it's just TOO scripted. I dunno about season 2 or 3."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"It seems popular these days for the comedian and relative to do a show, of course they're always super scripted, sometimes I am not even sure if they're trying to portray that they're not"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Don't watch.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Jack Whitehall is one of those 'good in small bursts' actor/comedians. Too much is off-putting.  

I used to feel similarly about Andy Samberg pre-Brooklyn 99."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"there was a series of documentaries done on this in the mid-80's. first the american woman is in Australia and than the male aussie goes to nyc. he battles a drug cartel, other hi-jinks ensue.
"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Russell Coight's All Aussie Adventures is pretty close.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"But the reason an idiot abroad was so good was because of Karl Pilkington. 
If you can find someone as funny as him then it would probably be very good television."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Aussies are well traveled, apart from booze ups it wouldn't be too awkward I'd say."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,The Barry McKenzie movies are like that
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,I think their son has a new documentary coming out this summer! 
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Info:

>My Adventures with Superman (Voiced by Jack Quaid) follows Clark as he builds his secret Superman identity and embraces his role as the hero of Metropolis – and perhaps the world. Lois, now growing into a star investigative journalist, takes aspiring photographer Jimmy Olsen under her wing. All the while, Clark and Lois are falling in love, sharing adventures, taking down bad guys, stumbling over secrets, and discovering what it means to be Superman and Lois Lane."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Okay that’s 2 out of 3 c’mon cowards do it, Wonder Woman animated series."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Jack Quaid is fighting douchebag Superman and now gets to be light-hearted Superman, all while also being a member of Starfleet."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Me most days: God being a DC fan sucks. Why do I put up with this? I think I need to move on.

Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"What is with the Western entertainment industry and turning gingers black? I don't think it's particularly important in this character's case, but this certainly is another example to the pile."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"It's always the gingers.

Edit: I almost missed it, but I think Lois is Asian in this. Look at her skin color and the shape of her eyes. And the voice actress is Asian, too."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Lois Lane looking like Casca from Berserk.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,[deleted]
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Looks great! Now give us a Flash animated series.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Did you notice that lately every important redheaded character in shows gets blackwashed 😂 😂 😂
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Oh man I’m finally getting the light hearted Goofus Superman. Ever since  [McKenna Harris](https://twitter.com/kennnajean/status/1383602901394751497?s=21) posted her own take on the character all I could think is how much I wanted to see that version realized. I guess someone agreed!
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,This gives me hope that one day we could see a Gotham Academy animated series. That series would be perfect for an adaptation.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Who's the black guy with the camera? And isn't that the lead character from that owl show on Disney?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,oh look they are replacing another ginger character with a African American version... how original.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,DC animated series are far superior compared to their live action stuff
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,This Lois looks exactly like Luz from The Owl House. Coincidence?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Between this and Superman and Lois, I'm glad Big Blue's actually getting some love again.

It's mostly been Batman, Batman, Batman for a while now"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Is this going to be like Harley Quinn in tone?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Guessin this is gonna be a comedy based on the animation style or at least very kid in tone.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Everything wrong with modern adaptations of absolutely everything in one picture. Makes me ill.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,[removed]
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Oh. Uh... Yeah, not really getting the best first impressions. I mean, come on, that doesn't look like Lois Lane, that looks like a grown-up version of [Luz from *The Owl House*](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/3/38/The_Owl_House_-_Luz.png/revision/latest?cb=20200323075529) (with a slighly lighter skin tone, that is).

**Edit:** And they straight-up just *made* [*Jimmy*](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/3/31/Jimmy_Olsen_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130729220529) *black*. If you want diversity in animation, don't blackwash your old properties - make compelling new ones!

**Edit 2:** See reply to below comment."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"This looks great, the art is quite gen z like which feels fresh for DCAMU. 

I can see this taking off with the right steps."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Smallville done right?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Will this be another terribly average superhero show that relies on gore like The Boys and Invincible or will this have actual substance?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Looking forward to this
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Justice league needs an animated series now.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I saw a lot of people pissin' on the show and I can't see what is the big deal. The show hasn't even come out yet but people already assume its garbage because they don't like some of the writers. Understandable, people have expectation for certain writers but come on, at least give this a starting chance. I love how dorky Clark looks too.. it suits his ""civilian personality"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Man they aren’t even being subtle with their replacing gingers with black people these days.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Seems like an appropriate Superman Year 1 or 2.  Considering Snyder cut right from Superman's debut to him getting killed, I'm excited to see how they build this world.  
Also, love seeing that 'Superman' is the secret identity, as it should be.  The guy grew up on Earth and I feel like the character evolved beyond the 'Clark Kent is fake.'  Modern Clark Kent is a serious, acclaimed journalist that wins the respect of his peers and too often people want to go back to the exaggerated goof from the Reeves films.  Very well done but I feel the character has evolved from that"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Interesting, I would've cast Quaid as Jimmy. Seems like a no brainer."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Wait... Quaid isn't voicing Jimmy Olsen?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,She's def overdue for one.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,Has Wonder Woman ever had an animated series before?
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"I would COLLAPSE if we get a Wonder Woman series. Cmon DC, do it!!"

Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"DC animated shows are good. The animated movies vary in quality, but the shows are usually rock solid."

Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Abandon live-action, embrace animation"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"DC's strength has always been in the animation department

That said The Batman is one of my most anticipated movies"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,I feel like its just a symptom of ginger characters often being side characters (compared to the typical brown-haired white guy in the leading role) making them easier to race swap than it is an intentional plot to eradicate all gingers from cartoons
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,It’s very strange and if anyone tries denying that it’s a thing they’re delusional at this point.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"At least they're calling him Jimmy Olsen and not *James* Olsen, terrible character tbh."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"At this point its past ""scoring diversity points"" to the point I seriously think someone in Hollywood has a psychopathic hatred of redheads. You can set your clock to it."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"In all fairness, Jimmy Olsen is a great character to “race swap” because his race does not play into his character at all. The whole point of Donald4Spiderman was that there were totally nerdy black kids who were into photography. 

I can’t imagine that they didn’t plan this out, and they had pre-tested waters with this character after Mehcad Brooks’ portrayal in Supergirl."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Given that he was black in supergirl, this may just be so that he's closer to recently familiar versions of him. Perry white was Laurence Fishburne, so I wonder what he will look like in this."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,I think it’s more a case of people only noticing when they’re black. Jimmy hasn’t been a ginger in most of his many live-action appearances but nobody says a peep about it until they change his skin too.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Honestly, idk. I personally think it’s alright to race swap if it doesn’t affect the character (like, Superman being black changes VERY little about his story) but it is odd that they all happen to be gingers"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,I think it's the curly hair.
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Or he's still a white guy except they gave him brown hair and shot him in the head almost immediately

(I'm talking about BvS Jimmy Olsen. I'm ginger and am still salty about that one in particular)"
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"Since it's a cartoon they should have just made him black but with red hair. I mean in other cartoons people have natural purple, blue, or green hair, so it's not out of the question."
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,">It's always the gingers.

""I'm telling you, man. The ginger always gets replaced first."""
Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father,"huh looking back at the photo again, Jimmy and Lois both also look really young next to clark"

Strong Girl Bong-soon,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea

I would include ""showrunners"" in this sentence, but I think this is what sunk Heroes more than anything. They saw how fans got attached to S1 characters, and decided they needed to keep all the fan favorites. And that meant not doing the anthology idea. Bad move."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,The only think the Writers Strike probably did was keep Peter's Irish love interest stuck in an erased alternate fascist future.  And then Peter basically never mentions her again.  Which felt like.... a weird choice.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The *idea* of Heroes was fantastic, it just didn't work to stretch over a 22-24 episode season and especially not multiple seasons.

Also, Breaking Bad is that old?"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"You're right. The writers managed to hold things together for the better part of the first season but the problems were there. 

The plotting makes it very transparent that they're moving characters around like chess pieces. Character motivations will turn on a dime and not make any real sense. They'll forget they have the ability to do something when it's convenient for the plot."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The S1 ending was ruined by the network's last minute insistence that there be another season with same characters.  They weren't all supposed to survive.  S2 was going to follow an entirely different set of characters.   As a result, they had the S1 characters become too powerful too quickly, something they had to figure out how to undo in later seasons. 

Arguably, this is to blame as much as the writer's strike."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"It all goes back to the decision making about what season 2 would be.  A few characters like Claire could easily continue for multiple seasons.  But it was just so obvious that many of them wouldn't work for long run.  The whole season 1 plot was stopping Sylar.  Then in season 2 he's back but no one really knows what to do with him so he meanders around looking for a purpose.  Ditto Hiro and Peter, two characters so completely overpowered the writers had to tie themselves in knots to keep them from being a deus ex machina every episode.  Hiro could have worked as a recurring character the way future Hiro was depicted in that one season 1 episode - just dropping in a couple times a season trying to fix something, but mostly failing to take all the variables into account.  Instead, it was just ""lets find lots of ways to temporarily depower him and keep him removed from the main plot but still on the show.  They even felt the need to bring Nikki back.

It's hard to blame it all on the writers as it seems pretty clear the network mandated that everyone return, but even then, that doesn't explain why the reboot season was so weak.  Every time there's a reddit post about what show declined the most in quality from beginning to end, Heroes tops the comment section (usually followed closely by Sliders, which kind of had the opposite problem in that it kept jettisoning cast members)."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Heroes had no story after the origin.  And they committed the cardinal sin of making heroes too powerful without weakness.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I think the issue is that many people don't understand that scripted production stopped during the writers strike, believing establiahed tv writers were simply replaced with randos. (And season 2 of Heroes is bad enough that it kinda supports that.)"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,This is why ‘Lost’ has no reason to be as good as it was. Creating 24 episode seasons for a mythology series is almost impossible for a writers room.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"They lost Bryan Fuller, who has a proven record of being fired and that ruining a show."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"All the evidence you need is Heroes: Reborn

NBC gave him another chance with no real creative restrictions, and it’s even worse than the original was during the strike."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I am actually 50/50 on this. I do think it got worse by writers strike, but it was never going to be any great show either. 

I kind of see this more of a case like Prison Break, where it was meant to be 1 season. Then the show got super popular and they just ran with ""whatever"". Which would also apply to the messier final episodes of season 1. They needed to quickly map themselves to s2 with some kind of cliffhanger bullshit. Prison Breaks mediocre seasons were just more fun than Heroes though. 


But yeah, I did not ever think this would become some great show after watching s1. I thought it would be enjoyable adventure, with some interesting characters. But it wasn't even that."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"100%.  The writers made the conscious choice to change the ending of 'Part Two' due to the strike so that part three was a fresh start rather than the second half of the virus storyline.  But that change was as much due to the poor reception of season two as a whole as anything-- if it was worth sticking with that story there was nothing stopping them from doing so.

The show was already bad by the time the writers strike happened.  The show was fundamentally flawed to begin with-- they created interesting and popular characters with powerful abilities that they did not have enough money to use to their potential on-screen, forcing them to rely heavily on copouts.  This was evident by the time the season 1 finale came around, and wasn't something they could fix without harming the show."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Honestly I think you give season 1 too much credit. It all felt very formulaic and rote. And nothing ever made any sense. It felt very JJ Abrams ""mystery box"". Like they billed it as ""look how smart and clever we're being"" and then in the first episode there's a solar eclipse seen from every spot on the planet all at once that never has any impact on anything but the logo."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I love the fact they saved the world and then had to save it from something worse

Nuke in Ny, then global plague and then i gave up mid way through season 3 but the glimpse hiro got it looked like the destruction of planet itself

Just should of let the cheerleader die"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Heroes needed the story planning to the same degree that dark had. But it changed to much mid course.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The OP is doing gods work. Every single day (usually more than once a day) someone brings up the show Heroes. I’m just sick of all the real people who definitely exist trying to push their flawed narrative on me. It’s even more flawed than Sylar’s redemption arc.
I really hope the op takes down Kings next, that sacred cow is due."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I 100% agree. Even the first season was bad. The constant switching of main characters between good and evil was lazy writing. The powers coming from an eclipse but then also from a genetic mutation made no sense. The inconsistent powers thing was super lazy (Hiro can stop time, teleport, and time travel, but only when it won't actually help the plot). The Hatian just made things super boring by canceling out other people's powers. Syler was a great villain, but he was the only interesting character on the show."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Absolutely. Season two was actually not terrible, certainly not as great as the early part of season one and had a rushed ending, but certainly watchable.

Season 3 is some of the dumbest television I’ve watched and it was completely unencumbered by the writers strike."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I am still waiting to find out how saving the cheerleader will save the world.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"If it ended after season one it would have been  legendary and talked about for years along with the likes of Firefly ( still have not seen that ).   I was a huge fan of season 1 , but stopped watching after one or three episodes of season 2.  I did not even realize there was a season 3 or 4"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"the show was good during the introductory episodes, the easy part ; once the plot finally started it crumbled on itself"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"""Save the Cheerleader save the World!"""
Strong Girl Bong-soon,They just *could not let go* of that fucking Sylar.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"As a massive Heroes fan I agree. Many years later I went to rewatch the series and after three or four episodes I just gave up and that was during its peak first season. The entire series is just an endless carrot on a stick of mysteries. Every episode ends with a stinger question which is solved in the next episode or two only for a new question to be posed. If you know the answers to all the mysteries then theres nothing there. It's just straight up boring. If the writers strike was to blame then it would have picked back up after it was done. Yeah we could say they needed time to recover, but it had years to do so and it never did. 

Heroes was a flash in the pan relic of its time."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The biggest ""WTF"" moment I remember regarding the failure of Heroes is when Peter and his brother confronts Sylar in an office. It should have been a grand battle scene but then I believe Peter fucking slams door behind us and we never get to see the fight."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Thank you!  
The writers strike only affected the season 2 finale where the virus was supposed to get out and they had to quarantine the city.  
The ireland plot sucked, the founders story was half thought out and ultimately pointless. Bringing Sylar back was a mistake, at least straight away. Hiro would be too overpowered so they had to send him to the past. Nobody knew what was going on with Nikki. The new orleans characters were cool and then never mentioned again...."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I pin-pointed the exact moment the show jumped the shark - it's when HRG says his name is Noah. Last episode of season 1, right before they fail at killing Sylar, with his stupid spinach can. This was before the writer's strike so I agree with you."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Pushing Daisies was ruined by the writers’ strike
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Heroes was one of those shows that did build up well and payoff poorly.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"You mean that in one of the first episodes when high schooler Claire goes to a party one night, falls and gets a stick jammed in her head and “dies,” wakes up on an autopsy table with the Y-incision done, pushes her chest back together and sneaks out of the morgue and shows up in the early morning hours at home by seemingly just being a few hours late was bad writing all along? No way!"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Exactly. I remember the finale was such a let down
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Ending was fine, the problem was bryan fuller leaving"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,The season finale for the first episode of Heroes was one of the most disappointing finales I ever remember watching.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"you're 100% correct.

Heroes didn't even have a fully solid first season.  the first half was great: introduced a variety of characters with interesting powers discovering themselves and struggling to leave their mediocre lives to get wrapped up in a phenomenal adventure.  by the mid-season finale, we had the whole SAVE THE CHEERLEADER, SAVE THE WORLD mantra - and it was great!  suddenly our separate heroes were starting to cross paths and threads pointed towards potential team-ups and stuff -- similar to Stephen King's THE STAND.  --but then they all went back to their lives... the world had been saved.  the end.  ...and then shit started dragging on.  ...the second half of the season was lukewarm and directionless -- and that finale was the most disappointing episode of tv in history; you're right, two superpowered dudes just punch each other a bunch and one turns into a bug and escapes while everyone else just stands by and watches.  ...yawn.  


i watched half of season 2 and gave up.  fun characters, fun ideas, but just a meaningless show with no direction.  sleepy showrunner?  (i've little respect for jeph loeb)"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea, and had no plan.

This. Although I don't think it was the writers who gave up on it, but rather the Network requiring it.

Even worse was keeping the Villain. He shouldn't have returned and they ran out of things to do with him pretty quickly."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,That's the secret.  Heroes was never good.  Not the first season.  Not any season.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The Writers Strike didn't make them constantly fudge the rules on healing and brain injuries.

It didn't cause them to write a plot where an eclipse gave people powers, even though they already established that wasn't what happened.

It didn't make them forget that Peter could walk through walls, and didn't need to rip a safe open with telekinesis."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Well thought out and spot on
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The ending of s1 where he gets away was bullshit and it was doomed from the start

there was clearly no plan and they were just doing more seasons for the sake of it"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Totally agree. Tim Kring is one of those writers who has great ideas, great plot concepts, but then has absolutely no idea whatsoever on how to resolve those plots.

His follow up series with Keifer Sutherland (can't recall the title) had a similar lifecycle. Great high-concept, intriguing plot threads.....that never got resolved, the story became so self-referential it was literally up it's own arse, and the audience walked away.

I have a similar take on Lost but I won't hijack your thread for that. It'd be good to see more of these kind of threads in here, well reasoned arguments that go against the grain."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"> Heroes was a flash-in-the-pan BAD show

This is the correct take. Tim Kring makes nothing but shit. The first season of Heroes was an absolute outlier."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I agree. Season 1 was a ton of fun to watch. But the finale was a big let down. And seasons after the writer's strike still sucked.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"In my opinion

Season 1 &2 were mostly Perfect

season 3 had a Great start but the ending was just nothing special >!WOW Surprise Sylar again the main Season Finale Villain!<

Season 4 with the >!carnival !<was  a really good idea but the writers got carried away and did a lazy job   I don't mind the Bad Guy and the Story  the >!whole past of the  Founder of the Company and Carnival  !<but the implementation was bad"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"It remains that the writers’ strike marked a big shift in character motivations, plot threads, and quality. The whole pandemic thing suddenly went away, Peter completely forgot about the Irish woman that he left in the future, and many characters just felt very different. Sure, maybe the show wasn’t as good as it’s first season. But without the strike, I feel it may have remained fairly enjoyable for me as the quality petered off instead of dropping off a cliff like it did."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,">other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Breaking Bad season 1 ending was famously impacted by the strike.  You cannot just use 2 of the most popular shows possible in the era as your comparison baseline."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,It suffered from JJ Abrahams mystery box syndrome. No one cared to develop what’s inside the box.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The writers strike made a bad problem *worse*.  


Heroes was never supposed to last beyond the first season.  They changed the ending to keep key characters alive and allow another season when it proved popular enough.  Problem of having way overpowered characters remained.  Those characters were nerfed to make writing less challenging but there was no recovery happening."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Honest question but how old were you during the writers strike? Your post reads like someone who looked up the stats of a great athlete from before they were into sports and decided they knew everything about that player.

Did you have this opinion back then? I feel like seeing it happen in real time versus binging the series and deciding 15+ years later what happened is different."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Did this really needs its own post?
Strong Girl Bong-soon,[deleted]
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Wasn't this the show that started with an eclipse visible everywhere on earth?

So, in effect, flat earth?"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Lost started spiraling season 4.  IMO its when it really became clear they might know what they are doing and are just throwing out more mysteries that won't be solved.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"No

Season 3 wasn't perfect, but it was a million times better than season 2, which ridiculously bad."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The movie ""Push"" is what Heroes should have been.  Do a time jump and have people on the run and in hiding from Govt. orgs all over that want to weaponize the people with powers, as it is all out in the open now."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I quite enjoyed heroes. This is why i never bother with reviews of movies or tv shows. 

100% of the time (yes 100%) i see someone bash a show or movie it's always something I've seen and everything they blabble on about is their opinion and their opinion only. I wish other people would do the same. Maybe some of these obscure movies and shows will finally get some love."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Nah. I was there. that show was alright for season 1. Writer's strike, and then it completely shit the bed."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The few episodes of season 1 were not great, but they had so many ideas, characters and storylines floating around a pile up was bound to occur.  Especially if it makes it seem like was destiny or something.  Having time travel in a story can be a dangerous thing, I have seen done badly so often."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,This was a show that needed to be one and done. Maybe it was possible to get another few episodes out without tanking the premise. But in the end it was a closed story from the start.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I rewatch season 1 every so often and it really does fall apart in the finale.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Was the first season good?  Seriously, I remember it being just okay. Haven't seen it since in first aired, but I just remember a lot of lazy storytelling and the cheapness... iirc the finale was during a prom and had 5 people in the whole thing.  Their budget for extras must been nil."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I have tried at least 4 times to get through the show but hit a wall around season 2 episode 4 I came to the conclusion that the show just want for me.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I think the show would have been excellent if it had to work with 10 episode seasons.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Agree it wasn't all the strike, that couldn't have helped though.

Seems like more an issue of direction.  When they decided to keep all the characters that became popular, things got messy.  Plus, going full fledge time travel will always break plots."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I just rewatched the first season and pretty much agree with this. I loved Heroes because it clearly came from a love of comic books and comic characters. I even like the seasons past season 1 just because they’re silly, melodramatic, and take themselves far too seriously. After watching the “good” season again, it did have all the things people seem to dislike about the the later episodes, just with slightly better writing. It’s not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it was, but I still love it for what it is."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Yeah, the WGA strike didn't ruin it, it just cut the 2nd season massively. If they had a good idea they could've just continued with what they were going to do.


If they had stuck with the anthology idea, sure - but they didn't



The WGA strike **did** fuck over Pushing Daisies, though."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,It’s not like season 1 was that great
Strong Girl Bong-soon,The average redditor doesn't seem to have any clue what the writer's strike was and how it affected television.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I watched the first season, it started great, but towards the end it declined quite rappidly. Keep people dead, regardless their popt. 

And can somebody please explain to me why the cheerleader needed to be saved?"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Excellent post, and I agree 100%. 

But you forgot to list the most important point of evidence: the writers' strike occurred at the end of the writing of season 2 and before season 3, and **not** between the production of seasons 1 and 2 as most people who spread the myth believe."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,They should have stuck to their original plan and killed off all the season 1 characters in the finale
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Thats debateable but it did change the path of the season and who knows what different stories could have come from that
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I never watched Heroes, but you have a very well written argument, so I believe you."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I don't remember it in a lot of detail, but I thought season 1 was really great.  I don't recall being too disappointed in the last episode but I don't recall being blown away either.  I don't think I even made it through season 2 it just got bad and uninteresting after season 1."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Heroes should have ended at end of S2, everything else was unnecessary."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,S1 was good....S2 did indeed feel like the SAME shit. After that I just lost interest. You could just tell that they had no real overarching plot from season to season.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I liked most of the show tbh, it wasn't the greatest but probably gets more hate than it deserves. Maybe just because there was less content then."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Even season 1 had cracks in its plot. Remember the nuclear guy who everyone thought was going to blow up the New York. He was shot by Company agent who was working for people who were plotting for nuclear detonation in New York. Then why did company agent tried to kill the key person for the plot?
Strong Girl Bong-soon,I think what really hurt them was losing Bryan Fuller.  When he came back for a couple of episodes in season 3 those were just so much better than the rest of the episodes.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"> While the second season WAS disrupted by the Strike, other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Wait, I'm sorry, in my mind Breaking Bad and Heroes are from two completely distant and separate eras of my life and my brain is having a really hard time wrapping itself around this."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Save the cheerleader save the planet.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I think it would be a whole lot better if it debuted today, to rival “The Boys” and was just 8 - 1 hour long episodes per season."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,They only had one season in the can. After that they were scrambling when it became a hit. so many shows fall into the sophomore slump
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Man that first season of Heroes, especially those first few episode just something else man. I remember being very excited every week when new episode releases. Save the cheerleader save the world."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I watched the season 1 finale and said out loud ""oh never season is going to be bad."""
Strong Girl Bong-soon,Season 3 was a masterclass in batshit. Delightfully insane and incoherent. The Television Without Pity forums and Topless Robot reviews for that season deserve to be in the MoMA.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The problem was that it was a huge hit.  This meant they had to keep that going instead of just making good television.  So they had to come up with convoluted ways to keep the same audience-favorite characters around, and somehow keep them saving the world every season even though they already saved the world.  That's all.

The first season was great, and the rest could have been great, but success changes the mission.  There were some decent elements here and there early on, but it just fell into the same soap opera trap as Once Upon a Time and so many other dramas that go on too long without being willing to change."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,In my opinion the major problem was that it couldn't get pass Season 1 premise and Season 2 wasn't just a repeat of Season 1 but also a poorly written show. Reborn was just terrible and had crappy CG.
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The original idea was to have an anthology series with each season disjoint from the previous but sharing the same universe. 

I have no idea how the writer's strike could affect not implementing that idea."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"TV shows for some reason during that time were actually quite good. It was films to me that seemed to be exact copy and paste of each other, with dull dialogue and plots.

Even though the Writers Strike was specifically TV writers, during that time to me, I noticed it was mostly films suffering with quality, while TV shows were delayed."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The funniest part to me is how every single week there would be promos for the next episode that were so dramatic, like it was the second coming of Jesus Christ every week. It was like they were trying to outdo themselves but most of the time what they were hyping up was pretty insignificant or downright meaningless."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I don’t know, the fact that we are still talking about it in 2022 proves it’s impact. There are so many more shows that got so many more seasons that I don’t think are good. We should just enjoy it for what it was and wait for the eventual reboot."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"The dumb thing was they sort of gave up on the idea... and they sort of didn't.  They kept all the characters from the first season (even ones they could've easily killed off like Peter and Sylar) and didn't do the anthology, but then they still added a new slate of characters as if they *were* doing an anthology - Maya & Alejandro, Adam, Monica, etc.

It just created this dynamic where they introduced all these new characters, but you didn't care about them, because you wanted to keep watching those fan favorites."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Yeah I don't think we can attribute that to the writers, they just write what they're told."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"But also didn't advance any of the characters either. Just Flanderised them.

Hiro was the worst. We see cool future him. But present him just became an increasingly bad punchline."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"That was the network's call, not the showrunner's.  They had to change the last episode in post-production."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Thing is, they could have kept Hiro since he was THE fan favorite or cycled individual characters in an anthology while focusing on new ones.  The only real problems were power creep with Peter and Sylar.

On a related note, Sylar is a fantastic concept for a super villain"
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Fair enough!

My primary criticism is aimed at Kring."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"Making it an anthology would have been terrible, though. All of the excitement of the first season came from the anticipation of watching these characters gradually discover their powers and come together. We don't want to see a reset when the first chapter ends, we want to see them team up and fight crime or do whatever. Heroes was a 'mystery' show more than a superhero show, but you can't just throw away the characters."
Strong Girl Bong-soon,"I’d want to pin it on executives above the show runners. You want to throw all these characters out  after we spent a season establishing them, we can’t possibly do that is a quintessential executive decision"

The Confession Tapes,Why did I think she had died?

The Confession Tapes,Jon Peters payed off her debt.
The Confession Tapes,Why did I think she passed away?
The Confession Tapes,no one cares
The Confession Tapes,Tommy Lee will do that to a guy.
The Confession Tapes,It was likely so he wouldn't have to pay tax on giving her the huge monetary gift.
The Confession Tapes,Source?
The Confession Tapes,Are you confusing her with Anna Nicole Smith?
The Confession Tapes,"If you’re like me, you might have heard she got Hepatitis C in the late 90s from a tattoo needle. She didn’t hit the news cycle much after that (at least for me) and at some point I must have assumed she passed away from it. Turns out she was cured in 2015."
The Confession Tapes,"Because Hollywood made biopic about her, they doing it mostly about dead celebrities.

Done without her permission, just like sex tape publication."
The Confession Tapes,"Dude you're not alone, I could have sworn she died. I think I got her mixed up with Anna Nicole Smith."

The Confession Tapes,I am disturbed as hell by this. I really liked this guy as an actor.
The Confession Tapes,"A lot of people are making jokes, but this is pretty serious news. He has worked with many child actors and has a long list of credits according to imdb. This is going to shock and hurt a lot of people, as well as his own life (his fault on that part of course). I'm curious to know if he decided to go to therapy on his own or his ex-wife forced him then made the tapes. Either way, this is sad. I really enjoyed him as an actor. Hope he stays in therapy, or whatever it takes (jail!), for a very, long time. He can never recover from this completely. "

I also thought therapists had a legal obligation to report child molesters.

And it's kind of fucked up to listen to it too. I did listen to most of this, but it's really gross of me to do that. Even if this dude is a horrible man, he shouldn't be publicly shamed and have the brutal details of his past sins publicly displayed as entertainment."

All About Love,IGNORE ME!
All About Love,Eat the pennies
All About Love,Honestly Hank where do you come up with this stuff? I never see you read a book. It’s like your channeling dead crazy people
All About Love,"What cemented my love of this show was the episode in which Rusty was complaining about someone posting pictures of him making out with Lydia Lunch and Stiv Bators at CBGBs


Edit: And when Hank exclaimed, “The guy from Labyrinth just turned into a bird and flew away!”"
All About Love,Great show!
All About Love,Strange. I just went on a rabbit hole of looking up this show last night. Wanted to see if the movie was still on track.
All About Love,"Yes it is. Go Team Venture.

*sheds tear"
All About Love,"I just finished a rewatch of the entire series not too long ago and I knew I liked the show, but I forgot just how truly amazing it is. It's *really* well written, has super sharp dialogue and it has some of the best recurring jokes and call-backs I've ever seen in any show (here's a fun little game while watching; see how many times ""The Viceroy"" comes up).

It's honestly is up there as one of my favourite TV shows of all time."
All About Love,"Best show on TV, sad that they didn't get an 8th season, hopefully the movie provides a good send off for a show that really deserves it."
All About Love,"Hands down the smartest, most lovingly-made animated tv show of all time"
All About Love,"I mean, there's a movie in production."
All About Love,"‘If I knew you could just call the cops on him, I would have done it years ago! Because I'm no sissy, no sir. I would just pick up that phone and... ""Officer, there's a man in a butterfly suit shooting my robot with a laser beam.""’"
All About Love,Just eat the pennies
All About Love,"[""you...think it's a cry for help?""](https://youtu.be/3Gnh8laMgew?t=203)

easily one of my favorite quotes of the whole show."
All About Love,"For me it was the scene where Molotov gives Hank mouth to mouth, causing him to get an erection. Dean tells him ""don't panic. But I think the Apaches are back. Teepee in your trousers."" (After the previous joke about the compound build on an Indian burial ground as we see ghosts running around) The next scene is inside as Molotov talks to Dr. Venture, Hank runs by screaming ""my pants are haunted"". 


The show itself though is INCREDIBLE at world building and every rewatch you catch new throwaway background things that later came to the foreground. I love throwing it on for background noise from the adult swim app- you can marathon the episodes in order there"
All About Love,"Hullo, I’m David Bowie."
All About Love,James Urbanik tweeted that he had finished all of his voicework last June which seems to indicate the movie should be coming out this year.

Don't want to set my expectations high and get crushed.
All About Love,The show is so well crafted it is honestly my favorite TV show of all time.
All About Love,Squeeeee!!!

All About Love,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
All About Love,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
All About Love,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
All About Love,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.
All About Love,These guys think they are way smarter than they are.
All About Love,[removed]
All About Love,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!

All About Love,Gonna be so thankful i got a teenage girl brain slurry vaccine when cannibal rapists chop off my legs or a bloater rips out my spine
All About Love,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
All About Love,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."
All About Love,Joel entering the Avatar State to save Ellie.
All About Love,Thanks for the heads up
All About Love,"As someone who hasn't played the game, all of these discussion threads are so frustrating. Everyone constantly talking about what happened in the game. I don't care about the game, I'm just trying to enjoy the TV show."
All About Love,"I have played neither game and am watching this series and loving it so far. Thank you for the heads up, even though so much time has passed. Appreciate it"
All About Love,Bless you
All About Love,I basically told all of my family and friends to *not* read any article or community regarding it because people are so toxic about it in general if they wanted to keep fresh eyes and not be spoilt.
All About Love,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."
All About Love,"The HBO specific sub really needs to enforce a ""No Game Talk"" rule or have ""Show Only"" threads"
All About Love,It wouldn't be a problem if they'd fucking release it for PC
All About Love,"I still understand his PoV. They were going to kill his daughter again. I also understand that it's not the morally ""right"" thing to do, and it's also very selfish. But a lot of parents would go for the selfish option without even thinking of the impact it'd leave on their child.

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
All About Love,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
All About Love,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.
> 
> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
All About Love,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
All About Love,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
All About Love,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
All About Love,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

Heck, larger themes like ""loyalty"" and ""brotherhood"", etc. were a huge part of the driving forces in LoTR."
All About Love,"> It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
All About Love,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
All About Love,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.
All About Love,Co-wrote*
All About Love,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
All About Love,[removed]
All About Love,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
All About Love,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
All About Love,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."

All About Love,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
All About Love,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
All About Love,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
All About Love,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
All About Love,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
All About Love,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
All About Love,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
All About Love,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
All About Love,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
All About Love,What?
All About Love,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
All About Love,...they do have show only threads
All About Love,Rekt
All About Love,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
All About Love,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
All About Love,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
All About Love,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
All About Love,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
All About Love,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
All About Love,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
All About Love,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
All About Love,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
All About Love,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
All About Love,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
All About Love,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
All About Love,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
All About Love,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
All About Love,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
All About Love,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
All About Love,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
All About Love,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
All About Love,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
All About Love,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
All About Love,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
All About Love,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
All About Love,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
All About Love,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
The Many Faces of Ito,I want to see Natasha Lyonne play Ms Frizzle from Magic School Bus with cigarettes and all.
The Many Faces of Ito,"I’ve just recently cottoned onto Pokerface, which has led me down the rabbit hole of Russian Doll.  I really am digging this chick.  Last episode I watched had her telling her partner in time distortion a story about a girl who was if Andrew Dice Clay and the girls from Brave had a baby.  I thought, Whoa…that is the greatest description of anything ever!"
The Many Faces of Ito,"I want to see an extended cut of her swinging the wood around saying “fuck you dog,” cried laughing from that"
The Many Faces of Ito,I want to see Natasha Lyonne in a grimy road revenge movie alongside Fiona Dourif.
The Many Faces of Ito,"Bella Ramsey was snubbed, not even an honorable mention. Natasha was great this episode, but it wasn’t a particularly special performance compared to the rest."
The Many Faces of Ito,"

Lauren Ambrose from the penultimate episode of Servant (Apple), imo. 

Dorothy 'waking up' was an excellent scene. Chilling, heartbreaking, intense...

Bravo to her."
The Many Faces of Ito,"I loved the first season. Thought it was a great throwback to the kind of thing we don’t often get anymore. But I oddly felt let down by the finale. In the end, >!she’s right back where she started the season at — on the run, but this time from some new big bad over the phone.!<

I can appreciate the symmetry, but maybe I wanted some progression? I dunno, it’s a weirdly frustrating feeling."
The Many Faces of Ito,https://youtu.be/6-R_sujwkfk
The Many Faces of Ito,What is TVLINE?
The Many Faces of Ito,"“Natasha Lyonne” is magnificent in Poker Face. I 100% recommend watching it.

P.S: while watching if you guessed a solution to the mystery of the episode I want to tell you that you are 99% most probably wrong."
The Many Faces of Ito,"She is basically doing a Peter Faulk impression this show 

Not that it’s a bad show 

I still have Staplehead stuck in my head"
The Many Faces of Ito,Just started this series and I'm hooked. And she's great in everything.
The Many Faces of Ito,I recently heard her on smartless and I love hearing her talk! Also Shawn hayes has the best laugh on there
The Many Faces of Ito,How is Bella Ramsey not even an honourable mention ?
The Many Faces of Ito,Love this show!! Bella Ramsey is also great. She will have her time
The Many Faces of Ito,"Is it just me, or is Poker Face a mix of Columbo and The Littlest Hobo?"
The Many Faces of Ito,She is so distinguishable. I knew she was in Detriot Rock City. She looks exactly the same
The Many Faces of Ito,This chick plays the same person in everything she’s in… herself…
The Many Faces of Ito,"Honorable Mentions:

* Whitney Cummings (""Accused"")
* JB Smoove & Nick Kroll (""History of the World, Part II"")
* Jessica Williams (""Shrinking"")"
The Many Faces of Ito,"will she ever not play the same exact character in every show she’s in? probably not, she’s basically a character actor"
The Many Faces of Ito,She’s so beautiful it fucks me up
The Many Faces of Ito,"I just don't like Natasha Lyonne as an actor. There, I said it.

She's obviously talented and I can respect that others disagree, but I just don't get it."
The Many Faces of Ito, I really want to like her but her voice is so grating.
The Many Faces of Ito,Poker Face is terrible.
The Many Faces of Ito,Can't even watch this series here in india
The Many Faces of Ito,"Cool, does she play the same snarky, independently minded, dry character that she portrayed in American Pie? One dimensional..."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Overrated formulaic show with good but nothing special acting, writing, or story"
The Many Faces of Ito,She looks like she smells…
The Many Faces of Ito,Frog with a wig on face
The Many Faces of Ito,[deleted]
The Many Faces of Ito,They better make season 2
The Many Faces of Ito,I love her
The Many Faces of Ito,"She's really good. Poker Face is a good show, well shot, good cast. I stopped watching though. Not my thing."
The Many Faces of Ito,"I have loved this lady since American Pie. 

“You’ve never double clicked your mouse?”"
The Many Faces of Ito,"In any movie or show, I love Natasha Lyonne’s hair and voice."
The Many Faces of Ito,I think she is great in both Russian doll and this. However it seems she kind of just playing herself. I would like to see her do something totally different.
The Many Faces of Ito,Wish there was an easy way to watch it here in the Netherlands.
The Many Faces of Ito,"Its like Columbo had a daughter with Roseanne Roseannadanna.  Really starting to like this show, but I dont think the charm will last, but ill watch it while it lasts."
The Many Faces of Ito,"*Yeeah , you see kids? All dose good nutrients from that pastrami Ma ate are get’n sucked right inna the walls of ‘r small intestin. Now, I’d ratha not see how this story ends, cuz we already know it’s gonna be 2 owus on the shitta read’n a 15 yea’ old Readahs Digest. So let’s go back the way we came, and I’ll drive this hunk’a crap out her stuck up schnauz, so somethin can be goin outta it ‘sted of come’n in. Then we’ll get all big befoah Carlos heah gets eaten by a cock-a-roach, kapeesh?*"
The Many Faces of Ito,"She has been very publicly trying to quit smoking recently, but that version of ms frizzle would be fucking awesome"
The Many Faces of Ito,That is hands down the best casting idea I've ever heard
The Many Faces of Ito,She's great in Orange is the New Black too
The Many Faces of Ito,She was fantastic in Slums of Beverly Hills. She really is just great.
The Many Faces of Ito,"I love Natasha and really wanted to like Poker Face but I just can’t. The first episode was good after that it was terrible. No suspense, no originality, few other interesting characters, same ol tired “bullshit”."
The Many Faces of Ito,All of her interactions and scenes with that fascist dog made me laugh more than anything I've seen recently.
The Many Faces of Ito,"2nd Best Parson Russell Terrier actor ever, next to Moose playing Eddie on Frasier."
The Many Faces of Ito,Yep
The Many Faces of Ito,">Fiona Dourif

[OK](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_stand_2020/s01) but can we talk about how she radiates chaotic energy?

[tfw the villain starts talking too much sense.](https://www.horror.land/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The_Stand_News_2020_16.jpg)"
The Many Faces of Ito,"Usually how the TV Line performer of the week works is that they only give to an actor for one episode of their season and Natasha hadn’t gotten it yet, so they gave it to her this week. Even tho she was definitely better in other weeks. It’s pretty stupid how it works tbh. They’re probably waiting for the finale to give it to Bella."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Last week’s penultimate Poker Face was way better than the finale imho, and she was amazing."
The Many Faces of Ito,I'd say the actor who played David was really good too.
The Many Faces of Ito,">	Natasha was great this episode, but it wasn’t a particularly special performance compared to the rest.

Probably a hot take for this sub but Bella’s performance wasn’t that special imo."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Ramsey really was not that good. Very flat, forced delivery of every joke and ever cuss word. The subtle genuine moments were pretty good, but not worth an award or anything."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Bella can only emote two emotions, angry and more angry."
The Many Faces of Ito,You’re delusional if you think her performance the first 10 mins of the episode is worthy lmao. It’s like you don’t watch any other TV
The Many Faces of Ito,"Natasha probably has a good agent to still be acting, so no surprise she gets mentioned in “news” like this. 
In the early 2000s it was rare for older gen actors to still get roles, now we have mult gens of b-listers still getting jobs. 
Must be due to some massive agency mergers over the years. I prefer seeing fresh faces and new talent so this past decade or so has been super lame for hollywood. Esp with all the rehashed story lines. Come on hollywood"
The Many Faces of Ito,"I just watched this episode and I agree. Lauren Ambrose is an incredible actress, I can’t wait for her performance in Yellowjackets season 2."
The Many Faces of Ito,She was INCREDIBLE in this scene. The Servant has ratcheted up its last episodes into some of the best TV I’ve seen. Makes me wonder why Lauren hasn’t done more since Six Feet Under. Also - shout out to Rupert Grint in that same episode.
The Many Faces of Ito,I’m trying to get past season 2 but so far is just “where is Jericho?” For five episodes
The Many Faces of Ito,"Voiced by someone whose >!last name is Perlman!<, too. Makes me wonder how many actors with >!that surname!< they can go through if this show keeps getting renewed, lol."
The Many Faces of Ito,The show lends itself to being able to get her into new situations in new locations. Changing it up too much would steal the magic from a procedural.
The Many Faces of Ito,Same. That last few minutes basically rebooting the seaso was kind of lame because I now think next season is going to be more of the same at the end.
The Many Faces of Ito,"I just think it’s silly to do a procedural show but also have these tacked on serialized elements. Like, we’re gonna skip the murder mystery this week to dive into Charlie’s childhood trauma…? Fuck that. I don’t mind the framing device just so she has a reason to be on the road, but it just kind of sputtered in this last episode which was tough coming off probably the best of the season."
The Many Faces of Ito,best avoided
The Many Faces of Ito,">“Natasha Lyonne” is magnificent in Poker Face.

Is that not her name?"
The Many Faces of Ito,"poker face is like columbo.

I loved reruns of columbo and so this was a must watch"
The Many Faces of Ito,Did you watch the first 10 mins of the episode?
The Many Faces of Ito,Heard her on a podcast the other week. She mentioned her lost decade through addiction and how she thinks it somehow pickled her to look 10 years younger.
The Many Faces of Ito,"""*Featuring*  
Natasha Lyonne  
*starring as*  
Natasha Lyonne  
*playing*  
Natasha Lyonne.""

I say it at the beginning of every new thing I see her in, was not disappointed this time either."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Nick kroll on HOTWP2 is so hilarious, giving 110% every time he’s on screen"
The Many Faces of Ito,">tvline.com/lists/...

I thought Jessica Williams was better last week but she's been a really pleasant surprise on that show either way."
The Many Faces of Ito,"Character actors do all sorts of things.

If you hire Natasha Lyonne, you know exactly what you're gonna get: zingers."
The Many Faces of Ito,"She looks smelly in all her pictures, even personal ones"
The Many Faces of Ito,"the issue is she only plays herself.

every role she's ever had, she's playing Natasha. the slightly dirty girl, who smokes and acts ""bad"", has a raspy voice and seems cooler then she is."
The Many Faces of Ito,She’s actually not that talented though
The Many Faces of Ito,"Ye I agree. The first couple of episodes were fantastic because I felt it was setting it up to be a super clever show, it just happened that a few random deaths occurred around her then, it was not yet that unbelievable. But then they just rinsed and repeated in the most hollow way possible. No character development and just her in a new place stumbling upon a new murder each week. Sad."
The Many Faces of Ito,American Pie?? Where have you been for the last 20+ years? In a coma?
The Many Faces of Ito,"I dunno she's like Gilbert Gottfried or Rodney Dangerfield or something. A persona.

Like you know there's actually a real person under there, but they're just playing a super performative, over the top, ridiculous character schtick that works. They're like WWE comedy characters almost.

 A lot of people appreciate a very broad caricature, and Natasha has a very particular handle on the smoky, snarky, wise observer character she always does. It's harder than it looks to maintain a persona like that over time. 

People wonder what's real about her, because I've never seen it but I've seen Gottfried out of character."
The Many Faces of Ito,Columbo is formulaic and that show is amazing
The Many Faces of Ito,Thanks for sharing
The Many Faces of Ito,"Lol, it's had some great acting from some of the best actors in the game."
The Many Faces of Ito,They weren't.
The Many Faces of Ito,I read this with her voice and it was glorious
The Many Faces of Ito,And “but I’m a cheerleader”!!!
The Many Faces of Ito,"That was where I was introduced to her, and she was terrific there. I never finished the show, I think I got partway through season 4 maybe? But she was excellent"
The Many Faces of Ito,"Your call but I would say later episodes have original elements with interesting twists and turns that highlight Rian Johnson, of Knives out fame, influenced. 

The basic structure is effectively Columbo with a touch of the Adventure Town trope but it does it well and while it’s not prestige TV there have been a few surprises after the BBQ episode."
The Many Faces of Ito,now say it without that pokerface
The Many Faces of Ito,That dog was pretty good too!
The Many Faces of Ito,Also Soccer playing Wishbone.

The Many Faces of Ito,Agreed. Those ‘ Bullshit ‘ (s) just hit harder .
The Many Faces of Ito,"I agree, last week was actually my favorite episode of the season, and her acting was much better than this week’s"
The Many Faces of Ito,"I loved that her ability didn't really help her much in that episode either. It's usually get superpower that gets her out of trouble, but she barely got to use it in that episode! 8 live when TV can turn your expectations around. Great episode."
The Many Faces of Ito,"He was terrifyingly fantastic, I agree."
The Many Faces of Ito,Username checks out.
The Many Faces of Ito,"Hot and bad take, yes."
The Many Faces of Ito,She was pretty good but the scene definitely hit harder in the game.
The Many Faces of Ito,It wasn’t. People are just circlejerking the show for some reason. The show is good and so was the episode. The first 10 mins of Bella’s performance was not award worthy. People need to watch other TV series before they say the only one they watch deserves awards lmfao
Click for Murder,I'm absolutely ready for more and would have loved Ben Shwartz to return for a cameo or something
Click for Murder,I hate the name of this show because I always confuse it with Search Party which was also a comedy murder mystery.
Click for Murder,Really enjoyed the first season but I still find Tiffany Haddish an odd and poor choice.
Click for Murder,Nice! Afterparty was a surprisingly clever series.
Click for Murder,"Walt: It's finally my turn to be the star of the season!

...

Guys?"
Click for Murder,"This is good to hear but the second season does need to step up the writing

The first season was entertaining. but considering the cast, the show should have been much funnier.  It's still worth watching."
Click for Murder,That was a great whodunnit where they gave you enough breadcrumb clues towards who the murderer is. If you pay close enough attention you can figure out who it is before the finale which is really rewarding.

Click for Murder,"I was so hoping something like that would happen and a Dave Franco bit as well, even though he was killed in the first one.  He gave his horrible character human points.  That is actually hard to do."
Click for Murder,Getting Zach Woods in there is a great consolation prize
Click for Murder,He was the best character! the show will have to work hard to replace his energy.
Click for Murder,This came after
Click for Murder,Me too

Click for Murder,"I'd say about half of this subreddit is ads, maybe more."
Click for Murder,"I love AppleTV but you’re exactly right. I was surprised because I watched Afterparty and thought it was fine, but most of the Reddit comments at the time were very whelmed. But this post would lead you to believe it was a beloved show. Clicking on OP’s account it’s clear they are either a huge of Apple TV or paid to be one."
Click for Murder,"Alright, just don’t get Apple TV+ then."
Click for Murder,"You're one of the very few ones who give a shit, I assure you."
Click for Murder,"I feel naïve whenever I think of questioning comments like this but....is that really the most likely explanation? Legitimately, if there's something I could read about Reddit advertising by studios where this is explained, I would like to read it. The title of this post is directly from the linked press release announcing the return date, which I thought was common practice. 

OP has a long comment history that seems 90%+ pro-Apple content, but also this is an entertainment subreddit, and some people are just positive about what they watch, only have a couple streaming services, and/or find a niche of something they're interested in that nobody else reliably posts to Reddit. Also, some people like me use /r/movies and /r/television as their only source for entertainment news, like RSS aggregators back in the day, and the copy/paste press release stuff doesn't feel weird.

The thing that feels weird on these subs is when a basic press release-type post is awarded gold, but I also don't really understand the ploy there either? (seriously, someone explain studio reddit advertising to me)

Personally I think Season 1 (after the first few episodes, which were great) is the weakest thing Lord & Miller have done, but the potential is strong and I'm glad to have it on my radar."
Click for Murder,I would genuinely hope it’s just an anthology series with some other murder. Not a continuation of the same characters.
Click for Murder,"No show, Aside from Ted Lasso, is a hit on AppleTV+."
Click for Murder,It's ok not to like stuff. There's a ton of stuff I couldn't get into even though everyone loves it. That's just how it goes sometimes.
Click for Murder,Absolute banger
Click for Murder,Looks to me like they are going the whole “hope people have forgotten and moved on” route but who knows. It’s the kind of thing that the general public needs to be making a huge stink about before they’d take any action and that simply hasn’t happened yet.
Click for Murder,"Same here. I thought Apple would care. It's not like a he said she said allegation. It was sexual child abuse if we're being honest.

Given that most comments on this thread have nothing to do with this, I guess they're right. People don't care. And since this isn't going to court, I doubt that changes.

Edit: OP is also a paid apple promotion account. So it wouldn't surprise me if some replies are also astroturfed and conveniently making discussions about everything but Tiffany Haddish's crimes."
Click for Murder,They probably filmed it before she killed her career.
Click for Murder,"Oh, they wrapped filming literally the day before her controversies were reported upon."
Click for Murder,I always wondered why she talks so loud in every roll she plays and then I heard her in an interview talk about how she's deaf in one ear and it completely made sense why she tends to talk louder.
Click for Murder,I love him but that's the worst role of his I've seen. That show could have been much better!
Click for Murder,So you are paid to advertise Apple TV+ ?
Click for Murder,Stop trying to advertise while pretending to be a normal Reddit user.
Click for Murder,"It will have some of the same characters — the same detectives (Danner and Culp), and couple (Aniq and Zoë) with a murder occurring at the latter’s wedding. Brett (Zoë’s ex-husband) would be back too. And possibly some other characters. With a mostly new supporting cast."
Click for Murder,I think it’s because the accusers dismissed their charges soon after the story broke. I’m sure it’d still be a hot topic if that didn’t happen.
Click for Murder,"I think it needs more context. When the skits were filmed, Tiffany Haddish was a nobody. From what I gathered, it's an Aries Spears project for his website—which he funded and produced. Haddish was told that it would be a PSA for Nickelodeon, so she agreed to act and convinced Spears to hire the children of her close friend. While the skits didn't involve actual nudity, Spears' scenes with the children were still uncomfortable and in poor taste. It should be noted that Haddish wasn't in the scenes in question. She was in the scenes leading up to it. Spears then uploaded the skits to Funny or Die, as well as YouTube, to promote his tour dates at the time.

Also, the charges were [dropped](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tiffany-haddish-child-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-responds-1235360684/)."
Click for Murder,Wow I thought you were joking but OP only promotes apple+ shows
Click for Murder,Apple hired Jared Leto
Click for Murder,"I was wondering about that as well, the allegations were awful."
Click for Murder,What did she do?
Click for Murder,I thought you were joking.  That comment history is crazy.
Click for Murder,They wrapped production on the season literally one day before the news on her controversies were reported.
Click for Murder,Oh ok I thought she was just ratchet
Click for Murder,"Yea I mean it is very obviously just veep in space. Funnily enough, imo the thing avenue 5 is missing is Sam richardsons character in veep lol. 

And it’s hard to beat Zach in Silicon Valley, but he does well with the “constant ensemble banter roasting” humor of a Armando Iannucci series"
Click for Murder,"Lol I wish. I just enjoy Apple TV, so I share it."
Click for Murder,"OK, that sounds pretty good.  Seems similar to the White Lotus (although done to a greater extent) - keep the popular characters, but then bring in a fresh set of newbies to keep it from getting stale.  I'll be watching it."
Click for Murder,Wait what? I feel like you might need to read up on the details. Most of the controversy comes from the context of the video they made.
Click for Murder,"No way. Veep is way, way better."
Click for Murder,You enjoy it enough for the first thing in your Reddit bio is telling me to get Apple TV+?? I think you can see why I’m suspicious lol
Click for Murder,I read up on the details when the story broke. I’m just saying people aren’t making a big stink about it because the [plantiff asked for the charges to be dismissed](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tiffany-haddish-child-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-responds-1235360684/). Of course the general public will forget about the case when there isn’t a case anymore.
Click for Murder,"Well, yea. But it’s obvious the show has the same creator haha"
Click for Murder,You’re wrong here. People care more about the context of the video and that the parents weren’t fully aware. It’s irrelevant if the plaintiff asked to drop the charges. Just to be clear nothing she did should be career ruining but we live in the world where the court of public opinion is the big decider and just wait I’d bet when this releases you’ll be seeing a hell of a lot of people bringing it up in discussions. Also just looking at her upcoming projects it makes me wonder if she may be laying low or just not getting offers. Wonder how her being in haunted mansion is gonna be with the public.
Click for Murder,I'm not disagreeing with you that people care about the context of the video and that the parents weren't fully aware. I'm just saying the public outcry hasn't been as loud because the charges have been dismissed. That's it.
Click for Murder,I don’t agree. She hasn’t really been back in the spotlight and I think that’s when we will see the most outcry. I think it’s completely irrelevant that that they dropped the charges (they probably settled outside of court and were paid off) and even if they didn’t I don’t think much was gonna come from it. Again I do not agree that the case being dismissed has nearly as much bearing on public outcry as you and if it were still going it would be the same level today. People talk and then they forget but once that celeb shows up again people start talking again about past deeds.
Click for Murder,"It’s *technically* his third Emmy, but his first two were Daytime Emmys. This is his first *Primetime* Emmy."
Click for Murder,"It’s his first win!? He’s so accomplished both on screen and stage I just assumed he had one by now

Either way congrats Nathan"
Click for Murder,His dips are amazing
Click for Murder,"Well deserved. “The Boy From 6B” it’s just a fantastic episode from start to finish and he’s part of the reason why.

That scene when he’s forcing Theo to listen to music, heartbreaking."
Click for Murder,"Way to go, Timon!!"
Click for Murder,"He was so damn amazing in The Birdcage. Alongside Robin Williams, they were comedy gold. A classic film I didn't discover until recently.

""Oh God, I pierced the toast!"" 😂"
Click for Murder,Why on Earth did they cut guest star from the main broadcast? Lane deserved to get his award at the Emmys proper.
Click for Murder,"> The three-time Tony-winning actor, best known for his memorable roles in films like “The Birdcage” and “Mouse Hunt,” as well as series such as “American Crime Story” and “Penny Dreadful: City of Angels,”

Does *The Lion King* not exist in The Wrap’s world?!?"
Click for Murder,Well Hakuna Matata!
Click for Murder,Mousehunt. Shit is like distilled childhood on the screen.
Click for Murder,Max biayastofk finally got the reward we deserved
Click for Murder,"As a Greek, when he tells the story about his Grandmother I cried like a baby. It came out of nowhere and knocked me out."
Click for Murder,Yes!!!!
Click for Murder,"Well deserved!! He’s always a pleasure to watch, and Teddy ~~was~~ is a good role."
Click for Murder,If it wasn’t for the Pirin tablets…..
Click for Murder,Did they not televise the Emmy awards this year or do I just not watch enough regular tv anymore to know it was on?
Click for Murder,He is such a talent! So glad he won.
Click for Murder,Does he have a EGOT now?
Click for Murder,His character on the Gilded Age is basically a queer Colonel Sanders. He's wonderful.
Click for Murder,He looks sad
Click for Murder,Nathan Lane is one of the funniest men alive. I love him so much! He deserves this!
Click for Murder,This person is a national treasure!
Click for Murder,He was barely in this last season.
The Iron Lady,Stunt people get hurt all the time. That’s what we pay them definitely not enough for.
The Iron Lady,"I dont have an answer but thanks for reminding me of Raising Hope, Ill need to binge it again soon."
The Iron Lady,"Just watched it. Not a doctor, so I don’t know, but that fall looked rough. The stiff arms seemed to happen really fast, but maybe that’s normal. I hope they were ok."
The Iron Lady,Looks like she's wearing a soft helmet under the wig.
The Iron Lady,"If anyone wants to see the scene, Raising Hope is on Hulu."
The Iron Lady,Jeez this gave me chills
The Iron Lady,"i hear ya, but this seems like a monumentally simple thing to fix. 

fall frontwards, lay a mat down, change the camera angle, etc etc"
The Iron Lady,"thats what i thought too. 

i figured if it was a stunt fall (which i am sure it was), there would have been some protections in place to make sure the head didnt slam onto concrete."
The Iron Lady,"interesting, didnt think of that! I will rewatch and take a look. 

seems like the helmet didnt do too great of a job"
The Iron Lady,"Is this just a sneaky way to get people to re-watch Raising Hope?

Because I am 100% for it!"
The Iron Lady,"me too, pretty rough bonk of the noggin"
The Iron Lady,"Fwiw, and I forget the source, but I've heard stunt people take pride in the pain shots. I'd imagine it's  a ""if I'm gonna fuckin break an arm for you you better use it"" mentality"
The Iron Lady,"We rewatched *Back to the Future* a couple nights ago with our kids and the part where Marty’s grandfather hits him with the car and you see and hear Marty’s head hit the rough road surface … it gave me chills. I don’t like that sound. I was trying to figure out how they did it. The medium shot is certainly Michael J. Fox’s double. But the close-up is all Fox. They either used a semi-soft surface made to look like road, or maybe some kind of plate in his hair or under a wig. Or Fox just let his head hit the payment, which seems unlikely. Whatever protections should have been in place for *Raising Hope* must have worked for *Back to the Future.”"
The Iron Lady,"lol as soon as i posted that, i was like ""this sounds like a raising hope ad"""
The Iron Lady,"oh thats an interesting point i hadnt thought of. like a ""dont let this massive concussion be in vain"" type of thing"
The Iron Lady,"I believe in the commentary - which I listened to quite a while ago, mind you - he drops his head onto a safety mat painted to match the road and the sound is an egg hitting a table."
The Iron Lady,"oh MANNNNN. i know that scene very well, as BTTF is one of my favorite movies ever and it gets me every time. the sound when his skull hits the pavement is bone chilling for me. 

I guess back in the 80s it was a little more ""put some ice on it and laugh at the stars circling around his head"" and now its more - yikes thats a brain injury, but it still gets me pretty bad.

EDIT: to be clear, im talking about him hitting his head on the pavement in the movie, not the stuntman."
The Iron Lady,"If that makes you cringe, you won't like the scene where he is dragged by a rope on his neck in the 3rd movie."
The Iron Lady,Oh thank you! 38 years later and I can rest easy for poor Michael J. Fox’s head. The hairs on my neck are still going to stand up when I see that scene though.
The Iron Lady,The sound was added in post-production. He landed on a mat.
The Iron Lady,"I saw the third movie in theaters as a kid. I’ll be ok. Something about his head on the pavement has always made me recoil. I’m blaming the sound, which someone else said was the sound of a cracking egg."
The Iron Lady,"knowing that will have zero effect on my reaction lol

(but it is still good to know, thanks)"
The Iron Lady,We’re going to see a lot of borderline shows renewed because of the looming writer’s strike.
The Iron Lady,She's going to mop up crime.
The Iron Lady,The only IP that's worthwhile for Fox in a sea of formulaic procedurals and awful reality shows.
The Iron Lady,Is this any good? It looks fun.
The Iron Lady,She’s going to take over
The Iron Lady,"Thrilled - and surprised - about this! Need more Thony/Arman like burning.

  
Really hope FOX winds up renewing Alert too! I'm enjoying it."
The Iron Lady,Literally anything boring will get a chance on network tv now days
The Iron Lady,Because you'll be dust by Monday.
The Iron Lady,"Yep, I’m working on a show that hasn’t officially been renewed, but they’re already talking next season starting up only a month after we finish this season rather than the usual 3-4 month hiatus to try and get ahead of the curve."
The Iron Lady,">We’re going to see a lot of borderline shows renewed because of the looming writer’s strike.

Showtime/ Paramount+ didn't seem to get the message. While ""Let the Right One In"" wasn't going to win any awards nevertheless it was better than most and now with what turns out to be the finale episode unless picked up elsewhere I was more then interested in looking forward to it's return for S2. ""The Cleaning Lady"" I am unfamiliar with though speaking of cleaning *ladies* shout out to Margaret Qualley Andie MacDowell's daughter in ""Maid."""
The Iron Lady,I’m still shocked they just axed The Blacklist.
The Iron Lady,That would be an improvement to the last few storylines.
The Iron Lady,Season 1 was. Season 2 was a mess.
The Iron Lady,The premise doom itself after S1
The Iron Lady,Is production going to be done back to back to cut down turn around time?
The Iron Lady,"How is Let the Right One In? Big fan of the OG movie, I'm wondering how they possibly do a show based on something that was already remade..."
The Iron Lady,They released the rights and are shipping it around which is really good news.
The Iron Lady,I’m not sure a show ending after 10 seasons is exactly the definition of “axed” especially when it gets an ending.
The Iron Lady,"Good show, but should've ended around season 5."
The Iron Lady,"I’m shocked it took them so long to do it, that show was good up to season 4-5."
The Iron Lady,Yep. Probably would have been a better movie than a television series.
The Iron Lady,They straight up made Thony unlikeable. I don't even know if I'm going to watch S3 of this especially if they don't do something with that boring Luca storyline quick
The Iron Lady,It’s so they can get as many episodes finished before a shut down happens.
The Iron Lady,[deleted]
The Iron Lady,"> Big fan of the OG movie

OG movie IMO was the best. Everything else pales in comparison. I hear the novel (the original OG) is the best of all. That said I enjoyed the 2008 Swedish release immensely as well as the 2010 Let Me In Film (Chloë Grace Moretz) and sadly but still enjoyable the recently cancelled Let the Right One In."
The Iron Lady,"I find myself rooting for Nadia by midway through season 2. 

I think the biggest issue with Thony is Luca. He holds her story back a LOT."
The Iron Lady,"Fuck, that fucking sucks"
The Iron Lady,Damn. I am a fan of the original movie and I had this on my list of shows to watch.
The Iron Lady,[deleted]
The Iron Lady,"That's a legit point. There is so much good TV on right now, but if they pulled Let the Right One In also, then I can't even count on stuff being there a a few months later."
The Iron Lady,"She's saying it's ironic because they are pit against each other by men in the show and fans which are majority men are also pitting them against each other. But not sure what comments that is based on. Are fans pitting them against each other because of misogyny, or because it's literally the direction the show is going in?"
The Iron Lady,The preview we've been getting for 2-3 weeks shows Alicent trying to stab Rhaenyra with a dagger. Fans are *clearly* being led to believe they will be at odds with eachother.
The Iron Lady,To what extent can “fans” pit fictional characters against each other in the first place??
The Iron Lady,Aren’t we supposed to?
The Iron Lady,Fans pitting batman and joker against each other is fucking ironic
The Iron Lady,"Almost like they are different teams, maybe one team green one black so ironic"
The Iron Lady,"I think she’s doing a great job on the show, but when I watch her interviews I get the vibe that she neither knows nor cares for the source material very much."
The Iron Lady,"
 It's a civil war and they're >!(going to be) the leaders of the opposing sides.!< Course people are going to pit them against each other that's what the show is about!

She's a good actress but this quote pretty dumb

Edit: Yes I've read the exact quote multiple times and yet still haven't figured out if she was referring to her and Emily Carey or Rhaenyra and Alicent. If the quote is about her and Emily than it's fair comment to make, just worded confusingly"
The Iron Lady,"Honestly getting tired of actors and actresses giving their unwanted takes on fans of franchises and belittling the audiences of the show which is making them money in the first place.

The show itself seems to be implying the two will be at odds specifically because Rhaenyra is a little more immature while Alicent is at least trying to be level headed.

If that’s not where the show is going then well it’s a twist which the actress is spoiling plus expecting the audience to predict that without inside knowledge is pretty rich. 

So far great show with lots of tension and a very balanced portrayal of multiple parties. Though people need to shut this BS down of streamers , actors etc. blindly going ‘stupid fans this that’. 

All for outing and even arresting ones that send death threats and the like but if people just have an opinion on the show, especially as mild as this one, then leave it be."
The Iron Lady,"Is she just making shit up? Because I have not seen one discussion saying Milly Allcock is better than Emily Carry, or viceversa. The only actors people are ""pushing against one another"" whatever that means, is young Rhaenyra and old Rhanyra and even that seems more like a ""we love young Rhaenyra so much how could anyone do better""."
The Iron Lady,"Everyone has their opinions I guess. If you've read the book. This is not news. In fact if you've read the book, this comment comes off as silly. As that is literally what this book is about. Lol they are not friends."
The Iron Lady,It’s like every fucking day I’m seeing an article from an actor in a show with some (for lack of a better word) “woke” statement criticizing fans of the show/movie. It’s so fucking tiring.
The Iron Lady,"I think the show has been pretty clear that both of them are being used as pawns by their fathers playing a larger game. It’s quite sad, their friendship was the first of many casualties in the coming conflict."
The Iron Lady,Maybe she means some gross stuff she read online not just usual stuff.   Maybe people are talking about who's hotter etc. Who knows.
The Iron Lady,Why is there a news article every week about some actor in this show reacting to social media?
The Iron Lady,"TIL picking sides in a civil war is misogynistic

Worthwhile cultural criticism is dead."
The Iron Lady,Why can't fans just watch a fucking show without being attacked by the actors anymore? Let the fans attack eachother for saying stupid shit and have the actors tell a damn story...
The Iron Lady,"""What I found quite hilarious is that the fan base is also putting the actors, the Young Alicent and the Young Rhaenyra, at odds with each other, and choosing who’s better, also by decision of mostly men. So I think that it’s really just fucking ironic""

Does she have a problem with the viewing audience being majority male? And no shit, sherlock, people pit characters against each other all the time. That's the nature of, you know, watching a show about conflict.

I'm going to enjoy the hell out of the general audience perception of Rhaenyra as the plot progresses. The Dany treatment she's getting now will be hilarious in hindsight."
The Iron Lady,They have been against each other though? They’ve been arguing and Rhaenrya was HEAVILY manipulating Alicent with her lies in the most recent episode.
The Iron Lady,"those men, man, always pitting women against each others"
The Iron Lady,"ffs with these people in Hollywood. So pretentious lol. Fans are putting them against each other because that’s literally what the writers are doing. They need viewers to want to pick a side and to create controversy. Ugh, these people smh."
The Iron Lady,Wait till she learns about us having a circle jerk over who'd win in a fight: jaime or khal drogo and other dozen male knights lmao.
The Iron Lady,Here we go more fan baiting
The Iron Lady,I don’t think she knows what irony is
The Iron Lady,"Is she saying pitting the ""actors"" against each other by comparing them, or pitting the characters against each other?  Because those are very different. 

The story is dictating a showdown between the 2.  I'm not seeing how that is misogyny at all. 

That said, if the comments are about deciding which actress is doing better, I can *kind of* see that point.  But people will always compare actors on shows. 

Also, is GoT mostly men watching?  Maybe its just my social circle, but it seems pretty evenly split to me."
The Iron Lady,"Reading this comment thread just makes me weary of this show.

It’s wild how Game of Thrones showed the sexism inherent in a society and didn’t make it feel like a forced song and dance."
The Iron Lady,"**Alcock said :**

> What I found quite hilarious is that the fan base is also putting the actors, the Young Alicent and the Young Rhaenyra, at odds with each other, and choosing who’s better, also by decision of mostly men. So I think that it’s really just fucking ironic."
The Iron Lady,Why is it ironic?
The Iron Lady,I'm not sure why they say ironic but I was really sad when they had their falling out and Rhaenyra shunned Alicent... I know each episode essentially spans large portions of time but I was hoping they'd make amends much faster.
The Iron Lady,Milly needs to stop taking it so personal. This isn’t real life. Chill.
The Iron Lady,"...which in itself is ironic to say, because it's not like the men got each others back in some sisterhood pact either."
The Iron Lady,I seriously don't care.  What I do care about the writing seems a bit off this season so far.  Still Game of Thrones.  But off.
The Iron Lady,The original story is literally called >!The Princess and The Queen!< lol
The Iron Lady,[deleted]
The Iron Lady,Unless she's talking about it being ironic because >!of how the relationship goes in the books!< it's kind of frustrating how actors on these shows don't know their own character's origins
The Iron Lady,"Maybe my humor bone is broken, but I don't see how people comparing actors to each other and also being men is ironic."
The Iron Lady,"They are literally the opposing leaders in a civil war, how are they not put against each other?"
The Iron Lady,Or maybe fans read the book?
The Iron Lady,[deleted]
The Iron Lady,I'm not sure she's read the books
The Iron Lady,"What a shit take, she just wants attention"
The Iron Lady,[deleted]
The Iron Lady,"Women throw a fit when stories are not written for them. The actress admits the fanbase is majority male… maybe they should write stories for a male majority fanbase. Jesus wokeness is getting fucking old. I watched ‘The Descent’ last night and it was a fun movie that had an all female cast. Didn’t have any male bashing in it so it was enjoyable. Maybe the HotD writers could take a note from that movie that you can write female stories that men will want to watch if you don’t make men the punching bag of your story. “Down with the Patriarchy”? In the US, women are going to college at a 50% higher rate than men. Every demographic of women is going to college at a higher rate than white men. If you are a black female, you are more likely to go to college than a white male. Females nowadays are appropriating the trails of 50+ yo women. If you are female and under the age of 40, you have had nothing but positive bias in your life. You had female only scholarships, female only mentorship opportunities, preferred hiring, and preferred promotions. The patriarchy has been dead for 20 years, we now need to kill the matriarchy because young men are suffering because they have fewer opportunities than their female counterparts yet are still hearing about how privileged they are… fuck off, that is why this show is unwatchable."
The Iron Lady,I'm just really enjoying the show so far.
The Iron Lady,Is this one of those pathetic corporate fan baiting attempts
The Iron Lady,Sometimes actors don’t realise who pays them
The Iron Lady,"They’re… supposed to be pitted against each other lol

These 2 should probably stop giving their opinion on the show & just let fame come to them."
The Iron Lady,"Threads like these really go to show that people will just dead ass read the title and post without knowing what it’s talking about “. She’s talking about how the two characters are friends and how that friendship is challenged by the sexist culture they  live in. The irony is that even though this takes place in a fiction patriarchal society, many people in the real world are doing the same thing."
Classroom of the Elite,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Classroom of the Elite,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Classroom of the Elite,[removed]
Classroom of the Elite,[removed]
Classroom of the Elite," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Classroom of the Elite,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Classroom of the Elite,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Classroom of the Elite,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Classroom of the Elite,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Classroom of the Elite,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Classroom of the Elite,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
Classroom of the Elite,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Classroom of the Elite,Rat King is coming
Classroom of the Elite,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Classroom of the Elite,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Classroom of the Elite,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Classroom of the Elite,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Classroom of the Elite,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Classroom of the Elite,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Classroom of the Elite,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Classroom of the Elite,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Classroom of the Elite,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Classroom of the Elite,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Classroom of the Elite,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Classroom of the Elite,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Classroom of the Elite,[removed]
Classroom of the Elite,The lack of action started in episode 3
Classroom of the Elite,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Classroom of the Elite,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Classroom of the Elite,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Classroom of the Elite,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Classroom of the Elite,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Classroom of the Elite,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Classroom of the Elite,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
Classroom of the Elite,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Classroom of the Elite,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
Classroom of the Elite,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Classroom of the Elite,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Classroom of the Elite,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Classroom of the Elite,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Classroom of the Elite,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Classroom of the Elite,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Classroom of the Elite,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Classroom of the Elite,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Classroom of the Elite,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Classroom of the Elite,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Classroom of the Elite,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Classroom of the Elite,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Classroom of the Elite,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Classroom of the Elite,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
Classroom of the Elite,[deleted]
Classroom of the Elite,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Classroom of the Elite,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Classroom of the Elite,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
Classroom of the Elite,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Classroom of the Elite,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
Classroom of the Elite,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
Classroom of the Elite,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
Classroom of the Elite,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
Classroom of the Elite,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
Classroom of the Elite,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
Classroom of the Elite,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
Classroom of the Elite,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
Classroom of the Elite,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
Classroom of the Elite,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
Classroom of the Elite,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
Classroom of the Elite,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
Classroom of the Elite,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
Classroom of the Elite,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
Classroom of the Elite,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
Classroom of the Elite,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
Classroom of the Elite,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
Classroom of the Elite,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
Classroom of the Elite,We gonna get the rat king.
Classroom of the Elite,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
Classroom of the Elite,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
Classroom of the Elite,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
Classroom of the Elite,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
Classroom of the Elite,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
Classroom of the Elite,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
Classroom of the Elite,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
Classroom of the Elite,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
Classroom of the Elite,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
Classroom of the Elite,[removed]
Classroom of the Elite,[removed]
Classroom of the Elite,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
Classroom of the Elite,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
Classroom of the Elite,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
Classroom of the Elite,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
Classroom of the Elite,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
Classroom of the Elite,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
Classroom of the Elite,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
Classroom of the Elite,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
Classroom of the Elite,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
Classroom of the Elite,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
Classroom of the Elite, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
Classroom of the Elite,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
Classroom of the Elite,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
Classroom of the Elite,And more golfing
Classroom of the Elite,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
The In-Laws,And Barney Miller too.
The In-Laws,[And let's not forget his greatest role.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/e/e7/Ducktales-disneyscreencaps.com-8216.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130424021853)
The In-Laws,I didn't think Jane Curtin would be old enough to play Katey Sagal's mum.
The In-Laws,"Wait a damn minute.

Dan has remarried?  To Peggy Bundy?!!


Roseanne and Married With Children were the two competing white trash comedies of my youth.  I was a Married With Children fan.  I could never have envisioned Peggy Bundy actually replacing Roseanne on her own show."
The In-Laws,"To overuse an overused word... is she the most underrated actor/performer to come from SNL?

She's done nothing but work constantly ever since.  She always brings it.  I worked on Shaggy Dog where she played a judge, and when they announced that she was wrapped, we all gave her a standing ovation."
The In-Laws,They’re already at Season 5?! Is The Conners doing that good in the ratings? I remember watching Roseanne as a kid but it was never my favorite so I didn’t really bother with the revival. I think I’m just surprised that Goodman has stuck it out so long.
The In-Laws,"Good grief, John Goodman looks fantastic."
The In-Laws,Wait thats what John Goodman looks like in 2022??? Or is this an old photo? I mean its fairly airbrushed but he does look much skinnier.
The In-Laws,Loved her on Third Rock from the Sun.
The In-Laws,"Every single episode of this show is a fuck you to Roseanne Barr and I wholeheartedly approve.  Haven't watched a minute of it, but I'm just pleased it's still on the air."
The In-Laws,"Wait, this show is still on?  Holy shit, I'm actually shocked this has been going for five seasons."
The In-Laws,It’s kinda incredible how thin John Goodman is these days
The In-Laws,"This clip from SNL is what I think of every time I hear her name.  

https://youtu.be/klvjHXcuhF4"
The In-Laws,Laura Dern was about 11 years older than Reese Witherspoon when she played her mother in Wild.
The In-Laws,He doesn’t even look like Dan anymore..
The In-Laws,"Jane Curtin seems to pop up every couple of decades in a hit show since her days on SNL. In the 80s she was in Kate & Allie, in the late 90s to early 00s she was in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and now here she is popping up on the Connors. She hasn't worked a lot since her early fame but when she does take a role it ends up being a memorable one."
The In-Laws,I had no idea this show was still on.
The In-Laws,"I was wondering if we were gonna get a 5th season, I am happy."
The In-Laws,But he looks older than her…
The In-Laws,7 years old is too young to have a kid.
The In-Laws,whos watching this?
The In-Laws,They can just age her up. I feel like she will do a good job of reminding us of Estelle Parsons character.
The In-Laws,Love them both Jane and Katey. Roseanne was a disgusting bigoted lummox
The In-Laws,How is this show still on?
The In-Laws,Tastes in comedy differ. I don't remotely understand why anyone thinks the obvious humor on this show is remotely funny.
The In-Laws,Not funny without Roseann.
The In-Laws,They’re still making this show?
The In-Laws,Slim JG is just not right.
The In-Laws,Is that John Goodman?
The In-Laws,How is this even possible? 😂😂😂
The In-Laws,Someone put this garbage out of its misery
The In-Laws,Skip that one
The In-Laws,I hope she writes the script because the writing on this show sucks
The In-Laws,Who watches this shit?
The In-Laws,Fuck off with this show of traitors.
The In-Laws,Nobody gives a damn about this show now. Y’all over reacting ass ruined it by ditching Roseanne
The In-Laws,"Not that this is a post totally about John Goodman, but he is so fantastic on The Righteous Gemstones. 

Here to recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!! On hbo max. He’s so so good."
The In-Laws,I have seen the last couple of episodes and John Goodman is sometimes talking like he has a speech impairment.  It’s really weird.
The In-Laws,Oooohhh. TIL I have to find this show. I hope she lives up to the attributes of her SNL character :)
The In-Laws,Some asked over in the SNL sub what Jane Curtin was doing since the Martins are hosting tomorrow and here's the answer.
The In-Laws,Bring back Roseanne! They killed off dan and brought him back they can do the same for Roseanne
The In-Laws,He’s a pos
The In-Laws,Barbara Bel Geddes was only 9 years older than Larry Hagman on Dallas.
The In-Laws,"Jane Curtin is 75, Katey Sagal is 68. Strange! Haha"
The In-Laws,"I always think of Mean Girls.

Amy Poehler, 33, playing the mother of Rachel McAdams, 26."
The In-Laws,"Roseanne did the same thing with her Mom and Nan, there was only 7 years between them"
The In-Laws,She was the only pregnant girl in her second grade class.
The In-Laws,The original mom and grandma on Roseanne weren't aged properly either.
The In-Laws,"Katey Sagal is 68,how many 86/87 year old  and up working actresses are there to choose from,especially if you are looking to hire a name actress."
The In-Laws,She not.  Sagal is 68 and Curtin is 75.
The In-Laws,Estelle Getty was older than Bea Arthur and iconically played her mother in Golden Girls.
The In-Laws,"Roseanne Barr was who the creators of *Married With Children* originally envisioned for the role of Peggy, so this tracks."
The In-Laws,"There was the other Married with children type show out too. There was a stuffed puppet involved and the sister/daughter was a bombshell. 

It's like when a big tent movie comes out and someone spits out a replica starring Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen.

OK, I googled ""Married with children clone"" and it was the first result. ""Unhappily Ever After"". We didn't have cable and it was on like UPN or something strange, never really watched it. And Nicki Cox was her name."
The In-Laws,Yeah and its actually an oddly compelling storyline. The show is actually REALLY good now
The In-Laws,And Mary Albright comes back to earth to be dans mother in law
The In-Laws,"I would say that she's in the running. This would be a great question to post on r/livefromnewyork , you should post it!"
The In-Laws,I think she's also better as the wife or romantic interest than in the mom role.
The In-Laws,"> She's done nothing but work constantly ever since. 

I've somehow managed to never see her in anything but Third Rock From the Sun, but IMDB does show very few breaks."
The In-Laws,"what are you kidding me, goodman is making 400 thousand dollars an episode, gets to drive home at the end of the day, he ain't going no where"
The In-Laws,"More shocking, is that actually John Goodman????  Was he just the driver for a Dan Connor robot?"
The In-Laws,"It surprisingly good. I started watching for the nostalgia factor and the “ahhh; I know what they are talking about” bits of dialogue when referencing the previous show. 

With that being said; it really does stand on its own quite well as a typical, and well written sitcom"
The In-Laws,Its surprisingly really good
The In-Laws,"Yes it's actually a pretty good show, I would say it improved dramatically after Roseanne was fired."
The In-Laws,We can't get a second season of Firefly but this turd gets five?!?
The In-Laws,He doesn’t even look like John Goodman! I was like who tf is this?! Good for him.
The In-Laws,Apparently he's been drinking less? Most alcoholics who I know who've quit ended up losing a ton of weight.
The In-Laws,It took some concentrated staring for me to find him in the face pictured above.
The In-Laws,"I’m more surprised this show is still on, I had no idea"
The In-Laws,Unpopular opinion but I think he looks horrible now.
The In-Laws,He's lost a lot of weight recently. No stick figure but compared to his heyday he's much slimmer.
The In-Laws,Photoshop
The In-Laws,"I actually miss Roseanne on the show because she would be the Archie Bunker of the family. Takes the controversial opinion and brings her own take on it which creates a more interesting show. That being said the cast is still amazing and they all work incredibly well without her.

Its a shame it played out the way it did but she dug her own grave on that."
The In-Laws,Me too. Kind of liked the “real” nature of the characters; most weren’t Hollywood attractive at all and seemed to have real problems. But never could stomach to much of Roseanne. Don’t watch it now at all but feel as you do that it succeeds without her.
The In-Laws,"Sadly, it is not a good show.  I was really rooting for it, having been a fan of the original, but it's just bad.  The writing is bad, the acting is bad, there's little regard for continuity, they're constantly stunt casting, the tone is more ""after school special"" than prime-time sitcom.  I'm amazed it has stayed on the air this long."
The In-Laws,She’s living her best life
The In-Laws,"Me too. I’ve heard absolutely NOTHING about this show since they fired Roseanne. Not one rumor, not one article, nothing. I opened this thread because I didn’t understand what I was reading."
The In-Laws,I still can't believe anyone watches it.
The In-Laws,"Mother in law, not mother, but that being said, her daughter on the show is like five years younger than her too"
The In-Laws,Better than Golden girls where the mother was actually younger than the daughter.
The In-Laws,"I watch it. Grew up with Roseanne (mostly reruns) and tuned into the revival. I liked that, followed it to The Conners, and just kept with it since. Actually one of the few network shows I still watch. It's good for silly laughs. Nothing groundbreaking of course but it's watchable if you enjoy the characters and the humor."
The In-Laws,Enough people to get it to a 5th season
The In-Laws,"My partner and I watch it. He grew up with Roseanne, so the characters mean a lot to them. I didn't grow up with much money, so while I didn't watch Roseanne growing up, it's interesting (and refreshing) to see some of the specific issues I grew up with and to be able to laugh a little at the situations.

I wish Roseanne hadn't said what she did. I'm a raging liberal, but I loved how the show humanized conservatives and didn't make them out to be a caricatures."
The In-Laws,"Me. It’s a fun light show, with great acting"
The In-Laws,Do you people get some kind of orgasmic joy out of acting like if you don't watch the show nobody else could possibly be watching it?
The In-Laws,"I did a little, and I really liked it. I also loved the original while growing up. 

But I suck at keeping up with TV shows in general"
The In-Laws,Its on its last leg..less than 2.5 million viewers.. Compare that to the 18 mill when Roseanne was renewed in 2018.
The In-Laws,I kind of forgot when it was on this year but now I figured it out I am.
The In-Laws,You ever watched it?
The In-Laws,Some people just want to get home and put on something light that they identify with. Not everything has to be high art.
The In-Laws,Not funny with Roseanne
The In-Laws,"Think of your favorite show that was cancelled… ok? More than that show. 

The Conners is not even close to being one of my top 10 shows, but the storyline is simple and easy to keep track, and I don’t need to get heavily invested. It’s a good example of a comfort show."

Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Man wait until they get a load of Season 2.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"welcome to imdb, not a new phenomena on that site by any means"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"As soon as there is anything gay put in anything popular the internet trolls are always teeming to tear it down 

The funny thing is Bill way gay in the game too but the same people pretended that wasn't the case."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I really like/love the show.

I don't think it's the Second Coming of Christ, but i am really liking it.

But come on, this episode is so much more than ""gay love"".

yeah, sure, the relationship it was based on was between gay people, but at its core, this episode showed a romance/love throughout the years.

I mean, i am sure, everybody can relate with that, regardless if it's gay love or not.

Yes, to me, man-on-man SEX makes me a little uncomfortable, but so does seeing people eat shrimp, but that doesn't mean that i don't like those people or think that they don't deserve some recognition (but if they eat chocolate, i'm throwing hands).

This episode showed the good, the bad and the struggles that may come with a long relationship, all of that during the brutality of a post-apocalyptic zombie world.

In the end, what got to them wasn't the zombies or the raiders, it was life itself, we all get old, sick, slow.

They chose to go out in their own terms, instead of being eaten and rippen apart by monsters.

Not only that, but the parallels of Joel and Bill being protectors and fighting, living for the sake of their loved ones.

I mean, if this is ""woke shit"", atleast it's good shit and that is all that matters to me."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"The episode was about the inevitability of having to say goodbye to someone you’ve built a life with. That’s why it’s powerful. Being with that one person for the last time. I can’t think of a single more relatable storyline, since almost everyone will go through this at some point in their life. But then I remember……there are fucking dickheads in this world."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Wait till they find out about Ellie
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Who fucking cares

User scores will always be terrible. No one should pay attention to them. If IMDb got rid of user scores, it would instantly become a better website."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,">I want to watch a show about the post-apocalypse where people survive as best they can, not about the love of bearded men!

Homophobia aside, this is very funny."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"The right: make liberals cry again

Also the right: two gay guys were kissing on my tv show about zombies??? That’s LGBTQ propaganda/agenda! I am so triggered I’m going to give it 1 star on IMDB

unfortunately the world is filled with a lot of ignorance and hate. It’s just ironic that Bill’s character IS these people, which makes it ironic as hell"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Episode 3 also explained why treatment and vaccines were not possible. Everyone was already infected after eating pancakes.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I’m convinced that anyone who watched that episode and had only some kind of homophobic knee jerk reaction, rather than being incredibly moved and having their faith in love restored a little, if you can watch that beautiful love story and not feel even a twinge in your heart, then you must be a soulless ghoul, an incomplete person. I’d go as far as to use it as a litmus test for people in my life lmfao. As a straight guy with a lot of straight dude friends, they aren’t always completely politically correct or sensitive to issues surrounding sexuality. Every single one of us who watched agreed it was fucking beautiful and we all shed a tear, even one of my friends who usually complains about ‘woke bs’. It was a fucking beautiful bit of TV. I think everyone wants a love like that in their life, and it’s sad that if some of these hateful people just took the message of ‘open yourself up to good things and let someone love you’, they might not be so hateful. Instead they can’t see past their tunnel vision, it’s insane to me that people can be so close minded."

Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"> I want to watch a show about the post-apocalypse where people survive as best they can

Literally what that episode was about."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,If there ever was a time of being able to trust user reviews on anything that is even slightly related to a minority group that time is 100 percent over. Review bombs basically happen on every show or movie with these topics. It’s so lame. It was an amazing episode of television.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,">	User: kathanorn “So far worst episode that brings nothing to the story but only purpose for that is to please certain agenda. Okay the scenery is beautiful and music is top notch, yet Neil butchered his very own story.” 0/10

Bullshit. This episode 100% contributed to Joel & Ellie's story and even foreshadowed some future part 2 stuff! Also, am not surprised anti wokist are here. Once, this cult put tlou in its sights, it was game over.  Now, these fucks will be the butt zits of the fandom & will forever annoy fans with thier stupidity like they do in Star Wars & marvel. Fucking annoying if you ask me."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"There is some room for nuance here.

Personally I enjoyed the love story between Frank and Bill, that part was great.

BUT, the episode also *wasn’t* perfect. It doesn’t deserve a 10/10 either.

If we are being honest, the episode was quite slow. For someone not interested in romance stories (whether straight or gay) it was almost excruciatingly boring.

It felt like a slower episode of the Walking Dead or something, but without even a cliffhanger ending. It was practically like watching an inclusive rom-com, but instead of having any drama, the rom-com starts at the happy ending and continues through the golden years. It was… nice.

But exciting? Not at all.

We also shouldn’t ignore that it was a tremendous tonal shift from the last two episodes. I’ve been a huge fan of the show, but was still slightly off-put by it. Why? Because it was a romance story.

I, like many, don’t watch really enjoy watching romance stories. Nothing wrong with them, but they just aren't super exciting to me. And I certainly didn’t turn on TLOU intending to watch a romance story.  It doesn’t matter whatsoever to me that it was a romance between two men. I support inclusivity on screen. That part was great. I just wouldn’t personally choose to watch a slow love-story about ANYONE.

There are plenty of legitimate reasons to not like the episode. I am not surprised it was controversial, and not just because of homophobia. It was a biiiiig change from the game, basically the first truly significant departure in some ways.

Not all criticism of the show is homophobic in nature. Mine isn't at least.

The show being inclusive is great, but inclusion is not the same as perfection. You can succeed in one area and fail in others. For me, this was a pretty weak episode.

And it had nothing to do with the romance, and everything to do with the slow pacing and near complete lack of action."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,IMDb user reviews are worthless. Shows and movies get obviously review bombed all the time and they don’t really do anything to prevent that.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Good episode, really enjoyed it. Came on Reddit to see what people thought, and remembered why I stopped coming on Reddit."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,It doesn’t change the source material at all with Bill being gay
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"The IMDB allows anyone to post. Anyone can use the internet now. It's only natural that some people posting will be uneducated idiots.

I wouldn't give this episode 10 / 10 either, there are extremes to everything (it was pretty great though)."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,">""NPC syndrome"" was in full effect with that ending.

What on earth does this even mean? You terminally online people weird me out."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Ellie is an unlikable asshole. She’s my current issue with the show right now. I did *like* episode 3, but it felt wedged in and pointless to the main story of the show. It would be a 10/10 if it were some separate “short film” style thing."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Me in Wheel of Time fandom: see, these people are all always ready with their idiot pitchforks and bad-take torches

(that being said, TLoU ep3 was better than anything in WoT S1)"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Listen, as a guy who played the game, I was pretty concerned what the point of that episode was going to be about 40 minutes in, because if it wouldn’t have gone anywhere it would have absolutely looked like a random gay plot line inserted and drawn out for no reason. BUT, the way they wrapped it up with the note and absolutely nailed the crux of Joel’s arc was absolutely amazing. It was so much more powerful than the game! Top notch television. I am expecting Emmy’s to be handed out for that one."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Its not a 1/10...but its not a 10/10 either. 

It was filler, and stretched out for 65mins. I understand the point of the episode, to show that love still survives, thrives even, despite the hopelessness. The letter solidfying Joel in his future purpose of protecting Ellie...i get the point, i do.

BUT

Lets be honest, it all couldve been acheived in half the time, and the left over time couldve driven the main story forward.

It was filler, well written and well acted, but filler. 

And what the hell?! 80s music at the end of ep1 was wasted foreshadowing too, now that i think about it."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I fall into the camp of not enjoying this episode as much as the other two. 

Oh it’s own, the episode is good. As a fan of the game, though, I felt like we missed some great interactions between Bill and Ellie. I also felt like Bill got out of it a bit too “clean”. 

It bothered me that, in 16 years or so, Bill and Frank were able to build and maintain their little slice of paradise with their biggest problem being one attack from a few raiders that was managed by some automatic traps. This world is brutal and unforgiving. There is no way that these two wouldn’t have drawn more attention from different roaming gangs, or infected. I really had to stretch my suspension of disbelief to go along with it. 

I predicted Bill taking suicide pills as well the moment the idea was mentioned. However, I thought that the ending would be that they didn’t work, and we’d transition to the gruff, disenfranchised, emotionally distant Bill from the game when Joel and Ellie met him. It would have made perfect sense, and been more heartbreaking knowing his history. However, he got to die in his lover’s arms on his own terms, and that was it. I feel like it’s too clean a death for somebody in this universe. 

As a horror geek, I guess I’m also a little sour on the omission of some great horror set pieces that could have gone along with the Bill’s town section. I’m fine with the love story flashback, but I feel like we lost some great content and interactions in place of it.

I think that this episode really should have supplemented the adventure that Joel and Ellie have at this point in the game, not replaced it entirely."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I love this episode and I would give it 9 out of 10 too, but I have to disagree with you on Velma. Velma is not a “mid”, it’s straight out bad, maybe 2 or 3 bad."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Yeah but thank goodness they took away the forums to kill the trolls. That worked great.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I mean it generally balances out. While there are a bunch of brainless 1/10 reviews, there’s just as many including myself who’s biased and rates it 10/10 because they/I might look past a few things"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Some people truly are incapable of enjoying things cause they're so hateful. Just let them be miserable and enjoy the episode and rest of the show.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I'm sure Velma is getting review bombed, but it's also kinda bad. I didn't make it far in that at all. TLoU episode 3 was amazing though. 

Personally I think user reviews are better when it's binary. Just a choice between like or dislike. Otherwise there are too many disingenuous reviews trying to game the system on either end of the spectrum."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I’m not a fan of shows shoe-horning diversity and inclusion quotas where it breaks the realism of the show and makes the show worse - rings of power- Witcher blood Origin- though both those were awful in far worse ways than that

But episode 3 of last of us was improved by it being 2 gay men, it makes more sense of that relationship building and happening in the first place

If it’s a male survivalist and a women who falls down the hole it gives off a much more creepy vibe of her prostituting herself for the safety of his compound 

But with it being 2 men you don’t feel that creepy dynamic which the relationship is built on

It also helps with the character being perfect for Nick Offerman, who was fantastic"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,I was bored to tears. Terrible episode you could easily cut from the season on a rewatch and not miss anything. Those 10/10 reviews are biased af.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Unsurprising a bunch of incels are making their voices heard on rating websites.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I'm a conservative, but I know good TV when I see it. 

Best Television I've seen in a while."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Thankfully? Why? Why can't people dislike an episode of a series? You sound like you have a dog in this fight
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,You guys shouldn’t give a shit. You either like the episode or you don’t
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Honestly who even pays attention to review scores. They are almost always a load of horse shit. I mean look at how shockingly bad rings of power was and trolls still gave it thousands of 10 votes.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Not sure if a few reviews ranting about gay romance are representative. I would bet that most of the negative pointing comes from game fans that didn't like the end, which is a serious change relatively to the game.

Bill was gay in the game too, though that was only suggested, and most fans that I have seen are pretty aware of that."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Bill is gay in the game so why are people so fucking mad?.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,I get that people like the episode but calling it the best self contained episode done by HBO sort of invites people to argue with you
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"It’s annoying in the modern world people put any stock whatsoever into these manipulated, completely non representative user scores.

It’s also funny to me that these homophobic last of us “fans” even exist. It’s one of the gayest mainstream entertainment franchises, what are you still doing here?"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I think its' fine that people can give 1 to a show, as much as it's fine they can give it a 10. Everyone can cast his vote and this is the result. The fact that many took the time to write about their irritation is at least the sign they somewhat cared about it. Yes, you can call them homophobic but until it's illegal being so, well, that's how things go. If 20% of population is homophobic and they can vote on their liking of the show, this is an understandable result"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"“Wahhhh gay men bad I’m a bigot” ~ 1-star voters

No other reason as that episode was an actual masterpiece."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,It was amazing …anything that can make me feel like that I’m here for
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I loved the episode. It was beautiful. I want to find love like that, and I'm straight."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I didn't particularly enjoy this episode, but the fact they are gay never even entered my mind as a reason.

It didn't feel out of place or forced or anything to me, I actually thought it was a really nice depiction of a gay couple, you'd have to be pretty bigoted to take offence to this."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Just finished this episode and it's just fantastic. All the hype is warranted.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Best episode of a series that had not a GD thing to do with the series. There should be a new Emmy category.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,People being angry at The Last of Us TV series for including stuff from the game is hilarious to me.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,It's the religious homophobes as usual.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Well here I can surely say that those are straight homophobes. 

Episode was fantastic. 

Unlike Velma. Fuck Velma. Thats how you do LGBT in media, you impudent cringemakers."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,">I want to watch a show about the post-apocalypse where people survive as best they can

That's exactly what the episode showed lmfao.

>It's not about the game. This is about ideology.

This guy didn't play either of these games. If he did, he wouldn't be complaining.

>yet Neil butchered his very own story

Anyone wanna tell this guy that it's the same story?

Female, non-white, gay, any of those in a combination just triggers these guys. Hell, I work with a couple of people with similar views, but I can convince them why a different story is good."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"It’s probably the best episode so far, yet the only one(so far)that I probably won’t watch on rewatch. It was a beautiful love story that fleshed out two characters, but didn’t do much for the plot otherwise so I wouldn’t give it a perfect rating in the grand scheme of things. 

But on its own it was a very touching story, and one which I most certainly wasn’t expecting."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"""omg all these 0/10 reviews! None of them are valid! The show is perfect! Look at the 15,000 10/10 reviews as proof."" - You talking about a tv series with a 100 million dollar advertising budget while you can buy imdb ratings for like $0.16 a pop."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Oh, so review bombing works both ways huh?  
Nice to see it openly admitted I guess."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"It wasn't bad, I just think it was too long of a side story and felt kind of like a filler episode from an anime. That shouldn't happen in a low-episode ""cinematic"" series.

Compared to the first 2 episodes its a 4/10, in a vacuum its probably a 6/10 or 7/10."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Hoes mad.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"The show gets review-bombed mostly by an international audience. If you have a closer look at the demographics you'll notice that it's rated 8.7 by US viewers and 8.0 by non US viewers.

Does anyone know if it is possible to get a more detailed breakdown of nationalities? I am also surprised that only about 25% of reviews are US based. I didn't know IMDB was that international. The rest of the world is apparently way more homophobic than the US."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I think people who rated it 1/10 are fucking dumb who doesn't understand the story but people who rates 10/10 are also so biased. Well maybe people have different type of ratings but 10/10 is such a rare occasion and people just throw it everywhere. My problem with this episode is that the bill and frank relationship was too fast, bill is an experienced survivor and he trusted frank in 1 day and had sex with him right away. It felt forced so they can have gay sex in a television."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,These people have clearly not played the game lol.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"i think this is one of the most revealing things ive seen in a while. this episode (my only critique being that i feel it was a little too quick to ”begin”, but on one hand they needed to get on with the episode and on another, its interesting to think about how people might change after life as we know it ends. maybe a good dinner isnt all somebody can be starved of) was absolutely fantastic and a truly emotional story, yet still from reactionaries it gets called ”propaganda“ and only exists to further an agenda... propaganda to who exactly? the adult target audience?

the excuse they always used to fall back on when talking about “woke” things like ghostbusters and steven universe and such was that it was bad because it was just trying to be woke and not good, or trying to push agendas on children. theyd always be able to find secondary reasons for hating it (even if the latter point especially is obviously wrong)... but apparently even *this* is too far despite being both for adults, and actually really really good

oh well. better tell my adult housemate they cant watch this. its gay propaganda and will threaten their precious, heterosexual… 30 year old… brain 😩"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"People keep ignoring what actually ruined this episode. 

Bill standing out in the open in the middle of the street trying to fight the raiders. 

I mean come on. Bill is the ultimate survivalist. No chance he hasn't planned for this and built an eaglesnest somewhere so he can snipe raiders from *behind cover.*

0/10"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Lol. I like the retreat to ‘I’m not a homophobe the episode was really bad because reasons’.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"How sad that something so masterfully done can trigger you, because your bigotry blinds you to everything.  I'm so glad I can appreciate every nuance of this, even though is has nothing to do with my lifestyle.  Literally one of the best episodes I have ever seen."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,People can't hate the episode?
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,People are going to have different opinions from you.  Not everyone is going to like what you like.  I feel the same about people who give Perfect scores to people who give overly negative score.  I stoped caring a while back.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Well the episodes have thousands of 10/10's before it even releases as well, so it kinda balances it out."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"So I really enjoy lyes the episode.  But will admit it felt a little jarring.  Im not talking about I have issues with the content.   It just felt like we were in overdrive going 100 at the end of the last episode and we started this episode in first gear. Im not even sure that’s a problem with the show.  I have the same problem with books.  I’ll get so wrapped up in a POV chapter that when the next chapelter begjins and it’s about someone else it’s a letdown.  Sometimes I even stop for a couple of days, but regardless it takes a couple of pages to recapture the excitement."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I think these episodes always get polarizing reviews from self-conscious people on both sides who feel added social pressure to evaluate it with weighting towards whatever ideology they prescribe to. I thought the episode was pretty decent, well made, but kinda hallmarky too. It was hardly perfect imo. Both 9+/10 and 1/10 scores are perplexing to me tbh."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,[deleted]
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I looked at the voting, and currently the average for US users (15k) is 8.8, whereas the average for non-US users is 8.1 (40k). That actually makes me give less of a shit about the lower reviews, I feel like the reactionaries that are complaining about the gay agenda/etc aren't even American to begin with so it doesn't matter as much to me."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"That episode did little to further the story for me. It was a wasted episode when we only get 8-12 episodes a season. The used it to character build two ppl
So that you would care when they died. Half way through the episode I knew we weren’t going anywhere this episode. All y’all are gonna be angry when we’re season 4 in and it’s starting to suck and they didn’t do enoguh to wrap the story, they will then hastily wrap it up on one season and game of thrones it for all. 

I do want to see the maga morons melt down when they see gay ppl and then get triggered to look up the game and notice the main character is a lesbian."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,My biggest issue with the show is that there is a subset that think it's the best thing ever. Its a really great show but the extremism in reception really dilutes the show to be discussed in a meaningful manner
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I mean it was very gay, which is very unexpected in a zombie show. Too gay perhaps. 

I had a couple buddies over on Sunday to watch the football games. Afterwards, I offered to watch the show, but we ended up doing something else. I’m glad we did, because that would have been awfully embarrassing. Was there really a need for the extended gay love scenes in my zombie show?"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I think there are legitimate criticisms of that episode that don't touch on homophobia, and make the episode deserving of a low score.

I also think the general theme of romance and yes, showcasing of LGBT in an immensely positive light, make it so people will fail to see its flaws.

I think they cheaped out on this episode. And if the trend continues, I think the whole series will end up with low scores as a result."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,I loved the episode 10/10 but why give this any attention? Who cares.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Played the game, loving the show so far but this episode. I just didn't see the point of showing all that. Maybe because of the game they always had letters so I don't know. I found it stupid. While everything else is messed up these two people held off hordes and raiders by themselves. Cheesy Happy ending."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Who cares? Representation is more important than internet points
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,its another zombie show. I dont get it. Walking Dead has been doing this for years.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Lol positive review bombing a show you’re a fan of is as bad a leaving negative reviews.
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I mean it’s one of those cases where if you hated you will be vocal, if you loved you will be vocal. The problem is that if you found it just ‘meh” like I did then both sides will hate you. No room for nuance, especially with this show."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,People are watching Velma? And you’re someone who is upset that Velma is getting bombed because it’s actually mid?? Velma is fucking trash lmao
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,It was a shit episode
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Have you ever stopped to think that maybe this episode was ACTUALLY trash? Don't fanboy simp for a television show, you won't get rewarded for it."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"scores I agree with are right and good!

scores I disagree with are wrong and bad!"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I agree with the negative reviews, this episode was pure propaganda shoved down our throats. I skipped a lot of it to avoid disturbing scenes.."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Waste of time this episode was not in the game the best part is they got a car the rest was gay fked up shiiit 🤮🤮🤢🤢
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I liked it. But still:


Me watching The Last Of Us alone:🧟‍♂️

Me watching The Last Of Us when my gf walks in:👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Eh, while the episode was different than what I was expecting from the game, I think it worked in what the show runners are trying to portray. I thought it was a touching story about hope in a bleak world. My wife didn't enjoy the episode though, she wants more infected and action so the slowness of the episode didn't appeal to her. She's not played the game, so doesn't have the back story of how Joel and Ellie's relationship grows and evolves throughout the story, and I'm not going to spoil it for her. I feel like this show is my chance to experience the story all over again like new."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"While I understand that Bill thought he wouldn’t be useful without Frank around and wanted to join him, I just think that’s a selfish way to look at it. Think about how many more people he could protect (including Joel and Ellie) even after Frank’s death."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Wow, maybe review bombing actually good shows doesnt work"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,Thanks for the IMDB link so I could vote
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"episode 1 and 2 = 8/10

episode 3 = 1/10"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I didn't like it. It was a whole story about 2 dudes I don't care about that didn't move the story along until the letter. It was a long way to go just to slap Joel with the reality of how his one goal now is to protect Ellie.  If it was a flashback of early Ellie or Tess,  or if they had the truck already and THEN the story of where they got it from, I'd be interested. But I didn't care about these one off guys at all. Although I had a feeling of dread the whole time cause I just knew that the one dude was going to get them both killed being so open and welcoming. So I was surprised that he didn't ruin everything lol. That's new."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I agree. I think the rest of the season should only and exclusively be focused on gay relationships. No more Joel and Ellie, no more plot, that's it. I just want to see an hour of two men in love, kissing and holding one another.

We could start each episode with Joel and Ellie coming across a clicker, no more than 5 minutes after the start. Then I want to see a full backstory on that clicker, where he grew up, where he was born, his first boyfriend, coming out to his family and friends, his marriage, his struggles, I want to see it all. Every clicker has a story to tell and I want it.

""But it's The Last of Us! I want to see the story between Joel and Ellie!"" Oh I see, so you don't want to see a gay story? You're just mad that gay people exist?? Well, sorry HOMOPHOBES, gay people exist and you will not stop their stories from being told!! I want 10 seasons of this and nothing else and I hope all you BIGOTS hate it!

Episode 3 was clearly the greatest episode of the whole series, no question about it, probably the best thing on TV or even in any art form ever in human history."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I thought it was a nice episode.  Nick offerman played bill really well.

Frank was cool. Funniest part was the 'infact I spoke to a nice lady on the radio'

Bill: WHAT!!!

I did find pacing severely slow with scenes that thought added little. Like the raider attack had Bill shot but that was it. I guess the ""call Joel showed his change in perception of the group but I didn't get invested into the fight. 

ESPECIALLY since he stood in the middle of the goddamm road!!!! and not from a window. Or at least behind some type of cover. XD

I'd give the episode an 7/10 I lt was a good episode just felt long. Another thing I think i would have liked Nick Offerman narrating the letter. Having the fantastic scene of Joel walking outside knowing Bill meant for tess to he safe was great."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"Altering opinion:

Ep3 would have been scored lower then the first 2 eps, even if it was a heterosexual relationship. An hour long love story between a man and a woman in a apocalyptic show, based on a video game, would have been hated just as much. It would have been called boring and unneeded. I don’t feel the homosexual element made that much of a difference in the score. Sure you will have haters; but I think the love story is what upset viewers."
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I feel like these people missed the message of the episode, and instead focused on the “gay agenda,” they seem to have made up. I thought it was a beautiful message about family, that served as a message to Joel, just as it did in the games"
Elegant Yokai Apartment Life,"I don't think people who haven't played the game are going to get triggered by season two the way many gamers did.  The people that do get triggered are the same people who got triggered last night because the show had the gall to show two gay men in a relationship that wasn't played for comic relief.  And much though they love to be very vocal about everything they hate, they ultimately don't matter and the show will succeed without them.

Season two is going to deliver exactly what your average HBO watcher has come to expect from the network.  Shocking twists and horrific violence."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Hannibal is the Hannibal of cooking shows.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Kantaro follows standard anime cooking show over the top hallucinatory reactions. It comes across as absolutely bonkers for a live action drama and I'm surprised it works so well.

If you enjoy this show you should definitely check out Yakitate Japan or if you can take some fanservice Shokugeki.

"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,It's a very weird show
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Bring me more Samurai Chef and Midnight Diner. 
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,did any one else get a weird Oedipus vibe from episode 9. 
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"*Buzz words!*

The Hannibal of cooking shows? The fuck does that even mean?"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I love this show. I put it just because the thumbnail looked interesting when I was bored, but I got hooked when it turned out to be a wacky but sincere mixture of anime and food porn. If I ever go to Tokyo, I already know that I will visit some of the places featured there. Also, the lead actor is fantastic; he's like a cartoon come to life."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,this show is the shit tbh its anime humor except actually funny
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"It's the cleverest gay 'Queer as folk' like show on TV because they figured out that by eliminating sex but keeping bdsm, sexuality and sociopathy they could explore hannibal and wills characters without putting off straight men.

If you watch especially season 1 and 2, there's this layer of will being intoxicated with hannibals power and his effortless dominance over men and women that Will being incredibly empathetic wishes he had that debauched Dorian grey like power.

I havent watched season 3 yet but it's so easy to get wrapped up in wills power fantasy about having the kind of control Hannibal has.

Its basically the equivalent of chicklit 50 shades of grey but just written with a little more subtlety to it.

So much of the show is about consumption, and decadence, Dominance and Submission .


Credit to Bryan fuller for cleverly making a show that could do that 
"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Shokugeki = food wars
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Is it in english? Dubbed? Subbed?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Did you already saw the three original series of Shinya Shokudō (midnight diner)? Or the movies? There are also korean and chinese copies, but they are supposed to suck, mostly because they are to similar to the original. There is also the original source, the manga. But it's quite different to the live action."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,oh season 3 is way gayer
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"> ke show on TV because they figured out that by eliminating sex but keeping bdsm, sexuality and sociopathy they could explore h

have you seen Yuri On Ice "
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,don't forget Bartender and Restaurant to another world 
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Subbed only I believe.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I want to see the three original series, but I don’t know where to find them. "
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Season 1 is now on Netflix. I loved it so much.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,My friend keeps wanting me to but it's just too fucking pedoey
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,ty
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Just google for a stream. There are many platforms for asian dramas available nowadays.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Are you talking about Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories from 2016? Because I don't find any other series that name on netflix. Or was it just today added?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I recommend you skip episode 9 then. Gets weirder with a sexualized food porn scene with Kantaro and his mother
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I recommend you avoid watching television completely
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Because netflix can't cater to everybody. There will always be someone that takes of offense. Netflix isn't your personal streaming service, where everything is made specifically for you. You with your delicate sensibilities should probably stay away from TV AND definetly the internet."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,">Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman
>This deadpan, gentle, weird-ass show is about Kantaro, an office worker who lives a double life. Every episode is built around a quest to find the time to eat a specific dessert during work hours. The comedy very lightly spoofs crime and food shows, while also showing lots of ecstatic close-ups of Japanese delicacies. 

Yeah, you know me alright, Slate.com. I was just fucking thinking today, ""Man, I can't wait to fire up some sweet, sweet *Kantaro*. I need it real bad."""
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Honestly thought it was canned
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Feels like it's been years since the first season came out... Can't wait to see what comes next.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I watched it. I liked it but I can't remember anything about it lol.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,It's always a problem when there's a big delay between seasons and you have child actors. They change so much in a couple of years at that age
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Seemed like that show was 5 years ago
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Really wish it stuck to the graphic novel. Show was okay, but would have been far better if it followed the correct story path."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I was wondering when this would come
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,That took forever.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,This was absolutely one of my top 10 dramas from 2021.  Excited for S2.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"First season was decent, not great though, I'd be willing to give the second a try."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,YES!!!! Its about time! I feel like its been forever
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I somehow doubt this is getting a season 3 😏
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"The problem with Netflix is how they dump all the episodes at once. While it makes for great binges, it falls off quick. People will talk about the show for 2-3 weeks and then forget about it for over a year. I used to like the whole season drop, but I've come back around to preferring weekly releases. 

That being said, I liked this show well enough, and am glad there is another season."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Remember that creepy groundhog character? Deeply unsettling, Five Nights at Freddy’s territory, a modern Ghoulies."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"This show, along with The Walking Dead, has made be think there is something about comic book villains that don't translate well to live action adaptations. Captain Abbot was a little too hokey and one-note, even given the shows YA vibe."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Ive never been so let down by a series. The book is just top shelf. Amazing haunting tragic story with more heart than a Chinese organ farm.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Sweet tooth is going to be sporting a sweet ass mustache this season. The actor must have needed the work to pay his alimony, I guess... what's it been? 15 years?!?"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,[deleted]
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Annnnnnnnnnnnd it's cancelled.

&#x200B;

Edit: Come on, you can with at least 95% certainty assume this is going to happen: Two years between seasons? Look what happened to most of the other Covid-era productions that were delayed. (Warrior Nun, The Hunters, The Nevers, Avenue Q, etc.)"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I am so excited. Enjoyed the first season so much more than I expected and I thought we not going to get a S2.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I am pretty sure it was announced soon after the first season premiered it was renewed, plus having Robert Downey Jr producing helps."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,The normal thing to assume when talking about a Netflix series.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I think it is just expensive to make and needs a lot of time in post. Same thing with Stranger Things.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I legitimately thought it got canceled.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Covid irreparably fucked our perception of time.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"it hasn't even been 2 years yet, that's really not a long time at all"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I've got apocalypse fatigue from all the recent shows and movies on the subject. I liked S1, but they missed the bus on S2. I'm not sure another end of the world show is going to numbers. The genre is almost as overasturated as is superhero universes."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Humans with antlers and stuff and there was fall out boy playing in the background “loaded god complex cock it and pull it”
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I remember liking it more than I had expected to, and it being really cute/sweet, but nothing more than that."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"The main character was just in Cocaine Bear. I easily recognized him, so he’s not *too* different"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Pour one out for Walt.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Hasn’t even been that long though?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Wasn't it like 2019?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I hope it ends up like the comic, in a roundabout way even. That was some surprising shit."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,What are the differences?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"What? Shane, The Governor, Negan, Alpha were all amazing villains"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"They would translate better if the people making the show actually followed the books and didn't change it so it ""has their creative touch"""
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,the first season came out in June 2021...so a little over a year and a half ago. honestly a pretty normal gap between seasons
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,[deleted]
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,The fact it made it past the COVID hump is big news. REally just depends on its viewer numbers. I imagine we'll find out if it's canceled or renewed within a couple months of it airing this year
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Not really. Just look at Netflix;

Stranger Things: renewed after 3 year gap between seasons.

Umbrella Academy: renewed after 2 year gap between seasons

The Witcher: renewed after 2 year gap between seasons.

Outer Banks: renewed after near 2 year gap between seasons

Bridgerton: renewed after 18 month gap.

Ginny & Georgia is also likely to get renewed after a 2 year gap between seasons.

As long as folks actually watch the shows in question Netflix are happy to renew them. 

You also have the fact that HBO have had their biggest budget shows on 18-24 month gaps for years. It will always be two years between seasons of shows like The Last of Us and House of the Dragon."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,[deleted]
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,">  plus having Robert Downey Jr producing helps.

does it though?"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"It is, there's even a Season 2 is coming since months on the show page on Netflix"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Wow, it seems longer, might have to renew Netflix for a month or two…maybe"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,You’re seriously telling me you got access to a Time Machine and decided the best use of that incredible technology was telling people online that Sweet Tooth season 2 sucks?
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Nah they’re just getting good at it
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"And every episode involved “Sweet Tooth, don’t do ____.”

Then he proceeded to do exactly that."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,WALLLLLLLLLLT
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"It's been 2 years. he was 11 when season 1 came out and he's 13 now. Doesn't sound like much, but that's usually a big change in how kids look. I generally just accept it as one of those unavoidable things, but it's generally noticeable."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Are you seriously comparing child actor to adult actor lol

2 years is a long time for child actor, here’s Finn Wolfhard in stranger things s1, 2, and 3.[ also 2 years differences](https://i.imgur.com/fdgYU4t.jpg)"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,21
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Me too, but I don't think the writers have the guts to do that."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"It would be better to just read it rather than have someone explain it. But for starters it's not a young adult, pg13 story."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Thanks for your service! 🙏
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Yeah, no shit they didn't cancel Stranger Things. As if Sweet Tooth even came close to the same number of viewers. 

Shows like Fate, Space Force, Raising Dion, Another Life and Gentefied that had a gap of at least 1.5 years all got cancelled. And are we really going to put Sweet Tooth in the ""Umbrella Academy"" list or is it more appropriate in the ""Fate"" list? 

When a show doesn't really hit the mainstream and then disappears for two years, it's much more likely to get cancelled. People are much more likely to wait around for a show like The Last Of Us and House of the Dragon, but not just because they're good shows and popular, but also because they're spending an insane budget to make the show as good as possible. That's hardly the case for something like Sweet Tooth, which was mostly just an average show."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,he probably got downvoted because every time there’s anything netflix related coming out people spam canceled in the comments and even though it’s true it’s exhausting as well
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I believe it was his decision/vision to turn a gritty, intense drama into a young adult pg13 story. Which is a real disservice to the source material."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I think miss the bus means they’re late and the opportunity has passed, more about timing than quality"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"That was my favorite part of The Sabrina show.

Everyone: “Sabrina No!”

Sabrina: “Sabrina yes”"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"He won't be 13 until November and this was likely filmed 6-12 months ago. It takes ages to edit footage. Here's a link to actual season 2 footage: https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/news-sweet-tooth-season-2-set-premiere-april-netflix 
Now if there is a season 3, changes would be much more noticeable."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"It’s been 1.75. Assuming it takes 6 months to shoot, 6 months to edit, that’s really not leaving a lot of dead time if it wasn’t renewed immediately…"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Yeah, I just don’t have enough actual interest in the show to read the source material. Maybe I’ll look up a summary."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Honestly the show is better for it. You can actually like the characters instead of just being dragged through the misery.

Plus if you want a gritty show about an old man protecting a child in a post apocalyptic world as they act as a surrogate for the child they lost previously, you have The Last of Us. All bases covered."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,They renewed it a month after release.  Season 2 started filming in Jan. 2022.
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"The premise is roughly the same. Events take place in a different order. But basically add more violent Walking Dead-esque villains (think Governor, Negan) and everybody being total shits most of the time, even when they are doing the right thing."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Season one seems forever ago
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,I need a recap so badly. I don’t remember what happened anymore
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Suprised this isn’t cancelled
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,One of the problems with waiting so long between seasons is I forget a lot of what happened in s1. Same thing happened to that Amazon Orlando bloom fairy detective show and now it’s cancelled
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,Yes please and thank you. Rewatching S1 now
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"He was in Cocaine Bear, hilarious!"
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"Honestly, the first season took me by surprise in a big way. 

I’m not sure if it follows the graphic novel/comic series that closely, but other than one episode I thought the show was really solid, well made, and full of heart. Looking forward to season 2 for sure."
Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman,"I didnt think it was getting a second season, i guess i'll watch the first one now"
The Standups,Have you seen Horace & Pete?
The Standups,"Season 2 is an all-time, Hall of Fame season of television."
The Standups,"He opens an episode with one of my favorite jokes ever:

""I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping...as should we all."""
The Standups,"> The child actresses rock though.

I'm really surprised the older girl never landed anywhere else."
The Standups,"Both Louie and Better Things, which he contributed a lot too, are excellent."
The Standups,Louie is a masterpiece of a show. I love it
The Standups,"Louie was probably my favorite show airing at the time, but I decided to stop watching after the *second* time it got super rapey.

First a woman in season 3 physically forces Louie to lick her asshole after he explicitly says he doesn't want to. He does it to keep her from breaking his finger. You might think ""ok, the show is depicting a horrible act, but that doesn't mean it agrees with it"". But then the punchline is that Louie ends up being okay with the assault and agrees to go on another date with her. I hated how it treated the subject of rape, but I kept watching.

Then in season 4 Louie forces himself on Pamela; restraining her while she tries to dodge his kisses, dragging her around while she says ""no no no"", trying to take her shirt off. She even says ""This would be rape if you weren't so stupid! God, you can't even rape well."" You might say ""well the show doesn't always side with Louie"". But then Louie is rewarded by Pamela agreeing to date him soon after that. There was never any indication before this that she was a character who would be willing to date someone who tried to rape her.

That's when I stopped watching. Louie is a show where rape/attempted rape are fine and even rewarded. It grossed me out even before I learned that the real Louis C.K. liked to use his power and status to masturbate in front of women [without their consent](https://www.cjnews.com/perspectives/opinions/counterpoint-i-didnt-consent-to-louis-c-k-masturbating-in-front-of-me). The art is absolutely not separate from the artist."
The Standups,Where do you watch it now that it's not on Netflix?
The Standups,I like how the middle finger was completely accidental but they kept it because they felt like it was a sign that from New York that they had the city’s blessing
The Standups,Good write up!
The Standups,"His comedy was always about being excessively upfront and authentic, so I was only shocked about his metoo scandal when I read the headlines lumping him with the likes of Kevin Spacey and Bill Cosby. When I read about what he actually did I thought yeah... He would do that. 

He definitely should face consequences for the shitty things he did, and I'm sure Louis CK himself recognizes he did wrong. But seems a little unfair to treat him the same as actual child molesters and serial rapists who successfully hid their true nature from their audience. But that's life I guess."
The Standups,"Good read. I'd agree, because it's sorta tough to enjoy the show, and this put that into words pretty well imo.

Keep in mind, I still do love this show, but it is a unique problem where it's almost impossible to separate the art from the artist, when the two are so very interconnected."
The Standups,"Yeah I was actually thinking about this recently, I was reading somewhere (forget where, probably here or twitter) about how someone was revering Atlanta for pioneering the ""auteur"" TV dramedy that we see so much of now, the kind of show that somewhat blurs the line between reality, and comedy/fiction. And it's like, nah, clearly Louie paved the way for shows like Atlanta (and Fleabag, and I May Destroy You, and so many others). But at the same time I have trouble believing those shows wouldn't exist if it weren't for some white bro comedian with a questionable sense of morality having the idea to be artsy in a TV show first. I think that's more because (FX president) John Landgraf was just more willing to take chances and CK was so popular at the time that he could do literally whatever he wanted (I mean... duh). Remember the show started off as a more traditional comedy (still weird and experimental though) before almost going full drama at the end, akin to a MASH or Sports Night dropping the laugh track.

Still, I'm not sure if we should necessarily have to put it in the comedy history books because it happened to be first. It's no different than the Cosby Show. I don't think we really lose anything by making it a footnote. Remember that the show existed and what it helped usher in, but also don't revere it for more than it was. There were better shows before Louie and there have been better shows since. Ultimately though TV isn't just art, it's also commerce, so I don't really know if it's a dick move to omit it from best of lists when that would garner it undue attention.

And I fully agree that it's hard to separate the art from the artist here as he's often specifically using the platform to espouse his worldview, and often using it to parse his complicated feelings on the things he clearly feels guilty of. And that makes puts a rewatch of a lot of especially, the ones you mentioned especially, in a different context that almost changes what they mean."
The Standups,"> You know - comedies that aren't really comedies, movies and shows that would never describe themselves as avant-garde but would be happy if you did so. I don't want to use 'pretentious' here since the Internet has grated that word into meaninglessness. But these were the sorts of movies and TV shows that would really like to be described as 'a work of art' in some Emily Nussbaum think piece.

Sorry if this is a little off-topic and weird, but holy shit after this paragraph I kinda had to stop for a sec in awe. You're a really good writer. You're so eloquent and clever. You should be a professional critic, that's if you're not one already because it honestly feels like you are.

Anyway, I actually was a super fan of the show back then. And it feels wrong that I don't remember being feeling ashamed or offended about anything. I think that's the reason I can't really see myself rewatching it after years have passed and the stuff about Louie came to light. I'm afraid to see what kind problematic behaviour, or stuff that hasn't aged well, was there that I never picked up on back then, that then will make me feel shame for my past self. Does that make sense?"
The Standups,Look at the [AV Club reviews for Louie](https://www.avclub.com/tv/reviews/louie). Look at that sea of A's and an occasional B. Guess what show was missing from their 'Best of 2010's' list? For a publication that was birthed from The Onion its suprising the AV Club has no balls.
The Standups,It was a fine show. He desperately wished he was Woody Allen and it showed.
The Standups,Now people know my dilemma when watching Woody Allen movies.
The Standups,I see why people like this show but this is where I started realizing that Louis CK is a pretentious Woody Allen wannabe. I prefer Lucky Louie.
The Standups,"How is removing it from Netflix a dick move, yet you understand them doing it? It was just a dick move. Last I checked there was free speech in this country, and as a female, I never thought what he did was really that bad. Kinda sick of females being so sensitive. I would watch him beat off in a heartbeat"
The Standups,"I watch every Louis CK related post on this sub like a hawk, but this is a really good write-up.

Many posts seem to just absolve him and use the excuses you mention and then just complain about cancel culture and say ""they deserved it!"" or some crap in the comments.

But this post was very well thought out, structured, responsible, and flowed well. Thanks for this.

You should totally start some sort of blog or something. But don't spam links here, otherwise we'd have to ban you lol"
The Standups,Jerked of to some people with consent. Man's into kinky shit we get it.
The Standups,"really good write up! i think i watched one season or something my freshman year of college and didn't really like the show. 

i found it trying too hard to be something that's considered ""critically good"" but i was going to give it another go but never got the chance after all the perv stuff came out"
The Standups,The episode where he gets “saved” by the lifeguard is incredible.  It is so freaking funny and expresses so much without using dialogue at times.
The Standups,"Saving this thread to revisit later. I'm very conflicted about CK since his misconduct, because he's a talented man with serious writing cred. I've been making excuses for myself with the usual cliche of ""seperating the art from the artist"", the notion which you eloquently disabused here. 

Rewatching that Fox News masturbating episode — boy that aged horribly."
The Standups,"One season Louie had a romance with a woman who didn't speak English. I like [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDFBkToaJdA), which happens after Louie and this woman have been struggling to communicate for a while.

If I remember correctly, that plot ends by being pretty rapey, too. I think he puts his hands on the woman and she says ""no,"" and then they have sex. Something like that."
The Standups,Why should it have to be non stop laughs? It doesn't have to fit snugly into a genre to be great. Probably the best sitcom of the decade.
The Standups,Titus was a better show about a stand up comedian
The Standups,It is extracted from his life. CK has a femdom fetish and confuses it with feminism
The Standups,Loved the episodes when he was going to take over for David Letterman. It really inspired me in my life. I just don’t like what he did. That’s not cool.
The Standups,">dick move

Are we still doing phrasing?"
The Standups,"I always thought it was a pretty boring show & never understood the hype. But then again, look how popular Friends still is, and that show is total shit, so I guess my sense of humor is out of step with the gen pop."
The Standups,I don’t recall a single instance in which Louie was included on a Best of the decade list.
The Standups,Is it streaming again somewhere?
The Standups,Yes
The Standups,Also love the episodes where he trains to be Lettermans replacement. Those are fantastic. I really enjoyed Stanhopes episode aswell.
The Standups,It also has one of my favourite scenes in a TV show - when he tries to explain to his youngest daughter that you should only look into your neighbour's bowl to see if they've got enough to eat.
The Standups,Better Things unfortunately died after Louie stopped being involved. [The best scene in the show](https://youtu.be/VuFulZY6Qz0) was written by him (it’s funnier in the context of the episode).
The Standups,The episode with Doug Stanhope gets a cathartic drunken watch from me at least once a year.
The Standups,Yea I stopped watching the show after that Pamela episode. I really liked the show before then. The three-part story of him trying to get his own talk show followed by the finale where he ends up in China was fantastic television. But the stuff with Pamela was so cringe bad. God.
The Standups,"> physically forces Louie to lick her asshole

I don't think this is true"
The Standups,"I feel like taking the position of defending for downvotes on this😅
No excuses and his personal conduct aside, I think what the show tries to convey is the possibility that life is fucked up and sometimes it works out that way. On a normal show this would be a turning point and the guy/girl would be rightfully punished and ostracized. But humans can be fucked up (like Louie!). 
we read it all the time on reddit in TIFU, AITA, confessions, r/trashy.  publicfreakout
Adding in this case, there’re two characters that are past mid or in their mid-life. You look at your choices and go well wtf i guess. I didnt take it as a blantant “see rape works sometimes”"
The Standups,[deleted]
The Standups,"I've been checking Just Watch for a long time, and it's not available to stream anywhere.  Not even FX on Hulu.  The fact this isn't available for streaming is a fucking travesty."
The Standups,Yea I really wanna watch it again I remember loving it and forgot enough that it warrants a rewatch
The Standups,"The first two seasons were released on BluRay and they shouldn’t be too hard to find or buy. The rest were just released on exclusive DVD’s which are very hard to find

so beyond that you can purchase the show digitally or just download it elsewhere the old fashion way"
The Standups,"Thanks! Sometimes I feel like just watching TV shows and movie isn't quite a hobby - there need to be some further critical thinking about it on my part, some sort of a productive activity inspired by my viewing. Instead I post on Reddit about it lol."
The Standups,Didn't he come out with an apology and admittance when everyone else was denying? But then it still didn't matter really.
The Standups,Why should they? Putting it on that list gets it recognition and highlights Louie positively. Louie lost that privilege after what he did and it could easily offend people that have been assaulted. As you can see it hasn’t been scrubbed from the site just like any form of history shouldn’t but in no way should it have been on their best of list.
The Standups,Allen's shadow looms large over that entire particular category of indies.
The Standups,Thank you for this comment. Freaking hilarious.
The Standups,I think you mean *without* ?
The Standups,"Him and Aziz got caught up fucking horribly in the movement.

It's better that we know about everything, but the dude has a kink. 

Yeah you could make a case for him having power over them, but pretty much everyone in the industry agreed there's not at all that kind of power dynamic in comedy compared to casting for tv/movies."
The Standups,And that’s a surprise to you? No way it was going to be especially the fact that it’s called Louis CK
The Standups,Remember when she ratted out the woman shoplifting from the supermarket?
The Standups,I disagree so much. I think the show got even better after he left. I've loved every season.
The Standups,I remember watching that and thinking WTF? Does he think that's funny? Then the stuff about him masturbating in front of female comedians came out and I decided yeah I guess he did think it was funny.
The Standups,"They explained how the show rewards the characters for those actions and they simply say that they stopped watching because it depicted things they weren't comfortable with. No one said the show shouldn't be allowed to depict those things. 

What especially makes those depictions questionable though is CK's clear lack of understanding of consent. Not to mention that the subject is something he's clearly struggling with if you rewatch some of those episodes."
The Standups,"Hey, man. Creative and productive outlets are necessary for a good life."
The Standups,"> Why should they?

Umm, intellectual honesty?  Or is that a foreign concept to you?"
The Standups,">Louie lost that privilege after what he did 

You mean asking for consent? Then doing it upon consent and not doing it when not given consent?

>and it could easily offend people that have been assaulted.

Well Louis didn't assault anyone so why would anyone who's been assaulted be offended?

>As you can see it hasn’t been scrubbed from the site just like any form of history shouldn’t but in no way should it have been on their best of list

It was one of the greatest shows of the past 20 years. If people can't get past some redhead nobody asking them consent (years before he was famous BTW) and it ruins a show for you then just retire from reviewing shows or watching altogether."
The Standups,"> Allen's shadow looms large over every single neurotic who lives in New York

Fixed that for ya"
The Standups,"No, he asked every single person.  If they said no, he just walked away."
The Standups,Aziz's biggest mistake was going on a date with some fuckin neanderthal who thinks red wine with oysters is acceptable.
The Standups,"Aziz was so unnecessary. That poor guy got lumped into degenerates. 

Idk about power dynamic he was into this stuff wayback in 90s and before he was famous. So can't say it was a power trip or something."
The Standups,"The Aziz thing is weird because the revelation was just that he kinda sucks. Not that he's a monster or should never work again, but just that he's sort of a whiny manipulative dude. 

Like, I don't think he belongs in the same conversation as many of the men who were taken down.  

But at the same time his entire brand was ""I'm a feminist dude who is super respectful of women. I wrote a whole tv episode about it. It's a frequent topic in my stand up"" and that whole lens was sort of revealed to be bullshit, so I don't really have an interest in his work moving forward. 

When you are a comedian you are selling yourself and your ideas, moreso than an actor does. When it's revealed you are misrepresenting yourself, people might just lose interest (like I did)"
The Standups,"He was literally the boss of one person he did it to and he did it over the phone without asking to another person. Plus just asking that in a workplace is wrong.

&nbsp;

It is true though that he wasn't famous during any of the allegations, the most recent one was from 2005 and him ""blocking the door"" isn't true but still. If he stopped doing it around 2005 I'd forgive him but we have no idea how recently he stopped."
The Standups,I hate when people lump him in with Aziz as people done wrong by #MeToo movement as some people did here. Because Louis deserved what came to him. His behavior was definitively inappropriate and disgusting. And the crazy thing is his show backed up how fucked up his mentality was.
The Standups,You very clearly don’t have a good understanding of consent. He’s been blacklisted from pretty much everything. But sure you must have a much better understanding than anyone else.
The Standups,"I'm sure when they said 'yes', they were totally not worrying about what would happen to their future careers in comedy if they said 'no' to a rising star like that.

Get real."
The Standups,Wait was there something about Aziz I didn’t know about? All I knew was that he went on a date with some chick that accused him of stuff but later it came out that she was crazy. He’s even got his Netflix show coming back so he’s definitely been cleared. Is there more?
The Standups,"Reddit also likes to think he was a Hollywood superstar before.  He wasn't and mainly has Master of None (well received, not a smash) and a successful touring career.

He currently has a new season of his show and a touring career."
The Standups,"""If he stopped around 2005 it would be fine""

""We don't know when he stopped""

So what you're saying is that he could have possibly stopped in 2005? 

And that pieces of the accusations were lies? 

You don't *have* to argue in the name of cancelling him, it's okay to look back in hindsight and say we got some shit wrong."
The Standups,"He didn't when they said no. Did do it when they said yes. Yeah, you're right, my understanding of consent is off by light years.

As for your second point, saying f@$$&t in middle school is enough to get you blacklisted. Not that it matters considering Louie has been touring so either way you argument fails."
The Standups,Which is exactly the whole problem with CK's past behavior. Anyone who can't admit that is either incredibly dense or just being intellectually dishonest. I say this as a pretty big fan of CK's work
The Standups,Im just stating a fact.  He asked for consent.  Im not saying what he did was good and im not going to sit here and let you condemn me for stating a fact.
The Standups,"This all happened before this show and before he got real stand-up success.

He was pretty much known as the failed director of Pootie Tang when it happened."
The Standups,I wish I were surprised that you’re getting downvoted for this 🙃
The Standups,Well that's literally how life works
The Standups,"How is a rising star supposed to go about jerking off in front of people? If that is your thing, what is the avenue to do it?"
The Standups,"Yes? That's exactly what I'm saying - he could have stopped in 2005 but until he actually tells us when he stopped, I'm not going to say he shouldn't have been punished just because he *might* have stopped long before 2017. What kind of logic is that?

&nbsp;

And I didn't say pieces of the allegations were lies - him blocking the door was a rumor from before the allegations and a lot of people still think he did it. 

&nbsp;

You really think it's okay for a boss to ask their employee if they can jerk off in front of them and actually do it when they say yes? To ask anyone that in a workplace? Or to audibly jerk off while on the phone with someone?"
The Standups,He used his power and status to get them to do what he wanted. Do you really think asking women who you do not know or have any form of romantic relationship with if it’s okay to jerk off in front of them? Do you have any idea who the women were or the situation? Cause it sounds like you’re ignoring what they’ve said. He 100% sexually assaulted them. He just did it in a way that he can’t get arrested for it.  And wtf is that middle school example? That isn’t remotely the same or comparable. Legit makes no fucking sense.
The Standups,"I was a humongous fan of his. I lost every scrap of respect I had for him after this came out, and I remember it being rumored for years but I couldn't believe it. Wrong of me to look past that shit."
The Standups,Are you choosing to ignore context?
The Standups,Coerced consent/forced consent is a thing.
The Standups,The Disag-REEEEEE button strikes again.
The Standups,He's at +19
The Standups,"Well, to start, don't do it at work."
The Standups,"What, are you ""asking for a friend""? Is this a real question? Because it feels like a shitty deflection of responsibility: ""So what was he **supposed** to do?!"" Icky.

It's not my responsibility to make a post-facto game plan for this fuck or anyone like him. 

He asked for consent from people getting started in an industry that he was well known in. That's wrong, that coerces consent out of fear/anxiety about ruining their career opportunities by refusing someone more successful in their field. 

So you want to know what **best** practices are for jacking off in front of people? Do the math."
The Standups,"Power and status? Lol.

He was a fucking divorced loser with no money and non fame until 2011... *years* before the accusations. His power and status meant nothing more than mine.

I'm not ignoring anything. What has anyone said that could be considered assault? I'm genuinely listening."
The Standups,"I'm serious, if that is your fetish what is the healthiest way to go about exercising it?

If you are a semi-famous comedian (at the time) are you just never allowed to hook up with someone less famous than you in your industry?"
The Standups,"Him pressure the women to watch him is a form sexual assault my bro. You can deny that all you want but it is, also he did pressure these women whether you want to believe it or not. He’s talented and the show was great but he is a complete and total creep who deserves every bit of his status being revoked."
The Standups,"Wow, you're really focused on deflecting here. 

Here, how's this? You start with a conversation. You make sure there is mutual interest separate from your careers. Plenty of comics date comics. 

At some point down the road, you need to have another conversation: ""hey, I have this thing that involves me jacking off in front of you. Is that cool?""

What you don't do is make this your 1st or second ***interaction*** with a person, who is now confronted with a famous person in their industry, dick already out, asking if it's okay. What if you say no? Will he badmouth to promoters? I have a set lined up on Thursday at the Comedy Cellar, will he make that go away if I say no? 

Clear enough for you?"
The Standups,How is being asked consent being pressured?
The Standups,"Are you saying that people can’t be pressured or persuaded to say yes to something that they regret later or they didn’t feel like they could say no to? For example there’s decades of history around workplace sexual assault, where an employee felt “pressured” by a boss to do something cause they could lose their job if they said no. Seriously I’m just gonna assume you must be pretty young to be this ignorant. If you honestly care you should spend some time really looking into the situation and maybe read up on how common this type of issue is."
The Standups,Saying yes because you can't say no is not the same thing as saying yes
The Standups,"Other than the woman who didn't consent (and he didn't do it) it wasn't a workplace issue anymore than it would be if a salesman asked two other salesman if he could jerk off in front of them while trying to sell a vacuum in the same house.

And nobody was pressured, if I ask ""hey can I do this"" and the other person says ""yeah, sure""? What am I suppose to read their fucking mind to know they actually mean no? How is it Louie's fault that people can't have accountability?"
The Standups,Why *couldn't* they say no?
The Standups,Dude I’m done. The length you’re going to to defend this issue is extremely disappointing. I’m going to move on I hope that at some point you understand the full extent of the situation and hope to god you aren’t trying to justify some actions you’ve done. Good luck.
The Standups,"Because whether he intended to exercise it if they said no or not, Louis had power over them and their careers"
The Standups,Been waiting for a new special in so long
King’s War,">however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom

They bring this up as a negative point but I really loved that in the first couple of seasons of GoT."
King’s War,[deleted]
King’s War,"Rolling stones is interesting and one I really see as a positive. I hope theres more focus on politics, intrigue and dialogue. Season 1-3 were the highlight of the original series (and books) for that reason. 

Also the problem that the quotable/witty characters might be a blessing in disguise. The show ended up destroying itself and those characters because they became beholden and flanderised based on those lines/subsequent popularity. Tyrion in particular."
King’s War,"When the negative reviews are ""too much dialogue"" I'm in."
King’s War,Am I the only one struggling to see any inherently negative points in a lot of these negative reviews?
King’s War,"I am cautiously optimistic 

There are a few things that I’m apprehensive about though. Succession filled the void GoT left behind of a political power struggle with many moving pieces that managed to be far more grounded than GoT. House of the Dragon has to live up to both it and GoT in that regard in my opinion 

Another aspect is that I really preferred the production of GoT in its earlier seasons where it managed to do a lot with what was available. Later seasons felt like they went big for the sake of it which I felt made GoT lose some of its charm and HotD seems to be closer to later GoT in terms of production 

I really hope it delivers tbh"
King’s War,I am not surprised that Milly Alcock gets some praise here. Even in just the trailers you can see she has some great charisma and presence. I wonder if her older replacement will be able to keep up with her performance.
King’s War,"The only thing I can conclude from these, is that, most random reviewers just aren't worth listening to. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking the same approach with this and the Lord of the Rings TV show - my expectations are going to be set so god damn low, that it's almost impossible that I could be let down. 

&#x200B;

Narrator voice: ""He was later let down in dramatic fashion"""
King’s War,"I'd say we should go in with managed expectations. As far as I'm aware, the source material is sort of like a history book more than a novel. 

When GoT show overtook the ASOIAF books, there was a significant noticeable drop in writing quality. Characters started acting more petulant and dialogue became mostly juvenile.

I really do hope this show is a return to form though. But most fantasy live action in the last few years has turned out absolutely abysmal."
King’s War,"Critic reviews for TV are much less important than those for movies. Because critics only judge a TV show based on a couple of episodes, their reviews are  always missing the entire picture. Unlike a movie which is experienced fully and therefore you have a much better understanding of the product.

TV shows are a much longer commitment and therefore your true score will only come over time as your brain digests the material to a fuller extent.

GoT had some middling pre-reviews for S1 as well. It was only after the entire season had finished that some critics went back and thought ""Y,know what? That was actually pretty good!""

I always give a whole season for a show to find it's footing.

Edit: The truly damaging review comes from Slate Magazine and it was done by a game reviewer. Awful choice and makes me disregard the review, even if it was positive. Video games are a more action-packed medium and this is a more ponderous story."
King’s War,"Saw it on Wednesday thanks to Tiff in Toronto. I absolutely loved it. Now, it’s a great pilot, but the next two episodes will really show if its got legs. Personally, I think its a very promising first episode, the writing, acting and directing was very strong. Plus, its a fucking great looking show with no comparison (some weaker cgi here and there but great compared to other shows). 

I was so ready to be done with the show and go back to rereading the books, but now i’m excited for Sunday again.

Plus, it feels like GoT, the politics, the intrigue, the danger… and I think the story they picked will work really well for TV."
King’s War,"I’m super excited, not gunna lie."
King’s War,"Saw the first ep on Wednesday. I think it is going to be decent. However, people need to give it a chance with an open mind. I'd probably still watch anything GoT related that came out anyways, but I'm sure there are some people who are really bitter of how the show ended and are reluctant to give this a go. Really excited for Matt Smith as Daemon."
King’s War,"I know it all depends on the execution, but the mixed reviews talk about the focus on the politics of the kingdom and sitting around tables debating as if they werent the most engaging parts of early GoT. That being said, those scenes may be poorly put to screen in House of Dragon, will find out soon enough."
King’s War,"Should I even watch this if I’ve never watched Game of Thrones?. The ending scared me off, but I am interested in this new one."
King’s War,"I see a trend when somewhat middling reviews start to appear for a soon-to-release popular property. Redditors start to pick apart those middling reviews, saying things like, ""The critic has a problem with *that*?! Ridiculous! That particular nitpick is what I *love* about the property!""

But when the dust settles, the critics are rarely wrong. A show that gets middling critic reviews is almost always middling. That doesn't mean it will be *bad*, and that doesn't mean it won't *improve*. 

But, I'm definitely going into this show with lowered expectations. Hopefully it will be halfway decent."
King’s War,"From the reviews here and the comments, it seems like people don't understand that this too is a book? A history book, to be exact. Reviewers and commenters are making statements as if the show runners came up with the story."
King’s War,"[Slant: A Frustrating Jumble of Incident and Spectacle](https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/house-of-the-dragon-review/)

> House of the Dragon must really believe its own claim that “the truth does not matter, only perception,” for it ultimately is more interested in fan service—offering up more dragons, more gore, more surprise murders, a more expensive historical re-enactment—than it is in developing scenes that ring true for its characters. Game of Thrones veterans like director Miguel Sapochnik and composer Ramin Djawadi can make this new series look and sound like more of the same, but it’s as hollow and brittle as the massive scale model of the kingdom that Viserys takes pride in building. That’s a rotten foundation for an epic fantasy, so maybe the prophecy was correct after all: the only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.

[Empire: The writing so far lacks the sparkle of Game Of Thrones' most profound moments.](https://www.empireonline.com/tv/reviews/house-of-the-dragon-season-1/)

>For all its po-faced plotting, this show has plenty going for it. A decade time-jump in episode six, recasting several characters, gives the series a new energy; D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke (as the troubled Queen Alicent Hightower) breathe new dimensions into their aged-up characters, and the sudden switch-up suggests a show unafraid to take risks. This is a prequel that could surprise us yet. But to even skirt the heights of Thrones’ best work, it has an uphill dragon ride ahead.

[Indiewire: HBO’s Devout ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Rarely Roars to Life](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/08/house-of-dragon-review-got-prequel-1234752881/)

>Co-showrunners Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal, along with co-creators Condal and George R.R. Martin, make misogyny’s destructive influence the series’ central theme, but it’s more of a convenient shield than a piercing dagger. After all, this is a prequel to “Game of Thrones”; where Westeros ends up has already been set. Learning its past isn’t far removed from its future is both part of the point — feigning interest in how the medieval fantasy’s patriarchal power structures and boastful man-babies mirror modern day’s similar problems — and a safe path for the network’s first spinoff of its highest-grossing franchise. The first six episodes set up an intimate yet epic tale of how misbegotten pride, outdated customs, and an obsession with power burned down a long-thriving kingdom… all while enjoying the ensuing ugliness more than they examine its unnecessary proliferation. Pure spectacle and (often icky) soap opera make for intermittently absorbing TV. Mainly though, the new “House” sticks safely to the “Game” that preceded it, rather than fight for any meaningful change."
King’s War,"Meh - looking at what critics are choosing to praise here, I've slightly downgraded my expectations."
King’s War,"so, tons of childbirth scenes, THE STRUGGLE

&#x200B;

will still watch, though, because I'm bored"
King’s War,">Rolling Stone had a negative take, noting, “Palace intrigue, and questions of succession and legitimacy, were of course a huge part of Game of Thrones, but far from the only part. And they were only sometimes even close to the most fun part of a given stretch of that series.

Sepinwall enjoyed Game of Thrones for far different reasons than I did, it seems."
King’s War,[deleted]
King’s War,"I think people are too laser focused on what they perceive the review is I don't think they are complaining that politics are always boring, but rather that the show lacks in other areas that GoT didn't. There was plenty of political intrigue there but also lots of hillarious moments intersped with it, you could have Varys doing spy master stuff learning about everyone's position on matters and then have him discuss court gossip and marveling at the tales of Podrick's amazing sexual powers. 

Hopefully it isn't like that and the show's tone is more complex and not just FIRE AND BLOOD, non-stop. Even Tywin relaxed from time to time."
King’s War,Any idea if I need to have seen GoT to watch this show?
King’s War,"A big problem this show will have is that it can't be all things to all people like Game of Thrones did. GoT is like a diner that has a little of everything (burgers, chicken tenders, shrimp, quesadillas, etc.) while House of the Dragon is like a seafood restaurant (depending on your preference, one is better than the other). With GoT, there were plenty of people who said they only watched for the political intrigue or dragons or white walkers or Dany or Arya or Jon or the battles or the magic or a particular actor or actress or large scope or large number of characters or to root for certain characters to die, etc. House of th Dragon has some of that stuff but not all it it so it would be nearly impossible for it to be as big of a show as GoT (even if they season 8 had been incredible). They only way it could would be if it could get new people. Also, I hear GoT was the highest watched show for HBO in 2021 despite the bad ending and it being 2 years after it ending so that's a little hope for this show."
King’s War,"> however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom  

That is exactly what I'm here for. I can go plenty of places and get high flying wizardry and sword fighting. *The Crown* is fucking awesome, and it has zero dragons, sword fighting, or wizardry. 

I thought it was a great pilot episode, it didn't try to be GoT *exactly*, while still feeling like GoT (to me at least). GoT was a generational phenomenon, and impossible to recreate 1:1. Any attempt to do that would likely fail based on probability alone. 

I like the fact the show might be more concentrated. Sometimes GoT felt way too sprawling, and characters were moving around the map at breakneck speeds, especially towards the end where the scale of westeros really shrank.  

I thought the cgi could be cleaned up some in a few shots, but nothing too egregious. Some really great acting performances also.  

I usually love an underdog, so I think I'm gonna be team princess. I always wondered what Henry VIII would have done if he had just realized that one of the most influential monarchs in English and even world history was sitting right under his nose, so it was really fun for me to see a monarch do exactly that in this episode, even if it was a pretend one. Can't help but wonder if GRRM has the same question."
King’s War,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens compared to the more expansive scope of the original series:

the show is literally named ""house of dragons"" why was this person expecting stories of baratheons and starks?"
King’s War,"THR review has to be a meme.

Show is called House of the Dragon

Gets mad that it focuses on Targaryen Family"
King’s War,I just wanna see /r/freefolk implode if it's good
King’s War,"I'm going to say something that will bother many: if it wasn't for HBO, the reviewers ratings would be much worse."
King’s War,RollingStone points out the reason I've been so apprehensive about this show -- too much palace intrigue and not enough common folk stories from the wider world to ground the whole thing.
King’s War,[deleted]
King’s War,"Yeah I don’t know if people will ever get over the awful ending and return to the GOT universe. I can guarantee that this show will never even touch the ratings that GOT had back in its prime. Maybe it will start to pick up traction in a few seasons, but I think we all are still a bit scarred and this was too soon if you ask me"
King’s War,"These reviews don’t inspire confidence in me - someone who wanted a reason to be pulled back into the show other than just “it’s more GoT and more dragons.”

I expected more quality from this show tbh."
King’s War,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens

You're telling me House of the Dragon is focusing on the house whose sigil is dragons and who owns dragons??!

*shocked pikachu face*"
King’s War,"Whatever, call me when it's done. If they don't screw it up, then I'll watch it."
King’s War,"Idk if it's cause the last season or two of GoT turned me off to it so much or what, but the trailers didn't make me want to watch"
King’s War,"93% on RT so far, can’t wait"
King’s War,*fart*
King’s War,Looks like it’s worth the watch and a palette cleanser for that last season of GOT
King’s War,Is it even worth watching if i've never seen GoT?
King’s War,[deleted]
King’s War,I was interested in watching it so I rewatched all of GOT and remembered why I'm done with the series all together. I hope you guys find enjoyment where I find pain lol....

King’s War,"I have faith that it will be good, but as long as it just doesn’t suck I’ll be fine."
King’s War,"Grace said it’s good so it must be, I’m very excited, cannot wait for it to drop

Plus seems like GOT meets Succession, and as a fan of both I’m sure it’ll be fun"
King’s War,How much of the season have these reviewers seen? Always feel weird to judge something that isn't whole yet.
King’s War,It’s to big to fail….. they will talk about how great it is till we think it is. Hopefully it will be….. see already starting to work!
King’s War,I prolly only watching this for Matt Smith.
King’s War,"No matter what anyone else says, the show is still gonna be ""tainted"" by the slap-in-the-face GOT ending. I'm still pissed."
King’s War,"I'm not super excited about this. I'll watch it though.

Tyrion related and hung out with and plotted with the lower classes. The Stark kids went off in different directions— pampered nobility that were suddenly fish out of water. Jon went to the Wall and mixed with many types of characters. It was the mix of characters that made the aSoIaF books and GoT show good.

  
I'm sure they'll throw in some stories of castle staff and other lower class characters. But so far this looks like it's the adventures of a bunch of millionaires and billionaires (relative to our world) and that could get dry pretty quickly.

  
(I'm also in the weirdo minority who doesn't much like the dragons and dragon riding stuff. I love the dark magic that births them in aSoIaF. But then they grow up to be basically titanic lizards. Nothing really magical about them at all. They even need to eat herds of cattle just to survive—which would make them a huge drain on resources. Liabilities.)"
King’s War,[deleted]
King’s War,"Rolling Stone also panned Led Zeppelin’s first album, among many other highly acclaimed albums so I’ll just take that one with a grain of salt."
King’s War,"I watched every episode of GoT, first because it seemed interesting and then because of its storied beginnings I thought it could somehow redeem itself. What memory offers now is an absolute  grimoire of grisly ideas papered over by the moniker ""fantasy TV"". Women having their babies cut out of their wombs, castration and humiliation, death drowning in molten metal, having to learn to fight through sudden blindness, a talking gallery of decapitated heads, some sort of creeping disease, death by being pulled apart by dogs, being tricked into eating your relative baked into a pie, casual, ritual, near constant rapes. Spoiler -- mostly everybody dies. And then at the end the actors of this monstrosity could barely phone it in and started leaving their coffee cups and water bottles on sets as they were being filmed. 

Doesn't matter what anyone says. \*Never again\*, GoT; over here we finally understood we the audience were being terrorized."
King’s War,No more misogyny….I’m out
King’s War,"Yeah if I got paid to go to the big opening and review I'd say nice shit too, so I could go to the next big opening"
King’s War,All the people saying this franchise was dead after season 8 are delusional. Most of the reviews are positive; this show is going to be a *huge* hit.
King’s War,"Even negatives seems to be my cup of tea honestly.   


In the end, I'm here for the politicking and dragons and it seems that is what we will get."
King’s War,Most of the critics are things specifically said to be about the show (like too many Targaryens lol) and being upset about the things that made GoT great.
King’s War,reviews seem solid enough but i feel like there is a gap for rings of power to slide into that could take over the public consciousness.
King’s War,"Matt smith has one of the worst faces in Hollywood, and seeing him with that silly wig on he goes from being a 5 or 6 head to being 95% forehead. Not since MTVs the head, has anyone on TV had so much forehead."
King’s War,After GoT I honestly can not bother with this show. I stopped the books and can’t bother with a spin off.
King’s War,The show now lies around 85% on RT. Which is good news.
King’s War,"Trying…to not….get….HYPEEED!!!

But I am now! It’s too late. Time to pull out The World of Ice & Fire!!"
King’s War,"No matter what, I am going to wait for this show to end, even if it is going to be 10 seasons. Only if in the end it will be declared worth watching I am going to. GOT has been such a monumental delusion from season 6 to 8 that I am not risking that waste such a large portion of my life for garbage."
King’s War,"Does Matt Smith need to get a new agent? He's finally getting more work after Doctor Who but all as dour characters or villains without personality or at least appearing in movies and tv that's getting shit on for it, minus the Crown, which he was still a Dour Danny in, or Pouting Phillip I guess"
King’s War,Would take the guardian review with a grain of salt. Lucy Mangan is incapable of objective critique.
King’s War,I cannot fathom why anyone would watch this after HBO fucked up GoT the first time.
King’s War,"I just can't be bothered to care even if I wanted to (ABOUT REVIEWS/WATCHING THE SHOW if that wasn't obvious...I obviously care about expressing how I feel about this show). It's a prequel. A prequel to a terrible and worthless ending. Why care? Even if it gets 10/10 all around, it's a pass for me. Sorry.

Not to mention if I watched it, all I'd be thinking about in the back of my mind is the depressing ending. No ty.

[edit]: where were all you downvoting GoT gawkers after the show ended the way it did? lmao.  keep downvoting me for an opinion you know millions of people share."
King’s War,Is the show out already? I thought it was airing this Sunday?!?
King’s War,Why do these snippets feel like they’re written with less thought and care than your run-of-the-mill Reddit comment?
King’s War,How many episodes did they get to review?
King’s War,WE THE FANS ARE SUCKERS. George should have finished wind's of winter before doing any other projects. HBO ruined the ending passing George's progress and before he dies he owes US LOYAL FANS the ending we all know he wants to give us. How much money do you need at 70? The biggest heartbreak will be him not completing his life's work...then what some ghost writer gives us more of the same?  I watched the show. I know the history George outlined in the targaryens lives... I'm like you. A fan. I've read all the books...3000 pages x 5 plus. And I read them 4 times... so enjoy the show.. but don't forget... WE ARE OWED for our loyalty.
King’s War,"""Medical Horror"", I agree. What is the point of the super graphic birth? It was a c-section done archaically, we get it, mom and baby die. No need for the overly grotesque? It seriously made me uncomforatble and added nothing to the end result."
King’s War,"The premiere of this show was actually serviceably entertaining. In spite of the table conferences of the characters, this show seemed faster-paced than the old show. Maybe it’s because Benioff and Weiss are no longer involved.

A lot of fans have been miffed with George Martin recently over various things, like not working on the last books of the series and especially over his calling his audience names if they express exasperation with him. But none of that was enough to keep viewers, even the angry ones, away from the premiere, which did very well in the ratings. The bottom line is that people always need something to watch. And I guess they really do go for prequels, because they like stuff they are familiar with. There was never going to be any “boycott” of George Martin. People don’t really care about entertainment politics, it’s not important enough to care about. They endlessly gab about it on the Internet, which sometimes makes it seem important. It’s mostly hot air and venting that doesn’t reflect reality."
King’s War,"The show’s just trying too hard for nothing. There is sex and gore just to be there, trying to compensate for the drama that the writers cannot create to fill up the time between canon events and dialogue."
King’s War,I'm really liking this. First episode was great on my books.  I hope hate doesn't get this cancelled
King’s War,House of the Dragons is unbearably boring. I can't stand watching these disgusting Targaryen's bicker back and forth and that's all there is to see folks. BORING
King’s War,"One review “Sitting around doing nothing”, another review “fast pace” you can never tell with reviews"
King’s War,"I love the politicking of the earlier seasons but they were brilliant because we were invested in Ned Stark, Tyrion, Cersei etc. that it mattered to us. The murder mystery in Season 1, the looming invasion of Stannis on King's Landing, the built up to Red Wedding all worked because we were invested in various players on all sides of the game."
King’s War,"Depends how well they establish stakes and the relationships between characters. Having Tywin and Tyrion in the same room was always tense and had me at the edge of my seat.

I’m very hopeful that they create some compelling characters like the original series"
King’s War,Totally agree but it only works if you have characters enjoyable enough to sit around with. The critics complaining about this mostly say the characters are bland as well. Who knows I’m still excited!
King’s War,"Not enough dick jokes. Truly those are a sign of prestige television.

4/10."
King’s War,Foundation has Lee Pace sitting around with himself(brothers) and I enjoyed that.
King’s War,"Yeah, sign me the fuck up for this"
King’s War,The first time watching GOT you don’t pick up on it. The 2nd time you realize how much info is actually in the “sitting down and talking” scenes
King’s War,"Most of the quieter, slower-paced moments from the earlier seasons were character centric, not really expositing about the politics of the realm"
King’s War,Tywin & Arya's scene around a table is one of the most memorable highlights of GoT acting that i think of frequently
King’s War,"Only if the writing and acting is worth it (which it was in earlier seasons of GoT), otherwise it turns into a boring slog."
King’s War,Fuck just recently the best episode of The Sandman (episode 6) waa just people chatting but it was still fascinating.
King’s War,"The Small Council ""musical chairs"" scene from Season 3, which is dialogue free until Tyrion shows up, is absolutely brilliant and wordlessly shows the viewer the personalities and characterization of everyone involved."
King’s War,"It looks like most of the negative reviews come from people who, for one reason or another, don't like the actual palace intrigue and the politics of GOT and were apparently watching it for different reasons. They're all on a similar line"
King’s War,Also the reason I loved shows like Succession. It was all just backstabbing and scheming.
King’s War,"Guess they didn't like Mad Men, either? Some of the best TV dramas are ""sitting around tables and talking""."
King’s War,"They also call the characters flat but like...it's presumably only the first episode? Probably a lot of time to round them out, the original GoT episode 1 had a lot of flatness as well if I recall correctly."
King’s War,These are the people that are constantly on their phone when watching something.
King’s War,"Yeah, that was the best part of GOT to me"
King’s War,"They need to bring back brothel exposition

They knew these segments could turn off some viewers in GoT so added nudity to keep everyone engaged

Shane they are dialing it back"
King’s War,"Right?? I saw that and my reaction was basically the Obi-Wan ""That's...why I'm here"" meme. I was genuinely hoping this series would lean more into the political stuff. If it does then I'm definitely on board."
King’s War,The dialog was at it's best in these scenes IMO
The Oath,Crackle still exists? I always forget that Crackle exists.
The Oath,"They have that awesome StartUp show that would be huge if on netflix or hbo. Stars Ron Perlman, Martin Freeman and Adam Brody. Also, Chosen was good too. "
The Oath,"I thought Comedians in Cars... going to Netflix was due to Crackle shutting down. 

It was weird, today I watched an episode of The Dana Carvey Show on Hulu (after seeing the great documentary on it) and the logo in the corner was Crackle. "
The Oath,"I forgot that Crackle *and* 50 Cent exist, so this headline really threw me for a loop. "
The Oath,Wait what the fuck? That sounds great. 
The Oath,"RIP Sean Bean's character in the Crackle Drama ""The Oath""."
The Oath,So Crackle is still a thing. Huh. 
The Oath,More Sean Bean on my TV is always good
The Oath,We need another Sharpe.
The Oath,"Do we really live in a world where we have to refer to Sean fucking Bean, as 'Game of Thrones alum'?"
The Oath,I just wonder how many episodes he'll get before they give kill him.
The Oath,Has he ever made it to Season 2?
The Oath,"I don't think so. I don't even think he made it to Movie #2 in anything. He's made it to the end of LotR Fellowship, and did he die in the season finale of season one of GoT? Or was it the episode before?"
The Oath,Legends. Got to season two in that. Plus like 12 Sharpe movies
The Oath,"He survived the movie ""Troy""  although I have reason to believe he had a rough time getting home after."
The Oath,He dies an episode before the season finale. Poor ol' Ned didn't even make it that far.
The Oath,"Yeah, complete deal breaker, man.  /s"
The Oath,Good.  I am watching S1 now and I really like it.
The Oath,"Good show with excellent writing. The action scenes could use some work, though, way too much shaky cam. "
The Oath,How can they end it like that!!! so annoying
The Oath,They turned Jack Bauer into a SJW... 
The Oath,"Good info, thanks for sharing "
The Oath,"Saw the pilot for Counterpart - Season 1 (Starz), I am 10/10 all in. That's my flavor of tv.

Also don't forget Electric Sheep. "
The Oath,"https://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/

Does... Nice simple interface. Can select the shows you want to follow etc. Used it for years. Love it! "
The Oath,Can't wait for sneaky Pete and the Americans last season  and I have high hopes American crime story. 
The Oath,Mary Kills People is so good. 
The Oath,Can't wait for Bron/Broen season 4 when it airs on BBC with subtitles. One of the best shows I've ever watched. 
The Oath,You should make it into an iCal file or make it a Google calendar one so that people can insert it in their calendars.
The Oath,Metacritic keeps [this page](http://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-premiere-dates) updated throughout the year with premiere dates
The Oath,"Why is Elementary so freaking late? It feels like I've been waiting forever for it to come back. 

And thanks for the list. :)"
The Oath,try trakt.tv it has both film and tv series
The Oath,Inside No. 9 is BBC2 not BBC Three.
The Oath,Jessica Jones is only 2 months away? Aww yiss
The Oath,Definitely thought Portlandia already aired it’s final season. 
The Oath,Siren sounds cool so many shows 
The Oath,"Hey i dont know wo you are, but this its neet information and list. Cant imagine how bad the format look.

Thanks thanks"
The Oath,I'm really looking forward to Good Girls!
The Oath,Was REALLY hoping to see Preacher on there. 
The Oath,Cool. I'm curious how the mods of this subreddit populate the right sidebar with their calendar? Could we add time zones to that somehow?
The Oath,"I basically already do this on Google Calendar. It's more difficult, because I have to add it all manually, but it's helpful to be able have all my TV, movie, and book release dates in one place."
The Oath,"Totally, didn't see it mentioned a lot, loved it!"
The Oath,US only.
The Oath,"Oops, will fix!"
The Oath,"Isildur's sister and her wannabe boyfriend take up tons of valuables screen time and are the most boring generic characters I have ever seen and provide NOTHING to the plot, literally nothing. 

Meanwhile the actual forging of the rings...*which is the fucking point of the fucking show*...is taking place almost completely off screen and treated like a irrelevant side plot. 

Its mind boggling how bad they are at managing the plots lines. A veteran TV producer need to rescue this from the hands of the two rookie show runners because they have no clue what they are doing."
The Oath,"For anyone interested, r/LOTR posted a thread two months ago where it was stated that an Amazon crew leaked details of the show on 4chan. [So far, the leaks have been mostly accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/w13p0u/someone_from_amazon_crew_leaked_rings_of_power/) (spoilers, obviously)."
The Oath,"It’s also kind of ironic that people are defending the slow pace and accusing those of us that are bored that we just want action scenes. 

Cause this show has had a lot more action scenes than House of the Dragon. The difference is that the action scenes in RoP have all been complete ass."
The Oath,I hate when fantasy shows or media have people practice fighting with their actual swords instead of ones made for sparring.
The Oath,"So after 4 episodes of mucking about doing basically nothing.

Numenor is sending Galadriel back to the Southlands, but with three boats instead of 1.

The not-hobbits have moved from one place to another, but nothing has substantively changed.

The humans are... still sitting around waiting for the orcs to kill them.

The elves and dwarves have at least made some forward progress, but only in relation to a sideplot that the audience already knows is wholly irrelevant to the world as a whole, and what the show is ostensibly supposed to be about.


People are bitching about the dialogue, but it's the absolutely tectonically slow pacing that's the problem."
The Oath,How is the viewership doing
The Oath,why does an island nation only have 3 boats
The Oath,[removed]
The Oath,"I know I've been bitching about this series for four straight weeks, but this is the most generic fantasy show I've ever seen. Sometimes I feel like I'm sitting through an extremely extended video game cutscene. It just doesn't inspire anything in me; it's all paint-by-numbers. I literally don't know any of the new characters' names yet. There are a lot of pretty faces, but a huge lack of chemistry. Only character I really enjoy so far is that grumpy dwarf guy (whatever his name is).

The most admirable thing are the visuals on the show, top to bottom. You can tell there was a lot of care put into those superficial details. Maybe if it would've come out 20 years ago, it would have felt a lot fresher. There is just so much better quality content out there right now. I haven't been the biggest supporter of House of the Dragon either, but at least that one feels like it has more substance to it."
The Oath,"At the end of the last episode:


numenoreans are going to middle earth

Southlanders are holed up at the tower

At the end of this episode:


Numenoreans going to middle earth (less ships)

Southlanders are holed up at the tower (less people)

Aside from the lack of plot moving forward, I enjoyed Elrond and Durin's scenes quite a bit.
I also wonder what the plan of the people holed up at this tower is? Like what are they waiting for, obviously Galadriel and the Numenoreans are going to come rescue them, but they dont know that."
The Oath,"I came into this series with an open mind, but ....

The drama of the movie score far exceeds what actually happens in many of the scenes.  I find it pretty cringy in places tbh.  It builds to a rousing crescendo when nothing major is happening then abruptly cuts to another scene.

The Galadriel training scene was pointless.  A guy got promoted for nicking her arm.

And I don't care about most of the characters."
The Oath,[deleted]
The Oath,"  Can someone please explain, in more than two lines, the train of thought that goes from 'our trees grow blighted' to 'this means we all will lose our souls in a year' to 'send our warrior who seeks new threats away to fix it' to 'we need this metal from one specific myth that I've never seen before today, but rest assured I am certain vast quantities of it will heal our trees and souls... somehow. With its light.' Even if this is a heap of bullshit fed to Elrond to get him to be the innocent proxy, there has to be some reason beyond naivety or trust of authority figures that he hears this and goes 'yes, this makes sense, I have no further questions'. Because if you told _me_ that my entire magical race needed something very specific that was only just discovered to survive an incredibly short-term apocalypse, my first thought would be 'the timing of this is incredibly suspicious, please tell me a hell of a lot more about the specifics.'


In general, I don't _hate_ this show, it's awfully nice-looking and some of the characters are fun (Elrond being the stand-out example here despite or perhaps because of his earnestness), but I only like one of the four storylines going on right now, which doesn't really speak well of the story as a whole."
The Oath,Crazy how little i care about the Numenor stuff
The Oath,what is happening with this show It's like they drop all their budget on cgi and forget writing
The Oath,Man they’re really dragging out the Harfoot/Stranger storyline by giving them as little screentime as possible. I would’ve liked to see more of them.
The Oath,[deleted]
The Oath,"Maaaan, the pacing is really slow. Throwing money at a property isn’t going to fix bad writing and sluggish scenes. 

It isn’t a slow burn, it’s just sluggish. A slow-burn of a show would at least make me beg the question.

I wanted to like it, shame"
The Oath,"Most of that episode didn't need to happen, stuff happened, then basically the show did a loop. They were going to leave then there needed to be an episode for them to leave."
The Oath,Is Galadriel one of the most least likable protagonists from a piece of media ever? I never seen a main character so annoying and so hard to like and feel connected to.
The Oath,"The writing and dialogues and actors are just not good enough.
I wonder if they can fix it in season 2. They can't make a good show with a budget like this. It's kinda sad."
The Oath,"I’m never against a slow burn. 

But man I feel like episodes 2,3 and 4 could have been condensed into one episode with a lot of the plot points. 

The most interesting and best acted character (Ador) doesn’t even show up until episode 4 and he only got one scene."
The Oath,Miriel only knows one acting style: scowl. I’ll definitely blame the directors on that because Galadirial also has no subtly in your facial expressions and I know the actress is really good.
The Oath,Halbrand is fucking Sauron isn't he? That better not be the fucking Ring in that pouch around his neck
The Oath,Best way to watch this show is at 1.25 speed on the second monitor.
The Oath,"This show is turning out to be a disappointment. The different storylines are bland and the switching between them give an incoherent experience. The story, dialogue and tension created between the actors is corny, very disneyfied.
That intermixed with showing off how much money they put in their CGI: all those slomo, grand scenes but storytelling like written by an 8 grader. It is a jarring experience. It is inexcusable with the richness provided by Tolkien’s work. And then I am leaving out that they basically disregarded the lore because they thought they could do better. 
Amazon is making a name for itself trashing good fantasy."
The Oath,"I think what ultimately doomed this series were the writers, storytelling and Jeff himself. It’s just boring. The pacing and story adaption and suspense just sucks. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Nobody will care to watch this show ten years from now."
The Oath,Nothing but more mystery boxes... Snore.
The Oath,"A 715 million dollar series so far has given us nothing but 5 episodes of watching boring characters walking, talking, sitting, talking while walking, talking while sitting…I feel like I’m watching days of our lives in medieval clothing."
The Oath,"genuinely dislike galadriel as the main character

her personality is awful"
The Oath,The writing is just jaw-droppingly bad. Like my mouth is literally hanging open in disbelief to see something so grand to feel soulless. It's almost horrifying that this could happen.
The Oath,I hope Amazon gets new writers for next season because I doubt many people will be sticking around if it continues this way.
The Oath,"Man, it’s slow. I have a suspicious feeling that the reason it’s so slow because the writers already written all of it at once.

I mean, they knew right from the beginning that the show would be greenlit for 5 seasons, because Amazon paid all the money for it.

So instead of planning every individual season like every other show runner does, they decided to write it like one single thing. As such, the slow start wouldn’t be a problem to whoever had read it, because (I assume this) it’s going to pick up in later seasons."
The Oath,"I gotta be honest, that hobbit song at the start was dope. My strength tells me no but the path demands yes. Inject it in to my veins baby"
The Oath,250 million to acquire partial rights. 465 million for the first season. This might be the biggest misfire in entertainment history. It's hardly better then wheel of time at this point. Can't believe they handed this show and IP to some JJ Abrams underlings. Could see this coming from a mile away
The Oath,"Do they plan to sail up the anduin? Because Galadriel told the queen that she should aid her and the other elves, but the elves don't know she jumped off the boat or know of any orcs in the southlands. If galadriel still needs to show whomever the evidence of Sauron's return they need to sail to Lindon instead. Which would cost them weeks or months of travel time. And even then there's no guarantee the elves will help the numenoreans or be convinced by galadriel."
The Oath,"So I’m getting mixed signals here about the show.  I’m incredibly hesitant to watch because I gave The Hobbit a chance and couldn’t make it through the first movie.  Absolutely loved LOTR trilogy, and really just don’t want to taint my memory of LOTR with some lame tv show."
The Oath,"God the dialogue is SO BAD. Sounds like something you'd write to make fun of fantasy nerds.

Of all the dumb clichés, the 'learning of words you don't know by explaining it with another word you shouldn't know' pissed me off the most this time.

Will still be hatewatching the shit out of it but it's getting harder to enjoy that crap"
The Oath,"Lord Halbrand, lmao.

I wouldnt be surprised if it turned out that he wasnt a king, he just liked the attention at their random assumption. (yeah, yeah, Sauron).

&#x200B;

but overall, such a strange episode.. what is even the point of Isildur's made up sister? All she did so far was always just be there and observe. You could cut her out easily. That ""boyfriend"" of hers as well. And Harfoots, what was that? They left them and now they have talk about leaving them behind due to not-Gandalf and the main dude is like ""I would never!"".. when did they even managed to catch up with them? How much time is passing? They seemed to be travelling for days or weeks but in Numenor like.. a day or few at most has passed? Same with Elrond stuff.. and why didnt these talks happened sooner, before the tower being halfway build? Was Halbrand going to cry when Galadriel was talking about her past?"
The Oath,"I mostly like this weeks episode, only thing that annoyed me was Isildurs forgettable sister taking up too much screen time from more interesting stuff."
The Oath,"It's so boring I can't even hate it.

Also seeing some people pick this over House of The Dragon is the most baffling shit I've seen in a while."
The Oath,"By all rights I should have stopped watching this shite series, but my love of Tolkien makes me persevere. 

But man it's difficult when this show is legitimately one of the worst biggest piles of shit in televised history. The pacing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the VFX are dog water, the writing is terrible, and the rage bait from the showrunners is so off putting with their victim mentality."
The Oath,[deleted]
The Oath,"5 episodes in and I feel like nothing had happened. They need to move the plot forward, whatever it is…

The pacing and writing of this show is severely lacking. Most of the time I feel like I’m watching a pretty painting."
The Oath,">""Their strokes fall like the Stone-giants of the North Moors""

The dialogue sounds like it was written by an AI trained on LOTR."
The Oath,This show is just so goddamn boring. Molasses moves faster than this show does.
The Oath,"I remember when I wouldn't prepare for a 1500 word essay back in the day and would be there the night before stuck at 700 words, trying for hours to scrape my way to the word count. This post is completely unrelated to the writing on this show."
The Oath,How did they managed to be weaker every episode?!
The Oath,"The way they ended last episode gave the impression that Numenor had already starting sailing to the aid of the Southlands. Now, we are told that was only signaling their *intent* to sail and that this episode gathers popular support for the voyage?

We're 62.5% into S1 and it's very obvious that the entire season's plot is just a small inconsequential battle between the Numenoreans and Adar's forces. Season ends with Orodruin erupting which turns the Southlands into the land of Mordor. I don't even think we get the Stranger's identity.

I dunno about you but to me that sounds way too little of plot progression in a 9 hr season. Insanely padded.

But, now on to the good stuff. Bear's score is excellent, Galadriel finally showed some maturity, Elrond and Durin are still a great combo.

6/10"
The Oath,"My verdict: episode 5 is even worse than episode 4 and introduces more mysterious objects, paper thin characterization, tension less  conflict (typically resolved in episode to keep what plot there is slithering along), and bastardization of legendary characters. It was honestly a chore to get through this episode.

However, Wandering Days is great and felt very Tolkienian and Elrond/Durin remain highlights of this shitshow."
The Oath,"What a boring episode, nothing really advanced the story since episode 3 :( I'm about to give up and I don't really want to. There's only 3 episodes left this season...

Everything is so obvious. It's so obvious that Halbrand is Sauron that is not even funny anymore."
The Oath,"How is anyone going to be like, ""this show is amazing"" while not severely cringing at the acting in nearly every scene. the odd dramatic cuts and exchanges. i almost just wanted to skip the whole sparing scene. the choreography was absolutely terrible and the whole execution just bad."
The Oath,"The editing and pacing in this episode is all over the place.

We're jumping from scene to scene and every scene just makes very little sense or has no significance. 

But the story between Elrond and Durin is good, but just the scenes are waaaay too short.

Regardless of Lore consistency, season 1 should have just been about Galadriel, Durin and Elrond.

There's just too much shit going on."
The Oath,"     Honestly lore aside, watching this show makes me feel like I'm smoking crack. I just want to keep puffing on this toxic crap while I ride the climax of every painfully drawn toke, never to experience the high that would give me the closure I need to put down the pipe. Much like smoking crack, none of this junk I am rabidly consuming is beneficial but rather detrimental to my health, sanity, and reference to time i.e. not only am I poisoning myself while getting high, I am becoming bored with how long it is taking to kill me. This episode was a breakthrough in addiction therapy as Amazon has effectively bored me into sobriety by making me wish the crack-fueled death had killed me before I took a rip of this new batch."
The Oath,"The Harfoots song was the best part lol. That was actually closest to capturing the cinematic feel from the movies. I think the lyrics are even a bit of a hint... There's a call back in the phrasing.

I would criticize them a bit here in making Numenor seem too small. It's fine to have small group scenes, but since they've arrived they haven't really expanded the Numenorean world in any meaningful way. They've got a nice looking capital, Elendil and Isildur are there, Pharazon and Miriel are ruling, the king is locked in the tower, and Anarion is...elsewhere. We haven't seen much expansion of the plot, cast, or setting in my opinion. Bottom line, small ensemble scenes need to take place in a world that feels big.

The Southlands plot to me is rather...boring. So the key makes Orodruin erupt. I mean if it's not that, then I gotta hand it to them. But I'm not worried. I'd be shocked if that's not the end result. But it seems a rather roundabout way to get to a volcano."
The Oath,"Never seen a ‘big’ show fade from the public eye so fast.

These days is crucial to engage your audience and respect their time rather than wasting several episodes. 

RoP understood this too late and now its already dying."
The Oath,"Last episode had the queen state they are going, I was hoping this episode had started with them left? It feels like a lot of this episodes plot, outside of Duran and elron, were things we didnt need to see? The harfoot portion was fine too but the southlands and galadriel's story basically treated water. 


I see embers of greatness but man this show needed another draft to edit out the extra fluff and allow the story to have a better pace"
Against The tides,"That staredown between Daemon and Aemond. Daemon was like, “did I used to be a shit like that?”"
Against The tides,Aemond actor has got a presence
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine’s performance in this episode was masterful. The entrance in the throne room and the supper monologue were outstanding. And the young actor who plays Aemond kind of stole the show too, he was great ! One of the best episodes of the season."
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine gave a truly magnificent performance this episode, and for the season as a whole. I felt so sad for him but took some solace that he died thinking that his family was at peace.

I felt such empathy. We all have aging and/or sick loved ones and most of us will all have to go through something similar at the end of our own lives. RIP King Viserys."
Against The tides,The scene when the door opens in the throne room and Viserys shows up was amazing.
Against The tides,Paddy Considine put down a career high point performance.
Against The tides,"Man, Paddy Consosine really made magic in this role"
Against The tides,"I’ll miss the King, he was the most human out of all of them."
Against The tides,"Wasn't expecting to be so moved watching an old man walk up some steps to sit on a chair, but damn if that scene wasn't mesmerizing."
Against The tides,Osferth as Aemond was fun.
Against The tides,"Is it me or does it seem like Jace and Luke are not ready for a hand to hand fight with Aegon and Aemond? Daemon needs to train those boys.

Also there seems to be a connection between Aemond and Daemon... wonder how that will play out."
Against The tides,Damn that scene was so nice when Daemon helps Vicerys climb the throne and crowns him. It's almost like Daemon is appreciating Vicerys's (possibly final) kingly move and ready to support him whichever way he can.
Against The tides,"""Handsome, wise...and Strong."" For how long was he sitting on THAT one?"
Against The tides,Totally blown away by Paddy Considine's portrayal of Viserys in this episode. Just wow.
Against The tides,"That scene of Viserys entering the throne room might be one of the best scenes in the both shows combined, Paddy might get an Emmy for this episode next year"
Against The tides,HBO better start working on a high-budget show for my man Paddy Considine. What a star!
Against The tides,"That head slice caught me off guard.
""He can keep his tongue"" - savage! Haha loved this episode"
Against The tides,Aemond looks so bad ass and evil. Like Final fantasy character lol
Against The tides,"Aemond's actor looks like Matt Smith, like it's two Matt Smith's in the room, and they're both sporting elf haircuts."
Against The tides,Also a joke note but I am convinced Daemon and otto are timelords that live for a thousand years because they havent aged in a show that has skipped nearly 25 years from the first episode.
Against The tides,Such an excellent episode for the actor who plays the king. What a tremendous send off. He may not have been a good king but he certainly was a good man.
Against The tides,Paddy deserves a fookin Emmy for his performance.
Against The tides,"Viserys walking across the throne room was one of the most powerful scenes in recent memory.

No need for huge battles or anything flashy, this moment was earned. Absolutely AMAZING"
Against The tides,This man Aemond seems pretty hardcore ngl
Against The tides,"I couldn’t have been the only one to notice Daemon laughing at Helaena embarrassing Aegon. Even Otto congratulating her on it. 
That was the funniest scene in this episode lol"
Against The tides,I like how that dudes plan to become the lord of driftmark was to call the kings favorite daughter and most give no fucks swordsman’s wife a whore. Excellent plan.
Against The tides,Rhaenyra's kids really didn't think to get beefed up and learn combat after they lost a 4 v 1 to Aemond? That or Alicent's kids just got all the good Targ genetics and got the height + muscles.
Against The tides,"What an incredible scene the walk to the throne. Just wow. And aemond is getting more and more interesting. Helaena and jace dancing was so cute. And greens, even if I feel sympathetic to Alicent in some moments I don't understand how anybody can look at aegon and think he's a better king than rhaenyra will be. Or anyone. He's my last option. He's the ugly version of ""I dun wannit"""
Against The tides,"I believe this episode contains instant classic moments, the King's entrance and the final scene alone are absolutely remarkable, that final shot of the king extending his hand, with the window in the background reminded me of Nosferatu's death scene, beautiful composition."
Against The tides,"For someone who was adamant about not having kids, Rhaenyra really changed her mind there, she had more than Alicent.

RIP Viserys, he won't have to deal with the family BS anymore."
Against The tides,Im so glad they got vicey out before the shit went down . I needed that for him to have that one moment of serenity before he died. I got all choked up made me want to forgive my family for our issues and call my grandmother.
Against The tides,That dinner scene was so heartwarming for a sec that I honestly thought the whole thing was the Kings imagination as he dies. Rhaenyra hyping up Alicent was so precious and I almost forgot what a innocent girl she was. All she wanted was her friend back. I hated her so much for the past couple episodes but seeing that glimpse of kindness from her showed she is a naturally good person with a naturally douchelord father.
Against The tides,"Just yesterday I had Tyrion's ""I wish I was the monster you think I am"" speech reel pop up in my feed. And I thought, ""nyah, HOTD is nice but it's not gonna give us this standard of acting and production. 

Then today, I saw Paddy. Playing 'pre-mortem' Viserys. 
What a send-off. What a send-off."
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine should win an Emmy for his performance. Absolutely triumphant when he makes that walk to the throne. He’s doing it because he loves his daughter, but more so it’s the last remnant of Emma. Even better when he gets that moment of joy at dinner and dies seeing his wife. He will be missed but time for chaos to ensue."
Against The tides,This is setting up for a very big penultimate episode. Game of Thrones' biggest episodes were almost always the second to last of the season. This is looking to be the same. Can't wait for next weekend.
Against The tides,The music was fantastic this episode! Especially when Viserys walked into the throne room.
Against The tides,"Oh my days, Viserys entering the throne room and dragging himself to the throne was an incredible scene. That was up there with anything from GOT. Paddy Considine had a difficult, multifaceted role and pulled it off wonderfully. People pop for battles and dragons, but that scene is why I watch television."
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine deserves at least an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Viserys. He gave quite the performance from beginning to end. Such a great character, played by a great actor"
Against The tides,How the fuck are Rhaenyra and Damon's children so much better adjusted than Alicents?
Against The tides,"I expected retaliation, but man Vaemond’s splitting headache was brutal."
Against The tides,"The ost at hour mark during the supper when Viserys is finally happy. I thought that was beautiful. Made me tear up. How was this episode less intense than the previous ones and still on part with them. Since the wedding, every episode has been a bliss to watch"
Against The tides,It HOTD is anything like GOT the penultimate episode should be crazy.
Against The tides,"The scene of last supper is amazing. The joy, the bitterness, the sadness perfectly captured."
Against The tides,"Hats off to Paddy Considine, this was his episode without a doubt. Viserys entering the thrown room might be one of my favorite scenes in either this or GoT. Then Daemon coming up to help him... *chef's kiss*"
Against The tides,I thought it was a nice touch that they put a pig in front of Aemond
Against The tides,"Paddy for an emmy! 

Legit fucking killed the role."
Against The tides,"The King is Dead. Long Live the... ? 

Ahem... well... about that...

Paddy, your performance as Vizzy T was absolutely glorious. One for the ages."
Against The tides,Paddy Consosine gave us one of the single best characters this universe has seen so far. Incredible performance.
Against The tides,Agree with everyone here. Paddy Considine deserves the Emmy for this episode. Heartbreaking performance. Everyone was great though. Last two episodes are going to be crazy.
Against The tides,The Kings entrance to the throne room might be my favorite scene of the year.
Against The tides,"Oh and can we give all the accolades to Ewan Mitchell as well?

Yes, sure Paddy (and Olivia imo) stole the episode, but damn, Ewan's Aemond is gonna be such a joy to behold. 

Quite the contrast from his role in *The Last Kingdom*. Yeah, sure Osferth was a badass but differently. That's called fucking range."
Against The tides,"I know we've all talked about Paddy's amazing performance and Aemond's strong presence.

I also wanna give it up for Emma D'Arcy (Rhaenyra) in that scene where she was alone with Viserys and broke down, it was incredible and sad. How quickly they all made us forget about the younger actresses lol"
Against The tides,"I absolutely loved this episode!!! Daemon helping his brother. The king only accepting help from.his brother.

Daemon defending his step sons and wife!!

The uncle and nephew stand off!!

EPIC!!!!!"
Against The tides,"Episode 1 Viserys looks a few years older than Daemon. Tonight he looked like he could be his grandfather. Viserys' makeup looked great, but they haven't aged Daemon a day all season."
Against The tides,[removed]
Against The tides,"Anyone have any thoughts on what may be going on with Mysaria (the White Worm) getting Alicent's maid to come in? Will she play a part in helping Daemon? What are her motives beyond furthering her station? 

No book spoilers, please, but I'd love to hear any theories!"
Against The tides,Aemond def has some Sephiroth/Advent Children vibes going on
Against The tides,Wait so Haelena really married her brother? I am confused.
Against The tides,"Game of Thrones has had so many great moments but I think this episode has got to be among its best. There's very little spectacle, just the sheer magnificent acting of Paddy making us empathize with his character."
Against The tides,Paddy Considine’s masterclass performance this episode is the stuff that gets awards. They will definitely submit this for his Emmy consideration. Just.. wow
Against The tides,"At the end of the Throne Room scene where Viserys refuses milk of the poppy once again and says ""I will not cloud my mind. I must put things right.""  


He really was just trying to glue together the cracks before the end."
Against The tides,"Viserys died as he lived, fucking everything up"
Against The tides,Any time Aemond appears on screen I expect him to start fucking shit up. Which is why I like his character.
Against The tides,"My thoughts:

* Damn, it was shocking to see Viserys like that... 

* Aegon is such a dick, at least Alicent did something about it.. I wasn't expecting that after she gave Dyana the money. 

* I'm Team Black, but damn Aemond's fighting scene was incredible, Ewan Mitchell seems perfect for that role.

* Holy... that Viserys entrance... and Daemon helping him with the crown.. 👏

* OMG DAEMON WTF. He didn't even think twice..

* Of course Aemond had to escalate things.. 

* Ramin once again nailed the music. 

Another excellent episode!"
Against The tides,Viserys the Sad King
Against The tides,"Vyseris really fucked up by not involving Rhaenyra in the government, she should be the one sitting in the throne, not the Queen consort, if he knew he was dying he should've named her co-regent to have a smooth transition of power."
Against The tides,This show continues to prove my doubts wrong. Paddy Constadine deserves all the love
Against The tides,"What a performance by Paddy C. Wow.

My favorite performance overall in the GOT world together with Tyrion and Cersei.

Aemond is so bad ass and evil,too.  great presence."
Against The tides,And here…we…GO!
Against The tides,"Imo this is the first landmark moment of the series, that did not feel like a GOT Retread and I have to give them credit, the succession petition in the throne room, they didn't use shock value or some crazy death. It was just amazing writing portrayed by top tier acting in a beautiful setting with an excellent score"
Against The tides,Another fantastic episode. One thing House of the Dragon has done sublimely is build incredible tension. Even more so than Game of Thrones proper did. The rest of this series is going to be a banger.
Against The tides,"I can't get over how conflicted I am over Daemon. The man is obviously a murderer. A cold-blooded one at that. But in other arenas the guy is practically a paragon of virtue. Just the fact that he swallowed his pride and let his brother finish out his term as King is weirdly admirable. He's a bloodthirster but he's also an actual selfless hero in battle. He'll kill his own wife but yet also venerates his culture and traditions better than any Targaryen we've seen. 

This show is really upping the multifaceted morality of the characters angle that the original show was already known for."
Against The tides,"This episode was fantastic. 

One of the best episodes out of BOTH House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones. That scene with Viserys walking to the throne was perfect. 

&#x200B;

Amazing, how they can make such a simple scene so ... well, brilliant."
Against The tides,I appreciate the show pausing for a sec when Damond got the parchment/letter(?) so I can pretend to understand cursive.
Against The tides,"Give Paddy the Emmy, his performance as Viserys was so beautiful and heartbreaking this episode.  When he walked to the throne and that dinner scene speech, just incredible 👏. All he wanted was for his family to be happy and to get along 😭"
Against The tides,So was Alicent misinterpreting the fire and ice thing at the end?
Against The tides,Tragic calm before the storm
Against The tides,"Huh.  So a zombie can sit the Iron Throne.

I am amazed those Maesters were able to keep him alive at that point."
Against The tides,Last 2 episodes have been simply spectacular.
Against The tides,"DAMN the moment when Daemon says ""Say it"" and then chops the dude heads off. o_0

And then Aemond stares at him like ""bad ass"""
Against The tides,What a fucking episode
Against The tides,"But seriously after watching game of thrones and reading  the lore the only thing that is clear is nobody cares about who the ""rightful heir"" is. I dont care either. This is a power grab and the power goes to whoever works for it best. That's what's interesting to see. Ya rhaenyra was named heir by a king who is a man that inherited the power from his forefathers who grabbed that power from other ""rightful rulers"". Nobody cares about rightfulness when they are working for power. So it's fun to pick sides and be invested in the show, but either green or black supporters working their way through technicalities about who has the right to the throne by blood or being named by King makes no sense because you're actually endorsing archaic rules about bloodlines and monarchy which even the characters in the show don't actually care about."
Against The tides,[removed]
Against The tides,I want someone to hold me like Viserys holds onto life.
Against The tides,"\#AemomdDidNothingWrong

Just wanted to compliment his nephews. Don’t believe the fake news"
Against The tides,People go crazy over Daemon or Rhaenyra but Paddy as Viserys has been by far the best performance in the series.
Against The tides,What an episode. The acting in the show is so good. Especially Paddy Considine acting as King Viserys. Easily the best scene in the show was him slowly walking to the Iron Throne.
Against The tides,"Love the episode. 

Last week was better but this one is a close second for best episode of the season.

The only thing that I strongly dislike about this show is all the talk of A Song of Ice and Fire.

Yeah its SHOULD be epic all this talk about the coming threat of the White Walkers. But we all know how it all turns out, and how short it lasts.

Other than that, this show has been some quality television."
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine was EXQUISITE as Viserys.

I’m not a fan of the Alicent & Rhaenyra whitewashing - their mistakes just get transferred to the men around them. It’s a tremendous cop out to have Alicent confuse Aegon the Conqueror for her son Aegon when Viserys affirmed the succession that very day in his right mind."
Against The tides,"It's the Daemon and Aemond show now, only 2 characters I care about."
Against The tides,A real powerful and emotional episode by all means. The significant time jumps will need some getting used to. Paddy Considine with a standout performance.
Against The tides,one emmy for paddy thanks!
Against The tides,I'm an Aemond fan. The man just looks like he wants to fuck shit up.
Against The tides,"One of the best episodes of the season, but I’m really mixed on Alicent’s motivation to (apparently?) seize the throne is now the misread prophecy of a dying man. 

Depending how future episodes handle this, it would completely rework the story from a cautionary tale of inter-family ambition into one about… taking the words of a dying king out of context, making Alicent have a more “valid” reason to seize power. I’m not sure I like that.

That said, Aemond looks cool as hell and Matt Smith and Paddy rocked it. The series needed a moment of the family genuinely rebonding."
Against The tides,"Amazing episode, but the miscommunication at the end left me very uneasy. If it never gets addressed again and becomes the starting point of this entire conflict I'll be pretty upset"
Against The tides,Paddy is a fantastic actor.
Against The tides,"Paddy Considine does such a fantastic job. And it made me sad how Rhaenyra will never know that her dad’s last moments were thinking about her. Though she did see his last great move was standing up for her against the Hightowers.

The misunderstanding thing at the end was lame."
Against The tides,"I felt really bad for Vaemond, not gonna lie. There is no reason to root for any of the players, but the show is intriguing enough to keep me watching.

Edit: What do Fire & Blood fans think about this show so far? How many seasons should there be?"
Against The tides,"The Last Flight of the Crippled Dragon

So tragically beautiful it brought me to tears.  Especially his last words.

He truly did all that he could."
Against The tides,Has someone put that throne room entrance to Stone Cold's theme yet?.....Asking for a friend
The Ultimatum,I don’t know what this means; but I’m pretty sure I hate it.
The Ultimatum,“Stars”
The Ultimatum,I’ll give it a chance…seems like a rip off of Are You The One
The Ultimatum,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
The Ultimatum,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
The Ultimatum,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
The Ultimatum,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
The Ultimatum,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
The Ultimatum,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
The Ultimatum,"What all these folks need is couples' therapy, but since they've chosen reality TV instead, I guess we're along for the ride!"
The Ultimatum,"The only reason this show works and isn't an immediate turn-off for me, is they did something pretty smart and cast only couples that I already think should break up. 

Can't be devastated if they split for somebody else, because I already want them to."
The Ultimatum,"I hoped there would be 30+ years people, but most of them are just college graduates, too young for marriage, especially guys. They don't know yet what to do with their life"
The Ultimatum,"I’ve seen people mention the way Colby treated Alexis….unless I misunderstood, I don’t see it. She tried saying he said she was unattractive, but unless I misheard, he said he wasn’t attracted to her. Two different things. She refused to take no for an answer. I found her almost unbearable. Speaking of actually unbearable, Madalyn. Ugh. Seemed like a completely unlikeable person. And, am I nuts, or was she always stoned or drunk?"
The Ultimatum,I wish they wore name tags of who they are and the original partner because I can barely keep up 😂
The Ultimatum,"This maybe an unpopular opinion but I really dislike April, she is childish and manipulative. She starts crying when she is put on the spot about her selfish ways. She never addressed the issues Jake had with her, going through his phone, calling him a cheat when she put in him in that position, acting like she might be pregnant. Speaking of her wanting to get pregnant, she seems like the type to try to trap a guy with a baby. Everything she does is about her, she is always talking about herself and what she needs, the only time she addressed any issues about Jake is when she was scared he might leave her, she doesn't act like someone in love, she acts like someone obsessed. It's a very toxic relationship, maybe Jake and Rae aren't for each other but Jake definitely needs to brake with April."
The Ultimatum,The point of most of these shows is always “what will create the maximum amount of drama to make you yell at your tv”. I think this will fit the bill.
The Ultimatum,I'm on episode 5 and I'm so curious if this show will have a second season as I honestly just don't think this will work. We all know that in honeymoon stage we try our best to show the best of us. Once the stage passes every couple will have their own issues. To me this show just further complicates their issues by bringing in a third person lol Feeling like eventually both relationships - old and new - won't work.
The Ultimatum,This show is nuts I love it this is the perfect trashy tv. I’ve certainly laughed a lot
The Ultimatum,"It’s funny how the ones who brought their partners for the ultimatum get frustrated that the partner is going to date others (but I guess not really cause all they want is for them to say yes to marrying them). Just about everyone was doomed from the start. Lauren doesn’t want kids her bf does. They need this show to show them that children/no children is the one thing you can’t compromise on in a relationship. Rae couldn’t say why she loved her man despite being the one who brought him here???? He seems like a pawn in her world, a box ticked off of her life checklist. Is there any couple that seems like they have a chance?"
The Ultimatum,Madlyn is so toxic that it's hard to watch when she's on screen. Otherwise I think this show blows the other dating shows out of the water.
The Ultimatum,"Its like Love is Blind but everyone's already in a relationship, just to complicate things"
The Ultimatum,I’m on episode three and DAMN. Lol
The Ultimatum,I'm on episode 1 and kind of hate it but of course I have to see what happens LOL. Most of these people are WAY TOO YOUNG to be wanting to get married anyway. And many of the couples are very obviously wrong for each other. So ridiculous.
The Ultimatum,"I just finished binge watching this series - so many thoughts !! I feel so bad for some people - some couples are clearly not made for each other coming into this . Some of the individuals  (and their friends) were just TOXIC, some had their insecurities pushed to the limit .And then there was also hope - I liked the way 2 of the couples communicated (not naming anyone) it was genuine and done so well. Definitely gives real life couples sitting on that fence something to think about.

 On a separate note - I felt so bad for Colby . He was brutally honest with everyone, him texting someone is not even close to the other one getting physical and downing him with her friends. I don't know what he was expecting out of this but he was dealt the worst cards of them all. 

PS: The stainless steel wine cups - please switch them out . drinking champagne out of it is a crime"
The Ultimatum,I literally cannot stand April I just can’t.
The Ultimatum,I'm honestly surprised to see positive comments about Colby. Am I the only person who really dislikes him and thinks he's a horrible boyfriend?
The Ultimatum,Lmao at Rae’s mom having to talk to both Rae and Zay like they’re children to get them have an even halfway productive argument.
The Ultimatum,Am I the only one who thinks that Jake only likes April because his mother does? He's definitely just not that into her.
The Ultimatum,"Rae just wanted to be single and date around. I feel for Zay because I think it’s fair for his abandonment issues to be triggered. If Rae hadn’t found Jake, or any man for that matter simply interested in her, I’m sure she would have been happy in her relationship."
The Ultimatum,"This is a horrible thing for couples to do… not smart at all but it helps that they are all horrible together anyways. These people seem immature and not ready to marry. And I don’t mean their age… I’m 25 and I’m sure as hell ready to find my person, get married and have a family. But no way in hell would I be in a relationship where the other person doesn’t want the same thing. You can’t trick them into wanting to marry you…."
The Ultimatum,"""I stay in the gym, I cook, I clean, and I know how to fuck.""  -Rae

One of the greatest quotes in reality TV history."
The Ultimatum,I’ve been dying for drama and this is pretty close!! And it doesn’t feel scripted. So many of these viral shows have people say the same type of words but not this show. It feels a lot more real and raw and emotional
The Ultimatum,I really want to know what Shanique wanted/meant when she said Colby should rephrase what he said about Madlyn (“her words can cut deep….”)
The Ultimatum,"I binged this show at 2x speed.  The show’s premise is mind bogglingbecause of the participants’ young age and short length of courtship. I understand the partner’s frustration. Been there, done that.  In college, I met my first boyfriend and I constantly bothered him about us getting married one day.   Looking back 11 years ago, I was not ready for marriage. And I can honestly assess that many of these couples are not prepared for marriage. 

a few reasons: 
1) age.  these people, except for Alexis and Hunter at 28, are very young. April at 23 yo wants to get married with kids? That’s great, but kids cost money. Monthly expenses cost $.  Kids’ clothes, braces, shelter, food.
Without a good salary, life will be hard. The number one reason for divorce is money. Second reason is in-laws.  Rae wants to get married because she finished her college degree and has a career planned. And I can't remember what are the other names 

2) short length of courtship. why are these people giving ultimatums after dating for 1.5 or 2 years? It’s not like they have been dating for 10 years.  I know couples who began dating in high school year at 19 and are now 29. NOW I would ask “why not marry?”

3) Lack of financial stability due to youthful age.  Alexis saying $ is essential is not a joke. It’s maybe harsh and off-putting per Colby’s reaction and other similarly minded people

4) Colby is a huge jerk. The way he kissed or slept with different women without telling his gf.  The way he treated Alexis.  The way he kissed April when he doesn't have feelings for her.  

Overall, the lesson for me is don't push my partner into another ‘s embrace. Even if I think I'm ready, shit will hit the fan unless I'm  a rare robotic human breed without feelings"
The Ultimatum,Most of the people in the show that gave the ultimatum are either wanting to trap the other person by guilt tripping them into a relationship and are not willing to see that they not right for each other. Also most of the girls don't understand what marriage is... The guys are giving real reasons to not get married such as financial instability or not agreeing on what they'd want for a future together. Marriage is not an Instagram photo marriage is hard fucking work
The Ultimatum,"I can't wrap my head around this premise knowing myself and well the large majority of humans I wouldn't be ok with me and my partner sleeping around on TV and can't for the life of me see how it's supposed to bring the couples together. 

It's gonna be a s**t show but I will deff watch it bcs I love me some reality TV drama."
The Ultimatum,I’ve been watching for 20 minutes and this Madelyn just seems selfish. And she just wants to fuck Randall. She’s had her eyes on him from the moment she walked in. Smh
The Ultimatum,This show is insane... and messy as hell.. but I watched lol
The Ultimatum,Does anyone else feel like this show is staged?? I went on their instagrams and only one couple has an old picture together. The rest don’t have any at all.
The Ultimatum,This show should be called train wreck lol love it give me more
The Ultimatum,"This show isn’t about marriage, it really just seems like “lets separate these couples, let them have a hall pass for 3 weeks, then we’ll see if they can repair their relationship after”"
The Ultimatum,If the show is watching this thread - can we get some older couples that are on the fence for the season 3 . It would be very interesting to see what and how couples value after their first marriage is done .
The Ultimatum,"Right!! I'm watching the first episode in awe, just trying to understand it but NO. I don't."
The Ultimatum,How does this show not have its own subreddit????
The Ultimatum,"i can't believe this show looks like it's just filled with a bunch of fake spoiled rich people. i wish they had more real couples, people from different walks and classes of life. it's just so fucking elitist."
The Ultimatum,"I’m conflicted about Colby and Madlyn. One the one hand she really acted like she didn’t care about him in the beginning, but she clearly feels for him based on how she reacted to what he did at the nightclub. I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to them.

I’m also really rooting for April and Jake. I don’t really like how Rae seemed to give an ultimatum to Zay but couldn’t even explain to him how she feels about him. As much as everyone in the show seems to want Rae and Jake to get together, I’m not a fan."
The Ultimatum,"Only on episode 3 but here are my thoughts. The first episode of this show was great until you realized they all date each other while their ex’s are a mere 6 feet away.

If a season 2 comes out they should change it so that the couples arrive, have the speed dating with all couples for day 1 and then they spend the next 3 weeks guys in one house and girls in another. In these houses they bring in 10 additional single people into both houses. 5 of those people are looking for marriage and the other 5 are not. And then the couples seek out other relationships 

The whole “exploring other options” while your “ex” is there just doesn’t seem mentally healthy. Netflix had this show in the bag and then ruined it by not being a classier temptation island."
The Ultimatum,They showed like nothing about Colby and April
The Ultimatum,I think April is my crush 👀
The Ultimatum,"As a big fan of the genre, I’ll put this ahead of Love is Blind but short of Are You the One? In any case it’s been a fun watch!"
The Ultimatum,"There’s only one participant that I genuinely feel sympathy and compassion for, and that’s Randall. Everyone else seems genuinely toxic and unlikeable so it’s hard to care about them."
The Ultimatum,Why are the cups all metal?! Literally every bar and restaurant they visit uses metal cups! Do you not have glasses in America?
The Ultimatum,"Love is Blind was already a stretch, but I can't sit there and watch the hosts be holier-than-thou while pimping this cruel bizarre premise. Hard pass"
The Ultimatum,"Why has no one pointed out they all have GIANT pupils, like absurdly dilated? I don't understand."
The Ultimatum,Lololol that’s all I could think of. My favorite thing to do is watch therapists assess the interactions so it’s like I get to see them “go thru” therapy without them actually doing it lol
The Ultimatum,Amen. I feel bad for some individuals but they deserve better
The Ultimatum,"I for some reason naively thought that it was going to mostly be couples who would end up together at the end. Then they started introducing them and I was like ""yikes, they shouldn't be together, they shouldn't be together, they shouldn't be tog-oh of fucking course, it's reality TV, obviously there's gonna be a ton of breakup drama"""
The Ultimatum,AGREEEE.
The Ultimatum,"Yes, that's what I was hoping for too. These people are young, messy, and codependent. Dating in my 20's was fun given options were everywhere"
The Ultimatum,">too young for marriage, especially guys. 

I'm with you until this. Why especially guys?"
The Ultimatum,Production didn’t want to ruin relationships they thought would last lol
The Ultimatum,I 1000000% agree. The show cast is way too young. I’m in my 40s and I love the concept but would be super-interested to see this experiment w people in their 30s. Who’ve been around the block and who have had greater life experiences. I felt like at times I was watching kids. College mindset kids. Too young and immature to really embrace the meaning of love and the value of a relationship. I’m in my 40s and it became laughable at times for me. I thought back to my life post-USC and how I was in my 20s and my mindset towards relationships vs today. And it made me laugh at this show. We have so much still to learn in our 20s. But drama oppty always wins!! Go Netflix. Great concept. Poor execution but poor viable relatability for the masses!
The Ultimatum,"«Especially guys» - Yet, consistently the most immature and obnoxious in these shows are the women."
The Ultimatum,"Mid 20s is not too young for marriage. Society has pushed this narrative of your 20s are for living and travel. You can do both of those while married. Besides, if you want kids there is a specific time period when women are considered  geriatric pregnancy. That age is 35. So if you find the right person there is no reason to put the on a shelf until your mid 30s or 40s."
The Ultimatum,Not everyone is too young then. Some people know.
The Ultimatum,"Yupp, I agree with this. The editing made it seem more like she wasn't okay with being rejected and lashed out at him for it, but I am 100% here for normalising being able to say that you don't feel attracted to someone and it being okay."
The Ultimatum,"Colby seems to be well off (I mean he play's polo) and wants to marry and just seems to have his sh\*t together kinda financially.   


Gold-digging Alexis then enters the scene and seems to spill right off that she wants a luxurious lifestyle and a MAN that can give her that lifestyle or she's not interested.   


Colby then totally checks out cause he doesn't want a gold-digging girl or someone that just cares about money when he clearly doesn't lack it so he just nopes out, and she can't take no for an answer by the only guy she liked so she tries to make it that he was really ""rude"" to her. Everything is about HER..."
The Ultimatum,"gosh, I was SO happy Hunter proposed to Alexis so early just so I don't have to see and hear anything more from her. I don't like Colby either, but he was extremely nice in his way of saying that he is just not attracted to her, which is absolutely valid even without considering he was the one issuing the ultimatum to his girlfriend.

I instantly assumed that Alexis might be very self conscious about her looks (while she is absolutely beautiful, she has a very strong jaw line, which can make someone in their early 20s insecure) so she instantly jumped to the conclusion that it's about her look, bc she said that she and Madilyn look very similar.

And then when they had her bachelorette party, it only took a couple of seconds for her to stir the drama again which was totally weird coming from a person nobody was interested in anymore."
The Ultimatum,"SAME! When Shanique met Zay for tequila shots, I full on forgot they were with different OG partners. LOLlllll"
The Ultimatum,Thank you. I now feel understood
The Ultimatum,"Thank god I TOTALLY agree with you, she's manipulative and psychotic, really reminds me of my borderline first girlfriend I dated for 4 years.. She even speaks about herself in 3rd person.. ""April thinks.."" I legit think people who do that usually have mental problems..

That dude that got shouted at by Colby in the 2nd or 3rd episode where they choose to marry or not with the funky moustache and his weird ass girl (they argued about the children thing) was also a total weirdo.."
The Ultimatum,"I just see a real young person and if I recall correctly this might be only her second “long term” relationship. Let’s not forget for us Old’s barely 2 & a half years ain’t the same duration as it is for a 23 year old. Lol. 

Now pardon me while I go yell at some kids eyeing my lawn."
The Ultimatum,"Not an unpopular opinion at all--she is grossly manipulative and only wants what she wants. The whole announcing her maybe pregnancy at the bachelorette party was just so annoying and self-centered. She wants the attention of all of these guys from Insta, yet goes through his phone?!? Sayonara sweetheart. I wish he would end up with Rae."
The Ultimatum,"I definitey agree, but I'm curious why you think Jake and Rae aren't a good match. Because I assume that's who he's walking away with"
The Ultimatum,"LMAO, literally me after watching episode 5. 😂"
The Ultimatum,"My poor husband. I did not subject him to this dumpster fire, but he had to endure my screaming at the TV every five minutes. All these people need about 5 years of stark reality and intensive therapy. It was my first and last jaunt at reality shows, other than Is It Cake bc I like guessing games"
The Ultimatum,I know I was expecting the show to end in the engagement episode I think episode 2 or 3. Jealousy can make you do crazy things like propose to a girl who doesn’t want kids but you absolutely do to the point you gave them an ultimatum.
The Ultimatum,"Literally it’s only purpose is to provide us a train wreck to wait to feel better about our own lives. Also, more plz"
The Ultimatum,Sooo many red flags like the two proposals (1 fake AF) in every ep loll
The Ultimatum,It’s been renewed and season 2 is all queer couples. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.today.com/today/amp/rcna23418
The Ultimatum,"To be honest, when I first saw the trailer at the end of LIB S2, I wasn't sure. But now, I'm loving it! It's the perfect wtfbbq-type television."
The Ultimatum,"Honestly, I feel bad for Colby, because I know editing is a thing, but whatsherface seems like she legitimately does not even like him."
The Ultimatum,You mean someone insane enough to do this show may not be emotionally stable?
The Ultimatum,"She got more and more so each episode. The way she's edited and framed is also very odd. It felt like production wanted people to see her as very charming and wanted to sell her as ""the super hot one"". I just thought, eh not my type I guess I don't see it but I must be wrong. Then we start to see her drinking... The way she talks to the other girls.... The way she moves like she didn't even come their with a person. She is so uncaring about Colby (who I thought was pretty toxic too tbh) but he doesn't deserve such cruelty. 

She then gets a more neutral edit for the rest of the show? Her actions are bad but if you watch how she's being framed it's not positive or negative, they just let her shoot herself in the foot. It's really weird."
The Ultimatum,I love me some drama
The Ultimatum,I’m on episode 1. I can’t wait lol. It’s clearly drama. How could a show like this not be.
The Ultimatum,"Seriously, average relationship length is two years? I can’t help but think of them as babies, and I’m not even much older. :("
The Ultimatum,"Colby and Madlynn is a case of he sucks but she sucks more. The only thing she feels for him is utter contempt. She seems to get off making fun of him (much like many other people, sadly). Props to him for maintaining a positive attitude when everyone hates him."
The Ultimatum,"Omg the cups!!!! Hahaha I was hoping someone would mention this

So production brought these cups to every location and restaurant they went to and switched out the drinks into them every. time. Or asked the restaurant to use their special glass wear?!?!

For why? Haha I can't understand the purpose

I was so focused on the cups sometimes I wasn't even listening to the person on screen."
The Ultimatum,"Hard agree, but especially viscerally about the cups! WTF is that very specific and conspicuous aesthetic???"
The Ultimatum,"Aaaah, the cups XD I HATED them! I get it, you can't show any booze on tv in the US, I guess, but there are better options..."
The Ultimatum,Can someone please explain episode 4? What did Zay and Colby mean when they had their guys nightout? Did Colby cheat on Madlyn by kissing a girl in the nighclub and then Madlyn didn’t want to hear it or?
The Ultimatum,Agreed! I really hope Jake leaves
The Ultimatum,"He rubbed me the wrong way from the get go. I thought it was so gross when he announced he was going to change Lauren's mind about not wanting to have kids as his ""spark"" justifying a trial marriage with her. I have to say I think the Alexis stuff was all Alexis driven drama. I bet the producers were like ""damn"" after they lost their Jessica/Shaina of the season."
The Ultimatum,I agree I find him to be a total jerk
The Ultimatum,Yeah almost all these ppl suck but Mads has only negative things to say about him and wants to constant fuck the other dude lol they both suck but mads is worse af
The Ultimatum,I agree I find him to be a total jerk
The Ultimatum,Yes you’re the only one. Madelyn is the toxic one and doesn’t deserve Colby.
The Ultimatum,Several of these people remind me of high school kids!  Way too self-absorbed and immature for marriage.
The Ultimatum,I wouldn’t be surprised if it was Jake’s mom proposing to “her little Filipino firecracker” at the end of the show.
The Truth Seekers,"Pegg co-writes and co-produces but is only in each episode for a minute so disabuse yourself of that up top. That said if you’ve never seen Frost unaccompanied, that’s on you; mf is funny and a good actor to boot. The people in the promo shot for the article are the main cast with support from Malcom McDowell (who is funny af in this playing Frost’s dad) and a cast of mostly one and dones some of whom you’ll recognize from their usual circle and some you probably won’t. If all you know is the Cornetto trilogy you may be a bit disappointed as this has no Edgar Wright in it or on it anywhere. I don’t say that as a negative, just as a statement of fact. Scorsese isn’t involved either; a lot of talented people aren’t. It’s fine.

If I were them I’d tread lightly acting like this a straight up comedy. It’s more in line with Stan Against Evil, Misfits and Monsters, Ash Vs Evil Dead etc in that it’s a show *about* spooky shit *first* that is also very funny. You’ve got some monster of the week elements, a season long arc, secrets, lies, more than a little bit of peril etc. In other words it’s a well structured show that is doing some world building. I’ve seen 3 or 4 episodes so far and I’m digging the hell out of it. The gags are good, the spooks are good, it’s a good show."
The Truth Seekers,"I like it, it s not your typical Pegg Frost thing but I am enjoying it."
The Truth Seekers,"Seeing Malcolm Mcdowell in this is a little weird, but fun.  Its not the Cornetto trilogy so don't really expect that.  Slow, dry British humor, I enjoyed it."
The Truth Seekers,[deleted]
The Truth Seekers,"I think Malcolm McDowell might be the funniest character in this. ""I don't mean to sound patronizing...but you seem like an extremely fragile person, what's wrong with you?"""
The Truth Seekers,"First episode was meh, second episode was better. Curious to see if it keeps getting better"
The Truth Seekers,"This show gave me big time Dirk Gently vibes, so much so I was trying to look up all the people associated with it because i was sure there was a lot of overlap."
The Truth Seekers,Where is this show? Is it Amazon?
The Truth Seekers,"Watched the first 4 episodes last night and really enjoyed it.  Started off a little slow, but once it found its legs it made for a great evening of television.  Looking forward to watching the rest tonight.  

I will say that I disagree with the whole ""British X-Files"" thing.  The X-Files, at first, came from both the believer and non-believer view of the world, leaving the viewer with just enough plausible real-world explanation of the episode's events.  This is straight up ""ghosts are real, enjoy the ride!"" kind of thing."
The Truth Seekers,Are they main guys in the show or like supporting people?
The Truth Seekers,"We watched 3 of these already and would take issue with any comparison to xfiles, other than them sharing supernatural category.

The joke density is pretty light, especially in the first show, but each show wraps up nicely to have made it interesting even if it's not particularly funny. I admit, though, the third show and the locked room were pretty funny

Probably the most disappointing is the sheer lack of pegg frost humor as they share very little screen time and frost is played out of character. His significant weight gain is a bit distracting I felt as he makes his way through narrow corridors and other old buildings. I will say his sidekick is quite hilarious as is McDowell, the remote on the chair scene in episode 1 is brilliant. 

Still on the fence but will continue to give it a shot as it has promise."
The Truth Seekers,"In episode 7, Astrid says she saw Princess Mononoke twice in theaters. Unless the Japanese version was screened in the UK in 1997 she couldn't have seen it until 2001 when it was released in the UK."
The Truth Seekers,“British X-files”? Haa! As if.
The Truth Seekers,I have two episodes left. 😢.. I really like this show but wish it were an hour long
The Truth Seekers,[deleted]
The Truth Seekers,"How can I be British and hate British comedy tv so much? I watched 3/4 of ep 1 and turned it off, its just not funny (to me)"
The Truth Seekers,"It's pretty terrible, its getting a bit of a free pass because of the cast. Dont expect this to be on par with the projects they worked with edgar wright."
The Truth Seekers,"I wanted to love this, but I really struggled to make it through the first episode."
The Truth Seekers,Kinda expected something more funny.
The Truth Seekers,It's a little light on the joke density for a Pegg and Frost production. Also the nature of their roles in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead was  conductive for comedy. Broadband repair sounds like it was picked out of a hat.
The Truth Seekers,"Binged the whole thing in a day. Loved it, love them, want more."
The Truth Seekers,Just wish it was better.
The Truth Seekers,"It’s quite obvious they just filmed Simon Pegg in one room in one day. The special effects were hilariously cheap, the plot and writing was quite shambolic. Many shots were out of focus. The ending was nonsensical.

I did still quite enjoy it. 

It should have been a buddy ghost-chasing show with Pegg and Frost."
The Truth Seekers,"Binged this yesterday in one sitting. It's really, really good! I'm not a massive fan of Hot Fuzz type British comedies but this toned the goofiness down and upped the spooky. 

I've been waiting for another X-Files-esque program to scratch my itch for years now and this definitely hit the spot."
The Truth Seekers,Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.  Watched Hot Fuzz and just fell in love with these guys as a duo.  One of my favorite movies of all time.
The Truth Seekers,"You will like it if you like Dirk Gently. Great show, but with much more potential."
The Truth Seekers,Omg so THATS who that was.  I got face blindness and thought the guy with the beard looked familiar
The Truth Seekers,I just finished it about an hour ago. It's a heck of a ride. Definitely hope it continues.
The Truth Seekers,I am watching it right now. It funny and light. I like it. Something you don’t have think so much about.
The Truth Seekers,"The sound design in ep 1 was almost unbearable. I understood what they were trying to do, but did not enjoy it. Hard to sit through."
The Truth Seekers,I like it. It reminds me of Doctor Who for some reason.
The Truth Seekers,Amazing show so far! Highly recommend if your a Simon and nick fan
The Truth Seekers,"""Collaboration"". Yeah, Simon Pegg has like 5 minute screen time.

*note, have 3 episodes left."
The Truth Seekers,First show I've consistently laughed out loud watching in 2020.
The Truth Seekers,It's shit and I'm very disappointed
The Truth Seekers,[deleted]
The Truth Seekers,"I literally just started watching this, haven’t seen or heard anything about it until of course 2 episodes in I now see it on reddit.  I’m convinced my life is possibly a Truman show type of thing now since this is the 4th time in as many weeks that I started watching a show and then peek at reddit and it’s the first thing that shows up in my feed.

Pretty good show so far though, definitely enjoying it"
The Truth Seekers,"Not that people seem up in arms about it, but their last film together was in 2013... Definitely not 2 decades ago, NYT"
The Truth Seekers,In three decades? Has it already been that long!? Omg! Go!!
The Truth Seekers,"Nick Frost needs to cut back on those COVID snacks, the lad has officially moved from “husky” to “lard ass”."
The Truth Seekers,I was kind of expecting one of them to be like “What? Haven’t you taken a short cut before?”
The Truth Seekers,"Started watching it last night, really entertaining."
The Truth Seekers,I’m waiting for the twist that one of them is a ghost
The Truth Seekers,Just finished it. It’s my new favorite show
The Truth Seekers,"I really enjoyed it. Like what others have said on this thread, it felt like watching a more adult violent Doctor Who combined with Dirk Gently."
The Truth Seekers,I’m really shocked that the New York Times has two writing errors in a title.
The Truth Seekers,The short hair woman i find a misscast. For the rest it's ok.
The Truth Seekers,Spaced was 20 years ago? Damn..
The Truth Seekers,Watched it all the other day didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did to be honest but it pretty fun to watch
The Truth Seekers,"This show is fantastic, i binged the season, and now wsnt to go back and rewatch as I know there are things i missed."
The Truth Seekers,"it was pretty cute.  some of the jokes are really funny, and the relationships are pretty wholesome and sweet, but its not on the level of the Edgar Wright films so dont go in expecting that.  plus you get Malcolm Mcdowell and Kelly Macdonald!  Id say it was a fun way to kill a couple hours and I would watch another season if they make one."
The Truth Seekers,This show was really fun
The Truth Seekers,It was a fun watch!
The Truth Seekers,"Some genuinely creepy moments, watched the whole series in one go. It's one of those where I'm watching season 2 but I'm not telling anyone they need to watch it, if that makes sense."
The Truth Seekers,https://youtu.be/yg8b-ZIQ4e8 here’s the trailer
The Truth Seekers,I love it. Malcolm is brilliantly used. It avoids a lot of tropes as well.
The Truth Seekers,"This show was great. I loved it. 
The first episode freaked me out."
The Truth Seekers,"Love Pegg and Frost, which is the only reason I started watching as I don't like horror at all.

Quit on episode 3. It was funny, but honestly too much horror-seriousness and I don't really enjoy that genre. :/"
The Truth Seekers,"Watched/binged the whole thing after 2 days. It was very enjoyable especially with a dearth of entertainment at the moment. Good horror elements, good characters & writing and some great comedy chops all around. I would definitely watch a second season."
The Truth Seekers,[deleted]
The Truth Seekers,"It's a great show, there are some good laugh."
The Truth Seekers,I went in watching this series with zero expectations. I really loved it. Great show!
The Truth Seekers,Oh hell yeah
The Truth Seekers,I’m almost done the first season and this show has been fantastic.
The Truth Seekers,First episode was really good the second episode felt like a Doctor Who episode but I wasn’t really into the third episode and I’m kind of trailing off of it
The Truth Seekers,"It's really lacking in creative ideas and carried by the acting/production. Deadbeat is a similar show that was recently added to Amazon Prime and it's way funnier and cleverer even though its production values & acting arent so good. Every episode has an interesting plot of its own with a satisfying ending, while Truth Seekers has boring supernatural nonsense episode endings, lazily tries to be heartwarming instead of funny/scary, and focuses on cool looking settings rather than interesting or memorable stories. But I'm only halfway through so maybe it gets better."
The Truth Seekers,Completed it in a day.. What's next thing similar to it i can watch?
The Truth Seekers,I expected it to be funnier :(
The Truth Seekers,"It has nothing whatsoever to do with ""The X-Files"". Not to mention, it's ghosts, not aliens. Speaking of ghosts, watch ""Ghosts"" instead."
The Truth Seekers,"So it's a ""Paul"" prequel?"
The Truth Seekers,It’s great! Well worth your time.
The Truth Seekers,"I really loved this. Does anyone know where I can read up, or watch / listen to more information about the production of this? 
I'd love to find out about things like the lens choices - it's such a peculiar look, with distortions and focus breathing, but it's such a solid style. 
It's not just funny and well written/acted, it's just bloody ace in all regards."
The Truth Seekers,"For those upset about the lack of Simon Pegg, he will have a bigger role in the next season (if you finish the show you'll understand)."
The Truth Seekers,Loved it! I just finished the last episode. So great to see Julian Barratt in there too.
The Truth Seekers,"This is the perfect roundup, and completely spoiler free. I’m only on episode 4, but yes, it’s been brilliant and you’ve rounded it up so well. 

Nick Frost is every much as brilliant as Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. I honestly have no idea why Hollywood hasn’t caught on to him in as big a way.

If any of you haven’t seen Cuban Fury, you need to go watch it!"
The Truth Seekers,Sick Note is a great show as it has two of my favorite mainstream British actors in it.
The Truth Seekers,"Useful comment my friend, thank you."
The Truth Seekers,"> Frost’s dad

Step-Dad"
The Truth Seekers,"Thanks for that I didn't see him listed as a lead, now I won't be disappointed after this post."
The Truth Seekers,"If this was from anyone else it'd just be considered ""ok."" I think people want to like it because Pegg and Frost are so likeable. It's definitely not super spooky nor laugh out loud funny. It's just... Ok"
The Truth Seekers,Malcolm really makes the show
The Truth Seekers,I'm thinking people actually expect something from Edgar Wright.
The Truth Seekers,That wig
The Truth Seekers,Some of it feels like Shaun of the Dead.
The Truth Seekers,"Idk, I’m getting pretty typical vibes from it and it was created by them. I think it pretty much kicks dicks."
The Truth Seekers,"I thought it has a lot of similar comedic beats than the Cornetto trilogy, just spread a bit thinner. Which I don't mind, because it's actually scary, which is something which would be undercut by too much humour (looking at you, IT Part 2)."
The Truth Seekers,"Same here.  I realized 2 things while watching it.  One is I keep expecting Nick Frost to bust out with something dumb, I'm not used to him being a mature responsible character.  And two, I wondered why Simon Pegg wasn't in the show.  Until someone pointed him out to me I just didn't recognize him at all!  It's a fun show with some really fun characters!"
The Truth Seekers,"I haven't watched it yet, but I think Malcolm McDowell takes any roles thrown his way these days. He was in Rob Zombie's 31 and it was odd to see him in that movie. It was literally a role anybody could have done. Nothing special about it at all to require an actor of his caliber."
The Truth Seekers,So more like Spaced?
The Truth Seekers,The ending made it seem like we could see more Pegg/Frost interaction in a second season.
The Truth Seekers,Yea I'm really hoping for a season 2
The Truth Seekers,"I'm slogging through it. It's not terrible, but it's not that good either."
The Truth Seekers,Where can I watch this?
The Truth Seekers,Samsies. This will be a fun show if it can get 4-5 seasons and have a maintain the plot from this season.
The Truth Seekers,There's no excuse for dressing like a cunt.
The Truth Seekers,“I’ve been a paranormal investigator for over twenty years... *hello ghosts?*”
The Truth Seekers,I didn't know Malcolm McDowell was in this. Now it's a must-watch for me.
The Truth Seekers,It does at a kind of steady pace.
The Truth Seekers,"There's an imdb feature that does that btw, where you can put in multiple movies and it will show the common people"
The Truth Seekers,"Same here, the Elijah Wood version for me. 

I don't know if it's the writing, or what, because it isn't really anything like it, but there is something there that had me going, this reminds me of DGHDA, a lot, after the 3rd episode."
Yours Fatefully,"The Wire was written by actual journalists who had deeply studied their subjects for decades. Instead of Hollywood-ifying them, they presented these issues in a grounded, realistic approach. If that's not deep to you, I guess it didn't resonate. But for those who recognized these characters as real people instead of caricatures, it hit deeper than Hollywood ever could."
Yours Fatefully,"You should read the bible David Simon wrote for the series. It details the themes and arguments he intended to make with the series before it was made. It acts as something of a pitch doc, but it's far more sophisticated than any other pitch doc I've read (and being a writer, I've read a ton). Reads more like a dissertation.

Yours Fatefully,"I think I genuinely disagree with every single thing that you said to the point I'm not sure how I would even begin to respond. The Wire doesn't focus on reproducing the emotional affect? I don't even know how to address that. Actually, a question comes to mind. Where's Wallace at? Where's the boy, String?"
Yours Fatefully,"Narrative is not created with a specific message in mind? 

Lol wut?"
Yours Fatefully,"The Wire was: Created, written, and helmed by a former reporter (David Simon), and a former detective (Ed Burns). Their narrative prose is of a journalistic nature rather than a polished Television construct of reality. Maybe OP isn't used to, or not had the opportunity to read older newspaper articles. Most of all the news has been taken over by 3 or 4 Mega corporations. Which has led to the severe decline of educated journalism."

Yours Fatefully,"This is ChatGPT right? You used ChatGPT to write this post? You told it to ""propose valid criticism of the 2000s HBO television drama, 'the Wire' as a genuine counterargument to it's wide critical acclaim"". 

And that's what it spit out? You're just testing ChatGPT's response, right?"
Yours Fatefully,welp r/movies and r/television back at it again this week with the worst takes possible
Yours Fatefully,Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
Yours Fatefully,Sorry but your post is just word salad. Nearly impossible to read all the way through. I genuinely still have no idea what you're trying to say lol.
Yours Fatefully,"Your assumption that all ""deep"" stories are ""emotional experiences open to interpretation,"" seems pretty indefensible. Unless you can back up this idea, you have no argument from the get go."
Yours Fatefully,Pshh you probably like manifest you turkey
Yours Fatefully,It’s ok to have an opinion and be wrong. I often am.
Yours Fatefully,Delete this post bro..
Yours Fatefully,">But I still want to try to open the door to serious counter-arguments as to why the show isn’t that deep or insightful or brilliant. 

I can't help you there, because it generally is. There are subplots that may not be necessary, but you often find by ignoring them you're ignoring a part of the American and human experience. Some find things like S2 boring, but you're watching a metaphor for the American middle class melting away to elsewhere.

It's really hard to understand why the american education system is in the state it's in and how some lives end up where they do. You can read articles and hear stories, but they don't really work and generally drop down to money and other things. When you watch The Wire, you come away with more of the complexities that are roiling around in the system, and how they interact with other parts of society. You come away with a better sense that we don't have easy solutions to any of this at the moment, but also a better sense as to some of the real tragedies taking place.

The Sopranos is great, and in some areas it's actually touching on similar themes from different angles -- but The Wire basically shows you how a mechanism of cogs works, then steps back to show you another mechanism of cogs interacting with it, and then another, and then another. The sum becomes so much greater than the whole of its parts, which I'd argue is the definition of *deep*."
Yours Fatefully,It’s ok to not like a show! But I honestly can’t even understand what your criticism is. You don’t like that it’s realistic? You don’t like that it has some specific messages?
Yours Fatefully,"Sounds like some snotty abstraction=high art, realism=low art bs. But congrats on the opinion."
Yours Fatefully,Saying that any form of narrative is incapable of relaying a specific message is such an absurd statement that I can’t not believe this is a troll post.
Yours Fatefully,"Having not seen the show, I am completely ignorant about the Wire. However, even I can tell that your opinion sucks."
Yours Fatefully,"So let me get this straight, The Wire isn't deep because it presents its characters and situations too realistically and without much of the typical dramatization of most shows and this doesn't elicit a strong emotional reaction from you?

If anything this makes me think the issue is YOUR inability to empathize with the actual people and situations the storylines are based on because they don't reach your required level of hamfisted emotional tugging..."
Yours Fatefully,"I hate that the internet now exposes us to village idiots who, a century ago, had their idiocy confined to their zip code."

Yours Fatefully,"I'm all for criticism. I like the show (live there myself). I think if you're going to take wild swings like you're doing it would be best to just say: I'd like to explore critiques of the show, The Wire. Here are 3 hypotheses. Skip the preamble. If you're going to lean so hard on whether or not something is 'deep', then define it and own it (as in ""For me, the show lacks the depth of other shows because depth to me means X)."
Yours Fatefully,"It's all in the Game. The Wire doesn't spoonfeed the audience, there is a ton of nuenced moments that can easily be missed.

Example: Prez marking Wallace's call from the country as ""non-pertinent"" , could've saved his life"
Yours Fatefully,">The Wire treats itself as an evaluation of circumstance

Real drama is *always* an evaluation of circumstance."
Yours Fatefully,Reddit is rewarding all these brain dead takes by changing the algorithm and shoving them our throats.   Its like r/IAmThirtheenAndThisIsDeep over here recently.
Yours Fatefully," I'm really confused what you mean by ""reproducing an emotional effect"". Are you saying you just didn't connect with the show? 

From a character perspective, you've lost me. If you didn't enjoy watching Omar work, feel for Dookie, hope for Bubbles, understand Michael's struggles, empathize with and respect Cutty, find Chris monstrous but compelling, have a wayward affection for Jimmy, despise but understand Rawls, feel slightly creeped out by Carcetti etc... I'm not really sure what to tell you. These are some of the best defined and most compelling characters in TV history.

Also, the themes of the story: bureaucratic nonsense, the unrelenting pressure of the game, the perverse incentives of the police, the hypocrisies of journalism, the tragedy of kids in terrible situations, the true nature of amorality, the frailness of humanity etc... are all finely sketched and carefully depicted. I found the show unforgettable. It changed the way I thought about the world."
Yours Fatefully,"Have you….have you even watched the show?!?!

My favorite movie quote of all time applies to OP:

“At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.  Everyone in this room (Reddit thread) is now dumber having listened to it.  I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”"
Yours Fatefully,"""the Wire is focused more on reproducing an accurate image rather than reproducing the emotional affect.""

yes.  and this is fine.

one should not ignore this shows significance in the context of our america 20 years ago.  it was more or less the first time in television history AND american history that such an effort was made to expose plainly the dire status of Baltimore and cities like it in the 90s/2000s via mass media.

That someone(s) was willing to make apparent with such accuracy and compassion for the circumstances of our people is what makes it deep.  It's an artifact of it's time.  It's Woody Guthrie on video.  It's Americana."
Yours Fatefully,Why has reddit been putting all these 0 upvote r/television posts on the very top of my frontpage recently?
Yours Fatefully,"Man, the AI posts are getting out of hand."
Yours Fatefully,Do you have any examples to back up your claim that the show is more concerned with realism than emotional effect?
Yours Fatefully,What is going on with all of these hot tales coming out of r/television and ending up on my home feed? Is the algorithm bugged? I see these types of posts every refresh.
Yours Fatefully,This is a horrific take. It is superficial and he tried to put a bunch of big words together and hoped it meant something. His initial argument is that the show is “not that deep” and then later says that it is “complex” and “intricate”
Yours Fatefully,"I think the Wire succeeds because it manages to be both incredibly realistic and emotionally hard hitting. The narratives and the characters sell you on a Baltimore that borders on historically accurate rather than fictional. The depth comes from how well the show manages to show institutions and departments interacting with each other. This goes well beyond a typical good vs evil or even an anti-hero narrative. 

Take Breaking Bad for example: It's a brilliant showcase of one man's descent into crime and the supporting characters. However, there are not that many different facets of life within that narrative. You've got Walter's family, the DEA (which is mostly still through the lens of his family), and then you have the drug dealers - primarily the Salamancas and then Gus. That's it. Those are all the different major factions through most of the show. Breaking Bad doesn't really get into media or education or how the government interacts with what the characters are doing (except through the DEA and very slightly with Saul as their money laundering lawyer).

The Wire has more depth because it isn't bound to a single family and their problems. In a sense, Baltimore is the 'family' and it's got a ton of characters with competing interests and motivations. And while that does limit the emotional impact you can have with its characters, its success is that it makes you care about characters that you haven't spend 4 seasons following. The narrative in the Wire is loose in many aspects because they aren't tied to telling you a Shakespearean story about the rise and fall of a single family (although you could argue it still succeeds in doing so at times). Instead the show is a portrait of Baltimore, a work of art that reflects the life and times of the people its portraying."
Yours Fatefully,"Have you watched The Wire? How could you say it doesn’t reproduce an emotional affect? Not sure how you can watch it and not feel emotional connection, especially when it comes to characters like Wallace, Bubbles, and the season 4 kids and their stories. Hell, when a certain female character gets shot in season 1, I felt incredibly emotionally invested in her safety and recovery. 

It’s okay to NOT like The Wire or think it’s not for you, but I just can’t understand that particular criticism."
Yours Fatefully,"Get out of my stash, bro."
Yours Fatefully,">Here is my shot: The Wire treats itself as an evaluation of circumstance rather than an emotional experience open to interpretation. 

Then I'd guess that leads to the next question: Are the circumstances it evaluates deep themselves?

I'd argue the answer is yes. The environment in Baltimore is deep web of individuals and organizations. So since the show conveys that depth, the show is deep."
Yours Fatefully,So one of the things that helped me understand the show is the creator David Simon started his writing career at the Baltimore Sun. He was on the crime desk for several years and the stories in the show are real. So I think the show has this photo-realistic effect to it that you are mistaking for this misguided rant about narrative reality reproduction. The story is told this way because he wanted to remain faithful to the actual people the characters are based on.
Yours Fatefully,"Everybody is a criminal in that show. Civilians, law enforcement,politicians, and drug dealers. Once you understand that… you understand the deep connection they all have to each other on how they perceive their righteousness in the world."
Yours Fatefully,"The Wire has tons of emotional impact and it’s tied pretty realistically to the system is portrays. I think that, combined with its huge scope, is why it’s so highly lauded. 

On a somewhat unrelated note, I’m wondering what OPs age is. Seems like the impact of something that’s highly regarded can get lost on folks who didn’t experience it firsthand or have grown up experiencing the products that were influenced by the thing that influenced. There are exceptions, of course."
Yours Fatefully,"WHY am I getting flooded by these bad take threads?  There's zero upvotes on it, and it's been up for 3 hours!"
Yours Fatefully,"r/television meta for the past few weeks has been ""extremely well loved and highly regarded show is bad or overrated and heres my outrageous and straight up wrong reasons why"""
Yours Fatefully,"I think I understand what you're getting at, even though I disagree with how it came out. 

The Wire is definitely more of an observational show, taking a more distanced, extroverted approach, in the sense that it doesn't spend much time digging into the psyche of the characters (Sopranos) and instead focuses on external situations and how they unfold.

I think it would be a mistake to call this 'shallow' as you sort of implied, although certainly it is in an interpersonal sense, but it's simply more focused on the depth at the level of institutions, processes, and their effects on people in a consequential and tragic way. Different shows resonate more with different people based on how they process fiction psychologically. 

Personally for example, I'm an extremely introverted 'people over things' type of guy, so naturally I prefer shows like Sopranos which really attempt to dig down into a person (or group of people). I love The Wire, its grounded naturalism even slightly removed still ventures to explore the emotional effects it has on its characters 'where's the boy String?', but it definitely has a broader focus on a more top-down instutional perspective. You can kinda see it as Sopranos is like 80% introspective, 20% stuff, The Wire is like 20% introspective, 80% stuff

The formal components of both The Wire and Sopranos are extremely difficult to criticize, and the remainder of the disagreement imo for GOAT status pertains to subjective psychological differences as noted above."
Yours Fatefully,"This post reeks of someone hearing how great a show is, going into the show wanting to poke holes in it, watching *parts* of the show looking for issues, googling criticism of the show looking for issues, not finding many, and then coming up with a patronizing jumble of bombastic word salad drivel. But what do I know?"
Yours Fatefully,">While the show has a nuanced perspective it boxes itself into a singular meaning that deprives the story of depth. It is complex and intricate for sure, but structurally as a narrative it does not offer the same level of ambiguity required for a dynamic and multilayered story.

I think that's a shallow criticism that doesn't take the work on its own terms.

Some stories explore themes in a broad way, asking open-ended questions and inviting the audience to ponder them.

*The Wire* is not doing that. It's making statements. Loud ones. With considerable rage, passion, and careful articulation. It's a scathing discursive essay, in fictional form, about institutional rot. The only times it asks open-ended questions (like ""can a good cop overcome structural deficiencies in policing?"") it nearly always answers them conclusively by season's end. (""Not for very long."")

It's closer to a movie like *Spotlight* than a show like *Breaking Bad.* You're not meant to ponder the ambiguity. You're meant to walk away thinking ""The war on drugs is a fucking catastrophe of epic proportions.""

You can argue that that makes it not land very emotionally FOR YOU, and no one can say you're wrong. But it's not a failing on the part of the show. It's a deeply intentional creative choice that undergirds the entire thesis of the thing, and it's a major part of why it resonated so deeply and so lastingly with so many viewers."
Yours Fatefully,I didn’t read any of this
Yours Fatefully,"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it it. I award you no karma, and may God have mercy on your soul."
Yours Fatefully,"The fact that you actually said narrative is not created with a specific message in mind is WILD. You have obviously never read any narrative critique or tried looking at any author interviews or intent. All narratives have a message in mind, even children’s shows. Even the message that good is preferable to evil IS a message. You need to go back to the drawing board and start from day one."
Yours Fatefully,"Idk why someone would even want to try to do this because your attempt at it was one of the most illogical things I've ever read.

It doesn't want you to feel the emotional effect?   It's a show that acutely goes out of its way to paint gang bangers as bad people yet makes sure you know they're still people and that you can get connected to bad people and be pained when they die."
Yours Fatefully,"What is that ""singular meaning""?"
Yours Fatefully,The murder of DeAngelo in the 2nd season as well as the the murder of Wallace in Season 1 is when I realized this show was not about happy endings and rather was about what the writers witnessed themselves up front and center. I think you are missing the whole point of how the show is relentlessly trying to show the helplessness of those in the inner city with their somehow forced existence as pawns in a continuous political game.
Yours Fatefully,PS this didn’t sound harsh it just sounds like you have no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t even think you watched the show.
Yours Fatefully,Spoken like a guy who has never even watched it. Bravo.
Yours Fatefully,[what you just said](https://youtu.be/YpuRcmPnSTM)
Yours Fatefully,But did you follow the money?
Yours Fatefully,if you don’t care why did you write an entire goddamn novel about how you don’t care
Yours Fatefully,TLDR; The Wire is missing the Dickensian aspect.
Yours Fatefully,Were you over-thinking it?  At the end of the day it is simply intended to be entertaining.
Yours Fatefully,OP coming in here like a 40 degree day.
Yours Fatefully,That's a whole lot of words to say nothing
Yours Fatefully,Well. I've heard of all the other shows you mentioned but never heard of The Wire so I don't think it's actually regarded is THE best.
Yours Fatefully,">The Wire treats itself as an evaluation of circumstance rather than an emotional experience open to interpretation.

I think that's to its credit. Stories which try to tell you what to feel are more contrived, and feel decidedly inauthentic and manipulative. In fact, I'd say that Hollywood's current pre-occupation with trying to get the audience to feel a certain way, or pander to a specific set of expectations, is part of why it's struggling to retain audiences and profitability.

This isn't to say you shouldn't have a reaction to a particular work, far from it, but when you're telling the audience *how* they should feel, or what they should think, you're presuming on their agency.

My question to you would be this: How would you change 'The Wire' to make it better than it is? What is it missing to make it a better show? If you can answer that, then you might be on to something, but I suspect merely that the show's unrelenting bleakness made it alienating to you."
Yours Fatefully,"Are you a Film Studies minor? This sounds like it was written by someone who is in the middle of a criticisms class. 

I get what you’re saying here: what’s so good about it anyways? 

But I also have no idea what you’re saying here. “Narrative in any formats… is not scientific in nature. It is not created with a specific message in mind, it is about reproducing the sensations of reality and not reality itself”

This isn’t your thesis dog, it’s just Reddit"

Yours Fatefully,"Serious question OP:  
Why does there need to be a connection between something being “deep” and being good?  
  
If emotional (or narrative) depth is a prerequisite to quality, most shows will fail that test. The Wire isn’t meant to be deep; it’s meant to be a good story, which it is."
Yours Fatefully,"No other show has come close to presenting the complexities of real life instead of some generic story line.

Yours Fatefully,"Yikes, the month of bad takes continues"
Yours Fatefully,"I don’t believe the creators were “obsessed” with realism; and certainly not in any way that might sacrifice depth, both emotional and intellectual. 

One example: The show’s overwhelmingly favorite character, Omar Little, is NOT a character born from realism. 

Obsession with realism would have been at the cost of actual entertainment. Obsession with realism would have produced a documentary."
Yours Fatefully,Why the hell am I suddenly getting posts like this at the top of my feed? These “hot takes” style of posts?
Yours Fatefully,"I believe you're focusing on the wrong things in your criticism - The Wire is not a character driven drama. The city, the communities, and the institutions are the highlights of The Wire. You could write any character as an alcoholic cop, drug dealer, or junkie and in fact the show features several of each. But ask yourself, what is The Wire trying to tell you about the institutions  that create characters like this?

I know this has been picked to death, but OP if you read this, I encourage you to reexamine the lenses you're using to criticize this show."
Yours Fatefully,I'm starting to think that posts like these found on /r/television and lately on /r/movies are just some ChatGPT copy/pasta
Yours Fatefully,Is this /r/unpopularopinion?
Yours Fatefully,"If you don't like ""The Wire"", then I would highly suggest watching ""The Corner"".  If you've ever wondered why Baltimore is such a fucked up place or how it continues to remain that way, then ""The Wire"" offers an excellent explanation. From the drug corners, to the corrupt police and politicians, to the jacked up school systems and how the media covers it. But if that's too difficult for you, then ""The Corner"" offers this from a more micro perspective since it focuses primarily on one family in a Baltimore neighborhood. And it's based on real people \[as was ""The Wire""\]."

Spice Up,"Andrew's reaction while Graham is trying to sell her on it got me. Then when he shakes Graham's hand, oh man."
Spice Up,"It's old now but this is still undoubtedly the funniest Graham Norton moment. In fact, probably the funniest thing I've ever seen on television, period.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH0Nm5_vf74"
Spice Up,"My favorite moments are pretty much anytime Miriam Margolyes is a guest. This one in particular:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F186jg6MsGQ"
Spice Up,"I thought this was phony when I first saw it, still seems phony (as in her reaction). 

My personal choice for the best moment on the show : 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuXGpUR7fXA"
Spice Up,"Seems like a great show.

I always inevitably bring up the Chris Pratt failed magic trick.  Watch the clip to its entirety, it is brilliant.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3Mi8rOB3U"
Spice Up,This is hilarious! 
Spice Up,Greg Davies stories are always awesome
Spice Up,I didn't think it was phony at all. It seemed like the reaction of someone who is trying not to freak out or to show that she's unhappy with what's happening.
Spice Up,"I’ve been watching THTH and I’m like four episodes in. Some of the conversation feels so artificial especially in the opening scene when they’re talking about fucking each other in less than a few seconds of meeting each other. It doesn’t matter how someone pitched Orgy Island to you, nobody is that forward, not even the shallow Instagrammer squad.

The fact is nobody really seems to care much about the money because they’re seemingly pretty wealthy anyway. The stakes need to be higher and involve people straight up getting booted off if they even so much as kiss. And as another user said, they don’t quite explain the prize pool: does everyone get $100k? Is it split between the remaining contestants? 

The narrator is not funny and strays toward really corny lame jokes. You can almost feel how she recorded her lines sitting at home watching footage and trying to riff as she goes with no one to proof it. ""What time is it? Time to build deeper connections!"" Please god make the cringe go away."
Spice Up,"The biggest problem with the show is that it is tonally all over the place. It’s obviously trash, but it paints itself as wanting to be empowering to men/women. The parts that aren’t trashy are boring af. 

I agree though that there needed to be something done about people that had no relationships. Like the Irish girl. She did nothing.

Also, why wasn’t there nudity? I’m surprised because Love Island isn’t as prudish and they’re both UK production companies. 

Why was the Irish girl left in the game? She was invisible."
Spice Up,I'm 5 episodes in and everytime Harry opens his mouth you just want to smack him. He's literally a whiny baby narcissist.
Spice Up,"What does Francesca see in Harry? The whole time I was watching him, I wanted to shave his horrific bangs off."
Spice Up,Kind of feels like that twist would work better with couples. Like literal honeymooning couples.
Spice Up,"Watched it all and I found a lot of things particularly annoying

1. They never resolved the conflict between Harry and Fran when Harry admitted to camera that he lied to the boys, and painting Fran as manipulative to the whole house. How is Lana supposed to make the boys better people when she never disciplined Harry for that heinous act and basically allowed him to go scott free. Also she lets Fran essentially get gaslighted and go back to him. Anyone seeing this the way its edited at least has to question if this is actually developing a deeper connection or just trying to stoke one of the only two real couples the show produced
2. Contestants were kept around for too long and there was not a lot of shift between the original group. In this case they might want to follow a love island type rule where if you arent coupled up or shown tangible proof that you are improving yourself like opening yourself up to others or showing maturity then after each episode that contestant goes home. I feel like they tried this sparingly because they just didnt have a lot of contestants lined up. This would have let people like David, Kelz and Chloe stay because I do feel they improved by themselves but kicked out Haley, Nicole, Matthew, and Kori sooner. Haley  and matthew would have either left a lot sooner or actually have been able to find someone to connect with.
3. There needs to be more punishment. The show tried to correct for how much Fran and Harry were accruing the mass amount of spending by giving them the opportunity to make it up. The problem is that I dont feel like it showed them as making better connections. Those two just stopped touching to not be forever hated for basically ruining the experiment for everyone. Realistically for the amount they took from the pot they obviously aren't going to connect deeper as people because they had already blown their load so they should have been kicked from the pot. But at least they would keep their relationship. I think the only reason why they were not kicked off the pot was because they were one of the only two couples.

So yeah I echo a lot of the complaints, lack of defined rules, not enough time and no revolving wheel of contestants to actually give those looking for change via love a chance or at least to actually try to practice chastity. I think their goal was to try to market love island with the gimmick of no sex with the pretense of self betterment.  However, Love Island itself basically does this already without having that gimmick. Love Island is still trashy sexed up tv but ironically focuses itself better on the real romantic connections because they actually let the contestants try to find them instead of sticking only a few people on a beach hoping a couple stick."
Spice Up,I couldn't get over how unnecessarily hostile and unfunny the narrator was.
Spice Up,"I breezed through but sort of wasn't motivated enough to either like or dislike it. It did come off as a bit haphazard.

>Netflix clearly thought they could fix it in the edit by letting a comedian just riff over the whole thing.

A small note that the show was created by U.K. production company Talkback and distributed by Freemantle. Netflix acquired it."
Spice Up,[deleted]
Spice Up,"I'm only on episode 5 and it's an entertaining show so far. But I'm really bothered by how Harry wasn't called out from lying about the kiss and turning the group against Francesca. Also the way the rest of the women didn't back her up because she's the most attractive (debatable, I know). Chloe in particular seems to dislike her from the beginning. When they were being introduced she was already starting a conversation with the rest of the girls, ""What do you think about Francesca?"" Like giiirrrl.

The rest of the group who do not have any pairing or similar connections seem to just be hanging out on the sideline and the show doesn't seem to make use of them a lot either."
Spice Up,"bryce is the worst of all lol, his acting was so bad, he made the show even cringier"
Spice Up,"Show was trash. I think they should’ve kept the rule breaks anonymous and had to spend $1,000 to reveal who broke the rules. Would’ve spiced it up a little. Also should’ve had some sort of real elimination process for those not making a connection. Just poorly executed. 3/10"
Spice Up,"My biggest problem with the show is that the show doesn't know what it wants to be.  
If you're going full trash, go full trash. Go balls to the wall, show everything. You're Netflix, there are no rules.  
If you're going for a deeper meaning about getting past superficial relationships and building deeper connections, using some people who are actually likeable might help."
Spice Up,"I liked it a lot. I mean it's the trashiest show I watched so far, but was very entertaining and funny."
Spice Up,"Not that I'm disagreeing but to be honest I'm assuming this could be more the norm for a while as TV shows with trucks worth of footage are edited--remotely. I applaud the push for my industry to WFH, but without clear structures in place and a story editor *sitting with* video editor and post supervisor, so much is going to be lost in translation and will fall flat. Especially with a premise as loose as this one sounds. 

TL;DR--Reality TV shows that debut ""B.C."" will likely suffer, being rushed to air while the post department flies blind. It will improve...eventually. :) 

That said, thank you for the time-saving heads up!"
Spice Up,"At the end they were like “ oh crap, we need 10 people for the workshop but we still have 11 so let’s pretend chloe is sick”. This really sums up how crappy this entire show is and I can’t believe I kept watching every episode."
Spice Up,I agree with most of your points and still enjoyed it lol
Spice Up,"Holy shit, the amount of people that actually enjoy this show kind of freaks me out."
Spice Up,"Honestly it was just as enjoyable to me as any other goofy, trashy reality show with hot people in a nice location. These shows aren't meant to be watched closely or analyzed, in my opinion - if you just toss it on while you're doing something else, it's totally enjoyable. 

I agree that the rules aren't set out clearly and that does hamper the structure of the show. But if you remind yourself that you're watching vapid reality TV, it stops bothering you pretty quickly. Genuinely, these shows can keep swirling further and further down the toilet and it won't change my opinion of them at all, because I'm not looking for quality when I turn one of these goofy turds of a TV show on.

I thought this particular show was an amusing descent into debauchery and my only wish was that it had hit a point where they cut their losses and just threw it out the window for a giant orgy."
Spice Up,"I was dying because at the end, it seems like they want to make it appear as if the participants experienced growth, maturity, self reflection etc. Did they rly think that these vapid individuals will suddenly stop caring about the number of instagram followers after the show ends?? 

And the idea about building deeper connections - the moment this show ends I just know everyone will go back to being their cocky self absorbed selves IRL.. and also the money they won doesn't really seem that deserved esp cuz so many of them still ended up kissing and having sex?!?!?!"
Spice Up,"Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghost busters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all of the while the slime was under the building"
Spice Up,i hope the winner proclaimed themselves the master of their domain
Spice Up,"Just finished binge watching and I just have to disagree with you. I found the show to be really funny and well done. I loved the narrators roast, and you can not tell me bounty hunter jesus was not one of the greatest things ever. Him hunting down Hayley was amazing it was uh pretty sad to see him try talk to Madison? 

One thing I feel is that the show is not at all about the money. It’s about self improvement. You see these amazing sexy perfect people and as you watch you realize they have the same problems, fears, and anxieties as you and that they have so much to improve on. I think it was fairly obvious the money was going to everyone at the end after they removed Hayley. I do dislike that they had Lana fuck her over because I’d rather had have them try to fix her problems as well. 

There were some obvious problems of course. I would definitely recommend not adding people midway through but after two from the og group dropped I guess the producers felt forced. I completely disagree with you about their removals and felt it completely made sense. After Hayley decided to fuck over everyone, everyone hated her and there was no reason to keep her. She had no interest in anyone calling them all stupid. The only thing Madison did was jebait my boy jesus into think she was not just a thot. But also his uhh yeah we wont talk about that. Kori had his part but after the date with Francis(I CAN NOT BELIEVE SHE EVEN WENT ON IT) everyone just hated him. Lydia and Bryce were both good additions but Lydia and Davids thing got no real expansion. 

Things I’d like. Straight up. I want a longer season. I felt that the biggest problem was just that there was so little time to really interact with each bother and figure out if you could go it with anyone. Nicole was constantly saying how much she wanted to fuck but when did she ever talk to a guy. So something like 12 episodes. Content wise I want way more workshops and activities. More dates. But especially in the early part maybe a sort of speed dating workshop. 12 starting contestants with a larger prize pool. As the end of the day it’s obvious that due to the nature of the show everyone at the end will win is guaranteed. So having $100,000 split between ten is $10k thats fucking nothing. And obviously people are gonna fuck around. I think making the price pool way larger but with the same percentages relatively would make so much more engagement to the contest part instead of people not giving a fuck about <10k. 


Overall I think that and a few other minor shakes ups like different punishments and rewards will solve a lot of the lack of “interesting” content. 

I also want to shout out David. That guys is the nicest fucking guy ever. After the group morale is fucked after The double kiss beginning he leads a workout session to get everyone together, he moves out of the way for his friend after he thinks he found his own genuine connection, and when Harry was super depressed about Francis going on the date with Kori he was legit there with him the entire time. He was the group leader and I’m real sad none of the gals fell hard for him but tbh none of them deserved him."
Spice Up,"I have a few issues with show:  


1. It's clearly scripted and they don't really hide it. The conversations and forced relationships feel really awkward and unnatural. A bit more on this later.
2. The cast's size made it hard to get anything meaningful going on between more than a few of them. Matthew, Haley, and Nicole especially contributed very little to the show excluding some very minor highlights. The show mainly catered to Sharron and Rhonda and Francesca's on and off relationship with Harry.
3. THIS IS A BIG ONE. The cast itself is very unlikeable and unrelatable. Sure, David is a sweetheart and he largely gets a pass here but the rest of the cast are all either Instagram models or reality tv stars in some capacity. They're all objectively beautiful and in all honesty, I just can't really relate to any of them because of how vain and disconnected from reality they are. For every touching moment with relatability we would have with somebody like Sharron with his trust issues and baggage, we were hit with dozens of vapid issues in relation to hook up culture and being too beautiful to ever worry about sex in the first place. Being released during a time where people are much more aware of social boundaries and trying to respect each other's choices, a majority of the dialogue comes across as tone-deaf and unrealistic. As somebody who had to live in a frat house and is very much familiar with the culture, everything in this show was a far cry from actual conversations that horned up young adults have on a daily basis. 
4. The narrator is pretty meh. Very subjective but I just felt like the dumb one liners added very little to the show. Honestly would have been better with a laugh track.
5. ANOTHER BIG ONE. The addition and subtraction of cast members comes out of nowhere and the show itself has no real structure. The intricacies to a pseudo game/reality tv show can go a really long way in making trash watchable and unfortunately, this show lacks most of those cogs and wheels to keep viewers interested. Maybe they could have instituted some sort of voting system or allowed the contestants to be off the director's leash a bit more in order to make some more compelling and fluid dialogue. They could have had real stakes and drama that mattered as people tried to side against one another and we didn't get any of that....and it saddens me. Plus, most of these people have a shit ton of easy money coming their way in endorsements already so it's hard to feel like 100k matters much to anybody (especially Francesca) and the whole prize concept of the show really doesn't make anybody feel compelled to stick around for some crazy ending.  


There are so many ways to make this show watchable and enjoyable (it has been done plenty of times before). As far as trashy tv goes, there is much better stuff out there to waste your time and I would largely advise anybody curious to skip this and rewatch LI, Big Brother, or the Circle for something palatable."
Spice Up,It looks like Love Island but mediocre tbh (love island is already a bit boring now).
Spice Up,kelz is the goat
Spice Up,"I am starting episode 4.

The Circle was kinda fun and cringe.

Love is Blind really boring except first few episodes.

Now, Too Hot to Handle is pure definition of cringe and just makes no sense.

\- People crying after being few hours without sex. When the motivation is 100k.. I doubt they had their last sex just before they left for show and now counting minutes before another round. (Ye Bryce fucks everyday, good for him)

\- Literally all they care about is the looks, no mention of personality - ever lol. All they ever talk is *""I WANT YOU SO MUCH, I CANT RESIST, SHOULD WE? SHOULD WE NOT?""*

\- Most People seem like they are either on instagram, in gym or in front of the mirror 24/7, so they don't really have anything to talk about and have no personality? I bet they spend just half day doing makeup in the show.

I feel like the whole premise of the show is just too dumb. In the most reality tv shows, you want the viewer to care about the goal or relate to it. But from the start you don't even know how much time they need to be without sex. For the viewer it is like - ""Hmmm is it like 2 weeks or a month without sex? I could definitely do it.""

I should be interested enough in a show that offers you **10 BORING PEOPLE TRY NOT TO FUCK EACH OTHER.** Well, the only thing that keeps you interested is question ""what the hell are they gonna do for 8 episodes???"".

And if you wanna tell me **THEY are US**, because we are in quarantine and feeling the same. I have a better idea for a show that I will relate to in quarantine - *Close 10 people into solitary confinement, survivors get 100k.*"
Spice Up,"Totally agree with you. At this point i feel like this TV shows are made

so those people can be mocked at. Everyone knows they are not the brightest and their moral compases are pretty primitive and they care about just 1 thing. To the peoplew ho take care for this people to have food on their table , roofs on their heads , they just seem dumb and weird, so we enjoy them for leisurely fun when we are bored."
Spice Up,"Agree with you completely. 99% sure it's scripted as well. The people not having sex just don't care about the money at all. No one gets mad at the assholes eating up the money. In fact, they congratulate then and say it's good for their relationship. No fucking way those people wouldn't be just going off on those brain dead idiots.

Like it honestly makes me angry. I enjoyed Love is Blind because there was actual structure to it and the personalities played well off each other. It was absolute trash, but it was well executed trash. 

This show has no structure. No rules. Follows just 2 couples really. The rest of the people just hanging out or get booted off arbitrary. I get so angry watching it."
Spice Up,"There are some bizarre cultural undertones as well. Everyone pretending they are talking to a ""computer"" instead of a woman fed lines by the producers to camouflage that they're monitored 100% of the time and doing the bidding of those producers, the idea that the only way to incentivize appropriate behavior is via cash prize or giving physical intimacy privileges, not telling the players how money would be allocated until the end (or pretending to do so), pretending there aren't camerapeople on set ALL the time (though that's standard for reality TV), the fact that contestants openly thank ""Lana"" as converts to a new religion and act as though they don't understand it's just the producers...truly baffling."
Spice Up,"The show is a train wreck but I’m not about to stop watching. 

I don’t know how completely the producers/editors changed the footage but it was jarring to see people go straight into sex/relationships after about 24 hours together. All the conversations they show in the early episodes are just about how hot everyone finds each other. 

It’s fun to watch someone who is clearly very attractive, and then the footage showing their actual personality makes them so undesirable."
Spice Up,"I can't believe how much I dislike everyone on this show lol. 

Still entertaining though!"
Spice Up,"i just started watching it and i don't understand the stakes. if it's 100k total then they only get 10k each minus taxes. that's nothing. especially for people who clearly were able to leave their jobs/ have their rent paid while they're gone.

&#x200B;

if i was as horny as these people i would just say screw the money and let's all have sex and ruin this show haha"
Spice Up,I really like the episode where the men rub mud on each other and shout and hug though I thought it was quite touching
Spice Up,"None of it made any sense.  I couldn't figure out how the second activity took place halfway into the ""challenge"" on day 15.  What had they been doing up to that point?  After 15 days it seems like even the shallowest of people would have gotten to know each other far better than what was portrayed.  I found it irritating the creators assumed the viewers had no interest in any of the people who hadn't paired off, which was the vast majority.  They were supposedly there to learn how to connect with people on a deeper level and while some of the contestants alluded to the fact that they did, those supposed connections were portrayed as very superficial.  I only made it to episode 5 so maybe it got better.  I'm not remotely invested enough to go another 3."
Spice Up,"I like the show, but by episode 4 i really got the impression Francesca and Chloé had been planted. They are the 2 only participants who ever start anything at all."
Spice Up,"This show is incredibly disorganized, probably very scripted, and has an uncomfortable concept... The whole show is just horny people trying to resist their urges with money on the line. The Bachelor, Love Island, Love is Blind, etc. all fall into a similar category of reality TV. The difference is that those shows have higher budgets and can pump out quality content (...for reality TV). Too Hot to Handle is the dollar store version of these shows so this one being ridiculous should not be surprising. I think that this is the type of show that you waste some time on but also have some good laughs with."
Spice Up,"This was the worst trainwreck I have seen all my life.    
F .... F-"
Spice Up,THTH is better than the circle and love is blind lmao
Spice Up,"Netflix has done this before with their reality shows. They have another series called The Fastest Car, a show about “regular” Joes and their hot rods drag racing against super cars.

The show itself is mostly about sob stories and drama, and the rules are not consistent throughout. I still recall in the very first episode, the referees lay out the rules that say if someone commits a false start - going before green - they will reset and have *one* more shot before they’re DQed. 

Well, I think in episode 4 or 5, a couple racers commit a false start, and they just DQ them outright. No reset or explanation about when or why the rules changed. 

It is annoying that they don’t go over the rules clearly. I wonder if they do it just so they can change the shows format or setup as they want to maximize drama and tension."
Spice Up,It's addictive but terrible
Spice Up,This show is fucking stupid. Why would anyone trust other ppl with their money not to commit sexual acts. The cast shoulda just all fucked each other in the first 10 mins and let the money get to $0 and gtfo outta there. Show makes no sense.
Spice Up,"Is wearing a bikini top that is a little too small so the bottom half of your tits hang out, a new fad? Seems like all of the women do it constantly.  I think it looks fucking gross."
Spice Up,my two cents: the men were all hideous& shallow - Francesca totally overrated and plastic. I warmed up to Sharran and Rhonda a little.
Spice Up,Hoooly shit this show makes me lose faith in dating.
Spice Up,"Well, I enjoyed it for what it was, which was trashy TV.

I was really disappointed in how only 2 couples really dominated the entire thing and we never got to see enough of EVERYONE and their time on the island.

Hands down tho, my favorite was Matthew aka Jesus.  Like I wanted him to have more screen time and when he did, well, it wasn't pretty but that's my dude! lol

I'm kinda surprised they only got 8 episodes total over a 6 week (unsure of total time line) span?

When Bryce was introduced, I couldn't have laughed harder as I was like... WTF is that guy doing here?  He seemed so out of place."
Spice Up,"I wonder what would have happened if all the contestants just said fuck it and like just hooked up to get the pot to zero dollars.

&#x200B;

I think that may have been more entertaining."
Spice Up,Grrrr omg all them so fucking annoying why did I have to sit through that steaming pile of shit! Harry is the most annoying little shit I have ever had to watch. The funniest thing is that he is going to go back to mummy and daddy’s big house with lots of money and carry on being an 18 year old... as if Francesca thinks she has actually found a man 😂😂😂
Spice Up,"I just started washing this trash hole yesterday. 

No person on this show has a single redeeming quality and their constant talk about how difficult it has been to abstain from sex so far (on episode 4 right now) is so fake. 

Like you've never gone a couple of days without having sex? Please. 

All that does is make you look like a huge douche to say that. 

People who tend to brag about sex all the time aren't getting any."
Spice Up,"I see a lot of good ideas, being suggested to the wrong people, I liked the show because i got to look at Rhonda , everytime i stopped what i was doing to look up at the tv. I like the superficial sexualy driven mood this show brought,  its fun and creates a relatable feeling, but everyone here is completely right.

And it would be nice to see these things implemented if they somehow funded a 2nd season. I  like this more than the circle, I just didnt like the whole catfish thing, it was weird and it was a little cringey ngl.

This show as well has its  questionable moments, but  wed be lying if claimed we havent experienced/seen people do more with less time and involvement"
Spice Up,"Yeah this show should have been called ""Too Boring to Watch"""
Spice Up,I don't watch reality TV. But the hot girls made me enjoy the show. I cringe at some parts. I can't tell if I like the show or just like the girls.
Spice Up,"It is truly awful, I don't normally watch these shows but I get the gist.  It feels like a complete parody..  Me and a couple of friends are watching it ""ironically"" and mocking it for how awful/fake it is - but how many are genuinely into this and lapping it up?"
Spice Up,"You need to ad ""spoiler alert""!!!"
Spice Up,"I honestly felt like I learned a lot from Too Hot To Handle, especially being someone with commitment issues. Although it may be a cheesy reality love show, it was more than what I expected watching the opening to the first episode. 

So, you know I had to blog about it, lol. I still loved the season and hope they continue with a Season 2!! [https://www.thisisuproar.com/post/5-things-netflix-s-new-too-hot-to-handle-teaches-people-with-commitment-issues](https://www.thisisuproar.com/post/5-things-netflix-s-new-too-hot-to-handle-teaches-people-with-commitment-issues)"
Spice Up,I just finished episode six and the main problem besides the shitty production is the lack of attractive women to compete with Francesca. Not saying the guys are all hot shit either but jeez
Spice Up,"Netflix cheapened itself by getting in the trashy reality show business. Amazon would never.

EDIT: downvoted by idiots that watch this shit and think Better Call Saul is slow and boring."
Spice Up,Who the fuck watches TV shows like this?
Spice Up,two words : Hot. garbage .
Spice Up,"This show was supposed to challenge these people and rehabilitate them but they werent super bad anyway and the whole temptation was useless and literally nothing happened as two of them were swiftly cut out.

Also so many people just got cut out so they would focus around the couples, we practically didnt see Mathew for a whole episode at one point, they only time people got screen time was if they were dating, breaking the rules, drama or in the confession booth. I really Kels but as soon Francesca left him he just became this old grumpy man getting pissed when people broke the rules.

That Irish lady (I cant remember her name) literally got nothing to do the whole time other than talk a few times to others. I'd try and bring other things up but that's literally everything we get for her.

Mathew is delt a bad hand, now he was my favourite character, Jesus was really wise and fun and I liked his deepness and advice, and he really was interesting, is what I would have said if we got time to build a connection too him, I swear after episode 3 or 4 who ever wasnt in a relationship or drama was completely put to the side and gathered dust and I'll be honest although the money at the end would have been nice I can see why he left.

Now Francesca and Harry are weird, they are given the most screen time by far but are some of the worst characters, they come of as bitchy and the whole ""I've never trusted someone like this before"" is so unfounded its just hard cause when I saw them I thought these guys could be interesting especially with the drama at the start and I did like the Francesca Haley plot until it just went and sizzles out. This show messes up with not sharing screen time enough with the WHOLE cast and obviously making it up as they go along, plus the comedian who narrated isnt even that good, I only sniggered once at her comments and that was a footjob joke! It's just really sad to see so many underused characters.

I like Sharron and Rhonda, I'd say there soem ofbthe best cast and especially now with more background on both of them I'm glad they left together, they definitely have the best growth in my opinion from beach sunscreen butt rubs to dates on a boat, it's honestly nice to see them together and I'd sometimes forget what I was watching when it was just them.

I'm not gonna do other characters as they're pretty forgettable and lack remarkable qualities such as charisma which slightly shines through with bryce but other than that not so much.

The premises itself is kinda BS. A wanna be echo dot telling horny adults not to fuck and then letting them kiss occasionally plus the rules were flimsy as fuck and everyone winning is kinda crap I was hoping that instead of money being deducted they would get straight up eliminated to try and knock it into them that they shouldn't just go round having 1 night sands and what not and if they had to maybe to a redemption challenge and the fact that the contestants just got nearly a third of their money back anyway is  awful they should have to live with the consequences of their actions. What I think happened is that the producers knew they need to give them more than $4,300 so they cut the newbies which is unfair and I didnt even like them, the only reason Layla stayed is cause she stuck with that other English guy. The prodyces were then also like 'shit they need more money, OK Harry and Francesca you two go to the suite you guys can do whatever we will give you the money anyways' and that's what happened. All in all I think 'Too Hot To Handle' was an unenjoyable, non-engaging, uninteresting, waste of potential and I doubt they will do another season purely on the reviews that are surely coming its way"
Spice Up,"Absolutely feels staged as fuck, like a producer is just off screen being like, ""how about you guys kiss to get ""revenge"" on the group?""  And I was so weirdly annoyed by the Harry/Francesca thing.  Like we all see Harry beg to kiss Francesca, and then blame her for moving on him.  Everyone in the group believes Harry because they all hate Francesca right away (a tale as old as time, btw), and somehow he gets off the hook while she's immediately labeled a manipulative bitch, despite Harry being shown telling everyone in the group that she's lying and kiki'ing.  And because of the show formula, Harry is never called on this and Francesca steps into the villain role (becoming the only semi-interesting character as a result).  Nonetheless, the whole thing is just coming off like Harry is a gaslighter who is just magically getting away with it over and over, even though his behavior is on film and not even edited to make it look more okay."
Spice Up,"Yeah I thought they would get booted off too, money doesn't seem to be much of an incentive or deterrent."
Spice Up,I think the host is hilarious! Adds a layer of fun to the show
Spice Up,"About the Irish girl Nicole O'Brien I was solely disappointed that she literally got no screen time, I calculated her allocated screen time and it only amounted to 4 minutes or so over the course of 8 episodes that are 43 minutes long."
Spice Up,i thought for sure she'd get booted with the 2 newer people. she didnt do ANYTHING
Spice Up,"He's a pretty standard modern Australian larrikin tbh. People love being around him and enjoy his banter, but he has a complete inability to take any responsibility for his actions"
Spice Up,"And he looks about 16 years old, while Fran looks like a proper aged person (25-29?). I don't see what she sees in him at all."
Spice Up,"Harry is a classic case of a tier 1 Fuckboi. Like Kelz told him, there are levels to this shit and dude is just on a different level of fuckboi douchebaggery that no one else besides Kori comes close."
Spice Up,I wanted to know this too. Aside from physical attraction that is. In the later episode they confessed they love each other and I wanna know how they get along and how it came to that. The only conversation I remember them having is how to pronounce oregano.
Spice Up,There is literally nothing appealing about him. I don’t get it.
Spice Up,I would pay to see that😂
Spice Up,Nah this is just normal relationships for any couple not in their early 20s lol
Spice Up,"This needs a million upvotes. Literally seeing 
Harry be a dick the whole time and having zero consequences was so annoying. Also... him calling Kelz ugly even though I don’t think Harry is attractive in the slightest was so strange (could be personal opinion). 
I could watch love island all day and love it... but this show.. I skipped through SO many scenes lol"
Spice Up,"Omg thank you. I've seen so much about Fran and Harry and nothing yet about how much of an actual slimy cunt that guy is, a complete and utter creep who lied MULTIPLE times and made out as if Fran drove the whole kiss and then straight up told people she was manipulative etc when he was the one lying. It came off really badly, especially when they then paired them up and he tried to act as if he was being the bigger man person and trying to move past the whole thing and that she was being petty or whatever when she had every right to be upset at the incredibly douchey and downright disgusting way he acted.

I'm honestly surprised the showrunners couldn't see how problematic all those scenes were with him lying about his actions to others, then pretending like he didn't know exactly what he was doing and trying to make her feel like she was over reacting about it all. Proper gas-lighting."
Spice Up,My draw dropped when Fran told kelz that she made enough money from instagram and that she didnt care about the prize money. What a self centered person. The money is for everyone! Its a team activity! She was responsible for so much of their penalties and was never truly punished or put on blast. Clearly a person who has never been told no in her life.
Spice Up,What was hostile about her? All she commented on was the contestants goofy behavior. She didn't pick on them while they were brushing their teeth.
Spice Up,"The sad part is all these women are... so artificial** looking. I'm a lesbian and I find none of them attractive; so fake looking and ""filled up."" The second they start talking I lose brain cells. It's amazing to me how these are considered stereotypically ""hot"" people..."
Spice Up,I don’t know why the last name thing cracks me up lol!
Spice Up,Is she a bitch in real life? She seems like she'd be a bitch in real life.
Spice Up,"Chloe was insecure from the get go, and I think that might be her age speaking. 

I disliked how her first reaction on the Kori-Fran date was “she has no morals” as if Kori wasn’t the one who picked Fran. This is like when men cheat and the girlfriend/wife automatically blames the other girl—That sickens me. 

I hope when Chloe watches the show, she’ll see her reaction and reflect."
Spice Up,But what about his song? Man that was so bad. But he doesn’t care. He has sex every day of his life with someone new on his boat.
Spice Up,They could have literally pulled in any random bro from LA and it would have been the same person
Spice Up,I thought he was the worst. When he first strutted onto the scene all the women went nuts for him and I did NOT get it. He reminded me of Rob Schnieder.
Spice Up,"God I know, what a fucking douche bag he was"
Spice Up,"Adding to this point my biggest issue was the montage party dancing. The basic reality show premise is that you put people in a stressed environment, up the tension and then watch it all come out with alcohol at the end of the night. Here they replaced the pay off with bizarre cringy clearly staged dance scenes. Wtf?"
Spice Up,When Francesca got mad at Kelz for caring about the prize money and ran back to Harry the show made it clear that it was aiming to be trashy
Spice Up,[deleted]
Spice Up,That is literally the whole point and I love it. Its horribly trashy and a complete mess but I can't stop watching
Spice Up,That’s where I’m at too.  These people are thinking about it way too hard when minimal thought and peak absurdity make for one of the best watching experiences I’ve ever had.  It’s trashy and insane and I love it.
Spice Up,"I thought it had potential to beat bridalplasty as trashiest TV, but unfortunately, it did not reach that level for me. The ending of THTH was a bit too scattered, I wanted more ruthless culling of the contestants by the producers. Like kick off everyone who broke the rules even once, and everyone who never had temptation to begin with. Winners would be Kels and maybe that new girl that stayed, lol."
Spice Up,B.C.? I'm guessing it's Corona related but I dunno what it means.
Spice Up,"That's probably a fair point about things to come but from ops description I doubt it applies here.

I can't imagine any edit saving what sounds like a horny meandering mess."

Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,This was a great read.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."

Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."

The Simpsons is, in my opinion, not a good show anymore nor has it been great since like season 9.  So it's not like you don't have a strong base for your argument without having to insult people for actually enjoying things.  It comes off as pretty sad.  No one is going to take you seriously if you talk to or about people like this (and they'd be completely right)."

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,🙂💕
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Learning Songs by Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,This was a great read.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Delta state was the shit!
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,It was on both actually
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Or, maybe it’s utter shite"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I like A Pup Named Scooby Doo
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I watched it, it’s pretty bad tbh"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Calling people racist for disliking a horrible TV show is just as cringe as the meta jokes that were written for Velma. Everything is subjective when it comes to TV/film but there’s a reason it’s sitting at a 2/10.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"This review is hilarious. OP says ""Comedy is subjective"" multiple times then proceeds to tell people they're ""this or that"" for not finding it funny. Lmao. Wow."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I just watched it. They utterly trashed the entire history of the characters. First of all, every single character has been given a total makeover that barely resembles anything that came before it. They did Fred completely dirty and turned him into a narcissistic psychopath a small wang. They made Shaggy not even Shaggy. I can get Velma is gay but DAPHNE? Where the hell did that come from?  I have never watched a show that totally crapped upon all the characters and actually feels like it HATES its target audience.  This wasn't made for Scooby Doo fans. It was made for self insertion and pandering. It's horrible."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"You put it on the same level as two shows with wildly different scores (8.5 is good/great, 5.8 is mediocre/bad).  Maybe it's just subjective and bad.  I haven't watched it yet because I don't currently have HBO Max, but your 6/10 is the most ringing endorsement I've seen for it.  It's not just racists who don't like it."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Scooby-doo is not even in this show lmao
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"It's important to remember that two ideas that aren't in conflict with each other can be true at the same time. People can be negatively reviewing Velma sight unseen because they don't like the politics, AND Velma can also be a bad TV show."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Or maybe, and hear me out here, people don't like the Scooby-Doo show without Scooby-Doo that turned Fred into a Trump parable and thinks complaining about society is the same thing as jokes"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Or it’s just bad and a bad idea
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I got 7 minutes into the first episode and couldn’t take anymore. The show is hot trash. You can’t even make the argument that humour is subjective, because the show just doesn’t even feel like it’s making an attempt at it, it feels like it’s just trying to edgy and controversial for views, and it is getting rightly destroyed for it."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,So basically according to you there's no way for this show to be bad. What a take.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"This feels like a really long, “if you don’t like this then you’re racist” post. I haven’t watched it and probably won’t because currently watching Be Cool Scooby Doo has really soured me on Velma. Is it fair? No. Is it racist or misogynistic? Nope."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I’m tired of people getting mad at bad shows getting bad reviews and blaming it on review bombing. It stinks, get over it."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"""If you don't like it you're a racist turd""

And that's where your opinion became irrelevant."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"The only people that have the right to be bothered by review bombing are the creators. If you follow audience scores, that’s on you. They’ve always been terrible and will continue to be. By making this post, you are the one giving the “review bombers” power. I have no stakes in this show whatsoever but this applies to everything, and it also goes for things that are rated highly because of fanboys. User scores can’t be trusted. The average user of any service is an idiot.

EDIT: I turned the first episode on after posting this and what the fuck. The first joke is cockroach sex?"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Just addressing your edits in relation to the comments I've been reading in this thread: You are adding your own interpretation and meaning into comments that I just don't think are there. I'm mostly seeing responses that respectfully disagree with your post. 

I'm certainly not seeing many people that are so ""fragile that an animated minority teenager sends them into a frantic rage."" You seem more upset than the comments section."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,The show is absolute garbage they need to be shown that making shows like this is 100% a money losing situation so they stop making them.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Could it entirely be possible that a scooby doo show that does not include scooby doo would be a terrible idea?
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"It's the show that was already arguing like a drunk in a bar before it even launched right?

I can believe its terrible, its always been SCOOBY and the gang, without the dog the others are just some dudes and dudettes who ride around in a creepy van and trespass."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Ugh I’m beyond tired of this “if you don’t like this thing then you’re a questionable person” narrative. It’s lazy, reductive, and reeks of brittle egos that can’t handle that someone doesn’t like a thing they like. 

Secondly, when you’re summarily proven wrong that, no, it’s not just racists or whatever who don’t like the show, you fall back to “this isn’t supposed to be the peak of art, wHy iS eVeRyOnE bEiNG so SeRiOuS?”

Why can’t we just accept that some shows are just bad?"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I think shows like this are toxic. They try to promote themselves off outrage culture and thus throw insults out before the show is even made. They use minorities as a gimmick. They purposely create a heated online community in an attempt to get clicks, with no respect for the audience or if they are hurt by it

I fit the minority groups they are trying to appeal to, and I thought it looked bad from the trailer as well as the actual show.

In this case, they wrote, filmed, an animated a response to toxic racist man babies before the show was even announced. Clearly the intention is to stop you from judging the show based off very revealing trailers.

It's not review bombing to dislike a show. Reviewing bombing would be if one person gave it a thousand bad reviews, not if a thousand people dislike it. I find it a poor Imitation of what Harley Quinn does better and the showrunner hasn't been putting effort into her writing in a long time.

Plenty of reasons to dislike this show that uses a corporate brand name to boost an already dated satire. It's fine if you like it, but it's also fine for people to dislike it.

Edit: the ""review bombing"" is literally what they wanted. If you're a fan of the show, be happy it happened. I for one am bored of outrage culture shows"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"OP, get your schizo meds"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Reddit posts should have a rule similar to YouTube where they have to disclose whenever they're a paid opinion.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"What horseshit.  Even the delusional, woke critics hate this absolute garbage.  And they'll shill for any pathetic dogshit that comes out like that ridiculous fanfic rings of power ""show"""
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Or it could be the show is actual trash, not the fan base? Don’t try to defend this piece of shit."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I couldn't even get through the opening scene but it clearly isn't close to Harley Quinn in quality. 

All it had was one stupid meta joke after another and a complete butchering of the Scooby-Doo franchise. 

Legitimately looks like it could be one of the worst shows ever made but I'm not gonna watch enough of it to find out"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I'm sure there's some unethical negative reviews but I'm a little curious about your point of humor being subjective and maybe the show isn't for you? 

At face value that's fair, but are people not supposed to write a review if they didn't enjoy the show? That would remove all negative reviews and give a false impression of what the show is. Personally if I'm reading reviews to see if I want to watch something or not I'll read a few positive and a few negative to get both views."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Maybe it just sucks. I mean Norville and no Scooby-Doo, sounds like trash"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I just some how hate how Shaggy became an actual contemporary black sterotype
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I haven't read a positive review of this yet, and that's from professional reviewers, not the online chatterbox. Many reviewers explicitly state that it tries to be Harley Quinn but is *NOT* on that same level.

Review bombing it sight-unseen isn't cool, but neither is OP's post, with also doesn't seem to have anything to do with the actual show (urr, urr, it's subjective). 

Let's stop bashing AND caping for shows for reasons other than its quality."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I tried to watch the show, it was incredibly bad. Stopped at first episode, never gonna touch it again. I don't care about race swap as I'm a brown south asian myself. If the show is bad it gets bad audience review. Look at House of dragon and it's audience review for example."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"So... your point is that people aren't allowed to dislike something if you can find some arbitrary similarities between it and another show? I mean if people really could just copy some show that did well and be guaranteed it would do exactly as well, don't you think every show that comes out would all just be exactly that?

From the trailer it sounded like it was going to be lazy. Like you're pointing out, it sounds like they picked four or five specific points like ""this particular animation style"" and then just phoned in all the rest.

I don't think that you get to tell people ""you are forced to like this show by a brown person or you're just racist"". I think it's possible for someone to just make a bad show even if that person is subjected to prejudice.

And from your various edits... yeah... I don't respond well to anyone saying ""if you disagree with one of my opinions then you're just racist."" Racism is a real, actual problem in the world, and people like you cheapen it when you think you get to use it to justify how everyone always has to tell you that any random idea you have is genius. You are unhinged and need to calm down and take a step back from the internet, and come back when you're able to listen to people disagreeing with you, without assuming you're perfect and the only reason someone might think other than you do is that they are prejudiced."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"God bless the paint chip eating morons that *immediately* try to cry racism/bigotry/etc. should some poorly (and unnecessarily) “reimagined” take on an **already established** IP be a steaming pile of dogshit. Certainly it can’t be because production opted to try to check too many demographical “wokeness” boxes! It has to be because the viewers are close-minded idiots that don’t know what they’re talking about!

Edited to add: and to be clear, by no means is this take limited in any way to ‘Velma’— it applies to far too many tv/movie/game releases as of late."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Enough of defending  bad ratings for bad shows as “hatred”, “trolls”.

Had enough during She Hulk and now this"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I can't stand the argument of ""the characters are FICTIONAL so its ok to change their race, gender, height, sexuality, etc"". Its so disrespectful to the character.

If you want a Scooby Doo type show with an Indian woman lead then that's great I'm 100% on board with that.

You know what though? VELMA isn't indian. We know that because we've seen her in a million other shows and movies.

Instead of race swapping an existing character just create a new character and make them part of the Scooby gang. Problem solved, everyones happy.

Same thing with the Little Mermaid. I'm perfectly ok with a dark skinned/black mermaid. In fact didn't we see that in the original movie? Ariel is a red haired white girl. Just make the new Little Mermaid Its own character. Why is that such a problem?"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Not gonna lie watched the first episode and it's bad ill try to keep watching but it is no way on the same level as harley quinn (which is a good example of taking something well known and creating something that is both good and original)
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"They completely changed the characters. Shaggy doesn't look like shaggy and where tf is Scoob? This post is just writing off criticism of the show by misidentifying it as racism. Hope the downvotes wake you up, people don't like classic characters being changed and fucked with."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Sure sounds like you are the only one butthurt, it's a terrible show."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"every time a series comes out, and people instead of talking about captivating history or interesting characters, discuss about : racism, sexism, homophony... I know it's not worth watching"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Why can't you just accept a show people hate getting bad reviews? How much are they paying you?
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"The show is bad, tries way too hard to be hip, cool, and modern. This approach ruins some of the original magic, I mean Scooby-Doo isnt even in the damn show."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"The IMDB and RT score isn’t a little surprising, it’s expected when the show is absolute ass. Just because it’s receiving horrendous reviews isn’t a reflection of toxic fans, it’s a reflection of poor writing and woke politics being thrown in our faces. I have no issue with female leads and a diverse cast, what I do have an issue with is dreadful writing and treating your viewers like morons. This show is reaping what is deserves and the audience is becoming sick and tired of fictional media playing the political game. We want to be entertained not lectured about how racist and non-inclusive we apparently are. Enough is enough"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,2.6? Talk about review inflation should be a 1/10.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I highly doubt a contingent of Scooby-Doo fans are review bombing anything. This is just an expected negative reaction to a terriblele show.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,It’s just bad. They should focus more on actual show and make it interesting and funny instead of lame jokes and make this show as inclusive as possible.. ratings are deserved. Don’t waste your time.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"You can't just say 'these adult cartoons have a high rating so my show is entitled to one as well"""
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"It may objectively not be a TERRIBLE show but when you take a beloved nostalgia property and add more than a heaping of self indulgence and vanity project-ness to it, it's never going to be received well by audiences. Rightly or wrongly, it's seen as Mindy Kaling getting her Velma cosplay on.

I also think we've reached a saturation point when it comes to reboots/remakes/reinventions. People want to see new and original properties made for today, not reinvent or ""hippify"" old properties or characters."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I hate race swap regardless of the show, the character and the franchise and I'm a black person. But I've learned to live with that and I don't consider it a deal breaker so I still gave this show a chance. I don't usually laugh with comedies but I still enjoy watching them since they're perfect to kill time. But despite don't usually laugh I've never, never, when I say never I mean not once in my entire life I have been bored with one, this is the first time I had to push myself to watch the entire episode.

Velma and Shaggy being black is just a minor issue when it is compared to the show itself being bad, so I might have a problem with them swapping their race but the truth is that they could have been white, black, Asian or fucking horses and the show would still be a huge pile of garbage."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I liked the artistic design and the animation, but the show itself relies way too heavily on gross-out/cringe humor and every character is massively unlikable, even Velma who we're supposed to sympathize with despite her casual cruelty to Norville and flash backs that show here causing her mother's eye to dislodge from its socket. It feels like one of those mid 2000s animated sitcoms like Drawn Together or Brickleberry and I didn't care for those either. It's not the worst incarnation of the series as I had a harder time sitting through Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue and certain episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, but it's not good."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Here's my question: 

How do you know when it's ""review bombing"" or when something is just actually very bad and people are just loudly expressing that fact?"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Is this a joke?
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"So you had 3 points, but for 2 of them you say you can’t comment for differing reasons? So why even post? You contributed nothing and just end up looking like a WB bot. Yeah they’ve rebooted this show too many times, but does doing it again without the titular character actually help? Obviously not, that’s why no one likes this."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Idk it just doesn't look very good to me, but I also don't really care."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"That show backfired just like this post did 🤣🤣 I don't know if OP is being satirical or truthful but God I hope OP is not really that dumb 🤣🤣 the show is literally nothing but racist backlash on a society that is tired of these elitist anti white racist attacks. I mean let's be real you're an idiot if you don't see the Democrats are trying to start a race war by sowing animosity through these attacks knowing that black people will lose..  Democrats have always fought to keep black people in chains from the civil war all the way up until the civil Rights movement. Wake up people, racism in any form is unacceptable, and we are going backwards.. Stop being puppets and attacking each other.. Fight the real enemy causing this woke retardation: Politicians."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I watched about 5 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. It's not just bad, it's offensively bad. Judging by the sheer amount of negative responses, also saying it's bad, you've received, the ""review bombing"" seems to accurately reflect how people feel about the show."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Hey man it’s okay to enjoy shit shows. You like Velma that’s cool but it doesn’t change the fact that it is a complete and total dumpster. I feel insulted you compared it to the Harley Quinn cartoon show but that’s okay too. Opinions are like assholes everyone has one.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Wait what? it's absolute checkbox trash. it's GORY it's full of nudity, yet the jokes are written for toddlers. what kind of medication is required to enjoy this I can't imagine. When the synopsis makes fun of Fred for having a tiny pecker and assures you that will be a constant topic of conversation... I assume zero dollars were required to make this show? maybe that's the joke.

And you KNOW the critics bend over backwards to upvote every show they can that is politically where they want it, and only a 50% from critics lol. That is horrendously bad. Next you'll be telling us Blood Origins is a decent show? Misunderstood by the entire population of Earth?"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,False advertising. No dog.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Because it’s dogshit lmao. It’s a pathetic attempt at being “meta” and falls flat on its face into a sea of cringe.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I watched the first two episodes and was really looking forward to it. It's FUCKING. TERRIBLE.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"OP gets told they’re wrong and then attacks commenters lol 

“Am I out of touch? No it’s the children who are wrong!”"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"It is a really bad show. I watched the entire first episode and no more, even though I spent the next 15 minutes browsing the titles on different streaming services for something to watch. This despite watching all seasons of Never have I Ever which is another of Mindy’s shows and liking it"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Sometimes a bad show is just a bad show
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I think this show is subjectively awful
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Dude really? The show itself is overtly racist in horrible ways to most characters. The ""humor"" is actually just repulsive, the show was written with no love for the series it comes from, and it's just really off putting to most people.

Perhaps there are some bad actors review bombing just because of race swaps, but I'd argue anyone trying to excuse this trash fire is also a bad actor unwilling to understand why this show is so awful and off putting *to most people* probably because the characters were race swapped and some how something this terrible is supposed to be a win for poc.

This could of been literally anything else and it would have been received better and supported more by more people."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I watched Birdgirl and while it has a bit of cringe to it I thought it was several orders of magnitude funnier than this show. At the very least you can tell there is comedy competency behind the writing in Birdgirl, and any ""wokeness"" is at least self aware. There was an episode where a woman was erasing a guy's memories after sleeping with him and it was acknowledged in the show that that's still immoral AF even if it's a woman doing it. I don't think a ""hyper-woke"" show would have acknowledged that, they would've spun it as a victory against men or something. Velma is just a bad show with bad writing."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,I’m still trying to figure out how the Reddit hive mind thinks it’s ok to race swap white characters but if don’t want them to do that we’re racist. but it’s racist to race swap out non white characters. They should have just created a new ip if they were going to alter all the characters.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,The show is shit and I am allowed this opinion.
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"I don't care about the race of the characters or the switch to a more adult tone. Hell I don't even care that they call Shaggy Norville. Scooby Doo was always one of the worst cartoons on the air so I really couldn't give two shits about ""preserving the canon"" or whatever. 

So when I say I could barely sit through the first episode it's because of precisely one reason: It's the writing. The writing is bad. 

Saying the jokes are hit or miss is incredibly generous. It's a brand new show that feels dated. It has all of Kaling's worst writing habits put front and center with little to no self-awareness. 

If you're going to go meta and/or address social issues you need to avoid coming off as smug and /r/FellowKids material, and the show does both. I mean fuck, it takes a lot of bullshit to make me actively dislike something *I agree with.* But here we are. 

Having seen much of her work and read one of her books, I think it's fair to say that Kaling is best when she has other voices in the room to moderate some of her...less than stellar ideas. 

Tl;Dr: I don't give a shit about anything but the writing, and the writing is bad."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"You're about correct, it's ridiculous it's at 2.6/10. No person with half a brain cell would give it more that 1 at best lmao. And if you disagree with that you're a brainless turd!"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Aw shit here we go again
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,Why is it so hard for people to believe that the show actually sucks? So what if you like it… Most of us don’t. And it’s not because we’re racist or homophobe the writing was seriously lame. I can tell a lot of work and thought was put into the show and it still sucked it just shows what a lack of creativity and imagination the Showrunners have
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Its a bad show that no fan of scooby doo would ask for, its fine if you like it but that just means you have bad taste"
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,"Sure, just call everyone who dislikes the show racist."
Little Baby Bum: Nursery Rhyme Friends,">currently sitting at a 2.6/10 on IMDB

There are only 270 votes on imdb, if it doesn't bounce back from that then it's not a good show

After more people watch it then it will easily go back to where it deserves, unless very few people watch it"
Under the Black Moonlight,"Most of of Patrick Sommerville's (Maniac, Station Eleven) shows are really hard to describe, let alone market.  They depend almost entirely on word of mouth.  Particularly with Station Eleven, the marketing just made people mad because they didn't get anything like what they were expecting."
Under the Black Moonlight,this show is fantastic! i’ll be really disappointed if it doesn’t get a third season.
Under the Black Moonlight,"I can call you Mary. And Mary when you call me, you can call me Earl"
Under the Black Moonlight,"The name of the show is actually Call Me By Your Earl, common misconception."
Under the Black Moonlight,[deleted]
Under the Black Moonlight,Enjoyed season 1 but can't see myself following it past that. Can't explain it.
Under the Black Moonlight,Slow moving sci Fi is a hard sell
Under the Black Moonlight,"I only watched it for Cristina Miloti and she’s great in it but I can kind of see why people didn’t lose their mind over it and it didn’t get a lot of hype, the writing is very mundane and the concepts aren’t mind blowing or anything, it could be a lot better

I saw there was a second season, still need to check it out"
Under the Black Moonlight,"I’m always following this subs calendar of show coming out. Every time I saw Made for Love I thought it was another crappy reality show despite the fact I watched the first season and really enjoyed it. 
 
On top of the name there isn’t strong marketing or interview articles to get posted here to drive interest."
Under the Black Moonlight,"It’s one of my favourites,an interesting take on the human experience."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Honestly, I can only watch Cristina Milioti as a women in distress so many times"
Under the Black Moonlight,"I quit watching after a couple of episodes. The show wasn't bad at all, just fatigued by stories about gaslit women, I guess."
Under the Black Moonlight,I just finished season two. It was very good!
Under the Black Moonlight,This show is sooo bonkers it is great! So many different layers to it like peeling onion layers and finding a gumball inside.
Under the Black Moonlight,For me each new episode got harder and harder to follow. Can’t say I loved the whole Zelda thing either.
Under the Black Moonlight,"watched the first season, don't care for it. if this show appears to have gone under the radar, it is probably because a lot of the people who have watched it don't care for it either."
Under the Black Moonlight,"It's a good show, but it consistently has inconsistencies that can be jarring, and some truly unnecessary elements that don't serve the plot or add to the characters, but at the same time it does have some brilliant moments, so it's definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. 

Oh, and it does seem like it has good long term potential. IOW, it has a lot of room to get better (unless it gets cancelled before that happens)."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Maybe it's the name. I thought itvwas a housewife sitcome and it was a completely different show. 

It's kust awesome."
Under the Black Moonlight,I really like it! It’s strange and interesting at the same time. I like what they did with Byron’s character in season 2 and after the finale I really want to know what happens next!
Under the Black Moonlight,Watching the season 2 finale right now after a few episode binge! Great show.
Under the Black Moonlight,"I am honestly tired of the oppressed woman regaining freedom scenario, so no thanks"
Under the Black Moonlight,I really tried to enjoy it and watch it in the background and it’s not terrible by any means but woah boy it drags some times
Under the Black Moonlight,"My wife and I loved the first season so it is queued up. ~~But really Amazon sucks at marketing.~~ 

edit: my bad. Didn't realize it was just licensed in Canada to Prime."
Under the Black Moonlight,The reason I noped on it the first time was that it seemed like a rehash of her black mirror episode. Ended up loving it though.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Actually, I think the answer may partially be the lead actress: she has a rabid fanbase, from my understanding, but is not everyone's cup of tea, and that may prevent the show from getting more love. I know that's not the answer you are looking for."
Under the Black Moonlight,Thanks for the recommendation. I like the actress from Black Mirror. Will give it a try.
Under the Black Moonlight,"So, have you watched/heard of Severance?

If you like Made for Love, you’ll probably like Severance"
Under the Black Moonlight,The first season was good but the plot is not something that needs to be a second season. Especially considering the source material. Feels like its being carried by a bunch of 🤪 characters now.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Just cause you like it doesn’t make it good, it’s sitting at a 6.9 on imdb. An 8 or over is normally something you need to watch"
Under the Black Moonlight,Blame Ted Mosby.
Under the Black Moonlight,People are too busy jerking off to the latest Star Wars/Marvel show to pay attention to anything else.
Under the Black Moonlight,I watched like four or five eps and couldn’t get into it
Under the Black Moonlight,I want to give it a try because Cristin Milioti is great and should be a much bigger star but there's just so much to watch and so little time.
Under the Black Moonlight,I know I watched S1 and enjoined it but I barely remember anything about it. Hesitating on s2 cause I’m not sure if I need to rewatch s1 first. Glad to hear it’s good though
Under the Black Moonlight,The opening episode sort of put me off. I might try it again.
Under the Black Moonlight,It's on Amazon Prime in Canada. I have Crave and don't see it on that.
Under the Black Moonlight,Coz there’s 500 shows out this year.
Under the Black Moonlight,"It sounds kinda shitty, is all."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Every description of it just confused me, but people were enthusiastic, so I finally looked into it and saw the 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and started it yesterday. Finished and I'm rewatching the first season now."
Under the Black Moonlight,I loved Station Eleven but I am always hesitant to recommend it because it is so unusual.
Under the Black Moonlight,Station Eleven was marvelous.
Under the Black Moonlight,"damn, maniac is one of my favorites that Netflix has produced.  I'll definitely be checking out station eleven and made for love, thanks!"
Under the Black Moonlight,Damn I loved Station Eleven! I’m trying to think back to what the marketing even was—what did people think the show was about?
Under the Black Moonlight,"I liked Maniac, even if the ending was weak. Didn't realize he also did Station Eleven. i guess I should check it out."
Under the Black Moonlight,"> Particularly with Station Eleven, the marketing just made people mad because they didn't get anything like what they were expecting.

Station Eleven made me mad because I'd rather die of a deadly pandemic than have to spend my post-apocalyptic future with fucking *theater kids*."
Under the Black Moonlight,Station 11 was so damn good
Under the Black Moonlight,Is the season 2 out yet?
Under the Black Moonlight,"I'm disappointed that I didn't know there was a second season. I just went through this with another show, too. HBO needs to do a better job of letting me know these things!"
Under the Black Moonlight,"~~It got renewed!~~

apparently it has not been renewed nor has it been cancelled"
Under the Black Moonlight,Dooo do do do. Doo do do dodo.
Under the Black Moonlight,Probably *[My name is earl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460091/)*
Under the Black Moonlight,"S2 is actually even better, not more of the same."
Under the Black Moonlight,"I had the same experience with Master of None.

I watched the first season, really enjoyed it. Haven't watched more because more isn't needed for me. That season sated my interest in the characters and the story that I feel absolutely no need to continue watching."
Under the Black Moonlight,Yeah the show is a chore to watch and therefore I dropped it.  Well done and good premise but I just do not enjoy it.
Under the Black Moonlight,Season 2 is non-essential. It goes for more emotional beats but misses the mark every time.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Marketing is terrible 

and yes you are right, the name is AWFUL 

it sounds like a reality show! what were they thinking?"
Under the Black Moonlight,"Same. Didn't even finish the first season. Something about it just wasn't very entertaining, but I can't put my finger on exactly why it didn't work."
Under the Black Moonlight,"This sub thinks anything on HBO Max is incredible and perfect. Someone in another thread got upvoted for saying every HBO Max show is better than anything Netflix has ever made. Not just HBO. HBO *Max*.

IIRC they even mentioned The Flight Attendant by name. Which is a good show but hardly amazing, ""must watch"" TV."
Under the Black Moonlight,It's on HBO.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Cristin Milioti? I've a few things she was in but I really enjoy her, what kind of bad fans are we talking?"
Under the Black Moonlight,"eh, imdb is not the end all be all, ESPECAILLY for tv shows 

there are a ton of really shit tier shows above 8 on that website."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Imdb scores are wildly inaccurate and subject to brigading.

Look at He's Expecting, a Japanese drama about a man getting pregnant. The show is tepid and unmemorable, but I wouldn't say it's bad, just okay. Imdb users have review bombed it to 1.9(something about Elon Musk I don't actually know). 

The same logic applies to Rotten Tomatoes, ""good"" is universally subjective and everyone's tastes will vary. Besides, if you're only watching and liking the things you're told to watch and like, you may have a bigger issue you need to deal with."
Under the Black Moonlight,Well 94% on RT is good even if it’s average score of 7.2/10 is less impressive.
Under the Black Moonlight,yeah marvel/disney/star wars is like the herpes of the entertainment world
Under the Black Moonlight,And that is the correct answer.
Under the Black Moonlight,I have no less than 4 people who I recommended it to (and usually appreciate my recommendations) who either noped out of it in episode 1 because it dealt with a pandemic or in episode 2 because of the radical shift in tone. I don't know how to explain to them that it's worth sticking with.
Under the Black Moonlight,Who would have thought a tuba-only rendition of Midnight Train to Georgia would be so lovely? That stuck with me like the ending of The Good Place.
Under the Black Moonlight,Really?  It's an easy rec for me.  You must know some really stiff people.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Station Eleven was brilliant until the finale. The prophet guy just walking off into an happy ending with his mom and the 100+ kids he kidnapped was disgusting (and in the book he molested them). Kirsten also had a crappy ending. Yeah, she was finally reunited with Jeeven, but she learned nothing and just stays with the Peter Pan Syndrome and repressed trauma gang."
Under the Black Moonlight,And because it falls apart.
Under the Black Moonlight,"A lot of people were expecting either The Walking Dead or The Hunger Games because that's the only context they have for post-apocalyptic fiction.

The trailers didn't give the impression that it's anything like that but they didn't give any indication that it's a show about the importance  of art and found family in recovering from trauma either.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPm52rq8CZA"
Under the Black Moonlight,"I never even saw any marketing for it at all, I only watched it coz the book had been on my list for awhile"
Under the Black Moonlight,"Hah. I enjoyed Station Eleven but this made me laugh. I remember in some parts, specifically with the younger girl, Alex I believe, I was like, this is over the top and cringe. But then I remembered the theater kids from when I was young and thought, actually, this is spot on."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Sarah annoyed the shit out of me. Definitely reminded me of some of the more pretentious theater kids I knew in school, and since I was in choir I interacted with them a lot."
Under the Black Moonlight,Made for Love?  yes.
Under the Black Moonlight,Wow I watch HBO Max all the time and I’m upset I didn’t know until right now too
Under the Black Moonlight,Where have you read that? I can't find anything about it being renewed.
Under the Black Moonlight,"That's good to hear. I've been putting off watching it.

Now I only have 6 other shows to finish before I get to it."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Personally, I felt S2 was much weaker. Certain new aspects were interesting, but even then I saw it done better with Severance."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Season 2 is *really* good though, like it's a bit different than season one and has Aziz, the character, traveling trying to figure himself out. It also gave me an obsession with *Un anno d'amore.* A decent part of the season is him in Italy learning stuff. It's cool

I did not enjoy season 3 that much, just watch 2 lol."
Under the Black Moonlight,"That feeling is definitely spot on for Season 3, but S2 was excellent and very different than S1."
Under the Black Moonlight,It's based on the book with the same name. It is a bad name for a show though.
Under the Black Moonlight,I go on HBO Max damn near every day and I've never even heard of this show and I'm super intrigued now.
Under the Black Moonlight,"same, didn't finish first season even though in theory i should like it. the whole premise of the show seems ""smart"" but then the show is just some stupid raunchy slapstick. doesn't the dad marry a blow-up sex doll or something ? and that's a recurring plot point that gets featured repeatedly. just didn't care for it."
Under the Black Moonlight,"I'm with you. Saw the first episode. Felt like torture-pron. 

I really hate how that's become a genre that likes to masquerade as other genres."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Totally agree, it just wasn't entertaining"
Under the Black Moonlight,The Flight Attendant felt like the show dragged on for far too long.
Under the Black Moonlight,"Well that's weird since I watch it on Prime.

Under the Black Moonlight,Himym fans still hate her (for no good reason) but that’s actually how i discovered her and started wanting to watch more stuff she was in
Under the Black Moonlight,Tell me about it. Call Me Earl isn’t even on imdb. /s
Under the Black Moonlight,There’s always exceptions but it’s a rarity. Made for love wasn’t brigaded it’s just ok
Under the Black Moonlight,RT is trash for TV scores. It already had flaws with movie scores but their TV scores are useless. So many mediocre shows have 100% scores because of the way TV reviews work.
Under the Black Moonlight,I had the same issue with recommending The Leftovers. People go into it expecting a sci-fi show like The 4400 or a mystery to solve like Lost. It’s really neither.
Under the Black Moonlight,"It's an HBO prestige drama that just happens to be set before and after the collapse of society.  It's not really about that.  In recommending it, I stress the themes rather the content.  I also don't recommend it to anyone who would have zero interest in seeing a free production of Hamlet playing in a park next to their home."
Under the Black Moonlight,"Okay I gave up after episode one because I really liked it but episode two felt like an ode to theater kids lol, but I’ll take your advice and try it again. I really liked the first episode."
Under the Black Moonlight,Watched the whole thing and liked it but didn’t love it. The concept seemed better than the execution and I feel like I got my fill of the show with how season 1 ended
Under the Black Moonlight,I stayed for Lori Petty. Worth it.
Under the Black Moonlight,"To be fair, the traveling musical and whatnot didn’t totally do it for me. The best parts of the show IMO dealt with modern life"
Under the Black Moonlight,And the cover art too gives you absolutely nothing
Under the Black Moonlight,"Theater kid, hippie commune kid and first generation post-pan. 

It was also probably the first time the actor did anything on screen with an American accent.  Playing it a bit over the top might help disguise places where she struggled with it a bit.  There's one scene where she hits the word ""trauma"" really hard.  The vowel sounds on that one are pretty different from the British English pronunciation."

The Dream Job,I subscribe and unsubscribe constantly to multiple streaming services. It's extremely easy and very little work. I legitimately do not understand why more people don't do it. Sub when you want to watch something. Unsub when you don't. Save your money.
The Dream Job,">Is it worth maintaining a subscription?

Does anyone really need to ""maintain"" something that you can cancel and subscribe whenever you want?"
The Dream Job,"What drives me crazy is that Netflix won't sell the rights to shows they cancel, so they have no chance of ever getting a finale season or movie. 

When Santa Clarita Diet was cancelled, Drew Barrymore tried to buy the rights to make the show under her own production company that was ALREADY co-producing the show. Netflix told her to get lost."
The Dream Job,"Since they raised the price to $20/mo in Canada we started rotating streaming services. It's working out really well.  The kids are excited for new content every month, and they vote for what one we get each month.

The Dream Job,I like the korean shows.
The Dream Job,"At one point they had so much content that even when they didn’t have anything new to sell you they had enough old shit it was still being worth subscribed.  They were the one with the deepest library so they’d usually have some show or movie you’d like to watch.  Once that all got split up amongst a dozen services it just became another service you renew whenever it’s got enough new stuff piled up.

I don’t think they’re any worse than any other network though. They cancel shit I love because I love weird shit that not many other people love and so the shit I love is rarely popular enough to be renewed. If I held a grudge against every network that cancelled at least five or six shows I loved I would have no networks to go to.  Do I pray that someone invents a replicator so we live in a post scarcity society and art no longer needs to be profitable?  Hell yeah. Am I going to throw a hissy fit every time I’m reminded that still hasn’t happened?  Nah."
The Dream Job,"If you are cancelling Netflix because it cancelled some shows you like in favour of others, boy do I hope you’re not thinking the other services are any different...."
The Dream Job,You and I have similar taste. I could have done with more Sense8 and OA. Season 3 of OA would have been intriguing or gimmicky. Not sure.

The Dream Job,"Then.... Cancel it? Seriously, is it that difficult? If you find you miss it then resub, none of this is hard.

And lots of comedy specials, fun movies and other popular shows.  Of course there is a lot of dreck. But I'm keeping Netflix as my most watched streamer because I don't want the gems to go away."
The Dream Job,It’s so funny how you constantly see posts like this and then a week later everyone is watching and talking about the latest big Netflix show.
The Dream Job,Just get another subscription for a different service then switch back when the novelty is back.
The Dream Job,I'm still salty about Santa Clarita Diet.
The Dream Job,"Every other day people get together to circle jerk about the inevitable demise of Netflix when it is currently the only streaming service that is making a profit. There are plenty of shows, documentaries, mini-series, on Netflix that are critically acclaimed and well liked. And people who fall in love with a niche show with a TINY audience compared to the massive subscription base population of Netflix keep thinking that their love is enough to justify the continuation o a show that isn’t drawing a large enough audience. HBOMax just went on a cancelation spree. Netflix isn’t unique. In fact, HBO was worst because it has literally stopped shows during production. Disney biggest attention getting shows are mostly one offs that were not intended to be a long series. So they don’t have to worry about renewals. 

There are shows that are insanely popular with new seasons coming. There is diversity in shows these days. You don’t have to like everything. You can sign up and leave any streaming service you want easily. Why even ask this question?"
The Dream Job,"I find this entire situation hilarious. A thousand Redditors are going bonkers over the fact that Netflix cancelled 1899 and predicting the company is doomed because of it while the rest of the world happily watches Wednesday and Emily in Paris.

Not every piece of content created is catered towards you. Cancel your subscription and go outside."
The Dream Job,"I'm out. 1899 and Archive 81 were both compelling horror series that were barely advertised, did well anyway, and still got axed. Anything that fails to become a mega-hit like Stranger Things is at risk now."
The Dream Job,We ditched Netflix and use Hulu and Amazon Prime.
The Dream Job,"Even if you don't factor in dropped series, all the made for Netflix B movies aren't worth a subscription so I just dropped mine."
The Dream Job,"Netflix has been the one constant subscription I’ve had since, oh, 2010 or so. It’s also become the most expensive one I have. 

Once *Stranger Things* concludes, I’ll likely bring it out of rotation for a long time.

But with all the HBO Max shenanigans, I might just end up seeking alternative media altogether."
The Dream Job,"I’m so sick and tired of these posts. If you aren’t getting value, then cancel. Stop whining and looking for validation in your choices. Just choose what you want."
The Dream Job,you can leave...then go back. you're not married.
The Dream Job,"I think it's also partially the fault of the shows that are getting too cozy doing a cliffhanger as a means of viewer retention. Don't end your season on a cliffhanger if you haven't secured a next season. It's starting to feel like a really cheap tactic to hype up for a future season, when it's in fact the writers screwing us."
The Dream Job,"I don't really watch Netflix for their major English language shows. I do watch them when they're well-received which is rarely these days.

I mainly watch Netflix for their foreign language shows. Some of them are such gems, tbh. I don't get these varied selections of foreign language shows from other streaming services.

I still enjoyed US UK shows, but sometimes you need some kind of new flavours, so discovering good foreign language shows can be satisfying. Sometimes they suck, but with those many options, when I found good ones, they're really rewarding."
The Dream Job,"Maybe it's a ""kids these days"" thing but all this whining about shows being cancelled is so bizarre to me. Where does this attitude even come from? A platform or network that doesn't cancel shows and just lets them have as many seasons as they ""need"" to ""tell a full story"" *has never existed.*"
The Dream Job,I wish I understood this websites love for 1899. It was painfully slow and boring. Now Santa Clarita diet being cancelled is a fucking tragedy.
The Dream Job,"I refuse to maintain subscriptions for numerous streaming services. Instead I've taken to keeping a list of things I want to watch and what service they're streaming on. When I get a long enough list for a given streaming service I'll cancel my current service and sign up for the one with my list. When I've watched everything on my list I'll move to the next service.

This approach has some risk that content will expire on the platform before you watch it but it's worth it for me to be able to minimize my entertainment expenses"
The Dream Job,"There's still good *completed* shows on there, and I feel like people forget that part of the appeal of streaming services is the other, older stuff? Or that you can watch things you've never seen before just to see if you like it?

But yeah at this point I feel like Netflix is only good for November and December (Bake-off and their insane Christmas movies), you can just buy DVDs of most of their originals instead of maintaining a subscription."
The Dream Job,"> Is it worth maintaining a subscription?

Compared to what? 

Is there another streaming service that you think provides better entertainment for a lower price?

Or are you going to -- shudders -- read a *book!?*

I've got like 6 or 7 streaming services (if you include the ones from Korea and China) and personally I think Netflix provides the most value. For me the hard part is trying to find the stuff I like. Their website sucks balls, so you gotta find good Netflix shows using other websites (throwing darts would be more effective than their site)."
The Dream Job,"Same. They canceled some of my favorite shows. Punisher and Final Space for example. (and others)

They ruined The Witcher.

And they produced nonsense like Blood Origin and Resident Evil and others instead.

Stranger Things will end after season 5. Umbrella Academy is finished after S4.

There are still some nuggets of gold: Arcane, Sandman, Shadow and Bone.

But it's the first time that I consider unsubscribing."
The Dream Job,"just buy it month to month. get bored? lose it and ge Disney, or paramount, or discovery or one of the million other channels. 

just come back to it later when you've written a list of programmes to watch!"
The Dream Job,"I still find a lot of great content.

:shrugs:"
The Dream Job,"Cancel your subscription you weirdo, the fuck do I care?"
The Dream Job,"We cancel for about six months and then re-up for a month or two. No reason to pay $20/month for something you don't use/enjoy.  
The only subscription I keep is Hulu, but that's $2/month."
The Dream Job,"What the fuck happened with the real shows? Marco Polo? Narcos? Mindhunter? Why the real stuff gets the axe and the butchered franchises like the Witcher and death note get the extra effort? I don't really understand the thought process. Short term investments will erode everyone's interests. Netflix was doing classics now is delivering bland and dumb stories. It is time to cancel the subscription? Yes, it is. I don't know why I pay it. Routine I Guess."
The Dream Job,"I have been done with Netflix for almost 2 years now. I am with you OP. Canceling Sense8 was near the start of the decline, I was quite a fan of the show. Not giving Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitt it’s 5th season pissed me off too. After that it seemed they just cancelled every promising new series they made after a season or 2. I am surprised Stranger Things has lasted this long frankly. I about to start watching OA when I learned that it was being cancelled, didn’t bother even starting it after that. Couple this with the price increases and I was done."
The Dream Job,There are plenty of good shows on Netflix. You also don't need to be tied down to one subscription forever you can bounce around month to month or as you want to watch something.
The Dream Job,Seems to me like they’re fishing for another hit and not finding it? I agree that recent series have been underwhelming.
The Dream Job,Norsemen is hilarious
The Dream Job,I dont have anything to add other than say that i agree. It’s only needed for 1 month a year. Get rid
The Dream Job,"Adding my voice to those that disliked the cancelation of Sense8 and Santa Clarita Diet.  Both shows had a lot of life in them.  At least Sense8 had a finish, though it was far too rushed."
The Dream Job,"I always jump from one service to the next.  After a few months they get new shows or new films, once I'm done watching what I like, I stop paying (I use gift cards) and restart the account of another service who has more interesting choices.  

In the last few months I had Prime, now I'm gonna jump to Disney+.  If they don't want me to go, they need to have better stuff."
The Dream Job,After stranger things I’m going to bounce. I would have stuck around for Witcher but they are sinking that too. Not sure what else to maintain for.
The Dream Job,Why do you need us to justify netflix for you? if you dont enjoy it then theres your answer.
The Dream Job,"They don't seem to have a real plan. If they had been ending the stupid series that they were cancelling, they would have a nice catalogue of mini series that were good for short binging sessions. Now it's just a bunch of incomplete shows."
The Dream Job,I like the stand up comedy
The Dream Job,I think netflix seasons need to be 26 episodes long and finish the series by the first season.
The Dream Job,"Questionable taste in tv shows to begin with but sure, might as well cancel if you don’t find value in it

Not like you can’t sign up again if you want to watch something in the future"
The Dream Job,Tubi has heaps of cool movies.
The Dream Job,I'm also salty about The QA
The Dream Job,"I consistently watch kdramas.  Generally they're written to be wholly wrapped up within one season, and any cliffhangers or teasers for following series are not generally emotionally dissatisfying enough to make me really desperately want answers."
The Dream Job,"If you have any interest in their original series or films, you could easily binge them in one month. Maybe everyone should just do ""Netflix November""? 🤔"
The Dream Job,They still have Star Trek in the UK. Once that's gone I'll probably cancel matey.
The Dream Job,"Nothing wrong to cancel or change to a on demand month per mobth subscription, if you feel like it. Or cancel completly. I bet there is at least another streaming service with nany great shows, you didn't see before. Don't be blindly loyal to any company as costumer."
The Dream Job,"I'm still sad they cancelled Marco Polo, really liked that show."
The Dream Job,"I wanted to cancel last year but my kids still watch it so we just downgraded it to the lower tier non-4k plan. Painful thing is I do not think my kids have watched it since, they've pretty much moved 100% to Disney!"
The Dream Job,How much Netflix are you guys watching? I've never felt even remotely like I was running out of content to watch on there. My list just keeps getting longer and longer. More and more series come out and I dont even have time to catch up on what I was already planning to watch.
The Dream Job,"I’m close to unsubbing. At the very least, I see no point in just having the sub on a rolling basis.

Fuck Netflix"
The Dream Job,"I just stopped mine, because they have sreadily crept up a dollar here, dollar there and now it's $15 a month. They're getting too full of thrmselves"
The Dream Job,Soap2day
The Dream Job,Just sub once ever 3 to 6 months to catch up
The Dream Job,"No. Once Better Call Saul ended, my subscribtion ended as well"
The Dream Job,If you feel like you’re done then you’re done. Cancel. Go on with your life.
The Dream Job,"I will never forgive Netflix for cancelling Santa Clarita Diet. It had such a great cast and entertaining story, and if I recall correctly, every episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews on IMDB. Then they cancelled it on a cliffhanger."
The Dream Job,I wanted to watch this on Corn Cob TV but they cancelled it
The Dream Job,I think what OP is asking is is there anything good on Netflix that y’all are watching that they might miss out on by canceling. I don’t think they’re asking for philosophical help making this big decision.
The Dream Job,"I’ll be honest my Netflix subscription hinges on a bunch of Korean dramas and occasional new movies.

The reason why I like Asian dramas on Netflix is 
1. They’re usually planned for 1 season. So no abrupt endings or cliffhangers unlike 99% of the English content Netflix licences/produces then ultimately kills.
2. The occasional over-the-top soap opera acting that you just don’t get from Netflix’s English catalog.

Also limited series are a reliable watch. Knowing a story has a start-middle-end is appreciated."
The Dream Job,Netflix to me still has the most diverse programming.
The Dream Job,As soon as they stop service sharing between households I’m out.
The Dream Job,Find a hobby
The Dream Job,dude Sense8 and The OA were the type of bloat you’re complaining about lol
The Dream Job,"I'm going to bring the perspective of an old person to this.

I grew up during the golden age of network television.  That meant three networks plus PBS (which wasn't even operational all day long), and a couple of indie UHF stations, as I lived in a fairly major market area.

*Many* series never made it past a single season.  *Everyone's* favorite show would get cancelled eventually.

Eventually, syndication happened, but only shows with enough episodes got picked up, which meant that if something was short-lived, you *never saw it again*.

A season of TV *used* to be 13 weeks, so you had to invest time and effort to watch regularly.  It also meant you were mixing it up, because there were six other days of the week to find something to watch.

Netflix bingeing upended that, where you could now burn through a (shortened) 8-10 episode ""season"" in two or three days.  That meant that content that used to be produced continuously a month or even a week before airing was instead completed as a package.

For the producers of the content, what might have taken a year or more to produce is consumed by the public in a couple of weeks.  Even if the show is well-received and picked up for renewal, for the viewers, there's a huge gap while a *new* season is created.

Netflix and Amazon have both dabbled in stretching out shows in the old way, with a new episode released weekly, but *all those episodes* are already finished.  You can't make a new season in 8 weeks under that model.

Netflix created the circumstances that don't allow a show to build an audience over time; if it's not an immediate hit, it basically disappears into the abyss of suggested content (another problem network TV never had; there was about 24 hours of prime time content each week, not 20,000 titles to dig through).

For the amount of content available (even if a large chunk is unwatchable garbage), Netflix is still a pretty good value, but their preferred model for producing new content vs. the burn rate of watching it isn't sustainable.

Hulu, which tends to hew to the old network episodic model, while still offering a giant archive of 'reruns', tends not to be as spikey in terms of grabbing viewers with the latest hot commodity, but is more consistent with the offerings it does have."
The Dream Job,I just canceled mine. I join every 18 months for a month to watch breaking bad.
The Dream Job,I couldn't care less if a show is canceled or not. If that one season was good then you got something out of it. Move on and watch something else...
The Dream Job,"Netflix fuckin around, they are about to find out. The only reason my subscription has been running for so long is the long trail of password-borrowers that I don't want to look cheap in front of. Now I have an excuse to boot them all, and I'm not dropping to the lower tier, shit is getting turned off. My kids stream Disney 247, I watch YouTube, no one watches Netflix except all the olds..."
The Dream Job,Just cancel it for a month and see if you miss it. You wont. Streaming services don't have term commitments so it makes sense to cancel it if you see no value in it right now. You can always take it up again later for a month if there is something worthwhile on it again.
The Dream Job,10 points from saying “I couldn’t care less about” and not “I could care less”. That drives me nuts.
The Dream Job,"Netflix has limited content I want to watch anymore. I had the service from the days of DVDs but canceled a few years ago. Now I sign up for 6 months every other year and watch what I want, then cancel."
The Dream Job,"It’s $10 a month.

I tip more when I pick up the tab at breakfast with friends.

Is this really worth a thread?"
The Dream Job,An inventory of broken dreams? Omg so dramatic lol. Just pause your sub until you want to reactivate
The Dream Job,"I don’t quite understand these posts. It’s a monthly subscription with no fee to cancel or start again, that even for the lowest paid earner, is no more than 2 hours of work to pay for monthly.  Why the agonizing like you’re selling an old vehicle??"
The Dream Job,So sad about 1899. It was so intriguing and such a cliffhanger
The Dream Job,If I didn't have a VPN I would've canceled long ago. Licensed content seems to be good enough to warrant subscription for non-US Netflix users. Bear in mind I don't really bother with Netflix' original content to begin with
The Dream Job,"You’re not tied into a contract with them, so cancel anytime you want to and re-up later. Cycle through all the services one at a time if you want. Watch Apple TV for a month, then HBO Max, then Disney, then maybe go to Netflix again and binge whatever’s new since the last time you were there. None of these services reward loyalty points or discounts for maintaining an unbroken subscription."
The Dream Job,"They’re all rushing to be the worst right now it seems. Unless you have money to throw away or you get them for free or a large discount, I believe everyone should only subscribe to a couple streaming sites at at time and then rotate every couple months to a couple different streaming sites. That’s the way to get your money’s worth."
The Dream Job,"I dip back into Netflix for a month about once every 6 months or so. Takes a couple weeks to work through all the shit I ""missed"" and I find myself bored with it by the time the month's up (and half the shit I would have watched has already been canceled). Content wise, the quality's gone off a cliff over the past couple years, I find it pretty worthless. Apple TV+, Disney+, and Prime have blown past it in terms of quality of original programming."
The Dream Job,"This post made me very angry, Sense8 was a goddamn masterpiece.

Also yeah I cancelled a few years ago, after the cancelled Sense8, Santa Clarita Diet, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and GLOW. I know they're fairly niche things but I adored them.

All I've really missed out on in recent times were Arcane and The Witcher (lol) , so I just used the high seas for that."
The Dream Job,Cry me a river
The Dream Job,"Once the password share block comes to my region, I'm out."
The Dream Job,Paramount+ is a decent alternative.  Great if you are a Trekkie.
ID-0,"The name of the show makes it sound like a cringe 15 year old drama for young teens but it's more like Sex Education and Euphoria, so if you like those shows, give it a go."
ID-0,"I grew up loving the original, but the more I hear about this reboot/remake makes me want to stay as far away from it as possible.

Have any Aussie’s on here seen both?"
ID-0,"ah, so a cringe 17 years old drama for young teens.

jk"
ID-0,Hey I'm a 20 year old guy and I thought it was pretty solid.
ID-0,I enjoyed Peacemaker a lot.
ID-0,The Bear was very good. I binged it this week.
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,Severance & From are my favorite new series.

ID-0,I haven't watched much new stuff this year but I am enjoying Irma Vep and Our Flag Means Death. I was super excited to see Pachinko but i'm waiting to cycle out a streaming service before I get Apple TV+. I'm not going to pay for more than two at a time.
ID-0,"Peacemaker, can’t believe a show with John Cena as the lead is actually good"
ID-0,"Severance

Peacemaker

1883 (pretty sure it was 2022 but might be December can’t remember).

Slow horses

Haven’t watched too much new stuff I’m gonna have to check some of these out."
ID-0,"I think out of these I would have to say Pam and Tommy. Good actors and writing, I thought the subject matter would be pretty tasteless but they managed to do it in a way that works"
ID-0,"My favorites for this year so far are

The Bear

The Boys

The Staircase- This was far better than the description makes it seem.

Ms. Marvel

Winning Time

Severance

I am certain Better Call Saul would be at the top if I had seen it."
ID-0,Severance and The Bear are my favorite shows of the year so far.
ID-0,Bear is not in it?
ID-0,Slow horses
ID-0,"Recently just finished All of Us Are Dead….a 9.3? I mean to each his own, but that’s waaaaay too high lol. It had its moments and it ain’t really bad, but there’s a lot of stupidity in its writing that doesn’t justify that rating.

The first half was so slow and a lot could’ve been removed, characters doing the same dumb stuff again, and again, again. A lot of dropped and irrelevant plot lines."
ID-0,"I binged the terminal list yesterday, hoping it would get better but it never did. It wasn't a thinker at all, it was revenge porn sprinkled with product placement."
ID-0,"For All Mankind

Severance"
ID-0,"Have to admit that Pachinko and All of Us Are Dead would feature high up my list as well. Pachinko probably at the very top! 

Some great stuff I’ve watched that you have not mentioned incudes As We See It, Yellowjackets, The Gilded Age, Winning Time, The Dropout, WeCrashed, The King (Il Re), Night Sky, and Blocco 181.

I’ll admit to also quite enjoying My Dress Up Darling. I’ve not done a ton of new anime but it was the best of what I’ve seen this year for sure."
ID-0,I mean if we’re not talking new shows the best tv of the year by far is Better Call Saul and I don’t think there’s much of an argument for anything else
ID-0,"Best: Peacemaker, Tokyo Vice, Severance, Julia, Bang Bang Baby.
Worst: All of us are dead, Naomi, Pieces of her, Reacher, Bienvenidos a Eden."
ID-0,Obi-Wan is excellent
ID-0,"My 10 favorite new on-going shows of the year so far...

*The Bear*, *Julia*, *Our Flag Means Death*, *Pachinko*, *Peacemaker*, *Severance*, *Slow Horses*, *Somebody Somewhere*, *Tokyo Vice*, *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*"
ID-0,Peacemaker and Severance are my favorite new shows of this year so far.
ID-0,"Severance 
Better call saul
Stranger Things
Peacemaker 
The Boys"
ID-0,"Best: *The Old Man*

Worst: *God's Favorite Idiot*"
ID-0,"I disagree with ""All of Us are Dead."" The show's totally unwatchable. All characters are stupid. Sure, everyone is going to have one or two bad choices in a situation like that, but I've never seen this show do something with the zombie genre that's fresh.

The humor in ""Peacemaker"" surely beats everything else this year, but ""Doom Patrol"" had really funny short moments, too. I especially like that moment in the first episode of season 3 when Niles was ready to have threesome sex with the ghosts, but then he had to vanish before he could even unzip his pants. This is a terribly description, but if you saw that scene, you'll know. Sometimes, comedy is not about the lines the characters throw.

Another show I really loved watching was ""Paris Police 1900."" I am happy to know they're working on the second season.

I have yet to finish ""We Own This City"" and ""The Baby,"" but so far, the episodes I've watched are good."
ID-0,I tried to watch *Winning Time* but I could only get through one episode. All the editing and visual effects were just way too much. Combined with the actual players and coaches complaining about how fictionalized the story is made me decide to stop watching.
ID-0,"Winning time and the old man have gotten me excited for tv again, after a lull of being uninspired"
ID-0,"The Old Man, Shoresy, The Bear"
ID-0,From would probably be top of my list.
ID-0,same.
ID-0,That and Umbrella academy.
ID-0,"I just can't watch a show about a kitchen, can't think of a lamer setting / premise than that"
ID-0,Slow Horses is so good🙂 Tokyo Vice also.
ID-0,"‘From‘ is cool

like LOST plus “Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight” 

I’m just worried were going to get unanswered questions or canceled before an ending"
ID-0,"Definitely watching The Bear as soon as it drops on digital. 

Haven't seen a Marvel show since Wandavision, but might do Ms. Marvel."
ID-0,haven't seen it yet. will do.
ID-0,"haven't heard of this one. but eeeeeh, only think that's appealing to me here is Riley Keough."
ID-0,"We in S3 of For All Mankind, it's not a new show."
ID-0,">I’ve not done a ton of new anime

I've only seen one new anime, as you can see. Usually I would've seen a lot more but just didn't have the time to venture into that world. I'm literally clueless as to what the HOT anime were this past winter & spring seasons. I know Spy x Family, but I'm waiting on that one to complete its run before I watch it. 

&#x200B;

>Yellowjackets

I've actually seen it. I don't think I liked it as much as most seemed to though. It's like... a 7/10 for me maybe. That whole flashback-driven storytelling technique is something I've grown so tired of. 

As for the others, I've come across The Dropout, The Gilded Age and WeCrashed but just wasn't interested. Might still check out Winning Time. Literally never heard of the others, but amma google em. 

&#x200B;

>Have to admit that Pachinko and All of Us Are Dead would feature high up my list as well.  

Surprisingly I've seen a few comments from people who didn't like All of Us Are Dead, and I have soooo many questions because, *how could one not like that show!!* Lol. But it's cool."
ID-0,"I don't watch Star Wars so I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. But I thought this was the one I was seeing praises about 🤔.... or maybe it was another one, idk."
ID-0,"I've seen a few negative comments for All Of Us Are Dead now and I'm actually surprised? 

> All characters are stupid.

Elaborate? I mean the majority are teenagers (as this is a teen-drama at its core), but also, what *stupid decisions* did you think these characters made that was so outlandish? 

> I've never seen this show do something with the zombie genre that's fresh.

I'd say the 'asymptomatic zombies' is something new... but maybe *you* have seen it before? I don't know. This is also the first time I've seen a teen-drama get pushed into a zombie apocalyptic setting (as I even mentioned here in a [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/iecu9vy)). I also love the way it throws traditional kung-fu fight scenes in the mix."
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,"Good thing that we're getting a second season, hopefully that will give John Griffin the opportunity to plan the entire series. 

I was a bit worried about a cancellation since the show was on Epix, but I guess the ratings were probably good enough for them, also it doesn't hurt having The Russo Brothers as producers."
ID-0,"Watch the boys instead of all that marvel shit, the boys is peak tv"
ID-0,"So many new shows, its so hard to keep track haha. (main reason i follow this television reddit)"
ID-0,Oops! Thanks
ID-0,"The fact that you couldn’t understand how one could not like AOUAD even with its obvious flaws is very telling that you’re a fanboy. If you’re looking objectively, the complaints about it are very understandable and valid."
ID-0,"It's cool.  I'm 51 and grew up with all of the SW content.  We find a lot of the hate isn't from my generation.  Liking or not liking something means we are horrible people, or something like that, lol."
ID-0,They're getting downvoted because r/television seems to really hate the show. It really depends what subreddit you're in as far as how people are responding to it. r/StarWars seems to really like it.
ID-0,Who cares if people make negative comments about a show you like? It's not a personal attack so don't take it personally
ID-0,lol i do watch The Boys. its existence doesn't mean marvel shows can't be good or entertaining.
ID-0,yep-yup. tv time app does more for me than this sub nowadays tho. this sub doesn't talk about the hidden gems like it once used to.
ID-0,"what obvious flaws though? 😕 elaborate? 

also... ""*fanboy*"" of what exactly? the zombie subgenre? 😆"
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,Yeah you have to dig way too hard for those indeed.
ID-0,"fanboy of the show, wasnt that obvious? lmaooo. disregarding and blind of its bad qualities just because you love it

characters repeating shitty decisions and actions, uneven writing, plotholes - im pretty sure most people that said the show sucked had written down their valid reasons but i doubt you'll understand them ""because you cannot understand how anyone could not like it"" right?"
ID-0,You're throwing a tantrum because someone said that a tv show about a kitchen is a lame idea for a tv show.
ID-0,"> i doubt you'll understand them ""because you cannot understand how anyone could not like it"" right?

I get the feeling you're taking that statement way too seriously man 😅. I put ""lol"" behind it for a reason. It was an exaggeration, I kno ppl gon like/dislike what they wanna, I'm just surprised that's all. 

> uneven writing, plotholes

That's the thing tho... I don't see it. That's why I've asked 2 times in this thread now for specific scenarios/scenes where this is the case (but got             nothing). Where exactly in this are these plotholes or ""*uneven writing*"" as you said?

> characters repeating shitty decisions and actions

I kinda frown upon the '*these characters make stupid decisions*' criticism for TV shows in general. Like... people make stupid decisions! A lot of times characters making stupid decisions is what makes them all the more humane (*sometimes all the more relatable*). And... it's not like there are any characters here that are established as ""*smart*"" and would be the ones to make wit decisions in this kind of situation. 

Also, it's funny you use the word ""repeat"", because in most cases characters repeating the same thing over and over again is something I'd criticize, but in this series, I don't recall any characters being in a position where they have a choice *but to*. 

The kids have to go from one classroom to another until they reach the roof because they don't have a choice. Going outside would be much riskier, zombies are everywhere. When they eventually do, it's also because they are left with no other choice.

The cop and the other dude have to run through a city full of zombies hopping from vehicle to vehicle and building to building, because they don't have a choice. They have vital information which may be the key to all of this. 

On-jo firefighter dad leaves the safe zone to go save his daughter because his love for her doesn't leave him with a choice, even when not knowing if she's alive or dead. etc. 

You get the point... no one has a choice here besides doing what they think they must in their given situation... well, besides that fucking asymptomatic maniac who's trying to kill cheong-san. lol.

> disregarding and blind of its bad qualities just because you love it

bruh, if whatever ""bad qualities"" you found in this were that damning I wouldn't love it at all. Do you know who you're talkin' to? I fuckin' hate everything. lol."

ID-0,"It's not a discussion about the show, it's just you complaining that someone criticized it"
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,"Exactly. That's why I said ""It's not a discussion about the show, it's just you complaining that someone criticized it""

Now is your tantrum over or you gonna keep whining ?"
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,Blah blah blah more whining. You just want to argue for the sake of arguing
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,"If you want to discuss the show, great, please enlighten me about why a tv show about a kitchen is anything but lame. If you just want to whine about nothing then that's fine too, you do you"
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,"Exactly, hence you're just complaining about nothing. It's a lame / boring idea for a show and you know it"

ID-0,"I mean yes. Most of the shows you listed are pretty average to bad and I don’t see any of the excellent TV listed from this past year:

Succession

The White Lotus

Black Bird

The Old Man

Slow Horses

Severance 

Bad Sisters

Five Days at Memorial

The Offer

Try those out, you won’t be disappointed."
ID-0,I'm rewatching The Deuce in the absence of anything good that's new.
ID-0,"This is or... *was* suppose to be the update for my [winter-spring compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).   
  
I think I'm gonna go back to making single posts for each review, because I've realized writing a review right after I watch a show might've given me motivation to watch a lot of these shows in the first place.  
  
Anyways, recommendations are welcome as to what 2022 show I should watch and review next, cuz I don't even know what the fuck is happening anymore (*don't be obvious tho lol*)."
ID-0,I've already lost it years ago. [In the late 00s](https://i.imgur.com/yv9nc8Q.png) used to watch close to 30 series a week [now I barely watch 2-3.](https://i.imgur.com/rb3Ab80.png)
ID-0,"Recently watched Slow Horses and Severance, both slapped."
ID-0,goddamn. how's the new season of Archer tho?
ID-0,Still decent. Not as good as the early seasons though.
ID-0,I think it speaks to Max Greenfield more than anything else. They’ve spoken in multiple interviews about how Schmidt was initially written to just be this giant douche but how Max brought a real vulnerability to him that made him so much more likable.
ID-0,"There’s a really great closing credits scene in the first season with a bunch of one-liners from Schmidt - *Nick, have you seen my other time piece?* and *Dammit! I can’t find my driving moccasins ANYWHERE!* - that I think was the moment I fell in love with the show."
ID-0,"Schmidt had amazing development from just a douche to an extremely adorable and friendly guy.

“Someone’s hitting our house! Are you the criminals? From the statistics??”"
ID-0,"""Ma called! The bees are back!""

One of my favorite moments of any show ever. 

I'm not even sure Schmidt was the best character. I change my mind every time I watch an episode. The main characters are all fantastic. Winston's inability to modulate his pranks is one of my favorite running gags ever."
ID-0,My wife and I love the way he yells everyone’s names lmao. He puts emphasis on such weird parts of words when he yells it’s great. We also occasionally yell “ALL DAY!” at each other when we’re goofing around. Definitely became my favorite character after a couple rewatches.
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,You look like Mick Mouse
ID-0,I feel the same way about Winston
ID-0,"My fave Schmidt scene is when he White Fangs Cece. Its so damn funny and sad and sweet and stupid.

https://youtu.be/axvkYXFt6Vs"
ID-0,"My absolute fav moments of schmidt was him losing all composure looking for a spider. [Clip 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScSPnDCiIAQ). [Clip 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooGhcY_k_9c).

Watching him, the whole episode looking for the spider to cumulate to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS2iD2BduY) was worth it. Laughed so hard i started crying.

Edit: oh and that he doesn't know how to do [laundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he4DGbrbvbM) haha"
ID-0,I don’t know what it is but the way Winston tells everyone he’s naming his son Dan-Bill just fucking kills me every time
ID-0,"Schmidt's interrogation of Winston and Ronda about what is and isn't a prank is my top 5 favorite moments of television ever.

""And then I took you to my accountant's office, and sitting behind the desk was just a little crab in sunglasses."""
ID-0,"Schmidt wasn't even the most lovable character in New Girl.

Winston's right there. Winnie The Bish, Prank Sinatra, Theodore K Mullins. The man for every season, ready for another classic Mess Around."
ID-0,The Zooey Deschenal series where every other character was more interesting and outshone Zooey Deschenal.
ID-0,I remember thinking the show had run out of new gags towards the end until the episode where they revealed Schmidt's real first name. That was such an amazingly well deployed joke. I wonder how long they were saving that after they came up with it.
ID-0,[deleted]
ID-0,"New Girl is great in general but Nick is the best character by far. The cookie scene is all him. They also have him a lot of scenes where he just plays off of himself or Tran (a mute character mostly) and it works. 

That’s not to say Schmidt isn’t a fun character. Just think Nick worked paired with anyone on that show."
ID-0,We built this Schmitty on tootsieee rollsss…
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,We should thank the Elders of the Internet for that. All that piracy of British shows was only possible thanks to their now decades old watch over that little black box.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Thanks to PBS I managed to see so many great British shows as a kid that I never would've known or had access to here in the states.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Toast of London anyone?
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I've downloaded Peep Show so I don't have to depend on the whims of some streaming service to carry it every few months. It's one of my favorite shows to rewatch.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"> easily accessible 

shoutout to all the dudes just uploading the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared show to YouTube"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"This is when it got me, early online “access” days… Skins, Hotel Babylon, Life on Mars and later Luther."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,BBC Sherlock was torrented and consumed in the US right when it was being released in the UK. No idea why PBS waited until May to broadcast it. Outdated business practices?
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"For anyone who hasn't seen it, I strongly recommend Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister as a follow it. 

Horribly relevant for today, but excellent writing, acting and casting all round."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Making the iPlayer a subscription service outside of the UK would be good way to support the BBC since the license fee has been frozen.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I find it interesting that in the UK Seinfeld wasn't nearly as popular as it was in the US and Oz, whereas in Australia it's been in continuous syndication almost every day, either on free-to-air or pay TV (or now streaming) since it originally aired over 30 years ago (that's even more than the US who had to wait for it to return to Netflix). But in the US they didn't get shows like Blackadder etc so they didn't know who Rowan Atkinson was and only knew him as Mr Bean, yet in Australia Rowan Atkinson was a household name because we got loads of British TV too.

Between the two of you, I think Australia got the best of both worlds."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Can confirm this with my obsession over The Great British Bake Off
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"From the bits of British (and European in general) tv shows I have watched, they absolutely do at least a couple of genres better than we do over here in the US. Their crime drama genre, for example, comes to mind right away. I also appreciate that the shows I've watched of theirs anyway don't drag on and on. They tell their story and get out. It makes for better art."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I love panel shows.  I'm not sure why those haven't taken off over here in the US.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I'll raise my hand here. Prior to loads of stuff being on streaming, I pirated lots of British TV that wasn't available here. The days before that, I used to set an alarm for like 3:30 AM because it was the only time Red Dwarf aired in the US."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"decent article but the failure to mention 'Peep Show' and Usenet is shameful....'Peep Show' is arguably the best britcom in history and folks had been using Usenet to pirate media for years before BT became popular. Also a shoutout to IRC, FTPs, Direct Connect, hell even edonkey would have been nice to see.

&#x200B;

also - Alan Partridge, Inbetweeners, Lead Balloon, Phoenix Nights etc etc etc etc"

Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Yeah watching British top gear on streaming sites back then was great kinda miss it.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Bring on QI T series
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Haven't seen it mentioned yet, but 'Still Game' is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. When it first came out it was only shown in Scotland. You can find all of it on Netflix and most of it on Youtube now though."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I will never forgive them for taking Peep Show from me. It's been a staple for me since college when I could finally find the whole show on hulu without pirating it.

Time to don the black hat of piracy once again, I guess."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Spaced and the UK Office were huge entry points for me into British comedy.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"My PBS station used to have hours and hours of Doctor Who (3rd-6th, mostly), Blake's 7, and Red Dwarf marathons. I think they had Fawlty Towers and Black Adder, too."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Matt berry is everything! Also British panel shows are absolutely hilarious.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"It's alright.

We pirate American TV just as much"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Then why did you guys fuck up taskmaster so badly!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Gotta say I was still a teenager when top gear was running, and to me and my friends it was the best thing on tv."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I started with my local public broadcaster doing British tv in the early 90s. Thanks VPB! I found Red Dwarf at a tender age and never looked back;)
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Thank you Brits for Taskmaster
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,None of you fupping baxtards have mentioned Father Ted and I'm going to go Jack Hackett when someone takes his liquor on your asses
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Um… how is nobody mentioning Top Gear?  It spun off multiple versions around the world which were nearly all flops until Jeremy was fired and then Amazon picked them up for The Grand Tour.

I know so many non-car people that loved that show because it was basically 3 guys, who you genuinely believed were friends, just goofing off."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I like British TV because they do more period dramas which are my jam. They already have sets and filming locations for a bajillion Austen adaptations so they crank them out. Reminds me of South Korea having a permanent set for Joseon-era dramas that fans can even go and visit lol.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Me: “New American show? Nah, I’m going to watch The IT Crowd again.” - I am American."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I have thoroughly enjoyed many British shows as an American
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I bet there are hardly any Americans watching Countdown, or Coronation St.

[This old screen wipe video comes to mind.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aGjnJ1ndI3g)"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Sometimes I really don’t understand why they make an American version of a UK show. Is the US version of Ghosts any different or better than the British version? 
That being said, I enjoyed the US version of The Office more. After the first season it was a completely different vibe/style of comedy than the UK Office so I don’t really see them as comparable."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,We even have a local PBS station dedicated to UK programming.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Want to pic one of these but not sure.   Which do you prefer more…. Acorn TV or BritBox
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Basil!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Thanks to piracy, I've bought MANY British series and movies that I never would have discovered or gotten into without it.

With streaming, I've been able to hold off on that somewhat since they carry so many things I enjoy now."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,The still game and IT crowd are awesome
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"It’s true, I do! It’s so pleasant and their comedic timing is just different."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I used to like British tv a lot. Back when dr who, Luther, broadchurch and Sherlock were all running. The bbc was killin it"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"My love for British TV started long before the age of piracy. My local PBS station would play Britcom on Saturday nights and I'd watch it all the time. Are You Being Served, Last of the Summer Wine, Keeping Up Appearances, and Red Dwarf were just a couple of the 

Then there was Mystery, which had Jeremy Brett's amazing Sherlock Holmes and David Suchet's brilliant Poirot among many other great British crime dramas."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"The UK is one of the few countries that produces television in English.   Other foreign TV is available, but not with English subtitles.  Kdramas are so popular because you can get English subs for almost every show produced in S. Korea.  Japan has some interesting looking live action TV, but only about 30% has English subs and those subs are usually fan made."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"They have really great comedies. Monty Python, keeping up appearances, loved Wallace and gromit as a kid and still do today, big train is hilarious, spaced, it crowd, garth marenghi's darkplace uhhh others"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I loved Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes back in the day.  So happy they are on Britbox!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Oi, Brent. Is all you care about chasing the Yankee dollar?"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Taskmaster!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,To be honest BBC news is better. American news is all talking heads instead of actual information.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,We are not American but Argentinean and have watched series 1 to 10 of *Doctor Who*. Also all of Poirot and now are watching *The Outlaws*.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I want more seasons of the windsors.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I remember gradually taping all of Red Dwarf as it aired on late night pbs. Those old VHS tapes got totally worn out through constant rewatches, God I love those smegheads"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I actually really enjoy watching Australian stuff. My favorite so far has been Mr Inbetween.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"As an American soldier deployed with the Brits in Afghanistan, their BBC channel would constantly play reruns of America TV shows from the 80s and 90s."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown was my intro into this and I love it. The quickness of the jokes and comebacks is refreshing. I mostly just watch highlights on YouTube but it works for me.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I blame my love for British tv on Luther.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,They love it but also constantly try to remake it in ways that completely miss the point of the original.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Oh and **This Is Going to Hurt** was amazing, but barely any word of it here. I'm just happy it's available to stream and it doesn't take long to get here. That's gotten better.

If you want to stream old titles like State of Play forget  about it."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"My local PBS channel growing up (KERA in Dallas) was a pioneer in showing British shows so they have always been a part of my life.   Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder, Yes Minister, etc.  What a treasure trove if you have somehow overlooked these shows."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"All the US writers in those years were following the same formulas.

British drama didn't follow those formulas. 

So many pointless love triangles in US TV back then."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Guys, here’s a new one for you….Cunk on Earth
It’s on BBC over here 🤟"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Piracy!? You just had to watch your local PBS station late at night. Red dwarf, fawlty towers, are you being served…"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Please just make it easy to officially watch shows like Taskmaster, Would I Lie To You, and Cats Does Countdown…"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I’m old Greg!!!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Please watch The Thick of It - it’s basically what Veep was ripped off of. Absolutely genius
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I can confirm this American watches a lot of  British TV on Britbox. Shetland is so good. And many more also on PBS. Plus I have family in Northern England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 so I ask them what they enjoy watching as well. Cheers
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I will die on this hill that The Big Fat Quiz of Everything is better than anything, yes anything, that we have on TV. 8 out of 10 Cats is also great. 

I think a lot of it is the appreciation of dry comedy."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"well, yeah. common language and all that, don't have to wait for fansubs

Imagine the bulk of it was just Blackadder, Doctor Who, and Red Dwarf"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Every year, more and more people get it when I say “don’t mention the war”"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"My latest YouTube obsession is “8 Out of Ten Cats Does Countdown” with my current celebrity crush Rachel Riley. It’s hilarious with Jimmy Carr, Sean Locke, Jon Richardson and company."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Too bad a lot of Americans don't seem to be into our greatest genre of television - comedy. A lot of classics they're sleeping on.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Blackbooks. If you like Father Ted and IT Crowd, Blackbooks is for you…

Spaced, too. And Coupling (prefer it to US Friends)…"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I am one of these Americans. I cannot get enough. I used to have to rely on PBS but now I have so much more on Britbox and Acorn tv.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"The king of all television shows to be illegally imported to America is Trailer Park Boys, not to knock Dr. Who, or anything British, but thanks to SurfTheChannel and TVlinks it was the most popular comedy show that nobody had any legal way to watch for over half a decade. I dont think we could even get the DVDs until after season 4. 

It's so oversaturated in our culture now that it's hard to imagine there was a time when TPB was spread completely by word of mouth, and it was a hard sell too, because the title made it seem like another TLC white trash reality show, ""no no it's about a trailer park somewhere in Canada, just watch one episode"", then getting the ole flip phone out and texting [Surfthechannel.net](https://Surfthechannel.net) to the person so they could watch it"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"As a Brit, I know a lot of Americans who watch more of our stuff than I do. Infact I don’t know if I could point to a single British show I watch. American sitcoms, dramas etc. just feel more available and buzzworthy on the apps I use."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"I don't think the US loves British TV. It's more intermingled now than it used to be, but very few British shows ever made it to the US commercial networks that had substantial audiences. The public television ""hits"" from the UK - Monty Python, Upstairs Downstairs, etc. - had relatively small audiences in the US."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Americn style TV is now just about being loud, aggravating, over stimulating, anger and anxiety inducing, with aggressively fast non stop edits, and its  super dumbed down. Its not pleasant to watch. 
Most people don’t even notice because they never step away from it long enough too but they know there is something more relaxing and positive about shows like the British bake off. Watch the American version and its unwatchable because everything positive is removed and its back to aggressive loud non stop anxiety to carry you to the commercials."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"We do t need to steal UK TV - there loads of it available on multiple platforms.
I’ll just leave this here - Toast Of London"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,something something Top Gear
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Personally, I have to turn on the subtitles when people are speaking with a British accent. And I don’t get/like British humor. And I feel like there’s a much larger culture gap than some would have you believe. There are always cultural references, or even just the use of certain words, that goes over my head."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Alternate title: The U.S. Loves Stealing British TV
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Mr Bean was my introduction to British TV but UK Top Gear made me a fan for life!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Is the peaky blinders on that list?!
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Wow nobody mentions Top Gear? The seasons with Jeremy Clarkson and the gang was at one point the most watched show around the world.

The current iteration actually is very good as well finally with a cast that has chemistry."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,I watch british / australian tv to avoid the US politics being JAMMED down my throat.
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"lol what? Sorry but BS. This trend started with BBC America showing new Doctor Who, and then Orphan Black, but Chibi put a headshot in that phenomenon and now the only popular ""british shows"" taking America by storm are American remakes like ""Ghosts.""   
At the moment there isn't a damn thing worth pirating on the BBC."
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,Well that’s a lie lol. Uk tv is extremely boring. Aside from top gear. But they managed to fuck that up too
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"All the shows I watch and love are bbc 
The musketeers, call the midwife, the split 
I don’t think there are any American shoes like those"
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,It’s just Ghosts
Love for Ten: Generation of Youth,"Being in Australia we saw both worlds. Watching  *Soap* to *The Goodies*.; *Johnny Carson* to *Not the Nine O’clock News*

Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,[deleted]
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Great show but the last season is pretty bad.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I look at the original Justified TV show on wiki and it says the ratings are only about 2 million but it seems to be very popular. Why the low ratings ? And does such ratings justify a revival?
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I hope they add Justified even in Europe to Disney+ alongside The Americans and Sons of Anarchy. (or Man Seeking Woman). But I am really looking forward to this one.

Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"eh, that's nothing really out of the ordinary for a show on cable tv these days. everyone here (rightly) loves Better Call Saul and that averaged barely above 1 million viewers in its final season. those numbers don't factor in people watching shows on streaming services or whatever"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"""Well if I had that kind of money I would be in Mexico.""

""Boyd, I've been to Mexico and I don't think you'd like it...""

""And how's that?""

""Because there are a lot of Mexicans."""
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"My friend. 

You’re in for an amazing finish. 

And rejoice cuz some of us have felt it’s absence for so so many years. 

Now it comes back and he’s finally gonna deal with Detroit and the villain they cast is Boyd Holbrook and Tarantino producing it from an amazing source book. 

I have missed Raylan for so so long. 

He’s Dixie Batman, his rogue gallery is almost as good as Bruce’s."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Yes, but it is one off miniseries, I would love more seasons."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"> Daisy Jones 

never heard of it, thanks for the tip

looking it up seems like a smaller role though"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Its crazy for the longest time you couldn’t find it in any major streaming site same as The Americans. That why I think both shows became a bit forgotten about.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"oh we dont have hulu in nz so hopefully it comes on d+ here (although tbh it could be on there already and i just haven't checked yet, but if not hope it does)"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"It's not Disney owned show. It's made by Sony, for FX."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,You can get Disney+ for $2.99 if you have Hulu.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I havent seen the show in quite some time. I just mean that every season is a new baddie that raylan has to get
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"It starts off as a case of the week, procedural before slowly switching to a more serialized arc.   I always figured it was always intended to be more serialized but they had to ease into it to get everyone on board."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I believe Tim said in an interview never say never about them doing more in the future. I think he's always open to it anyway.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Haven’t watched yet, too bad :( I’ll just continue along through season 4 of my justified rewatch."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"i know The Americans was on Amazon Prime for a pretty long time until recently moving to Hulu. i *think* that might've been the case for Justified, too"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,You’re right. I meant that Disney had the license for streaming and didn't clarify my original comment after the edit.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Disney owns FX
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,That's more than zero dollars.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Well, considering the main character is a LEO then what else could the show be about?"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,It was. Both were on Prime for a few years before switching to Hulu.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Yeah I know. But Sony is the official distributor of that show. They make it for FX but at the end of the day, they hold international rights for the show. Looks like a licensing deal between Disney and Sony is allowing this show to be streamed on Disney+ in Canada. Justified has been licensed to Prime Video where I live."

Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"There have been several subreddits for 'Julia', unfortunately fans of the show are prone to infighting, and aggressively argue and bicker among themselves.

'Julia' related drama spread to other subreddits and almost caused the collapse of Reddit. In some neighborhoods of Pasadena, fans of the show met for the purpose of fighting each other.

This incident known as the 'David Hyde Pierce - Tom Hollander battle of Oak Knoll' led to the destruction of property in Oak Knoll and several fans of the show ended up in hospital. 

Both actors tried to defuse the situation and appealed to their respective fans to not take to the streets, but to little effect.

Finally, Sarah Lancashire appealed to fans of the show to calm down and that seemed to work.

But for a while every 'Julia' subreddit was banned because fans of the show endangered public safety."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I watched this show earlier this year and swore there was a subreddit for it? I remember reading episode discussion threads but now I can’t seem to find it
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Natalia Temesgen was my professor at CSU. I’m so happy for her!
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,When's S2 dropping?
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Don't let Zaslav know this show exists or he'll ship it off to pluto TV or whatever
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Thank god free torrents with correct subtitles exist
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,This is some copypasta material that I'm saving for future usage.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I blame the butter
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"i cant tell if this is real, top shelf internet lore if true"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Not sure it needs its own sub, are there that many fans of a hypothetical Julia-verse? I liked the show but idk why we'd need a dedicated sub for it."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Disney's $3 billion cut into Marvel programming seems more significant.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Paramount and peak TV in the same headline.. interesting
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Any time a company destroys IP for a tax write off, that IP should immediately become public domain.

Fuck this fake ""loss"" by willfully deleting shit."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"All these streaming services take hits overseas and merger with other sites. They then claim they lost too much and raise prices on the only place dumb enough to keep paying, yep us here in the USA. Drop them like its hot tons of free options"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"The article reads more like a obituary than getting excited for anything on Paramount+Showtime.

It's say it will unlikely bring in new subscribers and risk turning the ones away.

Even goes on to say they want to resurrect dead shows and make them into franchise, instead of trying to take risks.

Showtime was stupid to gut those shows and should had tried to promote them.

Anyways the article basically saying Paramount+Showtime is playing it safe.

I have 2 more days in my subscription and I'm cancelling it. Literally nothing is worth the price on there for me."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"I can assume that we will have something around only 2 shows per month (new  shows or new seasons) in the vast majority of streams.  I imagine 24 ""big"" shows is a limit for them.  I used quotes around ""big"" because they aren't necessarily good shows, most being unoriginal (a prequel, a sequel, a franchise; oh god I hate franchises right now)."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,paramount has like 15 subscribers
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,As a fan of Star Trek and Yellowstone I have no problems with this.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Paramount Global is everything that is wrong with the super mega corps. If it were several (maybe 10) smaller companies, they could all be successful and produce slow and steady growth for shareholders. Those companies could actually employ many, many more people who could afford to subscribe to even more individual media platforms."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Interesting
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Half of the $1.5 billion write down is folding Showtime into Paramount. So it looks like they've have a couple hundred million in programming, but the majority of the savings seems to be coming from integrating staff and budgets from Showtime. 

Not sure about Disney but I'd guess some of that number might be from an anticipated combination of Hulu and Disney as well."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,They were not actually making a profit from Disney+. What is making them the money are the parks.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Also didn't help that Phase 4 didn't make any money for them and phase 5 is looking to be worse.  
The only movie that made a real profit is Spider-Man and they only get 25% of the profit as the rest goes to Sony, and this will repeat for the next Spidey movie."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Hey if you spent your whole life watching procedural bullshit on the networks I could understand why a boomer would think Yellowstone is prestige television.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Peak TV means quantity, not quality.  The very fact that paramount has a streaming service is emblematic of peak TV."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Not public domain, it’s rights should immediately revert to the creators, who then get to do with it as they please."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,[deleted]
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"They’ve already started the process of taking movies and turning them into series there’s a pink ladies grease spin-off series coming I think fatal attraction , the Italian job and flash dance are all in some form of development too"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"What you’re seeing is the slow killing Showtime to appease Viacom legacy brands. Last fall, Showtime’s CEO of 15 years left. After that they announced MTV Networks people would take over. Then they pivoted saying the Pluto CEO will take over. Then earlier this week, lots of Showtime execs left while a ton of people at the network were laid off. Viacom has a history of acquiring and destroying. Paramount keeps stumbling into money makers like Top Gun and Yellowstone so they’re just going to keep trying to do super broad stuff without really understanding why those things worked. They might stay alive but it will be through luck and not good decisions or talent."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,I’m just here for the Star Trek. That’s it
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"You do know that Paramount’s marketing department did no write the article, right?"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Disney can’t combine Hulu into Disney+ without resolving Comcast’s stake.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Phase 4’s theatrical releases averaged $214 million to produce and grossed an average of $815 million each - $630 million if we don’t count Spider-Man.

That’s amazing."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Downvotes for what? 

Excellent point, you nailed it. How far down the Top list do you have to go to find a Paramount TV show? Yellowstone is hot garbage from the intro to episode 1, unless your regressive idiot views left you with only one possible kind of program to watch, and this one has Kevin Costner!"
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Not  a bad synopsis, although ""Have Gun Will Travel"", ""Branded"" , ""The Rifleman"" and dozens of other westerns come to mind. It would be difficult to explain the phenomenon if it were not for 
IMDB. 

If we didn't see 'em in real time, they were on syndication - still are ( see Grit TV in all its pharma ad and reverse mortgage ad glory ). 

I'm not sure it's really prestige though. Too soapy really. I'll still watch it because it's mildly ridiculous and does a decent job of rewarding willing suspension of disbelief."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"A lot of things were created by the companies themselves and/or the creators are dead.  The reason there should be a public aspect is because it's public money that is back filling the write off.  But ya, for things where the rights were bought from individuals or the studios of origin, something should be done to wrap them in.

Saddest fucking thing was the post where the creator of a cartoon found years of work and dozens of episodes just fucking gone all so some bastards could get a discount."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Imagine if Disney decided to scorch earth ""their"" IPs so a mercenary CEO could get a bigger bonus.  SEARS and Toys R Us at least had physical real estate to deal with.  All some prick has to decide with IP is that, say, no one gives a shit about Marvel or Starwars anymore.

Pop!  Gone.  No more comic books, no more Jedis.  Anything they get their hands on they burn and throw in the trash.

It's a fucking joke."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"It's like they stopped at a gas station way off the highway, the one that services a small community near some provincial park and kept renting DVDs up until 5 years ago because the internet out there sucked. Then they dug through the discount DVD bin now that they're getting rid of them. The 3 for $5.00 bin. And those three movies are what they decided to make TV shows out of lol. Such a random, disjointed and mediocre mix."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,Even the legacy brands are struggling. They moved RuPaul’s Drag Race from VH1 over to MTV hoping that it might get some people to actually watch MTV for the first time in a decade.
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,[deleted]
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"All they have is old IP.  When they launched, they had a superbowl commercial that had a bunch of characters climbing their peak.  It included Picard, Beavis and Butthead, Spongebob Squarepants etc.  

I mean, they friggin made a TV show about an awesome movie they made in the 70s!  It's wild how they are clinging onto past successes."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Which could cost Disney around 9 billion dollars to buy Comcast’s third part of Hulu, even the CEO hinted they might look to sell it instead and just move their content over to Disney+ or perhaps Star+ as it’s already known for outside the US."
Come On!: Therapy for the Undecided,"Movies need to make around 4x to 5x their production costs to break even, let alone show a profit.  
Hell Spielberg said himself that Avatar 2 actually needed to make 2 billion in order for it to make a profit which is 4.9 times the budget, the same applies to Marvel movies they need to recoup, and they aren't doing that.  
The global box office for Marvel movies not counting Spider-Man is down by half for the  current phase.

So it looks to me that people are only interested in a lot of the current movie line up, save for maybe 1 or 2 titles like Spidey and Guardians. The fatigue seems to be setting in."
The Kindness Diaries,"Both went downhill, but I got to give it to Vampire Diaries.  Those first 2-3 seasons had plot galore.  People were dying, leaving, investigating, negotiating, tricking, blackmailing, converting, attacking, defending, every single week.  They also weren’t afraid to go quick with major character changes and just deal with the fallout.

Elena’s breakdown when Jeremy dies is awfully familiar to several instances I have had with people around that age.  Yeah it was soapy, but the pathos was there.  I don’t look down on YA or assume that nudity and bad language elevates the material. True Blood was just as soapy at times."
The Kindness Diaries,"True Blood was mostly fun, TVD was like a YA book"
The Kindness Diaries,"True Blood. Mainly cuz nudity, cursing, sex, violence, gore. 

But also because (similar to how the VD world is doing in the new thing about the Salvatore school) the True Blood show went fully campy and nerdy with faries and ware-panthers and just stopped taking it seriously as time went on. It made it even more fun for me. 

I never watched much Buffy but True Blood made me think of that. Campy, weird, interesting but silly. VD sorta tried to stay serious. And serious was kinda, for me, already done well by Anne Rice and her movie...but more so her books."
The Kindness Diaries,TVD and their spin off The Originals Cleared the other show
The Kindness Diaries,"Vampire Diaries stayed better longer and despite being a CW show, attempted real depth from time to time. True Blood quickly turned into Alan Ball masturbating all over his pages."
The Kindness Diaries,"sadly, both went to Fun Trash to Unwatchable Trash by the end of their runs"
The Kindness Diaries,"True Blood. I didn't really like a lot of the main characters in TVD, I only started watching it as I was a fan of Ian Somerhalder. 
 
Buffy/Angel still are at the top of vampire shows, but at the moment I'm a huge fan of IWTV even though it's only been one season so far. Hopefully it stays high in quality."
The Kindness Diaries,True Blood
The Kindness Diaries,Buffy. But True Blood out of the options given.
The Kindness Diaries,Buffy.
The Kindness Diaries,"Easily Trueblood in the beginning.  It started bringing the books to life, smoothing out some rough spots - it was even better than the books; in some places, like the King of Mississippi, they really eclipsed the book. 

But it was like they were so drunk on their success tweaking the story they started to invent new plots and making the story more global.  IMHO, it really got bad at the end.

That said, I'm enthused about a possible True Blood reboot.


And, just me personally, I'd put Buffy over Diaries."
The Kindness Diaries,"It's funny I watched both sort of at the same time. Initially, I stopped watching TVD and preferred True Blood.

Then, around True Blood season 5, the show lost me and I never finished it. I went back to TVD and absolutely loved it. It is a really entertaining show. Some seasons are weak, but at the very least still watchable enough. I really enjoy season 1-6."
The Kindness Diaries,"I liked both shows , but True Blood was my favorite between the 2 . It was  more entertaining in my opinion."
The Kindness Diaries,True blood
The Kindness Diaries,TVD. Just couldn't get into True Blood at all
The Kindness Diaries,TVD was fun when Klaus was on it.  Joseph Morgan stole every single scene he was in.  When he left to do the spin off The Originals I went with him.  TVD went down hill fast after that imo.
The Kindness Diaries,"> True Blood. Mainly cuz nudity, cursing, sex, violence, gore. 

And less teenage angst."
The Kindness Diaries,Oh man IWTV was fantastic. Probably my fave show of 2022
The Kindness Diaries,"Teen angst, in a CW show? Say it ain't so!"

The Kindness Diaries,it's probably about HBO Max removing stuff.
The Kindness Diaries,"It could also be in part that Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel made a bunch of year end best of lists, including Best Science Fiction for the Good Reads user choice awards. So many people have picked it up recently. (I bought it earlier this year and finally read it this week myself). I enjoyed it so much, that I planned on starting Station Eleven, knowing that she wrote the book of the same name that the show is adapted from"
The Kindness Diaries,"With different shows being pulled from HBO max, station eleven was also mentioned.  The show runner I believe also made some comments about how it will live on.  I assume some fans and new people wanted to point out how good it was. Basically the show came back into relevancy.   Definitely check it out though.  It's great."
The Kindness Diaries,"It's getting attention because of [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/zol0cs/station_eleven_showrunner_promises_to_play_it_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , though it was talked about a lot when it came out in late 2021. It was on many critics' best shows of the year lists, even if it didn't do huge ratings."
The Kindness Diaries,"You know, I’ve brought up Station 11 a number of times in the last week. I can’t really say why, but I promise, I’m not a psy-op."
The Kindness Diaries,Why would HBO be spending money on viral marketing a show that came out a year ago and didn't do very well? Seems more likely that Station Eleven just has a contingent of fans among people who visit TV forums.
The Kindness Diaries,I just binged the shit out of it in one day after seeing someone mention it in a tv show rankings of 2022. That shit was amazing I was not disappointed.
The Kindness Diaries,"Jesus. Fucking. Christ.

The reddit immediate jump to just believe everything is astroturfing is out of this world. Some of yall need to leave the house."
The Kindness Diaries,"I think it's past it's eligibility for most TV awards and I can't really imagine David Zaslav would want to be paying for something like that at this point. So probably not. I think it's maybe just getting a little attention now amidst several other shows people like getting pulled off HBOMax and some end of the year ""best of"" lists.
 It's seems to have something of a ""cult"" following."
The Kindness Diaries,"It is an amazing show, no hyperbole here"
The Kindness Diaries,It's a Christmas show and it's Christmas season.
The Kindness Diaries,We watched it right about this time last year and was surprised nobody was talking about it then. Definitely my favorite show in years and will be disappointed if/when it is removed. I hope I see the news in time so I can rewatch before she goes.
The Kindness Diaries,If it’s viral marketing then so is this post.
The Kindness Diaries,"Why would HBO be paying for marketing for a show they are removing from their platform?

My question is… why suddenly in the last week are random ass new posts without that many upvotes or comments from r/television or r/movies popping up on my home page?"
The Kindness Diaries, It’s great that’s whya
The Kindness Diaries,It’s a Christmas show
The Kindness Diaries,"A truly fantastic show, the finale gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. If it is some sort of awards marketing to get it top of mind, it 100% deserves it."
The Kindness Diaries,"Your own experiences are coloring your interpretation. I watched the show when it was released, loved it, talked about it on Reddit and saw posts about it. I heard the news that HBO Max might remove the show and then saw the same posts you're seeing, but unlike you, I assumed that people were discovering it because it had been in the news again."
The Kindness Diaries,"Who knows?

But it deserves all the love it gets."
The Kindness Diaries,"Someone sees something trending on twitter: ""This is sus"""
The Kindness Diaries,HBO could not have cared less about that show when it was out. I doubt they’re using any resources to promote it now lol
The Kindness Diaries,Well its awesome so I get it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
The Kindness Diaries,Probably just has to do with it being fucking great show. Why does everyone have to make everything out to be a goddamn conspiracy theory?
The Kindness Diaries,Probably not because HBO did a horrible time marketing it in the first place
The Kindness Diaries,"1) Multiple critics have recommended it on  Twitter on the basis ""it's a Christmas show"".

2) It's end-of-year list time.

3) It's exactly a year since it was released.

4) It's a very likely candidate to get disappeared off HBO, and there are a bunch of articles to that effect circulating that highlight the showrunner's comments on the subject.

Nobody is astroturfing a year old show that was barely promoted on release in the first place and is very likely to disappear soon.

This reminds me of a post a while ago where someone insisted Leftovers was being astroturfed. Sure, somebody's on a payroll to shill for an eight year old show nobody watched the first time, definitely sounds more likely than people just enjoying something for a change.

I can't help thinking there's a particular kind of show that a particular kind of poster doesn't get - which is fine! - but it's also just totally beyond their imagination to think anyone else might feel otherwise."
The Kindness Diaries,I watched it. Enjoyed it.
The Kindness Diaries,It’s a great show
The Kindness Diaries,"I thought it was a firefighter show.. turns out it’s very much ~not~ a firefighter show. Maybe I’ll check it out, shame it’s being removed from hbo"
The Kindness Diaries,"It got lost in the COVID haze. 

It’s a masterpiece of taking written word and making an emotionally resonant television miniseries."
The Kindness Diaries,"It's probably a combination of it being the end of the year and a lot of critics re-appraising the shows that have come out and then time passing since the height of the pandemic that people are more willing to revisit something with its premise.

It is such a great show though, it's right up there with Andor in that it feels like such a story we need right now but just didn't break through."
The Kindness Diaries,"I feel like not many people have seen it, but I also really liked station eleven"
The Kindness Diaries,"Never heard of it, but I bet checking to see how much fan fiction there is, *might* be a judge on how popular it is."
The Kindness Diaries,It truly was amazing
The Kindness Diaries,[deleted]
The Kindness Diaries,I dunno but I wholeheartedly agree. Incredible show
The Kindness Diaries,It actually is a great limited series only one boring episode that was necessary for set up
The Kindness Diaries,"As others have mentioned, it’s likely because it is a show that could get caught up in the HBO Max rapture.

On a similar note: Everyone go watch The Other Two."
The Kindness Diaries,Could be?  But it's a fucking great show too.
The Kindness Diaries,"No, it's human nature.

HBO decides to remove a bunch of content.

Station Eleven is amongst the content being removed.

Stories are posted about the S11 show-runner's attitude of defiance.

Someone posts about how disappointed they are that S11 is going away because they loved it so much.

This triggers a barrage of S11 appreciation content as people are reminded how much they loved it, and after all, Reddit is a site for sharing our thoughts.

So yeah, thoughts are inherently viral."
The Kindness Diaries,"I saw it in a thread about Damon Lindelofa couple days ago.  It was mentioned in a comment about The Leftovers which is one of my favorite shows ever. Now, I'm also seeing posts about it everywhere! I am definitely going to watch it."
The Kindness Diaries,"Not sure, but please believe the hype. That show is remarkable."
The Kindness Diaries,That show is fucking amazing. Deserved. Edge of tomorrow is in every thread somehow and still gets brought up. So.
The Kindness Diaries,"If it is it's working. I'm watching it now. I tried several times when it first came out but the first episode sucks ass so much that it took me forever to make it through. It was bland and droned on and on and on. 

However since I've seen the first episode and I like the premise I decided to give it another shot and the second episode is considerably better. It's still a bit slow but it's had some decent moments. 

I'm going to watch another episode or two and see how it feels. If it keeps up the pace of episode 2 I might keep enduring lol"
The Kindness Diaries,"I haven't seen anything about it on Reddit, but that doesn't mean it's not there. This kind of marketing is a real thing.

Edit: And literally a minute later, I see a post about it. So weird."
The Kindness Diaries,"Sometimes this whole sub feels like it's filled with HBO astroturfers. I get that HBO makes some good shows but the way some people push HBO shows on here it definitely feels like astroturfing. I've never met a person in my life who was passionate about any HBO series except for GOT, The Wire and Sopranos. I don't know where the others come from. 

Also, I'm posting this using an alternate account because I know I'll be downvoted to hell."
The Kindness Diaries,"I remember damage.

When streaming networks started pulling their own originals"
The Kindness Diaries,"It's the kind of show that a lot of people have seen and loved, but there's also a huge number of people who have just never seen it.  I work in entertainment and talk movies and shows with friends all the time...I'm the only person I know irl who has actually seen the show.  When I did see it, I thought it was fantastic and wish more people saw it.  So now anytime I see it come up somewhere online I chime in because I'd genuinely like more people to watch it.  I honestly think it's that kind of show for a lot of people."
The Kindness Diaries,"I saw someone post about it earlier today, binged three episodes and came back on Reddit and this is the first post I see… it is a brilliant show so far though. Really unsure how I missed it."
The Kindness Diaries,I think we just are terrified of the show disappearing since you can’t buy it anywhere and it’s amazing.
The Kindness Diaries,"What’s funny is my wife and I just finished it last week. It was good, not good enough for me to make a post on Reddit about it. But it was good. 

I’m guessing it’s the lack of new shows lately and people going back to the shows they might have missed in 2021 and 2022."
The Kindness Diaries,I fucking loved it and tried to get people to watch it but nobody else I knew did. Like The Patriot on Prime. Just awesome shows that went unwatched by the masses. This one tore me up in such a great way.
The Kindness Diaries,"I don't know. I've been planning a rewatch soon - the show has strong Jan/Feb vibes to me - but the rise in posts about it on here recently have me itching to jump the gun. I guess it's possible that we're all connected by a universal consciousness shared by all living beings, and some unknown power is pushing Station Eleven into our collective thoughts, but it's probably viral shitfuckery."
The Kindness Diaries,"Don't know why it's showing up now, but I checked it out based on a post I saw, and I'm so very glad I did. Binged the whole thing, and it's one of the front runners for best show of the year for me now. Terribly awe inspiringly beautiful. Final emotional swells gave me waves of catharsis. Would highly recommend."
The Kindness Diaries,This show got cancelled?  That's some shit.  Show was good.  That's actually unfair.  It felt like it was finished though in the sense that everything seemed wrapped up so I'm not left hanging or anything.
The Kindness Diaries,"I can’t get over how easily the show forgave the dude who abducted kids and turned them into suicide bombers.

The show could’ve been so good but like.. that dude did some fucked up shit. I don’t forgive him and I don’t like the show trying to paint him as a good guy at the end.

It was really jarring how the show wanted me to forget everything he’d done."
The Kindness Diaries,"I thought it was interesting, the acting was good enough and the characters weren't bad but only two were really good. The pacing was a bit stumbly, but overall I enjoyed it and think about it from time to time."
The Kindness Diaries,All of Reddit is going through a phase of posting the same shit over and over with slightly different wording. In space and futurology it’s “why mars?” In movies it’s “what’s the best sequel?” In tv it’s “station 11 best show!”
The Kindness Diaries,"If you look at the number of times posts about “what about Station Eleven” have been spammed on Reddit in the last couple of days, it is absolutely not an organic phenomenon, ie yeah, this is intentional on the part of some marketing firm because the show never got traction when it debuted and could very well be booted from the service because it was a Paramount/ViacomCBS production and not made in-house."
The Kindness Diaries,"Not even sure what that is, I assume based on the sub it's posted in its a show. Other than that not a thing."
The Kindness Diaries,I started watching it because of all the posts and I gotta say it’s awesome. I don’t mind people recommending me really fucking good shows.
The Kindness Diaries,"Yeah, it’s odd. This is the fourth post I’ve seen mention the show in the last couple of hours."
The Kindness Diaries,Get a grip man
The Kindness Diaries,"This is the first I'm hearing of it, so you tell me."
The Kindness Diaries,It’s an awesome show AND book!
The Kindness Diaries,"This show is really good, I laughed, I cried a bunch, was in shock and awe.. some great cameos and man... what a great story. I was told about it and put it off for a while to catch up on wheel of time, but what a spectacular story. You can see some of the twists coming, but it really is a great journey overall. Really can't wait to see what they do with the next season..."
The Kindness Diaries,Not everything is some grand conspiracy.
The Kindness Diaries,"I assume that 90% of the posts on this sub and r/movies are marketing. Never seen so many hyperbolic takes. Everything is ""the best ever"" or ""redefining"" or whatever."
The Kindness Diaries,"It's all marketing.

Smoke."
The Kindness Diaries,Can't seem to find it available on Blu Ray or DVD. I thought HBO usually released shows like this.
The Kindness Diaries,This is what I thought about Andor. Everyone and their brother posting about how great it was. I thought it was ok but hard to follow. I didn't get the hype and it felt manufactured.
The Kindness Diaries,"I’ve tried to watch this thing three times, I just don’t feel the love. To each his own, of course but … am I the only one that doesn’t get the surge in popularity?"
The Kindness Diaries,"Saw this as well. Totally agree. Seems like marketing. It was a good show; a little too artsy-fartsy for my taste but good. I don’t understand the all of a sudden interest in it. I appreciate it, the interest; it feels forced unfortunately."
The Kindness Diaries,I agree this is probably an inside job because part of my real job is to drum up “organic” social interest in things no one cares about.
The Kindness Diaries,"Probably! Paying someone $50000 a year just to post about your TV shows on the internet has got to be extremely cost effective. The sub has its fair share of shills. 

What they do though is more like trying to guide the conversation to get people talking and thinking about a show. Then the people will do the job for you."
The Kindness Diaries,I only made it through a couple of episodes of this show before I gave up on it. Not for me.
The Kindness Diaries,"This is ""that"" kind of woman's show, isn't it? The sort with lotsa dragged-out, navel gazing, Kumbaya convos about ""feelings"" while the world falls apart around them but there are no men around to fix it for them and such, right?"
The Kindness Diaries,Has to be. Everyone I know who watched that show stopped at episode 2.
The Kindness Diaries,Once you see or interact with one post. The algorithm is gonna show you more
The Kindness Diaries,"nobody knows for sure besides thread starters and Reddit, but it's a tad suspicious yeah"
The Kindness Diaries,This show sucked. Second half was hard to get through. All these comments in here gotta be fake.
Chasing Cameron,"Okay, so I've got a question... does the show ask what it means to be a ""social media star""? There was an interesting Frontline (""The Facebook Generation"", I think?) on the topic but I figured this show would be aimed at the guy's fanbase and wouldn't risk showing anything that might make those fans unhappy, just working to make him look good."
Chasing Cameron,This popped up in my feed over the weekend yet it already has very low ratings (around 1.5 stars.) Anyone know why?
Chasing Cameron,"I'm only 3 episodes in at the moment. What i gathered is that a social media star like Cameron Dallas essentially live off of views, likes, retweets, and shares. On show they combine all of this internet popularity into touring around for MAGCON, where they sign autographs, take pictures, and entertain the crowd with some music as they jump around and hype everyone up. "
Chasing Cameron,Either not enough fans are watching it and rating it higher or people like me who are trying it out and realizing it is not a very good show and giving it a 1 star.
Chasing Cameron,"The Original three (Foreman, Chase Cameron) were by far the most balanced and the best all around doctors. Their specialty's really complimented each other, and their personalities enabled House to do his best work, as Foreman kept him in check, Cameron kept his humanity in line and reminded him of the right thing, and Chase had House's back when the others got scared and came up with some of the more creative ideas.  

If I had to pick a fourth it would be 13. She was this mystery who always kept House on his toes. "
Chasing Cameron,Three Cameron's in spandex. 
Chasing Cameron,"I would pick Cameron, Foreman, and Thirteen. Those three would push back against House in his craziest modes. I detested Chase, especially after he started mopying around Cameron. "
Chasing Cameron,"Foreman Chase and Cameron were decided upon as one entity.

Everything else came up through plot which was limiting.

Granted one of my favorites was Masters"
Chasing Cameron,And you can't beat Olivia Wilde. House was the first thing i saw her in and I fell in love with her right away.
Chasing Cameron,[deleted]
Chasing Cameron,I did not like him even before he and Cameron married. I was not thrilled with him at first and he got worse as the show went on especially when he longed after Cameron.
Chasing Cameron,You talk about shows from the last century and your pick is from 2003?
Chasing Cameron,"Sigh, I dont have enough room on my DVR"
Chasing Cameron,I'm trying to fill in my blanks on the AFI 100 and for Best Picture nominated movies. Anything on here other than the obvious stuff (Dr. Strangelove/2001/North By Northwest/Singing in the Rain for example)?
Chasing Cameron,Will they ever show Angels with Dirty Faces on TCM again!? 
My Runway,"I'm wondering if, in like 25-30 years, when people will be watching shows, they'll wonder why certain shows in the 00's have like 10 episode seasons.

And then someone will make a ""TIL that in 2007, the Writers Guild of America had a strike. This is why many television shows during that year had extremely short seasons."""
My Runway,"I still mourn for Pushing Daisies, whose ratings momentum was cut off by the strike and it never recovered in season 2 and was canceled without a properly-filmed finale.

Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog also came out of the strike, and there's a [song on the musical commentary track about the writers' strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfwElBO-gQ8). "
My Runway,And Heroes never recovered as a show
My Runway,Was zack and Cody really cancelled tho? I thought it was because there 3 season contract was up (as what most Disney shows have.) And  on deck aired soon after and lasted another 3 seasons.
My Runway,Who Made Huckabee? Might be one of my favorite bits ever done on Late Night TV.
My Runway,Something that isn't mentioned as much - the strike was the end of strictly regimented TV season starts/finishes and sweeps weeks.
My Runway,RIP pushing daisies
My Runway,Am I correct in thinking that the Writers' Strike successfully prevented the Deposition and Dinner Party episodes of the Office from airing one after each other?
My Runway,The Writer's Strike is what made Misha Collins' career. The original SPN storyline got scrapped in favor of 'an angel raises Dean'. 
My Runway,"Writer's Strike Conan was the best string of television that late night television has ever produced. Sure his remote episodes done in other cities/countries are still the best stuff on late night TV now, and his final few weeks of shows on The Tonight Show after falling out with NBC were awesome, but the writer's strike showed how much better Conan is when he is freed from the shackles of archaic late night television bullshit of being forced to do monologues and sketches. It's just like how his current TBS show is unwatchable on a daily basis, yet suddenly he does a remote segment or a remote episode in another city or country and that is immediately must-watch."
My Runway,And I'm still bitter about Pushing Daisies
My Runway,That's a really nice write-up. Great job! Let's hope that will never happen again.
My Runway,Desperate Housewives wasn't a reality show
My Runway,"One show that got cancelled and it bugs the fuck out of me is “The Riches” I saw it on Netflix a few years back, finished season one, then season two ends abruptly with the bad guy calling to tell the main character that he has his son. "
My Runway,"I don't think anyone has mentioned, ""The Riches"":

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches

It was hit by the writers' strike in season 2 and only half of the planned episodes ever aired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches#Season_2:_2008).

I thought it was quite clever but I could see how they'd likely run out of good story ideas fairly quickly."
My Runway,The writers strike was a weird time for tv. 
My Runway,Journeyman TV show from NBC. I am sad.
My Runway,"The great late night madness will always be the most memorable thing from this. Conan was the best comedy on TV during the writer’s strike, late night or otherwise. "
My Runway,"I loved the 4400, it was heartbreaking to see it go."
My Runway,"Only 3 shows which debuted that season got to a 3rd season; Gossip Girl, Chuck and The Big Bang Theory. "
My Runway,Do non-union people suffer after union people are back in the industry? Are they placed in a blacklist or anything like that?
My Runway,"I remember being a journalist visiting the set of a lot of those series and talking to the cast. They all seemed happy as they got to have a break, but it was tough on the other people like lighting, make-up, catering etc. 

"
My Runway,it's insane that it's already been ten years. Quantum of Solace had shitty writing unfortunately.
My Runway,[deleted]
My Runway,Since the last writers strike gave us Dr Horrible I am anxious for another one!
My Runway,And new episodes of The Office finally came back! I remember when this happened It was torture having to wait.
My Runway,"Wait, why is Desperate Housewives listed as a reality show?"
My Runway,I know it's not television but Quantum of Solace basically didn't have a third act because of the Writer's Strike.
My Runway,I remember how annoying that time was. 
My Runway,RIP Pushing Daisies. 
My Runway,Pushing Daisies never recovered.  Such a shame.
My Runway,"Other than 30rock and the office having shorter seasons, I remember Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During this time he grew a beard and during the show he would spend time flicking his wedding ring. Each episode he would try to beat his previous record. Now, this does sound boring but Conan made it hilarious. "
My Runway,[Always worth watching the South Park episode making fun of the strike.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_on_Strike)
My Runway,RIP Drawn Together. 
My Runway,Aaaannnddd....all we have now is remakes of old shit.
My Runway,I was so excited for The day the Earth stood still too.
My Runway,writers strike ruined Battlestar Galactica
My Runway,And the industry never recovered. Movies have largely been shit rebrands ever since. Movies are dead. Series are the future.
My Runway,Essentially it saved breaking bad. It cut season 1 short and thus resulted in Jesse not getting killed off 
My Runway,RIP Reaper
My Runway,"After being introduced to the GEICO cavemen show in that thread about worst reviewed shows of the 2000s, I have to say its cancellation was a tragedy. What a hilarious trainwreck of a show. "
My Runway,I took the time to watch all seven seasons of the West Wing.  I've been a fan of Sorkin ever since.
My Runway,Quantum of Solace
My Runway,"...and gave rise to Netflix, reality unscripted TV and cord cutting, which is directly biting them in the ass in the latest negotiations (2017 expiration).

Talk about short sited. They got their little contract, but their value will never be the same."
My Runway,Spoiled whiners should just have been replaced
My Runway,TIL Steve Buscemi was a volunteer firefighter during the 2007-08 Writers Strike 
My Runway,Look at the '88 strike.  Mission:Impossible remade episodes from the 60's series and Star Trek TNG did a clip show.
My Runway,Life also got screwed in the writers strike. S1 was great and then just huge mis step in S2. 
My Runway,"I watched Dr. Horrible in my junior year English class when my teacher put it on, took a Xanax, and fell asleep. We quoted it for days"
My Runway,"I loved Pushing Daises but it’s ratings were dropping *fast* before the strike, it shed **half** its viewers over the first season. There was no momentum."
My Runway,And Jesse Pinkman's life was saved.
My Runway,Came here to say this. After season 1 the show just spiraled downward into a horrible mess.
My Runway,"Honestly I think the show was doomed  after season 1 anyway. 

They started drifting away from what I felt like the show was meant to be: human characters from different backgrounds dealing with super human abilities. These days that sounds rather generic but at the time it was a great concept that worked really well. But as the show went on, it seemed like it became less about humans dealing with super powers and more about just the fact that people had super powers. I honestly think season 1 was lightning in a bottle. There were good characters all circling around this mysterious event as well as a really cool villain.

Then there is the fact that they started fucking with their powers which really doesn't do anything but break the immersion of the world the whole story works to build. Some say they had to nerf certain characters' abilities but I say that's a lack of good writing and creativity. I could go on about Heroes. A damn shame it turned out the way it did, and the revival certainly did not make any improvements. "
My Runway,"Save the cheerleader, save the world! RIP."
My Runway,"Yeah thats true, shame they couldnt get back to their glory days not even once. "
My Runway,it was a lost cause before the strike
My Runway,Every time Stewart and Colbert did something with Conan it was gold
My Runway,Streaming (and the rise of HBO and other cable networks) also contributed to that.
My Runway,Can I get an EILI5 style explanation. The business of TV fascinates me.
My Runway,Eh...I dunno. I know that the original plan was for Sam to save Dean but that doesn't mean angels wouldn't have entered the picture anyways. I think Kripke added them in more to have balance with demons than to have an explanation of how Dean got raised from the dead.
My Runway,"Misha's performance is what made Misha's career. I'm pretty sure the angels were planned anyway, Kripke claims he had a 5-year plan from the start. It's just the manner in which they were introduced that came out of the strike. "
My Runway,"It was really great for late night television.

But as an actor and someone who worked behind the scenes it essentially meant there was basically no work for almost a year.

Made me leave the biz....which ended up probably being a really good move seeing how much the industry changed post streaming."
My Runway,I agree. Seems fitting a write up about the writer's strike is well written. Too many lengthy write-ups on Reddit are poorly written but OP is good at it.
My Runway,"Yeah, it was a bit worrying how close we got recently, I think it was last May? "
My Runway,"thanks, I had it on there twice, had the one in the wrong spot but removed it now"
My Runway,"Man I loved that show, I still listen to the theme song sometimes"
My Runway,We'll never know how well Promise City will/would have turned out.
My Runway,"How does that compare to other years though?


Edit: you also left out Private Practice and Flaspoint and non scripted shows The Moment of Truth, Kitchen Nightmares, and The Singing Bee"
My Runway,Yes! Hosted by Hulk Hogan and Laila Ali. I think NBC should make an American Ninja Warriors vs American Gladiators show
My Runway,Kind of a mercy kill at that point in the show's life
My Runway,LOL the writers strike isn't why we have Netflix. We have Netflix and similar products as a reaction to internet piracy of films and tv shows which was a reaction to studios refusing to use the internet to bring content to audiences faster and with less hassle (picking a tv show to binge on netflix vs having to go buy a dvd boxset). Basically studios didn't want to accept the future because it meant selling things cheaper. They were collectively told to fuck off by anyone who was able to pirate content.
My Runway,"Netflix and unscripted reality tv started before the writers strike. Netflix has been around since 1997 and the two shows that really kicked off our current reality tv show dystopia, keeping up with the kardashians and the real housewives of OC both started before the strike. The rash of competitive unscripted reality shows like survivor and the bachelor started way, way before that. So I don’t really understand your comment. "
My Runway,You really have no idea what you're talking about.....
My Runway,"Shows on Netflix and other streaming services still use writers that are in the writers guild, so those platforms existing and taking off doesn't hurt their value at all. If anything it helps them because they now have more platforms available where they can practice their craft. 

Cord cutters still watch shows through those streaming services so them cutting the cord also doesn't effect writers. It's cable companies that cord cutting effects, not show writers. Cord cutters don't want to give Comcast their money, but they still watch shows through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO Now, Sling, Vue etc. Why the writers aren't effected. Networks are adapting by coming out with their own or partnering with existing streaming platforms. 

Reality TV is nowhere near as popular in the last 5-8 years as it was 10+ years ago, it's certainly past its peak. Instead there has been a rise of unique, quality plot driven series (largely thanks to channels like HBO, Showtime, FX, AMC etc coming up with quality original content). To the point where it's no longer rare to see bigger name movie actors doing television, be it for a cameo or story arc or a full season or their own series. Whereas in the past television gigs had a sort of stigma to them for movie actors, and there was a much clearer status divide between television actors and movie actors.

The past 10 years have actually had some of the best and most abundant unique quality television ever. "
My Runway,Yes because we all know how replacements work out..such as the 2012 referee lockout in the NFL
My Runway,TIL Firefighter Steve Buscemi was a volunteer dog during the 2007-08 writers strike into the world pentagon building.
My Runway,"Otoh 'Breaking Bad' benefited from the strike, shortening the first season and making them reconsidered who was going to die and when."
My Runway,Life was so good! Damian Lewis and Sarah Shahi were great and they hit the right ratio of overarching story/case of the week content. I'm still salty about how they ended it.
My Runway,"Plus Gus was invented. Breaking Bad is one of the few shows, maybe the only one, that actually benefited a ton from the strike."
My Runway,"I wonder if there was no strike, would season 2 have still sucked?"
My Runway,Me too!
My Runway,Uh....this writers strike is why HBO never finished Deadwood.  
My Runway,"For decades (since the 1950s really) the scheduling of TV seasons was pretty much unchanged: New shows premiered in September to early October, ran strings of first-run episodes alternating with strings of reruns until the start of summer, at which time the season was done and the show either ran reruns until the next season or short season summer replacement shows.

Periodically there were periods called sweeps weeks where the Neilsen company collected data for its ratings and these were critical to the survival of programs so new episodes, and particularly the critical episodes of the season were programmed into these time periods.

The strike was the beginning of the end for all of that. Because shows were in many different stages of production when the strike hit, season lengths varied drastically and network tv never really got back into the synchronized start again - the programs resumed with varying inventories of episodes when the strike ended and networks introduced new shows at all times of the year rendering sweeps week ratings pretty much irrelevant."
My Runway,"Currently there are 8 (scripted) shows in their 3rd season.

EDIT: This is what Josh Schwarz and Stephanie Savage on the Nerdist Writers Panel."
My Runway,"Nah, it was still great!"
My Runway,"Never said it created it.

The strike pushed people there. "
My Runway,"Where the fuck do I say it created it? 

It pushed people there.

God some of you retards are fucking dense."
My Runway,"Arguably 24 as well. The showrunners were burned out after S6 and had almost no clue where they wanted to take S7 creatively.  The strike gave them time to plan shit out a lot better.      

The end result was 24: Redemption (which was awesome) and S7 (arguably second only to S5 in terms of quality)"
My Runway,"The dvd set for season 2 has what was going to happen.  The vial isn’t caught, instead breaking and infecting New York.  Stuff happens.  Turns out, Maya (I think that was her name) is the key in the end, as she sacrifices herself to draw the disease into her and destroy it.

I think it’s a much better story, and would hope it didn’t cause them to drop so many plot threads entirely and put them back together again in the way they did that made season 3 seem like almost a different show.

Also, I really liked the Irish girl and Peter just straight forgot about her entirely, which seemed super wrong and out of his character."
My Runway,Thank you so much for this. I was watching an old episode of the Simpsons and they referenced something about sweeps week or fall line up or something and I didn't get it at all. Thanks!
My Runway,"Thank you! I've heard sweeps week referenced a few times, but I've always figured it's one of those things that every American understands and nobody else has a reason to care about. Now I get it. Still don't understand the name though. "
My Runway,"It was going to happen with or without the strike. If the strike hadn't happened the result would have been the same.

Also if you think reality tv is unscripted..well...lol"
My Runway,"I think ""giving rise to"" something is usually synonymous with the creation of something."
My Runway,I hated Maya but that would've been a cool plot for her instead of what we actually got that season.
My Runway,"> they did that made season 3 seem like almost a different show.

Which reminds me: Heroes was supposed to be an anthology series following different people each season but, NBC got scared that people wouldn't care for new characters. So they pushed to keep the ones they already have and the rest is (shitty) history."
My Runway,"Weird.

Yet it all magically happened right with the strike.

The Files of Young Kindaichi,"She's so fucking good in Fringe. Liv can seem quite wooden at first, especially when she's opposite a man who regularly has emotional outbursts over sweets... until you start picking up on the fact she's just guarded in her expressions, and there's a million tiny ways she shows huge emotions"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Also, John Noble in Fringe should have gotten emmy noms or awards, he is seriously fantastic.  Awards ignoring a great performance just because its a sci-fi show"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"also 'the newsreader' for something more recent. basically follows her as a nightly news anchor in 1986 that covers a really interesting few months where we have halley's comet, the challenger disaster, important update on ""the dingo stole my baby"" case, bombing of a police station in australia, and chernobyl."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,or Mindhunter. She's great in it and the show itself is so enjoyable and well crafted.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Brilliant series, one of John Noble's best roles. fun fact, there is an observer in every episode of Fringe, sometimes milling about in the background or,.. well.. observing."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I’m rewatching s1 right now! Been meaning to do a full rewatch of the series, so what better time to start"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,My cat is named Olivia Dunham
The Files of Young Kindaichi,[removed]
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was SOOOOOO good.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Loved her in Mindhunters
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I'd say her best performance is from The Newsreader. The rent was due.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Also, Mindhunter on Netflix."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I like the fringe so much I bought the whole DVD set
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Funny enough, I started S1 today"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Literally watching it right now. S1E6
The Files of Young Kindaichi,She was amazing in Fringe.  Need more of her.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe is great. The last season is blatantly tacked on and imho, not very good."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Loved that series, but it got a little TOO weird towards the end."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I could never get through like season 4. Does it get better? Season 1 was one of the best seasons of television ever made, I just felt like they never knew where they were going after that."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I still can't believe that people tuned out. Such a great show but the decline in ratings influenced story changes, a move to Fridays which was considered a death sentence to any tv show, time jumps that later became a plot point. To be fair, that was a pretty genius move by the writers. The fact everyone wrote the show off at s3 but it held on for 2 more seasons is further proof of what a great show it was. It was originally intended to last longer than it did. For the time it did some pretty out of place things. For those who have yet to see it, it has multiple dimensions, multiple timelines, alternate realities, a giant conspiracy that spans the whole of 5 seasons, and multiple endings."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Whaaaat? I was a die-hard X-Files fan and you’re setting the expectations pretty high. I’ll give you that it ended poorly — both times, during the regular series and the reboot. 

But season 1-6 of The X-Files was insanely good. And Gillian Anderson was phenomenal from start to finish."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Xfiles did it first and did it better. X-files did go on too long and ended poorly, that's for sure."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was amazing. Walter!
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Great in Mindhunter aswell
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I absolutely loved Fringe -- even bought the boxset during Amazon's prime day sales. Anna Torv was amazing. I loved her and Kirk Acevedo being partners. And when she had to play her alternate self. I miss the show immensely.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is fantastic.100% recommended.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is my all time favorite show. It was nice seeing Torv in LoU.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"X files on acid in the 70s
Who cares about the science, we've got new vfx to play with!"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"The whole cast in fringe is amazing, John Noble steals every scene he is in. It's also a LOT better than X-Files"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Please refresh, y memory. Didn't fringe have kind of a disappointing last few episodes?"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is flawless. The only reason I’m considering watching the Last of Us is Anna Torv.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,The first half of season 4 is some of the best TV I've seen.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,She’s better in Mindhunter
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"i had never seen her before, and she was instantly the most believable actor on Last of Us"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is amazing after the first season which was a bad x files clone. Credit to the writers for realizing it and trying something new and much better.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fuck. I thought it was Carrie Coon!!
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Loved Fringe, but it is nowhere near as good as X-Files."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I liked fringe, but the science was too awful to rate the show."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"*SLIGHTLY* higher?

SLIGHTLY?!

You take that word back!  Take it back now!

I jest with that, but seriously X-Files has nothing to compare to John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Not by a long shot."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I was thrilled to see she was in this new show, but very disappointed  with how that all turned out"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"One of the best shows ever, imo."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe was really good.

I rewatched it all a few years ago and it still holds up."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Oh Fringe! I almost forgot about that show. Not sure how - I absolutely loved it. No one talks about it.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Dang now I have to watch it if it’s better than the x files
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Second!
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I wish it was on Crave in Canada where we get most HBO shows.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I remember back in the day how many people was like ""flashforward if the new X-Files"" or ""the event is the new X-Files"" and both got cancelled after one season, in the meantime fringe was doing their own ""I'm the new X-Files"" in the corner.

I loved that show, I didn't like season two monster of the week episodes that much, but season three was awesome."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was great
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I thought Fringe was great in the early seasons but gradually became worse as it progressed and the world got larger.   

Torv is a great actor though and did amazing playing two different characters in the show."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Really? Interesting. I thought Fringe was x-files but with modern garbage TV tropes and boring characters but to each their own I guess. You watched Warehouse 13 OP? I think you might like it, it's like Fringe but a different vehicle to tell the stories"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I was so excited for Fringe until I saw the male actor, yes the one also from Dawson's creek (never watched) I don't know if I'm the only person that this happens to but I feel a totally unjustified hatred towards the guy, can't stand his face, ruined Fringe for me"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe definitely stuck the landing compared to a lot of shows.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe is the GOAT, though they kinda cheated us on the ending"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I watched the first couple of episodes and thought it was atrocious compared the The X-Files
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I saw the first  season and for me it lacks something. Its not dark or mystical enough and a bit too much cabel tv-tv. Does the tone change? What I love about xfiles season 1-5 is that you can really feel the surroundings. The rain, the forest, the fog. Fringe is more like xfiles 5-9. Very much studio feeling."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I keep seeing Fringe recommended, and I love X-Files, but I did not enjoy Fringe.  It seemed too predictable and formulaic.  However, I did not watch further than a few episodes into season 2 before dropping it.  I don't know if my opinion would improve later in the series."
The Files of Young Kindaichi, This discussion really making me want to Fringe 😩😩
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"The X-Files will always be iconic, and many of its episodes are some of the greatest in the history of television. Its experiments with the idea of a serialized mythology offered pretty mixed results at times, but the few shows were ever in their element as The X-Files doing some of those classic monster of the week episodes. Shows that followed, especially during that 2004-2010 period, like Lost and Battlestar Galactica, owed much to the X-Files. 

And none more so than Fringe, obviously. 

I think Fringe is a perfect example of taking a familiar concept or premise, and not being too preoccupied with “filing the serial numbers off,” so to speak. It’s totally just The X-Files, BUT the difference is that Fringe has a clear idea about the kind of mythology it wants to explore from the outset; the writers found a genuinely clever way to use the monster of the week format to build towards a larger goal, and Fringe’s mythology is truly one of the best in tv. 

But probably the *biggest* reason Fringe stands above X-Files, is *John motherfucking Noble*. Genuinely, Walter Bishop is the secret sauce of Fringe and one of the most charming and beautifully realized characters in all television. It’s actually pretty remarkable how many great characters came right out the gate after 2004; we talk about the “golden age of television” now (and have for years at this point) but a lot of these network television series walked so these prestige tv programs could run. They had messier endings, but still left a huge mark."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is not good.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe is just the Bluebloods version of X-Files, and it's also trash. Seriously weak acting performances from both Torv and Jackson. Skip Intro's episode on spooky cop shows is the best deep dive into why X-Files is the superior content, when comparing the two shows."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Don't fall for it. She was terrible in ""Fringe"".

The series itself is a terrible pseudoscience/police procedural with its only redeeming quality being a parallel universe long arc that was explored much, much better in ""Counterpart""."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was better than the majority of X-Files which fell off pretty hard after the first couple seasons.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Hard agree on the better than X files .
I think some individual episodes of x files are some of the best sci Fi tv ever ,but as an over all series Fringe has the better story , character development,and consistency"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe was so much better than XFiles, all the interpersonal relationships flowed so much more naturally than the ""made for fandom"" sexual tension between Mulder and Scully.

Plus Fringe kept on track with it's original premise, unlike Xfiles that started off as a really cool show about unsolved cases of strange phenomena  only to get stuck on ""They're Out There"" alien-hybrid conspiracies.

I think Fringe didnt get the attention it deserved because viewers were burned out and bored of XFiles and assumed Fringe was going to be just another copy-cat show."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Only thing better than Fringe was Eureka!
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is leagues above TXF. It had a consistent overall mythology and story arc that ended on it's own terms in an amazing way.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Spoiler….. she dies in episode two 🤦‍♂️
The Files of Young Kindaichi,She's also great in an Australian TV series called The Newsreader
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"ya, Fringe was really effing good. if you like sci fi schlock and havent seen it, get on it. its one of the greats."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Literally what I started on Monday lol
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Welp, it's been a few years.  Time for another Fringe rewatch."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Mmmmm Anna Torv as a redhead.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,HBOMAX Europe as well! Just started another rewatch.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I completely didn’t realize it was her until someone pointed it out to me
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Didn’t even realise that was the actress from Fringe
The Files of Young Kindaichi,This statement compares to: true
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I've only watched the first episode but I really enjoyed her performance and I can't wait to see where the rest of the season takes her character
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I watched an episode of Fringe before watching TLOU and it took me a bit to realize why Tess looked so familiar. Funny how that happens sometimes.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe had it's moments but some of the seasons were weak, if you power through it - the last season was great imo."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,She also had a great part in Mindhunter (great show).
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I've watched first season but didn't enjoy it much does it get better?
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I got halfway through the first season. I want to get into it and finish it , but I had trouble getting through the monster of the week episodes."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Haven't watched the last of us show yet (loved the game), but I actually recently started watching Fringe funnily enough. I'm about halfway through the first season, and I'm enjoying it. Glad to see Anna torv getting more exposure."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I just finished watching her in the Australian show ""Secret City"" and I loved her performance in it. I found it on Netflix and there are two seasons."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was fucking amazing and she was definitely great in it. I'm glad to see that she's getting some recognition.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I couldn't figure out who she was I. This show, I thought she was Donna from the 70s show.

The crazy thing is I loved fringe up until the last season when they had to wrap it up. At least there was closer to the show and it didn't just end."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Well this is awkward...
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe was amazing
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"It makes me feel old that Fringe is a TIL subject since that’s where I know her from the most since she’s the protagonist, She’s also on that Netflix show where they interview serial killers."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Thank you.  I was trying to figure out where I remembered her from.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"That ending still gives me goosebumps.

>!🌷!<"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I stopped watching Fringe on the last episode of the last season. I think Joshua Jackson as Peter was the past holding bastion of good things about a show that had so badly Flanderised itself that I just didn't care about the outcome. Felt like the show found all of the fan favourite traits and wrote the show to be only those traits.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"As a fan since the original airings, I love how this show is having a small resurgence of popularity due to Anna Torv in The Last of Us."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Fringe was great, and if you're like me  and care about this sort of thing, it has an ending, no cancelled forever cliffhanger 😁"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"always wanted to check it out, it's available on NowTV, I just have to find the time"
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"I loved fringe and we just rewatched it. But I can’t watch Last Of Us.  Maybe I’m missing something ,but this whole zombie apocalypse thing is just not what I need right now to take my mind off the hell that is our actual reality."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,Fringe is amazing!  Anna Torv is also in Mindhunter.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,"Holy shit, I knew she reminded me of someone. I just had the same thing happen watching The Sopranos and Bokeem Woodbine was on an episode. Looked him up to confirm I saw him in the Halo TV series not long ago."
The Files of Young Kindaichi,She’s pretty good in ‘The Newsreader’ TV Series. The show overall is a Meh.
The Files of Young Kindaichi,I really don't know what happened in Season 5 where they writing literally went haywired. It really reminds me of crappy writing of Westworld season 4.
Miss in Kiss,Was surprised Charlbi Dean was omitted when she starred in a Best Picture nom. Her death was a sad discovery since she was young and coulda had a nice career trajectory after that movie.
Miss in Kiss,"Paul Sorvino was the worst ommission, IMO. He was a primary star in an Oscar-nominated movie, and alongside Ray Liotta who WAS mentioned."
Miss in Kiss,"Tiny dinky daffy, 92. Pancaked by drunk dump truck driver."
Miss in Kiss,"From a recent [Hollywood Reporter article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oscars-2023-in-memoriam-snubs-anne-heche-tom-sizemore-missing-1235350689/): 
> A spokesperson for The Academy then clarified that the “committee that makes In Memoriam decisions features a representative from each of the organization’s 17 branches, and some names that are more familiar to audiences cannot be included because all branches are entitled to representation during the limited time allotted for the segment.”

It probably feels like there's snubs every year because the general public is mostly familiar with people from the acting branch, and actors are only going to get a portion of the segment."
Miss in Kiss,"Ay Tone, they didn't put me in the Oscars in memoriam

RIP Tony Sirico aka Paulie Walnuts"
Miss in Kiss,It's like they died for nothing man
Miss in Kiss,Entertainment Weekly would have a more accurate list
Miss in Kiss,"Chiam Topol will be in next year's. He died a few days before the ceremony, and these things are finalized well in advance."
Miss in Kiss,"Every year they have people missing - why not release a mock up version of the in memoriam a month before the ceremony online? That way anyone missing can be submitted, by fans or family members. The only people who'd really search for it early anyways would be people who are invested.

It's not like this is a spoiler. And you don't have to have the music or the pics you plan on using on the day."
Miss in Kiss,I understand the omissions. Wouldn't want the thing to drag on too long. It's already a tight 9 hours 56 minute broadcast.
Miss in Kiss,"No Gilbert Gottfried??

I know it's actors, not comedians, but even Louie Anderson (who died as well last year) did some movies. Same with Richard Belzer.

I guess I can understand Anne Heche being omitted since she died in such a fucked up way."
Miss in Kiss,"It would have taken probably 10 plus more seconds to include Cindy Williams, Sorvino & Sizemore. Irene Cara got an entire page of just her as did Michelle Nichols but the other three were totally shafted? This made no sense. Uhura was groundbreaking but Shirley was too!!!!"
Miss in Kiss,I’m not surprised they avoided Anne Heche. Her end was not exactly something anyone wanted to think about.
Miss in Kiss,Did they mention Sally Kellerman? Oscar nominee for MASH.
Miss in Kiss,"William Hurt is a big omission IMO, nominated 3 times by the Academy."
Miss in Kiss,Leslie not being in despite starring in multiple Oscar winning movies is beyond shitty
Miss in Kiss,I can’t believe Charlbi Dean died. The triangle of sadness starts slow but is a wild ride of satire worth watching all 3 hours of.  What a loss.
Miss in Kiss,"They should restrict the ""In Memoriam"" to behind the scenes and technical roles and not feature any stars, that way nobody feels like their favorite has been missed."
Miss in Kiss,"What I found weird as fuck about these in-memoriam is that some of them you could clearly hear louder clapping for? Like, I get it, they're more ""relevant"", but couldn't they not clap at all? If a family member was remembered in one of these and nobody clapped but then everyone clapped for ""Random Producer N° 4"" I'd feel pretty shit."
Miss in Kiss,LOL ... seeing Leslie Jordan with that sphinx cat is fantastic! 🤣
Miss in Kiss,Omitting Sorvino was complete bullshit.  He deserved to be up there.
Miss in Kiss,"Well to be fair, Robert Blake did murder his wife."
Miss in Kiss,Pat Carroll (who played Ursula in the little mermaid) was a notable absence
Miss in Kiss,"> Fred Ward, star of Tremors

muthafuckin Remo? The adventure was just beginning. What if you find you made a mistake, what if it's worth the chances you take."
Miss in Kiss,"Fred Ward. The guy was in everything, and no acknowledgment at all."
Miss in Kiss,"Why is this even news any more? There will always be people missing, there will always be a focus on people that had long film acting careers... They put the full list on the website so that everyone is remembered but the segment doesn't go for half an hour... I'd say they are doing the best they can given they can't make everyone happy."
Miss in Kiss,I get that the Academy has to include a lot of names but the SAG in memoriam has a lot of these names. They even included Kevin Conroy and other voice talent.
Miss in Kiss,"And, they left out Stella Stevens!"
Miss in Kiss,"The one true constant of the Oscars is that people will ALWAYS complain about people who were left out of the in memoriam. Always. It's a tradition of its own at this point, like Boxing Day or Black Friday. ""Complain about the In Memoriam Monday"""
Miss in Kiss,"A podcast I listen to calls this ""getting Farina'd"" after they left out Dennis Farina the year he died."
Miss in Kiss,Cutting multiple times to Lenny Kravitz during a memorial to actors who have died is head scratching.
Miss in Kiss,Was really pissed that they left out Cindy Williams. She was in 2 iconic movies American Graffiti and The Conversation.
Miss in Kiss,Sizemore has a history of drug fueled violence and domestic assault. The Oscars likely overlooked him because of his actions.
Miss in Kiss,You want them to pay respect to the dead when there are Little Mermaid trailers to be pushed?
Miss in Kiss,I prefer the old time with no performer and just look the screen with 4 persons at the time.
Miss in Kiss,Anne Heche wasn’t there either was she?
Miss in Kiss,"Sadly, they had some extra time that they wasted. There’s a pause of the images during Lenny Kravitz’s performance. Instead of including some of these people, they put a placeholder with the words “In Memoriam” right in the middle of the song. It was an awkward few seconds that could’ve been put to much better use."
Miss in Kiss,They had a QR code for people to see the rest online.
Miss in Kiss,">...Olivia Newton-John, the production honored a sadly long list of those who were lost over the past year ...  Among those honored were Angela Lansbury, James Caan, Ray Liotta, Jean-Luc Godard, Irene Cara, Kirstie Alley, Raquel Welch, Nichelle Nichols, and Burt Bacharach, to name just a few.


I was aware welch died the other day, but all the others I had no idea? Feel a little sad about Nichols (I think she was uhura?), very surprised about liotta and alley, either they died relatively young or I'm getting very old. The rest I'm not surprised about, although I have no idea who Irene Cara was."
Miss in Kiss,I'm stunned they left out Gilbert Gottfried.
Miss in Kiss,The Oscars are always super weird about who they put on and omit from the memoriam section.
Miss in Kiss,"Did they show James Caan?  I know he’s on the Memoriam website. If not, that’s a huge snub."
Miss in Kiss,"But, surprisingly, the segment failed to acknowledge some important and well-known Hollywood fixtures. Among those not shown were Anne Heche, star of such films as Donnie Brasco, Volcano and Wag the Dog; Tom Sizemore, most remembered as Sergeant Mike Horvath in Saving Private Ryan; Liotta's Goodfellas costar, Paul Sorvino; and Will and Grace's Leslie Jordan. Also missing was recently honored Chaim Topol, most remembered for his role as Tevye in 1971's Fiddler on the Roof."
Miss in Kiss,I never forgave them for not remembering DeForest Kelley.  He was in multiple movies outside of the Star Trek fame.
Miss in Kiss,"This is a non-story, ""the Oscars did direct viewers to the longer and more inclusive ""In Memoriam"" list on their website, stating that over 200 actors, directors, and executives would be recognized in an extended photo gallery on the Academy’s digital magazine, A-frame."" It would have been one long-ass In-Memoriam segment otherwise."
Miss in Kiss,I wanted to see the person Alec Baldwin shot.
Miss in Kiss,Gay icon
Miss in Kiss,"The names went by so fast, with only two or three getting more than a few seconds. It's not like anyone but those three really got a tribute.  Just list the names and let people screenshot it who want to read them, if a second or two is all people are going to get anyway.  The longer the industry exists, and the bigger it grows, the more people they need to honor (not to mention the last few years seeing more deaths across the board than previously).  They've  reached a point where it's not practical to even keep doing the tribute, because you absolutely have to snub some folks unless you want to just have them fly by on the screen at an unreadable pace, or have the segment take the length of several songs."
Miss in Kiss,"The Oscars-production staff continually insult viewers with their lack of attention to detail. Its a google search for gods sake, a fifth grader could do this research.  The faux care is insulting."
Miss in Kiss,"""Well shit......"""
Miss in Kiss,Still no Tony Sirico
Miss in Kiss,"Imagine being viewed as an authoritative institution of prestige and celebration, but being too good to publicly acknowledge the dead that left their mark. I don't know why people still prop up this marketing and gatekeeping circle jerk."
Miss in Kiss,Why even do it then???
Miss in Kiss,"Tony Sirico wasn’t included, fuckin slander if you ask me.

I won’t be surprised if they don’t include Ignacio Lopez Tarso next year."
Miss in Kiss,If they can’t get it right (and they never do) I honestly wish they’d stop doing it.
Miss in Kiss,Many times the family/estate of the deceased do not give permission for the person to be included or they do not submit the person to the committee.
Miss in Kiss,How fu-king hard is it to go on Twitter and social media and ask for a list of folks who died this past year?
Miss in Kiss,"I did not watch the oscars, I am boycotting them over there lack of morals, last year over will smith, this year over Ukraine, it seams the oscars is just one big advertising commercial for Hollywood, nothing to see here, no real substance."
Miss in Kiss,"Melinda Dillon may have been the biggest omission of all, she was nominated twice for Oscars in her career."
Miss in Kiss,I can’t believe i’m just now finding out Angela Lansbury died. Was that recent? I thought she was still working.
Miss in Kiss,"Tony Sirco and Paul Sorvino being out killed
Me. Loved Paulie in the Sopranos."
Miss in Kiss,No Gilbet gottfried either!
Miss in Kiss,">Will and Grace's Leslie Jordan.

The Oscars are for movies. They couldn't even list a movie Leslie Jordan was in? Maybe that's why he wasn't included?"
Miss in Kiss,That’s why the memorial the SAG awards do are always better
Miss in Kiss,"Does this include whatever tribute the Academy had that wasn't aired?

There was clearly a statement after the segment that stated something like, ""this isn't all, scan the QR code to see the entire tribute in it's entirety.""

Like I get it, these people deserve to be recognized."
Miss in Kiss,"Not even a mention of Tony Sirico. Frankly, I’m depressed and ashamed"
Miss in Kiss,">...and Will and Grace's Leslie Jordan. 

I think if that's the credit they go with, it's kinda an admission that the TV actor didn't belong in a *film* memoriam section."
Miss in Kiss,"I'm not sure why Kirstie Alley was in there.  Besides being a right wing nut job, the only things she was famous for were ruining Cheers and those shitty Look Whose Talking movies"
Miss in Kiss,they werent diverse enough
Miss in Kiss,"I'm so pissed for these dead celebrities who never knew me, and I didn't know most of them even by name. They did so much for humanity by being an actor that it surpasses almost all human achievement. Humanity is dead I tell ya.

/s"
Miss in Kiss,"WHY O WHY WASN’T A GUY FROM A TV SHOW HONORED AT THE OSCARS
-this article"
Miss in Kiss,[deleted]
Miss in Kiss,I was really disappointed that Sidney Poitier wasn’t on the memoriam.
Miss in Kiss,">Heche was not included after her tragic death that came at the end of a lifetime of battling mental health issues.

Didn't she crash her car during a DUI that set someone's fucking house on fire? I can see specifically why they *wouldn't* want to honor someone who literally put others' lives at risk. What fucking world does this writer live in?"
Miss in Kiss,Or as Fox News and boomers put it slacking from work
Miss in Kiss,"Everyone agrees Angela Bassett deserved to be in the in-memoriam instead of all of them!
 
Edit: This was a joke about how she should have won the Oscar, not that I wish she was dead."
Miss in Kiss,"At the end of the presentation, I thought to myself ""Wait, that's it? I think there were more."""
Miss in Kiss,Topol died? Damn. That deserved more attention than it got Oscars or not..
Miss in Kiss,The in memoriam section is kinda like the award for best/most memorable death they always show the most beloved person at the end.
Miss in Kiss,"The Academy wrongly makes decisions as its an industry only awards show. It's much more than that. It's a television program. It's decisions needs to be made as rated program. Any person who the public knows need to be in the in memorial segment. Other individuals, who the public doesn't know, such as a set designer or casting director should be included in their other industry Academy awards dinner."
Miss in Kiss,Bingus
Miss in Kiss,bingus
Miss in Kiss,"ironically, by leaving certain people out, they ensure that the snubbed will be talked about and remembered more than they otherwise would have."
Miss in Kiss,The “Academy” is a joke boys club …
Miss in Kiss,There's every chance the edit had been wrapped and signed off and Tom Sizemore didn't make it having died so recently.
Miss in Kiss,That QR code was super fucking cringey as well.
Miss in Kiss,I'd rather skip actors who spent their careers on screen than the behind the scenes people who the general public never gets to see.
Miss in Kiss,No Tom Sizemore? I can’t put my finger in why.
Miss in Kiss,[deleted]
Miss in Kiss,No rich people
Miss in Kiss,Paul Sorvino?
Miss in Kiss,The article is blocked for me.
Miss in Kiss,They were missing Aaron Carter.
Miss in Kiss,Leaving out Charlbi Dean when she was one of the stars of a film nominated for Best Picture on that same night was a pretty big insult to everyone involved with *Triangle of Sadness*.
Miss in Kiss,Was Anne Heche included? I can’t remember.
Miss in Kiss,"I really appreciate shows doing In Memoriams but it also sucks for those left out and makes it feel even more sad because their friends and family are left going ""were we not important enough?"""
Miss in Kiss,That was the crazy one for me. How on earth is the star of a best picture nom from that year who died tragically young not in the in memoriam.
Miss in Kiss,My suspicion is that she wasn't an official member of the academy. Not sure if that's a requirement to be included but it would explain why
Miss in Kiss,Reading this article was how I learned she died. Hadn’t heard of her prior to watching Triangle of Sadness last week. What a tragedy and a loss. She would have had a bright career.
Miss in Kiss,Especially since the cast and director were in the audience. I can only imagine that lump in their throat they felt when Charlbi wasn't shown up there
Back to 1989,Series is pushed so far out they probably don’t even know what there doing with the series at this point
Back to 1989,It's been Wanda all along
Back to 1989,"Wandavision would have been so much better if Agatha's character had no part in it and they just let Wanda be the villain in the eyes of those around her. Like I'm way more interested in her dealing with the horrible things her trauma led her to do than I am in shifting the blame to some other character who was only just introduced in the franchise. By the final episode when there was just another big battle between people with similar powers just in different colors, I felt really let down.

No shade to Kathryn Hahn though. She's awesome."
Back to 1989,I really liked the Evil Dead parts she had in the last Doctor Strange movies.
Back to 1989,"Too bad the Doctor Strange movie ruined the show’s character development, killing my interest in more of her. I’m not sure how they so deeply squandered the Scarlett Witch storyline, but I’m ready for the whole MCU to find a new direction away from this one."
Back to 1989,Great to hear
Back to 1989,"I love Kathryn Hahn, but I cannot fathom how anybody cares about Agatha, even a little. Or a show about random MCU witches"
Back to 1989,Honestly will take as much Lizzy Olsen Wanda as she can give us after the break. Fast track a Wanda movie maybe
Back to 1989,"Wanda 

^^featuring ^^a ^^cameo ^^by ^^Dr. ^^Strange 

was my favorite recent marvel movie."
Back to 1989,Lmao nobody stays dead in marvel. Fucking ridiculous
Back to 1989,"I just don't see how Wanda could ever be redeemed.  They absolutely butchered her character beyond redemption, murdering people left and right for children that *do not exist*.  It's baffling."
Back to 1989,I'll be back 😎
Back to 1989,"If so, I’ll watch. There’s only a few marvel characters I care about at the moment and the biggest one is the scarlet witch."
Back to 1989,Marvel’s Coven of Forgettable Bloat Spinoffs
Back to 1989,How does anyone possibly give a shit about this
Back to 1989,"The whole Marvel Universe was created by the Scarlet Witch is a dream, she wakes up and just turns out to be ultra imaginative. We are all spared anymore superhero movies/TV. Honestly I tried watching the latest Antman in the cinema and not even Paul Rudd can save that one. Please God no more."
Back to 1989,Dr strange ruined her character.
Back to 1989,"I kinda hope so. I mean we didn't see her die, and she's too powerful to go down like that."
Back to 1989,Refreshing to see a star of the level of Olsen be always interested in returning to the MCU.
Back to 1989,Keep it
Back to 1989,MoM was so bad I think she needs to stay dead awhile and remember the plot of WandaVision.
Back to 1989,I sure hope so because that would be great
Back to 1989,"Does anyone, even a single individual, want or need this series?"
Back to 1989,"Westview didn’t look that great when it went back to normal. If you take away the mind control, I’d rather have Wanda’s version if I was a citizen. 

In fact I believe we should see that sentiment. Some folks hated it, but some people were completely onboard and want it back, at least some version of it."
Back to 1989,"wow, exciting peojects coming up. Can't wait for that IronHeart show as well"
Back to 1989,As long as she eliminates the cheesy hand gestures.
Back to 1989,Agatha does not need a show. What she got in Wandavision is enough. We need more Moonknight. More series like What If... More Ms Marvel.
Back to 1989,"Oh, to F’ing apologize to everyone you held captive and tortured out of your own sick selfishness? Cuz ya still haven’t done that, or made up for everyone you murdered in cold blood shortly after."
Back to 1989,"They need to say phase 4 was in another earth,  have it pan back and we have our heros watching a screen. Seeing what happened in a different world. We could reset the characters and even have the real cap back."
Back to 1989,Another tv show??
Back to 1989,I hope so. We saw a bit of Wanda’s mental trauma in MoM but she didn’t fully melt down like she does in the comics. Agatha could really push those buttons and get us to crazed disassembled/house of m wanda
Back to 1989,Fuck shit just keep her die
Back to 1989,[removed]
Back to 1989,"Now, if you know Lizzie, she didn't know that John Krasinski was in a movie with her in MOM, yet she still went on a full press tour worldwide and is still in denial about it. I love it, really. She is truly a vision. Listen, she deserved to win for her performance in Wandavision, with her portrayal of grief, love, the whole shebang, but this show, I can feel it's going to be the one. However, we all know she should have won that night, but it's cool."
Back to 1989,Such an unnecessary show
Back to 1989,"MCU needs, at least, a five year break to let organic interest resurface."
Back to 1989,God I’ve lost care for mcu now. As a die hard fan I don’t have it in me anymore
Back to 1989,"If it is even happening anymore after Disney and Marvel seem to cut back to ensure better movies and shows.

Just because something became a meme doesnt mean it has to be its own show."
Back to 1989,Bro its an Agatha series they didn't know what they were doing when they even suggested it.
Back to 1989,I will choose if it happen in her past after salam trial. Not after what happen in westview
Back to 1989,Who's been messing up everything?
Back to 1989,"That’s one thing that always got me about the show: Wanda was unquestionably the villain the entire time. She kidnapped, brain-washed and tortured a small town, and somehow the director of the government agency tasked with rescuing her was portrayed as the bad guy. I remember that scene where they’re all like “you’re going to jail!” and the only thing I could think of was “for fucking what?” If anything, that guy was a picture of restraint. 

And the thing that really pissed me off? *She got away with it.*"
Back to 1989,That’s why I was ultimately disappointed with it. WandaVision looked like something completely different within the MCU. So I was dissapointed that the final battle was your average run of the mill superhero fight that you can find in any MCU movie.
Back to 1989,"Uh, Agatha was not what was wrong with Wandavision. A rushed ending is what made Wanadavision bad."
Back to 1989,"Your comment, except Multiverse of Madness would have been so much better if Agatha's character had no part in Wandavision and they just let Wanda be the villain. MoM was bad for a lot of reasons, but the most jarring to me was the hard turn Wanda did from sympathetic hero fighting off her own villain and overcoming her demons to straight up villain who can't figure out that she's destroying countless versions of her sons just for the chance to kill one version of herself and be a mother to one version of her sons for five minutes. They needed to show that transformation on screen, but they didn't want to make Wandavision a show about a villain."
Back to 1989,Agatha was pretty much just there to set up Dr. Strange with the wannabe Necronomicon.
Back to 1989,"You didn't even have to take Agatha out completely.  Wanda goes crazy, discovers Agathas true identify,  blames her, and then Agatha just says ""nah, you did this yourself. I just came to enjoy the show"""
Back to 1989,"That is just the MCU generally, the universe is connected, but very loosely so. Tony Stark essentially gets reset after each of his movies, Ant Man one ends with the main character deciding to really be there for his daughter and not get into trouble, and then goes ""sure why not"" when asked to join a group of internationally wanted people in Civil War."
Back to 1989,"Dr. Strange 2 Wanda is my favorite version of MCU Wanda.

Literally all of the other content with her prior to that movie was complete butchery of the comic character in every sense. Dr. Strange 2 just dropped the pretense of her being a likable character and successfully made her one of the MCU's scariest villains while exploring the time-honored comic trope of ""what if X___ hero turned evil?"". Her portrayal in Dr. Strange 2 was nothing like the comics either, but at least it was interesting and stopped pretending that she's supposed to be the Scarlet Witch we all know and love from the source material.

I'm actually disappointed to hear that they're bringing her back because her meeting her end as a villain who realized she's too far gone was a fitting finale for her character.

EDIT: Lot of folks who did not like Dr. Strange 2 in this thread -- I thought it was one of the best MCU movies in a while, and I thought Sam Raimi really brought a lot to the table."
Back to 1989,Dr. Strange 2 was also just a terrible movie. Most of phase 4 has been beyond awful.
Back to 1989,Curious what part you didn't like with Wanda? She has traditionally teetered between good and evil.
Back to 1989,Yeah they took one of the most sympathetic heroes and had her run around the multiverse murdering innocents. Not sure how you redeem a character like that. Probably better for the MCU to move on
Back to 1989,"The doctor strange movie was so so so bad. I hope they retcon whatever happened with Scarlett Witch there through some sort of Agatha or alternate SW bullshit and just restart from the end of the show. 

Really I hope they ex communicate most of the marvel stuff that has happened in the last two to three years."
Back to 1989,"Welcome to the world of the Marvel Comics, where your favorite characters have become something somewhere murderous asshole and genocidal psycho.

Even Spider-Man ended up selling his marriage to a demon."
Back to 1989,I enjoy the movie but I wish Sam Rami literally watched Wanda Vision before directing…
Back to 1989,"> Too bad the Doctor Strange movie ruined the show’s character development, killing my interest in more of her.

Worse yet, they undid the show's character development *between the show and the movie*, off screen, and just turned her into straight villain."
Back to 1989,"I mean, she's dead. What's to develop?"
Back to 1989,"Just switch to the comics, if MCU at its peak was an 7 then the comics at their peak are a 9. You can skip the characters and arcs you dont like"
Back to 1989,"I don't care about it as part of MCU, but her character was interesting enough I'd give the show a chance"
Back to 1989,"That’s the thing about perspective and opinions.  Others exist outside of yours.  I ,for one, am excited about learning more about a centuries old witch with a stacked cast.  And I also love shows about random witches!  AHS Coven is one of the shows most popular seasons, charmed is one of the most popular shows of its time, as well as Sabrina!"
Back to 1989,"People don't disassociate characters and actors as they should, so when they want one, they also ask for the other.

Edit: can't believe I'm getting downvoted for saying that. It's just the truth yet people pretend it's not. If they like an actor they will ask for them regardless of how good the character is, we have seen plenty of times in all sort of media, specially in cameos or demanding specific actors for characters. 


Same goes for what is considered a good characters, people will cling to them. Super common with comedic characters and anti-hero. 


But none of that means a good actor makes a good character, nor vice versa."
Back to 1989,"You'd be surprised the wonders ""Agatha All Along"" did for her character lol 
I'd argue its massive popularity at the time is directly responsible for the creation of the show"
Back to 1989,"I understand believing the character is dead (because obviously she was “killed off” at the end of Dr Strange 2), but are you saying you thought the actress wouldn’t come back as an alternate universe Wanda, or simply revived with magic?

No way she was getting dropped from the franchise. Actor recognition is way more important for Marvel than story coherence and continuity."
Back to 1989,You didn't see her die. Why think she was dead? They haven't resurrected anyone but Coulson for the TV.
Back to 1989,"If you ever believed Wanda was actually dead, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

She was clearly being set up for a redemption arc, White Vision is still running around unresolved, and we never saw her body. She was always coming back."
Back to 1989,"Like who? Even Wanda’s death is never confirmed. Tony died, T Challa Died, Natasha died, Coulson died (don’t even bring AOS into this conversation, that show is far from canon), Heimdall died, Odin died, etc. Literally most of them stay dead."
Back to 1989,Welcome to comic books?
Back to 1989,"But they did exist. The kids and new Vision clearly could interact and affect the real world. It doesn't at all make what she did right, but they were real."
Back to 1989,"Well technically the kids do exist, just in a different reality. That was the whole point of her role in Dr strange 2"
Back to 1989,She was corrupted by the Darkhold.  It's not much different than Bucky.
Back to 1989,"If it does as well as Wandavision it’d be quite a spin-off!  Forgettable is kinda funny considering Agatha is one of the most talked about spin-offs, controversy and all LOL"
Back to 1989,I do. Its awesome. Been waiting my whole life to see these stories in live action.
Back to 1989,Who doesn’t want more Kathryn Hahn?
Back to 1989,I agree to an extent.  What’s really funny is the fact no one knew westview “disappeared” until Jimmy woo realized his witness protection guy didn’t return his call LOL.
Back to 1989,"if you take away the horrific thing 
where everyone loses all free will and are basically puppets

its nice"
Back to 1989,All three of those things are continuing

Back to 1989,"It's already begun filming. It's not impossible that they'd scrap it, but that'd be pretty unusual."
Back to 1989,This is one of the few marvel shows I'm looking forward to. Maybe if they do another Kate bishop story.
Back to 1989,“We spent how much on She-hulk?!”
Back to 1989,"Seriously, when did Marvel Reddit become so negative?"
Back to 1989,I agree memes shouldn’t get that much attention but I’m legit curious about her character.
Back to 1989,They could axe this and Echo and I wouldn't care a bit.
Back to 1989,I actually think the show is required because the way they ended wanda in Doctor Strange 2 was kinda terrible. We all know she didn't die
Back to 1989,"I honestly respect that route.

I'm a DC fan boy and over the years its got really depressing seeing the level of effort put into recreating great stories.. 

I don't want soap opera type TV series. I enjoyed Smallville as an teen but don't have much interest in that type of series anymore.

The animated movies are honestly the only thing I really look forward to anymore. The writing and story building are fantastic. It's a huge IP. They can afford to put money towards its development instead of putting out low quality series to maximize profit."
Back to 1989,"Unlike HBO, Disney has many guaranteed audiences, eg young kids. So even if the show is not too good, someone will eventually watch it. Disney need the volume. But for HBO, most of their audience are adult, they are less likely to watch shitty show."
Back to 1989,"Idk, any new series with Kathryn Hahn as a lead is good in my book"
Back to 1989,"the show is definitely in modern times and after westview, they converted a mall into 'westview mall' for shooting recently. a bunch of the westview citizens are also confirmed to be in the show."
Back to 1989,It's Wanda!
Back to 1989,"Wandavision *was* Wanda’s villain origin story. Down to a scapegoat to let her blame others, and a group of enablers telling her “they don’t know what you sacrificed.”

The whole thing was purposefully made to set Wanda up as a future bad guy, I don’t know how people think it made her look heroic.

Sympathetic, yes, but not heroic."
Back to 1989,"Got away with it in one sense, but the after credits shows she's falling to the darkhold which would end up with her losing her way and becoming a monster."
Back to 1989,"> She got away with it.

Well...after Multiverse of Madness I would say she got exactly what was coming to her."
Back to 1989,He wasn't really trying to save anyone he was trying to recover vision via any means possible and fired at a child to try to achieve that. So not sure prison is unwarranted but in general agree with the rest of what you said.
Back to 1989,"""It was Agatha all along!""

Catchy song, but how was that true? They clearly show Wanda creating Westview and that she is basically in control the whole time. Agatha intervened so that she could take Wanda's chaos magic, but she never really did anything to any of the inhabitants. They should have leaned harder toward Wanda being the villain in the end with her being arrested and later either becoming a full villain or being redeemed. It's hard to see how that is possible now given the...numerous...murders."
Back to 1989,"> Wanda was unquestionably the villain the entire time. She kidnapped, brain-washed and tortured a small town [...]  And the thing that really pissed me off? She got away with it.

Other ""heroes"" have done far worse things. Where was this flak when Tony Stark created a deathbot that destroyed a country? Or when Clint Barton murdered thousands of people over a five year period? Or when Valkyrie trafficked slaves for the Grandmaster? Or when Natasha considered a little girl acceptable collateral in the course of attempting to kill said girl's father?

> and somehow the director of the government agency tasked with rescuing her was portrayed as the bad guy. I remember that scene where they’re all like “you’re going to jail!” and the only thing I could think of was “for fucking what?” If anything, that guy was a picture of restraint.

Hayward was NOT a picture of restraint. And he also IS a villain. He wanted to resurrect Vision as a sentient weapon, refused to turn Vision's remains over to Wanda and tried to gaslight her, antagonized Wanda repeatedly, attempted to murder Wanda multiple times (firing a missile at her and her kids, sending in White Vision), and also attempted to murder her kids. And that's before other crimes to his name like conspiracy, and misappropriation of government resources."
Back to 1989,"The government guy did shoot at children to be fair, but I agree that it's sad that Wanda's punishment was just feeling guilty for a short time (by the post-credits she was already reading the evil book). 

Although to be fair, I don't think they could exactly put Wanda in jail, she was the most powerful person on the planet basically."
Back to 1989,">That’s one thing that always got me about the show: Wanda was unquestionably the villain the entire time. She kidnapped, brain-washed and tortured a small town, and somehow the director of the government agency tasked with rescuing her was portrayed as the bad guy. I remember that scene where they’re all like “you’re going to jail!” and the only thing I could think of was “for fucking what?” If anything, that guy was a picture of restraint.

No shit it will “get you”, if this is how you twist the events of the show and pretty much ignore what happens. 

Wanda went through a mental break, warped reality and accidentally placed people into a trance in the aftermath of seeing the dissected corpse of her boyfriend. Wanda didn’t know what had happened, or that she was controlling people, let alone hurting people, not until Vision confronted her about it later when she already had her kids and thus was in denial about what was happening because she didn’t want to lose them, and she accepts what he says a day after he tells her anyway. 

Then she accepts she’s hurt people, let’s them all go and puts things back as best as possible. She shows obvious remorse and accepts that the people hate her and that she deserves it. 

The government agent goes to jail because he was a corrupt piece of shit that was trying to use Wanda as a scapegoat for his own dodgy actions. 

He directly violated The Visions will, dissected his corpse and turned him into a weapon. People wouldn’t accept that if it was Steve Rodgers getting dissected for the super soldier serum would they?

Hayward shows no actual concern for any of the inhabitants of the Hex, and only wants Wanda’s magic so he can activate his White Vision.

Hayward literally tries to blow up Wanda and her kids, ignoring Monica’s pleas and point about how they don’t know what will happen to the inhabitants of the town or the hex if Wanda dies. It’s why Monica’s hellbent on getting Wanda to end things peacefully because it’s the best chance, yet Hayward doesn’t care. 

>And the thing that really pissed me off? She got away with it.

Yeah well no shit every hero in the MCU gets away with their dodgy actions.

Were you expecting Stark to get thrown in the slammer for creating a killer AI that destroyed a country and killed countless? Even if the AI was a success it just means the world would have had an AI placing everyone’s actions without the consent of any countries or people aside from Stark. Yet he got off Scott free, better actually as the Avengers who cleaned up his mess in age of Ultron where the ones that suffered the consequences of the accords in Civil War. 

Did you expect Hawkeye to go to prison for killing criminals for 5 years straight? Then has an entire show about covering it up where he kills even more criminals? 

Valkryie who sold people into slavery for years, and nobody in the MCU acknowledges it or gives a shit? 

Black Widow that killed a kid just so she could kill the kid’s dad and go straight and work for shield?

So many other heroes have done worse shit than Wanda yet nobody ever expects them to face consequences, so why does Wanda get singled out? Fuck prior to MoM Wanda never even intentionally killed any humans."
Back to 1989,"One line on the show that rage me so much, deliver by monica.
""they dunno what you sacrificed"" 

For god sake, I fcking hate that line."
Back to 1989,"Yeah, Hayward was not a great person (drone striking Wanda was stupid, rebuilding Vision is creepy and immoral, and shooting at children isn't great regardless of the context), but he wasn't nearly as evil as Wanda was. Wanda knowingly captured and tortured a town full of people. It always baffles me how many people justify Wanda's behavior in the show. And especially the people who are upset that she was the villain in MoM as though it wasn't telegraphed miles away.

That said, of course Wanda was going to get away with it. There's not really anyone on Earth powerful enough to bring her to justice. What do you do, politely ask her to go to prison for the rest of her life?"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Method directing
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"A lot of people in these comments are straight up making things up about what is happening behind the scenes, and not only about this show for some reason."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,This seems cruel to do to cast/crew.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if  he says otherwise. I'm suspecting that some disagreements with HBO will come to light sooner or later."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I mean if they were told before they could be searching other jobs for after the show ended. I would be pissed.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I wonder if this could wind up being a case like where the Closer became Major Crimes after a change of leads, and nothing else."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Boar on the floor.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Either the people involved with this show have just been constantly working us, or it seems like one of the more toxic workplaces out there haha. God damn."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Cant make a finale without breaking a few Shivs
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Someone pointed out that it's probably not a good sign that the main stars couldn't tell that it was a finale' after reading the script........
The Beginning and End of the Universe,There had been rumors before that the show will continue without Cox and it kind of explains why he is happy it's over. It feels like this how Logan would've ended things too.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I don't understand how anyone can watch season 3 and think ""surely there can be a season 5"", they rehashed so much stuff from season 2, Kendall's depression, his flirting with suicide, they undid so much of season 2 for season 3 to even have a plot and they upped Logan's plot armor to a ridiculous degree. They built up that FBI investigation like it was going to be hell for the company and then it was nothing, it served only as a tease to prolong the season and accomplished absolutely nothing. And the Skarsgaard plot point is nonsense one episode they want to buy his company, the next he can buy them... somehow."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Hey, I stopped watching mid season-2. But anyway, didn’t realize Hugo was Fisher Stevens, who amongst other roles was the guy from Shirt Circuit."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"On one hand you get to enjoy working on the season without the feeling of dread knowing it's going to end.

On the other hand, this is cruel for those who need to constantly audition for new jobs and could've missed out on a new gig."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,The cast should have been notified way before the finale to prepare.  I know I would want to know if my job was ending.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"The only reason I'm against them doing this to actors, is they should be given a heads up so they can start looking for their next jobs. I'm sure she will be fine in the long run, but she's not a household name so it will take some work to get the next big thing."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I can't get past the first part of that finale table read quote without GOT PTSD.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,How can you keep successing
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I mean it’s been known for awhile that this is the last season.


Does she not read the news?"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Here is the thing that puzzles me if the cast themselves dont know until the final table read that show wasnt ending it points to me maybe that ending was not really satisfying and deserved
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Must be painful to be snookered like that.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,She doesn’t watch the show if she thought it needed to continue.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Um, I knew it before they began filming. It was announced."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,At least she's got animal crossing
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Well Sarah, keeping you in the dark kept your performance authentic. It’s a lot easier to act like you have no idea, when you truly have no idea."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I am going to miss that juicy butt to be honest
The Beginning and End of the Universe,you’ll live
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Why did the post such a terrible photo? The angle and it’s out of focus. They literally picked the worst one they could find. She’s awesome and I’m sure has some high quality ones they coulda used.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,TIL:   Succession is a TV show that exists. And Sarah Snook is a n actress that also exists.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Trust me, I don’t know how they didn’t know! I was in a pivotal scene and I knew it was the end, just being an extra."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Is it just me or do her facial expressions weird anyone else out.  It’s like she’s always actively trying to show different emotions with her eyes than she is with her mouth.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Is this the ""Snuck a Snook up my snizz"" person?"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Good riddance.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"She’s the worst of the show though so I don’t feel bad, next is the dude that plays connor tbh… dude is mid as heck"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Boohoo. Ffs
The Beginning and End of the Universe,So no one else knew either or did they all just decide she will be the one left out?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Nobody mentioned it on set?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Good god that site is cancer on mobile
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Emotions aside what if you turned another job down during the season?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Snoo snoo
The Beginning and End of the Universe,no more Succession?  who's gonna win all the emmys now?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,And a pretty big loss of $$$$$$$ as well
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I love her sm
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Rooting for you!
The Beginning and End of the Universe,What?! It feels like there could be 2 seasons left in it. It was just really heating up (as far as popularity).
The Beginning and End of the Universe,so when is the spin off staring sarah snook?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I mean sure, but also wasn’t this clear right after last season aired that the coming season would be the last? Or was that only my impression and no one else’s?"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"As a fellow Redditor I can provide some insight about what’s happening behind the scenes. 

If we look at her eyes in that random Getty photo the journalist used, we can see that she is sad that she will not earn a million dollar payday next year.

If we move down to her smile we can see that there was a sense of jealousy that her on-screen husband was Mr Darcy. 

If we look at her cheek, we can further understand that the dynamic on set was strictly business."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"reddit loves pushing their narrative. some guy saying ""some people in the witcher writing room didn't care for the source material"" got spun into ""everyone involved in witchers production except for my boyfriend henry cavill hated the source material"""
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Haven't been to this sub before?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Weird phenomenon all over Reddit, first noted it in the videogame subs.  The conversation drifts a million miles away from discussing the actual subject matter and in to circlejerk narratives about business decisions/behind the scenes stuff.  The most popular version of the moment is ""I didn't like adaptation X so I'm going to say that the creators must hate the subject matter and they wanted to tell an original story but just tacked the IP on to it.  They think they're too good for the IP."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,90% of the shit said on Reddit is made up.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,They may not have known at the beginning of the season.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Maybe it will be fitting with the character’s narrative arcs. Have them stroll through the show with swagger and the confidence that it’ll go on forever, only to have the rug pulled out at the last moment. 

These characters are detestable and I hope their story has an equally upsetting conclusion for them.

Edit: from the comments, I think many of you underestimate the lengths a director or show runner will go to help coax the desired performance out of their cast."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Right? Cruel not just from a story standpoint but now their paychecks are going to stop (correct me if I’m wrong, idk how it works getting paid in tv) or not having a new project lined ip"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I’m sure any working actor you asked would not be surprised by this. Pretty standard Hollywood industry BS
The Beginning and End of the Universe,This is by far the cruelest act of cruelty I have ever heard of. Humanity is done for.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Is there a GoFundMe somewhere to help alleviate their suffering?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Armstrong has been indicating that the show would likely end by the fourth season for some time now, IIRC."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Or just a budget thing since HBO is cutting left and right.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Abrupt?  It's been rumored forever.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Yes disagreements because hbo would slaughter their cash cow. What you are saying makes no sense
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"> The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if he says otherwise.

Sounds like you know the truth and nothing will change your mind, then. Must be nice"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Yea I’d be pretty peeved if I was left in the dark and I could of been searching for other roles.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Reminds me of managers who let go workers and tell them to clean out their desk the same day. In France by law, bosses have to give two weeks notice if they are letting someone go."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Or the Good Wife became the Good Fight
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"That's what it feels like to me. I would've thought actors and their agents would be aware of the near future plans of a show, so they could schedule other projects around it."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"“Emotionally, all of us weren’t necessarily ready to be done with the show because we love each other so much,” she said.

How are you getting toxic workplace from this article? Did you even read it?"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Now they have the material to make a Succession style show *about* Succession!
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I really don’t think the decision for this to be the last season was planned like people are saying and probably came about due to the fallout of actors Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong
The Beginning and End of the Universe,[deleted]
The Beginning and End of the Universe,It says she found out at the table read right? So she found out the first time she read the finale script is how I’m reading this
The Beginning and End of the Universe,That’s not what the article says though.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I’m afraid it’s going to end literally where we began with health issues, everyone fighting and nothing changed."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Yup, honestly I’m concerned that the finale may be rushed and not really feel like a finale at all. 

That’d be beyond disappointing for such a good show, but everything is on the table now with HBO given WBD’s terrible management."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,It wouldnt be but that isn't what it said. Maybe read.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,What are the odds discovery dropped the ax and made them wrap it up after the merger? I swear I “knew” this was supposed to be a five season show. Didn’t the creator say that back in the beginning?
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"The weird thing is the same thing is happening with Barry, it looks like it’s the last season but there’s been no announcement of it being the last season and the cast aren’t allowed to comment on it."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I mean yes and no. 

It’s building up to something I’m sure they just didn’t realize it was the end end. 

they easily could squeeze one more season of whoever inherits the company and it’s downfall with out Logan."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Honestly my completely unsubstantiated conjecture is that this season will end with both Logan and Kendall destroying each other / dying as the series resolution. This removes what sound like the two most problematic and volatile personalities behind the scenes, then the show can continue on with other characters in a rebranded show. Possibly Tom/Shiv/Roman/Greg leading the supporting cast. Since for some reason the powers that be talk about spin-offs and the way this show ended abruptly.. it just seems like they’ll finish the show to let everyone out of contract and then renegotiate for a spin-off that is more or less a continuation."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Half the plots in Succession are sitcom style where they return to the status quo after the plot is resolved. Even though they sell shares, lose power, are the most publicly turbulent company ever, nothing ever really changes for the characters. Logan still seems to control absolutely everything. The one that sticks out to me was with the dick pics thing and how suddenly they put all this pressure on Gerri seemingly to try and force her out, and then next episode it's not brought up, no one seems to have it out for Gerri and no one cares at all."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Fair point. Even the trailer hints at another rehash of the plot of season 3. Basically the kids actually team up this time. 

Which I enjoy but definitely would have liked to see it play out a season earlier."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Agreed with this. I loved Succession so much but season 3 just ain’t it. They flanderized Logan too with all the swearing for no reason. Nothing really happens all season.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"also if i knew it was the last season maybe i savor it

not rushing home at call time but maybe hanging on set etc"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,I mean whatever next move would have been planned. They don't shoot the season back to back they take like 6 month hiatuses or something so if she was going to start a new film franchise or tv show she would have already scheduled that for the hiatus.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,And then she cleaned up her trailer because she is totally OCD
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Well it definitely points to everything being wrapped up in one episode.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Um, what pre-filming announcement would you be referring to? Because it was a big deal when the end was announced 2 months ago."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Ditto for both.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Wouldn’t your work as the extra come after the table read
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Laughably bad takes here.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,Shiv has always been outside the inner circle. Cousin Greg knew…
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Certainly not.

It seemed like last season set up the PATH to the end of the show, but for really popular programs, that’s usually two seasons worth of content. For example, instead of 12 episodes of a final season they’ll do 8/8 split over two final seasons. Such as what Breaking Bad did."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Uhhh not really, and tbh the lack of final season announcement until last month had me pretty convinced we were getting a fifth season as well."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"I dunno.. rich white people drama, mixed in with nepotism isn’t really that compelling these days. It’s a great show. I hope it ends with a bang, quick and easy."
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"yeah, how did I know it was going to be the last season before she did?  They have been telegraphing this as the last season for at least a year"
The Beginning and End of the Universe,All I've read prior to that announcement was the plan was always 5 seasons.
The Beginning and End of the Universe,"Finally, someone who can *actually* give us some reliable insights."
The Beginning and End of the Universe," I look forward to seeing all the clickbait articles on ""SARAH SNOOK JEALOUS OF HUSBAND"""

Jinxed,Desperately needs a showrunner that can tie up plots and give direction. It feels like they just make an episode at a time with no foresight.
Jinxed,"It makes me so sad that Titans gets new seasons confirmed before the previous is even finished airing, but Young Justice is always on the chopping block with a limited budget and the showrunners tweeting to keep watching the show so they can get renewed"
Jinxed,First three episodes of season three were great. Then it’s like they let whoever wrote the terrible ending of season two write the rest of the season.
Jinxed,"I hate this show, but it has a bizarre grip on me.

Everything this show does… is the wrong thing. Characterization, action, story, settings, just everything. And to add salt in the wound, HBO Max has done great with every other DC thing they’ve done. Even Stargirl."
Jinxed,Joseph Morgan is the fucking man.  Klaus is the only redeeming thing I remember about Vampire Diaries.  He was soooo good in that role.
Jinxed,I guess I’m not the only one who can’t stop watching it. I was not expecting it make it to season 4.
Jinxed,I’m in for klaus baby
Jinxed,"Lol the red hood shit and super boy scenes were so cringe.... You got this 5ft guy in a huge mask acting like a bitch all the time, nothing like the real Jason Todd at all.

Then you got this super strong guy acting like a bitch destroying a star ship because his girlfriend's going to leave.... Then 1 episode later he's fine with it.

The consistency of this crap...

Also, why the fuck was the Lazarus bit so dragged out!?"
Jinxed,The last time I saw Franka Potente was Run Lola Run.  Excellent film.
Jinxed,"Lots of haters here. I love it, it’s fun and a different take on the Titans"
Jinxed,The show turn more terible in s3
Jinxed,"Yeah Titans is just Arrow/Flash typical CW garbage with swearing and more blood.

I'm out on that show.

Peacemaker and Young Justice fill my DC itch"
Jinxed,"Titans is a strange show. They do well in casting roles for the most part and their villain choices for the last few seasons have been great and they start seasons fairly strong. Then it just kind of fizzles. Brother Blood and Jinx are interesting choices for S4. I'll probably watch it.

BTW anyone who likes DC content and hasn't seen all of the other stuff from the defunct DC Universe service, check it out. Doom Patrol gets a lot of press already but Stargirl and Harley Quinn are great too."
Jinxed,Dreadful show. Nothing even there for those watching in hopes of nostalgia.
Jinxed,This is one of the few shows that make me irrationally angry.
Jinxed,"Every season, this show just sets the bar lower."
Jinxed,"I felt so bad for Vincent Kartheiser, who's a pretty damn good actor. You can tell he knows that his villain character (in season 2) was written horribly, yet he still managed to elevate the crappy material. I was actually actively embarrassed for him (and the cast members) as I was slogging through/hate-watching season 3."
Jinxed,"After having seen every episode, I have come to a conclusion: they must get rid of handsome boy Dick Grayson. I can’t buy him as a asskicking superhero. This show must have some CW casting people involved because too much of the cast is super good looking. Even Beast Boy is a hunk!"
Jinxed,Doom Patrol is so much better than this show its fucking sad.
Jinxed,Just give us more seasons of Teen Titans (Catron) Darkseid was teased in the series finale
Jinxed,I pray the plot and script is a lot better than last season
Jinxed,I think the problem relies with the budget. They clearly aren’t working with much so they rely on Batman mythos since it’s cheaper than exploring the crazier aspects of the DC universe that the Titans live in.
Jinxed,"I would have said yeah sure after season 2 of YJ, but after season 3 and now 4 I do not feel the same. Sure budget cuts means it kinda sucks by default but I think the show meandered for too long, they should have worked towards a conclusion by now. And I swear the story was bad in season 3 but at least it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.This season's story is painful and the Mars storyarc was total garbage, and their take on racism wasn't only very on the nose but also straight up idiotic."
Jinxed,I feel like they should just renew Young Justice Anyway. I mean people are still finna watch the show regardless.
Jinxed,"Personally both shows have died in quality.  Titans was good for season 1 and then went the WB32 route.

Young Justice was great for the first 2 seasons then the budget died.  Half the show is just still shots to save money on animation.  Terrible voice lines.  Plus the stories are pretty bad.  Like the most recent one with Mars and racism.  It was a 2-3 episode story stretched out to half the season."
Jinxed,Titan's just lets me down consistently.  I want to like it.  The cast is pretty good.  They manage to do a lot with some rather mediocre writing.  A lot of times the fight choreography is solid.  Redhood vs Nightwing was excellent in season 3.  The costumes are really good.  Then the writers just fail and have the characters do dumb stuff to make the plot last.
Jinxed,What a way to fuck up what could have been an incredibly awesome season.
Jinxed,"I’m mad for using the whole Trigon storyline in the first season. That is where they already messed up. I mean the only one from the Titans who can defeat him is Raven, his own daughter. For that to happen she needs character development in both as a person and her powers. They should have used that storyline for their last season. It would have make more sense."
Jinxed,The costumes look really nice though
Jinxed,">Even Stargirl.

Season 1, at least."
Jinxed,Klaus and his siblings were all great in that show. Honestly came across as creatures that had been alive for centuries. Their inclusion was the best thing the show did.
Jinxed,You right. Joseph really nailed that role. Now I can’t imagine anyone else portraying that role.
Jinxed,"Really a ""great taste awful execution"" kind of show."
Jinxed,"It does big streaming numbers regardless of the quality so it keeps being renewed

It sucks but in such an interesting way that I'll keep watching anyway"
Jinxed,I'm pretty sure it's Stockholm syndrome. It's so horrifically bad but I can't stop looking.
Jinxed,It has insanely high viewership
Jinxed,Same. There was something about it that just did not work for me. I guess it works for other people though.
Jinxed,[deleted]
Jinxed,"> You got this 5ft guy in a huge mask acting like a bitch all the time, nothing like the real Jason Todd at all.

Man I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because you are the only other person I've come across who shares this opinion. The Titans sub fawns all over him and his costume, yet all I can see is a malnourished Psycho from Borderlands."
Jinxed,"She was in Taboo https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3647998

I didn't but a lot of people loved it."
Jinxed,She was in the first 2 Bourne movies.
Jinxed,It's shockingly bad
Jinxed,"Is Young Justice actually an engaging, solid watch? I see it thrown around Reddit all the time so started a watch through from season 1… and it’s just, standard kids superhero cartoon. 

I loved the DC animated movie universe, particularly the more mature-leaning stories (JL dark, doom, throne of Atlantis, flashpoint, etc), but this just isn’t doing it for me so far. Give it more time maybe?"
Jinxed,I watch it for Ryan K Potter (Beast Boy) but even krypto gets more screentime than he does.
Jinxed,Your not alone.
Jinxed,I don't think budget is the reason behind some really glaring issues in the writing.  They have Dick Grayson run around in civilian clothes doing Nightwing stuff yet they have a Nightwing costume he could be wearing.
Jinxed,"I’m fairness only Season 3 really leaned in to the Batman mythos. Season 1 & 2 we’re Titans stories and looks like 4 is going back to that.

Season 3 would have been great if they cut like 4 episodes in the middle. The beginning and end were pretty tight."
Jinxed,It was literally 4 episodes of what will be a 26-episode season. It's not even half of the half that has currently aired.
Jinxed,Show just needs to clean house in the writing room . At least this season has stronger villains and ones front teen titans lore instead of Batman villains
Jinxed,It makes sense for that to be the first story.  I’m the comics Trigon was literally the first arc and that was how Raven brought the team together.  The problem is that the show mishandled it.
Jinxed,S2 is solid - they did a great job with Eclipso and The Shade IMO. And S3 looks promising with Keith David voicing Mister Bones.
Jinxed,"I like season 2 better, honestly. Shade is the coolest guy in any room."
Jinxed,"and thats why the originals was much better than TVD, found it more mature yknow?"
Jinxed,"There's something about this show that makes me convinced that there is greatness lurking within, and I watch (and enjoy) it based on that. It's so strange."
Jinxed,It's like a high budget CW show with slightly better terrible writing.
Jinxed,It's one of those shows where you're ashamed to tell people you watch it.
Jinxed,Same as the later seasons of Smallville
Jinxed,Joseph Morgan’s character from the vampire diaries
Jinxed,"Hahaha lmao, I agree so hard on the borderlands guy. 

Also that bit when Dick Grayson gets shot because Red Hood is suddenly the hero now....the kid who shoots him....his voice is hilarious! 

Squeeky little munchkin voice ""I did this for you! Red hood!!""

I watch this with my girlfriend just to laugh at how bad it is....

What the fuck was up with that batman casting lmao, love that actor but never did I go, oh yeah he's a total Bruce Wayne!!"
Jinxed,You're definitely not the only one.
Jinxed,"I'm a bit biased because I'm a DC nut but Young Justice is worth sticking with it a little longer.

The first 5 or so episodes are kind of a kids cartoon but it evolves into a more serious and mature show as it progresses. It doesn't feel like a kids show to me. 

I love it because it feels to me most like a comic book come to life. They follow my cardinal rule for superhero success which is to translate the characters from the comics onto the screen. Justice League / Unlimited had the same idea.

Also, I'm a pretty awesome tv watcher. Seen everthing from The Wire to Buffy to Justified to Mr Robot ie all of the classics.

I've only enjoyed peak GOT more than Young Justice."
Jinxed,"YJ really finds its voice in the back of s1, but I agree that it feels generic at the start."
Jinxed,Beast Boy should never have left Doom Patrol
Jinxed,">Season 3 would have been great if they cut like 4 episodes in the middle. The beginning and end were pretty tight. 

S3 would've been great with a different writing team. This show sucks."
Jinxed,Isn't WarnerMedia being put up for sale as we speak?
Jinxed,"Plus Sportsmaster and Pat's weird friendship is entertaining as fuck, and I'm pretty excited to see more of him."
Jinxed,I’ve never actually watched it. I think by the time it came out I was so annoyed by TVD that I couldn’t be bothered to revisit the world. Did give Legacies a go recently before dropping it a few episodes in once k realized the love interest was there to stay.
Jinxed,"Sometimes you get moments like Krypto the Superdog catching an RPG in midair and 360 no-scoping a bunch of LexCorp mercs; other times you get villains who can't land a single hit against Oracle/Batgirl in a wheelchair, but for some reason is still considered a threat."
Jinxed,"They almost always start off strong on all fronts, then somewhere in the middle of the season they muck it up. Hell the UtRH storyline was rushed af but i'm not gonna lie, it still started of really well.

The writing team has talent, they just need a showrunner who can provide proper direction, and reign them in. Also production minus CGI is pretty dope."
Jinxed,Superman and Lois is actually much better than this
Jinxed,"What makes it even sadder is that Stargirl is a better show than Titans. And compared to Titans, Stargirl feels more like a baby. At least when comparing the vibes of both shows."
Jinxed,I’m sorry I enjoyed parts of it. I’ll do better next time.
Jinxed,"i would give The Originals a chance tbh, elena isnt crying every other episode since she isnt in it thankfully"
Jinxed,I don't think I quite grasp the first sentence here.
Jinxed,Oracle in a wheelchair is very formidable in the comics
Jinxed,"Stargirl, Superman and Lois, Peacmaker, and Doom Patrol are the good DC shows in my opinion.

Oh and Swampthing got cancelled to soon."
Jinxed,Is it sad? I watched Stargirl s1 in two sittings and had a great time.
Jinxed,"I criticized the writing, not your enjoyment. Act like a victim about it though."
Jinxed,I might pick it up once I get though everything else on my watchlist.
Jinxed,[Then watch it here](https://youtu.be/pdqZSbr78IE?t=95)
Jinxed,"> Act like a victim about it though.

I love the backhanded slap of this reply."
Jinxed,The documentary came out 6 years ago... that's how slow our legal system is here. I'm surprised that frail old dude is still alive to be convicted.
Jinxed,One of my favorite moments in all of television history was when he was confronted with the envelope with the matching handwriting and he started burping and shitting his pants 😂
Jinxed,"Long overdue. Killed his wife,neighbor, and best friend. He'll die in jail and that's better than he deserves."
Jinxed,"Let his be a lesson to everyone.

No matter how rich and powerful you are you’ll be convicted after murdering multiple people over 40 years when you’re just about to die."
Jinxed,Good.
Jinxed,"Maybe I’m remembering it wrong but didn’t he boast at one point about how he would never be convicted?

Like on the level of O.J. Simpson‘s book “If I Did It”"
Jinxed,One of the best documentaries I've ever watched. The scene where he's in the bathroom and forgets he's wired with a mic is incredible.
Jinxed,21 years later after he had a trail of bodies behind him? Some justice ! RIP Susan
Jinxed,No bribing of the jury this time?
Jinxed,"Wow, Chauvin aged fast in prison!"
Jinxed,Lol. I watched first ep last night. Now I know
Jinxed,He looks like a live action Mr. Burns
Jinxed,About damn time.
Jinxed,Doesn’t he have mental illness?
Jinxed,Why took so long to get. Conviction the guy’s clearly a   Psychopath and these Lawer all in get his money’s try to defend him ! American system is such a joker
Jinxed,His family is as rich as it gets. I’m amazed it even went to trial and amazed he got convicted - his brother is really rich and hates him and also doesn’t want to share the family wealth
Jinxed,"I still quote this doc



Bobby D was that funny, he is so matter a fact for a murderious creep"
Jinxed,"I was also confused why it's taken so long but reading the [Wikipedia history of the trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Durst#Trial_2), it makes sense. Basically, several delays based on;

1. Hurricane Harvey
2. Expanding volume of evidence
3. COVID-19"
Jinxed,???
Love Family,I'll watch it if it doesn't have a laughtrack.
Love Family,Great show 👌
Love Family,You’re in luck. Bonus too that it doesn’t have catch phrases either. 
Love Family,I'm watching the first episode right now.
Love Family,"There are definitely catchphrases, but they are great. OKSEEYOU!"
Love Family,"If he can make selfies and post them on Instagram that's good sign. Get well, Jeremy."
Love Family,wonder what that chest pad is under his shirt? big surgical bandaid to keep any sutures or wounds from sticking to his clothes?
Love Family,"One tough SOB. He’ll undoubtedly take his time but, man, his comeback film or series is going to garner a lot of eyeballs. Hope he’s given the space he’s needed to heal because there’s no doubt he has top notch care."
Love Family,What happened to him?
Love Family,[removed]
Love Family,Apparently it's like a gigantic chest bandaid thing that doctors use after surgery in that area. Makes sense since he had major chest trauma in addition to a fucked up leg.
Love Family,"Snowplow accident, it ran over him. The article has all the details."
Love Family,"Im not saying it was Yelena, but it was Yelena"
Love Family,"Damn, that's rough"

Love Family,"My boyfriend doesn’t like “that British shit” but that’s like 50% of what I watch. I do find him enjoying the heck out of Taskmaster, though."
Love Family,"My cousin ""hated"" Vice Principals and simultaneously was pushing to finish it ASAP."
Love Family,Letterkenny
Love Family,The Sopranos
Love Family,"My wife watches downton abbey and the crown as her repeat comfort shows. I do not care to get thoroughly involved in watching it, but if it’s on when I come in the room, I’ll stop to watch for a while.

My wife insists she can’t stand Brooklyn 99 and futurama, but she laughs often whenever I have them on."
Love Family,basically any show about teenagers/high school my husband will complain I want to watch then he ends up getting all into whatever drama is happening. A couple good examples off the top of my head have been Veronica Mars and Never Have I Ever.
Love Family,"I once had all of the audio from the table readings from this show on a stack of RW CDS, losing them was one of the saddest things I can think of now but I was a dumb kid.  I was friends with one of the main technical leads on the show Sal Mallimo when it was being aired.  He was so proud of that show and once showed me why audio is the first most important step in production.  I'll never forget that."
Love Family,My wife says she gets annoyed at king of the hill but every time it’s on I catch her getting invested.
Love Family,My wife was at least as into Falling Skies as I was despite the horror elements being significantly over her usual tolerance threshold.
Love Family,My room mate was watching love island. She started with Australia. I was solidly indifferent. When she started UK it got its hooks in me. Still not a fan of other countries but something about the UK version is *chef’s kiss*
Love Family,"My wife hates South Park, but laughs at it all the time when it’s on"
Love Family,Dang I love that British shit. I don’t understand all the references in it but I catch enough.
Love Family,Are you US? I always wonder how things like peep show etc translate over there lol
Love Family,"I am but I haven't seen peep show. I like to watch some of the panel shows, Would I Lie to You is my favorite. I remember one joke I had to look up because I just didn't get it but everyone on the show thought it was so funny. The premise was that David Mitchell was claiming that there was an elephant at the zoo who was infatuated with him, and he said something like ""The only person who was with me every time was my friend Kevin the bun-seller""  
  
The joke has several layers of cultural differences. First of all, I guess there's a stereotype over there that elephants like buns or sticky buns or sweet buns, I'm not sure what you call it but I don't even know what that is. I'm thinking it's similar to a cinnamon roll or something like that. But here the stereotype is that elephants like peanuts. We also wouldn't really use the word 'seller.' So for the joke to work here the punchline would be ""The only person who was with me every time was my friend Kevin the peanut salesman'' (still doesn't make total sense because I haven't ever heard of a peanut salesman)  
Usually I wouldn't actually look up a joke, I would just be ok with sort of getting it. But that one killed and I had to know why.  
  
I actually had a work friend (or a mate, if you prefer) from England visit recently and some of the most fun conversations were around what we call different foods.  
  
Sometimes I binge these shows for so long that my internal monologue turns British and when I speak I'm surprised that it still comes out American."
Love Family,"If you like David Mitchell you would likely enjoy peep show too as that’s him, it’s from the mid 2000’s so a bit dated but very much British humour :) I think they are making an American version but if utopia is anything to go by it won’t be good.

I actually had to ask my SO about that joke because I was kinda confused too (I’m Scottish, he is English), and he said it’s about imperialism which is probably why it got such a laugh from the panel. The bun thing is apparently to do with the English feeding elephants in India or something when they were over there being horrible, which if that is the background of the joke would be very much a David Mitchell thing to say lol Another good show is Friday night dinner if you haven’t seen that, it’s not David Mitchell but it is very much British 

I love comparing US to UK too, the differences are both small and big at the same time lol also food wise, some US food sounds soooooo weird, like sweet potatoes and marshmallows? Crazy stuff lol"
Love Family,"I think I will check out peep show then, I've heard the name now that I think of it but I didn't know what it was. But I've never seen David Mitchell and not enjoyed him. Thanks for further explaining the joke, it's wild that after all the research to I did to understand it I was STILL missing context. 

Another thing I think is kind of silly is that here we act like the English people are the ones who speak English weird, as if we're the ones who invented the language and they're the ones messing it up."
Love Family,"It’s worth a watch, I hope you enjoy it! It’s on channel 4 online for free and on Netflix too (UK though so might be different in US and idk if you can access channel 4 there). 

Haha about the English language thing, it’s a common joke here that Americans hate spelling because of words like “colour” lol and English might be called English but a bunch of it is from Latin and Ancient Greek anyway so no one really created it. Of all the weird things, the strangest to me is probably that Americans have guns but don’t allow some European cheeses for the “health risks” which I just find kind of insane (not trying to start an argument about guns, I just think blue cheese is clearly safer than a gun)"
Love Family,I'm Australian and understand the humour.
Love Family,"Non-Italian here, I always found Romano's comedy unremarkable so I never watched ""Raymond"" but in recent years I've liked the guy in dramatic roles.

By the way, I'm a big Sebastian Maniscalco fan if that tells you anything."
Love Family,"Not Italian and enjoyed the show. Most of their tropes were universal, at least to Americans."
Love Family,"That show is about as Italian as eating at Olive Garden.  It's based on creator Phil Rosenthal's family, who is Jewish.  Doris Roberts is Jewish and Peter Boyle is Irish American."
Love Family,I did and in NYC. I think I have members of my family that correlate to every member of Ray's. It's not at all inaccurate. Pretty typical Italian-American family in the North-East.
Love Family,I’d assume non-Jews like Seinfeld so same thing
Love Family,Yeah. We're familiar enough with the stereotypes. We don't have any Italian in our family and watched it religiously as a kid. I'm not even sure if my parents have met an Italian person.
Love Family,Love it.  Irish  American here.
Love Family,Im not Italian & I usually enjoyed  that show. I don't think it's limited to Italian Americans either. I think a lot of Americans families are like the Barones.
Love Family,I go through phases with sitcoms where I love or hate them. I went through a phase where I really liked the show but I think if I did a re watch it would annoy me.
Love Family,nah
Love Family,I know that my mom liked it but it wasn't ever something that I watched and not a show that I would stop on and watch if I was flipping the channels.
Love Family,"As an Italian who grew up in a large multi-family Sicilian community, I never enjoyed the show at all and really never found it funny."
Love Family,What? Italians don't even like that show. It's garbage.
Love Family,"I'm a WASP (WAS, anyway), and I'd have killed myself if my family acted like that."
Love Family,"I don't love the show, but it has it's good moments. I never really considered it Italian-American specific to be honest, most of the characters seem pretty universal; over bearing mother(in-law), grouchy old man/dad, man-child, unappreciated/ignored wife, and loveable loser. You can find one, or all of these stereotypes in so many cultures. 

For context, I'm British, and the characters are all familiar stereotypes of people I know/have known, who were not Italian-American, Italian, or American."
Love Family,I liked the show. Funny is funny :-)
Love Family,"My grandfather was a rural New England Irish-American and ""that Raymond feller"" was his favorite sitcom."
Love Family,"I loved this show, one of my favourite sitcoms ever, I'm British btw"
Love Family,"Excellent in ""Made for Love""."
Love Family,Well the show is *literally* his family. He married Ygritte.
Love Family,"Should've also tossed in a ""I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve."""
Love Family,"> **I love this show more than I think anything.**

bro you're married"
Love Family,Thank you Kit for your all great work. You played Jon very well and I seriously couldn’t think of any other playing him.
Love Family,"Say what you will about D&D but damn that was cute af when he told Kit ""thank you for being you"" :')"
Love Family,He will always be My King in the NORTH!!!!!
Love Family,I hope Kit is OK & gets the help & treatment he needs
Love Family,"I feel for the guy.... Goes straight from acting school to (what eventually turned out to be) the biggest show on television.  He's still relatively young, especially considering this is all he's known. Jon Snow was an amazing character, and Kit is an awesome guy. I wish him the best in the future."
Love Family,"I cannot imagine the emotional letdown after being on the wild ride that is GoT and then it stops. All the friends and habits you’ve had for years are ended in that form. Some people you may keep in touch with (or even marry) but that whole way of life is over, not just the role."
Love Family,The Last Watch was a surprisingly compelling piece of television. I would advise anyone still upset over the writing choices over the last couple seasons to watch this special and conclude your GoT experience on a high note.  Worked for me.
Love Family,"Maybe it's all fake (I don't think it is) but everyone involved in this show seems like really cool nice people. Just a perfect storm of chill grateful down to Earth folks.

And yeah, that includes the two devils."
Love Family,DAKINGADANORF!
Love Family,Loved that documentary. Watching him get emotional reading the script when (spoilers) was really touching.
Love Family,"If you haven’t seen this documentary yet you should watch it. No matter what your thoughts on season 8 were the documentary shows how much work goes into it. It’s a beautiful documentary that focuses on the people it should. The extras, the make up department, the director etc etc. People who the show could not be made without. Of course some of the cast is highlighted but I loved the focus on the unknown talent behind the scenes.

Def worth a watch.

Edit: sorry folks. It’s called Game of Thrones: The Last Watch"
Love Family,Maybe he was wrong & will be in a show bigger than *Game of Thrones*.
Love Family,KEEEEEEET!
Love Family,"I can't even begin to process what this means to Kit.  I want to hug him so bad and let him cry on my shoulder.  How does one finish a show like that, then just walk away?  I really hope he's ok..."
Love Family,Imo Jon Snow could carry a new show
Love Family,This makes me think of the time I watched all the 'behind the scenes' footage on the Fellowship of the Ring and one of the Star Wars prequels. This GoT footage shows them to be just like the FotR crew...there's lots of love being shown there. The Star Wars crew seemed so bored and intimidated by George Lucas. There didn't seem to be much love there at all.
Love Family,He's wrong. Theres no way GOT is the greatest thing he ever does. Up and up Kit
Love Family,"I know it may not be the time or place, but damnnn hes really attractive"
Love Family,I absolutely love seeing someone being passionate about something. He is now an immortal legend in fantasy/pop culture.
Love Family,"Sorry, Rose."
Love Family,"I've worked on a lot of live events that involve big productions. Lots of people, myself included, get the post-show blues. It's like a huge part of your life has concluded, and all of the mates you've bonded with will all go their separate ways.

I can't imagine the level of blues these guys are going to go through now."
Love Family,"As fans and viewers of the show, we will always be able to live it again.  He will never get that experience again."
Love Family,King of The North!
Love Family,Seems like a good bloke. I’d look forward to seeing him in a different role.
Love Family,We love kit.
Love Family,So r/freefolk started a movement supporting Emilia Clarke’s charity which I plan to do with my next paycheck. Does anyone know how we can support Kit given his recent times of adversity? Jon Snow was my favorite character on GoT and I’d love to offer Kit some support for all he has done on this show to impact mine & others’ lives.
Love Family,"Awesome guy. Obviously has a big heart. Hopefully he can grow a thick skin around it and don't let the retards get to him and ruin him, like it happened with so many other actors before him."
Love Family,"If the end of the show has impacted him so badly he has sought help, I suspect he has ""adjustment disorder"". Not an easy thing to deal with. Its like heartbreak, death of a loved one, depression and lack of direction, all rolled into one sweet mental horror loop.

Time, and support, and hopefully many, many more great roles will come his way to help him get over this stage in his life."
Love Family,"I'll admit, this broke me a little..."
Love Family,The words of a true king
Love Family,"Jon Snow in movie, Jon Snow in real life."
Love Family,Goddammit I want to hug him to now. ;(
Love Family,I felt more emotional watching this than the actu- okay you know what I was gonna say.
Love Family,"Nerd culture really needs to do some introspection; it’s become so toxic.

I understand not liking something, or having criticism of something you claim to love, but let’s not forget the people behind it. These actors, directors, crew, etc. have literally devoted a decade of their lives to bringing this whole thing to life, for really nothing more than providing us with entertainment. And in response over a million butthurt armchair writers choose to invalidate all of that, and make a petition to demand it be made again until they are satisfied with it (and we saw the same thing with Sonic). 

We’re finally at a point where nerdy stuff has become some of the most beloved and celebrated content we have the privilege of experiencing, and yet each and everyday the fandoms around that content is becoming more fragmented and elitist. 

It’s as if everyone has forgotten that we’re meant to actually enjoy the things we love."
Love Family,"As a smart man from a little town in Canada would say, ""Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life"""
Love Family,"Let's do a Jon Snow spin off series, if Kit feels up to it seems like a win win for everyone."
Love Family,"""See ya later, fuckin cunts."" - Rory McCann, last day on set"
Love Family,Awww. Sweet Prince.
Love Family,"Well shit, with a lead like that *I'd* follow him into battle."
Love Family,I love how much he loved it. I hate how D&D fucked it up. I loved it to Commander.
Love Family,A RIGHT PROPER LAD!!!
Love Family,"I figure most of the younger people will go the way of Star Wars, maybe one break out and the rest will make a living."
Love Family,Now I know why he checked into a depression/alcoholic center. He's probably still dealing with it.
Love Family,Upon hearing this quote I can understand why he took the criticism of the craptacular last season so personally.
Terrace House: Aloha State,I am Canadian but my best friend got me hooked on terrace house and aloha state and the greatness that is that show. Would love to help you out! 
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Whenever they base reality shows in Hawaii, especially Oahu, they never leave the touristy areas, or if they do, are super careful not to show how shitty some of the areas are. Is this show more of the same? "
Terrace House: Aloha State,Viewer from the US here! I would love to talk with you about the show if your willing. I've seen both Boys and Girls in the City and Aloha State. 
Terrace House: Aloha State,"US fan here- watched B&GiTC and AS, starting on B&GND and waiting for OND release. Happy to help, best contact via DM on twitter @gemidelux"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"show in Japan = pretty good.  The new series on Netflix.  

show in Hawaii = not very good.  

The only reality in the show is the interactions of the cast. No, they never show any reality in Japan or HI. It's not about the world outside their house, not really. Everything is carefully edited."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"OK, good to know. I respect the hell out of Dwayne Johnson's Hawaii sketch on SNL because it's all about how parts outside of the tourist areas can be shitty. We used to be the meth per capita leader in the US IIRC. "
Terrace House: Aloha State,"For any of you seeing this saying “What’s the Owl House? Should I have known about this? Is it any good?” the answers to your questions are “One of the best cartoons ever made, accessible to adults and kids alike. Not necessarily, Disney undermarketed it due to disputes with the creator over things like lgbt inclusion, only to discover that when it hit streaming it steadily accrued a massive fan base through word of mouth. And yes, it is very good.”"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Unfortunately, thanks to iTunes and Disney Channel's continued ineptitude... the episode leaked 16 days early.

So a word a warning to those who still can:

#**AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS**"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"This post really makes me sad, since it highlights the poor marketing Disney is giving the series. 

It's been [known](https://twitter.com/DisneyAPromos/status/1600624288855658496) for nearly a month, yet there are still people out of the loop/it wasn't established enough to get hype. This, coupled with iTunes leaking it, will hurt it when it ultimately airs."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Looking forward to this. Will be terribly sorry to see the show end though, it really hit a hell of a stride."
Terrace House: Aloha State,[removed]
Terrace House: Aloha State,Neat. Can't wait.
Terrace House: Aloha State,S3 taking so long to drop and in 3 chunks makes me just give up on it. It's not as good as Amphibia or GF but it sucks S3 is getting such a shit treatment.
Terrace House: Aloha State,Didn’t they cancel it?
Terrace House: Aloha State,I would also argue that the latter half of S2 was as true an heir to the good episodes of Buffy as I've seen. The sense of genuine desperation against the terribly high stakes hits that same bittersweet note.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"It's very weird to me how persistently iTunes Canada, specifically, leaks *everything*, from Disney shows to indie albums. I used to be a music blogger, when that existed, and they were *notorious* for it even then."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Do not go on YouTube and any socal media storm since there are filled with spoilers for that special!
Terrace House: Aloha State,"What ever you do, stay off the internet for the next two weeks. The special got and people are already posting screenshots and reuploads."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Sort of, but yeah. Instead of an actual season 3, there are three final extra long specials to wrap up. 

This one is the second of the three, and then there will be one final later one."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"> A cause of death was not immediately clear. However, the most recent update on her Instagram story on Friday featured a photo of her with her cat, with a caption that reads “goodbye.” She had also recently posted a series of troubling tweets, one of which, according to a fan translation, read that she didn’t “want to be a human anymore.”

>“Thank you to everyone who supported me,” read another message, which also implied that she had been cyberbullied. “I love it. I’m weak, I’m sorry."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Twitter was a mistake. Poor girl.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"I doubt this is solely the result of the laundry incident on terrace house.

I've seen a bunch of the japanese twitter posts showing years of abuse from a couple of accounts that were pretty much daily asking her when she's going to die and shit like that.

I imagine the extra attacks regarding terrace house, lack of wrestling shows to participate in due to COVID and a bunch of other shit in her life has caused this.

It's really sad, my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to watching the rest of Terrace House season and Hana was one of our favourites."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Cyberbullying is no joke. Just because you do not care about cyberbullying doesn't mean others can cope with it. I hope the people who wrote those messages knew they just indirectly murdered a person.
Terrace House: Aloha State,It's been a rough week for pro wrestling. RIP Hana
Terrace House: Aloha State,"She had all the potential in the world. Sky was the limit. A charismatic performer and a extremely talented wrestler. I knew people had been sent to check on her and heard she was ok. Relieved, I then sat my phone down for an hour only to come back and get hit in the face with the news. Gutted. I can't imagine what the Stardom family is going through. R.I.P Hana."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Oh my god. She was so young. Wow.
Terrace House: Aloha State,I love TH and cannot believe this. It is such a sweet show.
Terrace House: Aloha State,[deleted]
Terrace House: Aloha State,"That’s sad, geez"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Holy fuck, she was one of the nicest people to ever be in the house.."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"That truly sucks.

This is one of the few shows my wife and I watch together and we both loved her."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"So sad that it ended like this.  She was very fun to watch on Terrace House and even though there was some controversy, it was never meant to be serious and the internet overreacted as usual."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Hana Kimura plays a bad girl in Terrace House, and the actors and producers keep saying the tv show is genuine, although this is quite clear that they make drama happen.
Anyway Hana washed her clothes and forgot one item that was very dear to her. I’m not totally sure but I think it’s a piece of clothe related to her pro wrestling career. Another guy of the house didn’t see it in the washing machine and did his own laundry which caused Hana’s clothe to shrink. She got batshit mad at the guy like the 22 years old kid that she is.
And Japan, as usual overreacted and started bullying her in twitter mostly. There is a tweet that has been now removed saying that the world would be better without her and she liked it before killing herself.

After her death the Japanese football player Keisuke Honda wrote about how people were gutless for bullying a weak person and that they should aime at strong targets like himself. Which is super disturbing but the guy is a professional troll."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Holy shit. 

National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"So sad for people who can’t find support, suicide hurts everyone."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"I am so sad, she was my favorite, such a joyful personality."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Twitter is such an awful place. I sincerely hope it’s shut down. Rest In Peace.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"If in fact she did commit suicide, I feel like whatever country she is from should be able to trace any cyberbullying and prosecute for it. People have to learn to be more loving towards each other. So many people genuinely suck."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Rest In Peace Hana Kimura. Such a tragic loss
Terrace House: Aloha State,That’s awful. :( the poor girl she must have been going through such turmoil.
Terrace House: Aloha State,The people who drove her to suicide should ALL be held accountable!!!
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Reality TV has dominated TV for 20 years now. Haven’t watched a minute. So glad.

What I do know is that 95% of former contestants on reality shows regret it and caution others.

Editing is so slick these days and the viewer can’t tell. Whole conversations can be contrived. It’s too late, you’ve already signed off legally.

Then Social Media has its day with you."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Look up dead wrestler of the week/month. It’s insane how many wrestlers have died.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"hope she get better place. RIP Hanaさん
I just don’t like how the bullies took her life."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Such a talent in the ring as well. It was great to see her become so good over the last couple of years...RIP
Terrace House: Aloha State,RIP. I hope she found her peace.
Terrace House: Aloha State,rip
Terrace House: Aloha State,Wow this is shocking I just finished the last part too RIP Hana.
Terrace House: Aloha State,Poor lady. If only she was able to get the assistance she needed.
Terrace House: Aloha State,It s extremely sad cause she was projected next top star or ace for Stardom
Terrace House: Aloha State,Cyber bullying is stupid needs to stop
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Holy shit! Can we just start taking care of one another and lifting each other up? If you are a bully online or off, you need your ass kicked."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Fuck, this is sad. Hana was a good one"
Terrace House: Aloha State,A fact Very sad I don't know what say about. RIP Hana Kimura!
Terrace House: Aloha State,Sad.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Was Her death to due the Cyberbullying attacks on the social medias?

Look at video on Youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqo43SIrfRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqo43SIrfRs)"
Terrace House: Aloha State,Disgusting. Social media users should be hunted for sport.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"*I should have killed myself hundreds of times ...* 

# many people do everything they can to preserve bullying, especially in its worst form: physical and material"
Terrace House: Aloha State,Omg no.. why would anyone bully her?? Shocked. RIP ❤️
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Damn RIP 

She was so fun to follow and a great member of the community"
Terrace House: Aloha State,"What's truly said is all these comments justifying bullying by saying ""people who commit suicide are weak.""

The fact is, it's weak minded to think that about anyone that feels suicidal, or commits to killing the self. You don't know the mental weight they were under, and just because you've never felt pushed to kill yourself, doesn't mean they were weak for doing so."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Rest Easy Hana 🙏💔
Terrace House: Aloha State,She’s so beautiful and watching videos of her talk she seems like an emotional person. Wish someone could have helped her before things started going south. This makes my heart ache.
Terrace House: Aloha State, May that beautiful lady rest in peace.
Terrace House: Aloha State,Rip. Gone too soon
Terrace House: Aloha State,Reality TV and Ratings (social media count and community) interaction...therein lies the problem: expectations.
Terrace House: Aloha State,Reality TV and Ratings (social media count and community) interaction...therein lies the problem: expectations.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"This really made me sad. I don’t watch reality tv shows the way people do but I religiously watched this show and for this current season, she was my favorite. She was so nice, beautiful and sweet girl. I just feel like there is a terrible online bullying culture in Japan that have not been addressed well. I see the same thing in South Korea too. I hope they do something about it soon because this is ridiculous."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Oh no, that's fucking terrible. 22? Goddamn. Rest in peace..."
Terrace House: Aloha State,This news reminds me of Hannah Baker from 13 reasons why. The names of both (Hana and Hannah) are quite similar as well.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"It really upsets me to see this. I learned so much from her by watching Terrace house. I cried with her and could relate completely with her feelings, so young, so beautiful, just great as a person and with a bright future.   
Rest in peace."
Terrace House: Aloha State,sax
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Very sad, she was so pure and honest."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Poor girl, cyberbullies committed murder."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Unless you have felt this way I just dont think you can understand (not to gatekeep suicidal depression its just hard to explain)

I didnt know who she was but its sad that she felt that way and Im sorry she had to go through that.  I cant imagine what its like especially with the 'world' of twitter anway saying horrible things to you all the time and being hated.  


I hope for her now that all of her problems are gone and she is at peace in some way."
Terrace House: Aloha State,Omg this is heartbreaking. Hana you were such a sweet being
Terrace House: Aloha State,[removed]
Terrace House: Aloha State,"I am so sad about Hana, she was one of my favorites on the show - I thought she was so pure and genuine. I think she was disappointed in Kai for many reasons and her anger stemmed from a loss she felt at the possibility of something with him being over in her mind. (She had also been unsuccessful with/let down by Ryo so her anger could have been a build-up even from that.) Kai’s flubbing the laundry situation was just a catalyst. I came here to see if anyone had any more information on whether any of her Stardom cast members tried to get to her or help her after her (cry for help) Twitter posts. I lived in Japan for a few years and it is very common for people to be very hard on themselves and not reach out for help. Shame at any failure to deliver, or letting people down, can be overwhelming and, unfortunately, suicide is too commonly the “out”. RIP, Hana-chan."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"RIP Hana, you will be missed."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Let's show love by raising money for Hana's family.

The death of Hana Kimura is an absolute tragedy. I hope this serves as a reminder that interactions on social media can have a serious effect on the mental health of anyone, no matter who they are.

Terrace House: Aloha State,"I think this just goes to show the horrible, negative influence that social media can have on a person. It appears to be especially bad in Korea and Japan, for some reason. It seems every year there are a few celebrities who commit suicide due to social media bullying, usually young women. 

Reddit often tries to be a decent place but even this website can get pretty insane. I think it's healthier to limit social media and spend more time with loved ones in real life. Unfortunately for me I can't really do that right now, so all I have is social media. It's a poor substitute, though."
Terrace House: Aloha State,"The problem with reality tv is that it's real, but it's not real. It shows only bits and pieces, often reducing people into caricatures. The events might be real, but the depiction of them and the people involved is edited. Fiction can be spun out of non-fiction if you pick and choose which elements to show. Audiences will go off the information they're given and fill in the blanks.

It's like those ""based on a true story"" movies. The fact that part of it is true messes with audience's heads as to how much of it actually is. Social media arrived at a terrible time in this aspect, as we're not taught critical thinking, let alone in a new application as this. I'm still not sure that we as a species were ready for social media."
Terrace House: Aloha State,[deleted]
Terrace House: Aloha State,Bet the marked it down as covid related
Terrace House: Aloha State,Social media is cancer of 21st century. if oyu can't handle this shit you shouldn't be on social media. people are trash.
Terrace House: Aloha State,[deleted]
Terrace House: Aloha State,f in the chat
Terrace House: Aloha State,Just another reason why reality TV is garbage and we should go back to making real programming that actually takes talent and creativity
Terrace House: Aloha State,Are celebrities dying more often? Or is it just me
Terrace House: Aloha State,R.I.P.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Never heard of her before, but R.I.P."
Terrace House: Aloha State,This is not Japan...
Terrace House: Aloha State,She was so pretty too.  Suicide is so sad man.
Terrace House: Aloha State,"This season is cursed.  Terrace Haunted House.  Watch out for Kai, Vivi, Emika and Tupas are next, Kai has depression, Vivi can be impulsive, Emika had a breakdown on the show, Tupas has severe anger and drinking issues"
Terrace House: Aloha State,5
Terrace House: Aloha State,"Has anyone possibly looked at the factor that CTE might have made this worse for her?

I’m sure wrestling isn’t too good for you, since you are constantly getting it knocked around"
Terrace House: Aloha State,🙏🙏🙏

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Season 1 on Netflix is actually season 4 plus 2 movies. The Japanese name for the series is Shinya shokudo.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I too would love to have more on Netflix. They make for great casual viewing.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Download the subtitels you want and add them manualky to the video you want using vlc media player
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,They can be found streaming on a site called dramacool.io or .bz.  Search for Shinya Shokudo
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,[deleted]
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I'm curious if you know. Is it ok to watch from the ""season 1"" on netflix first? Or would you recommend going back and finding the original Season 1 of Shinya shokudo online and watching from there?"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Thanks for the try. Just went there. Looks like both are down. :(
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Watching them is like eating a hot bowl of ramen. So wholesome.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,The series introduces characters from season 1 and you get to know their background and some are still around in season 4. Up to you on how you feel about such things.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"[http://dramacool.bz/drama/shinya-shokudo-season-1.html](http://dramacool.bz/drama/shinya-shokudo-season-1.html)  


nvmd, I'm a dumbass."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"So we'd know a little more about the cleaning lady with a history that made an entrance in the last five minutes if season ""1"", and hinted to some sad shared past or lost present?

Agreed on how friendly this show is"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I thought it was gonna be like a food documentary and was quite surprised when it was what it was. Might give it a shot later on.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,It's very calming to watch.  
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,So...what is it?
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I cannot thank you enough for this.  I just watched the first 3 episodes and this show is absolutely wonderful.  I love it so much.  I would have never even known this was on Netflix if you hadn't taken the time to share it with us here, so again, thank you so much!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I hope there's a season two happening. 
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Is this just Netflix streaming Shinya Shokudô in english?  It was a great series to watch in Japanese and I'd love to see new episodes.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Me too, finally sat down and watched a handful of episodes on sunday night. Very fun, and calming. I wish I had a restaurant like that to go to."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,The film is pretty good as well.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,This show is amazing
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I just watched the 1st three episodes and I can only say it's a must watch.  I absolutely love this show, it's wonderful."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,[deleted]
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Perfect way to describe it
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I just watched the first 3 episodes and it's a series of stories set in a small Tokyo restaurant, with different characters each episode, except the master who runs the place.  It is like a collection of short stories, and each is about a different set of people and situations.  

I love this show, it's wonderful, relaxing, calm, emotional, sweet, funny... I highly recommend it!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,No problem. Glad you liked it.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I think this might be season 4.  Season 1-3 are fan subbed.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Yes, but Netflix only has the one season; no new episodes."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,It's subtitled on Netflix for me in the US.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Where have you watched the movie? I can't even seem to find much info about it online, but would be so interested in watching it! I loved the series"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Actually,  there's 3 seasons for this show already. It's not on Netflix but you can find subbed ep under the name shinya shokudo. "
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"have you been able to find them online? I have no clue on where to find them, I find too little info."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Couldnt get past Ep 1. Might try later.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,The description reminds me of that anime bartender. I'll give it a shot 
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,It's a comforting show to watch when I want to slow down and focus on simple but wholesome. I hope there's more episodes planned.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,So what's the word on this getting a second season? Or did they adapt all of the source material already?
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,[deleted]
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Yes pls give us the rest of the seasons. I also really like samurai gourmet but that was cancelled too!
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"The protagonist is very Spike Speigel. The dialogue is fine for me, it's written like good anime. Ellis writes comic books, great comic books, so there's that. 

What I really like about the show is it establishes a really good world. It has some good depth. It feels like it's going to be epic. 

By the way, if you like this maybe try Claymore (on Hulu and other anime sites), it's the first show I thought of when I finished the season. There are a lot of anime similar in tone to this show.

I'm looking forward to season 2, I'm ok with 4 episodes making up basically a single normal length movie. "
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I really enjoyed it. The intro was great at establishing Dracula's motive for what he is doing. I was hoping the series would have been longer or at least the episodes themselves.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I watched a review by James Rolfe aka The Angry Video Game Nerd, and one of the things he said I felt was spot on was that the first season seemed very unbalanced.  The entire first episode is centered on Dracula.  Just watching that episode, it seems like the show has very little to do with the Castlevania franchise and is more a show about Dracula in general.  The rest of the season focuses on Trevor Belmont, and we don't see Drac at all. It would have been nice to see better balance between the antagonist and protagonist in the show.  Also, as you've already mentioned, the music wasn't great.  If the show is supposed to be based on Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, it would have been nice to hear some of the music that was in that game.  I'm not asking for the midi representations just like the game, but orchestral pieces could have helped to give the show a familiar tone.  Overall, I like where the show is heading and I think the show could be quite good if the creators make a few changes and continue down the path the seem to be heading in."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I thought the monsters were fine, especially since they technically haven't even gone into Dracula's castle yet."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"> Forgettable Music:

As a fan, I agree.  However, I can't help but wonder if non-fans even think twice about the music.  It's not memorable, but I wouldn't call it bad either.  I'm too biased to be able to objectively judge the music, because I'm comparing it to the enormous selection of excellent music from the game series.

> Lame Dialog:

I'm hoping the dialogue was strained by a need to set things up, and that now that we've established characters and goals, it will get better.  IMO, the dialogue was at it's best when the main characters were interacting, and worse when supporting characters were giving exposition, and I'm hoping for more of the former going forward. 

> Lame Monsters:

I hoping , [Spoiler](#s ""Now that we're actually on a quest to fight monsters, rather than corrupt church members and guards""), that S2 will have better monsters.    [spoiler](#s ""Really in S1 we only fought monsters at the end of E4, and Trevor was fighting humans the rest of the time, so I didn't really have time to notice the lame monster selection.  The Cyclops would be an exception to this, and he was alright, and even straight out of the game, although he had an eyebeam not a hammer in the show"")

> Okay Fight Scenes

While none were ""best animated fight ever"" quality, or even close, I liked what I saw. If the show follows even a moderate upward trend in quality as it progresses, I'll feel I'll enjoy the show thoroughly.  I'm letting my excitement (and perhaps nostalgia) get the best of me, and eagerly awaiting more."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"That seems okay, then.

If they do Double Dragon, can it not be like the shitty cartoon from the early-mid 90s?"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,He is looking at them
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I remember playing Castlevania III on the NES back in the day.  I recall you had the option to play as Alucard, which was pretty cool.  Is he in the show?"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"> The protagonist is very Spike Speigel.

Considering an early pitch of the show for the show was to basically [take the characters from Cowboy bebop and plop them into the world of Berserk](https://youtu.be/MwLJ4xHMNgU?t=7m29s), it makes sense how you'd get that out of the protagonist."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I totally forgot to add this in the original post but Netflix already confirmed that for season two the episodes will be at like double the length.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I was sad that they used a generic monster to kill the Bishop, that would have been a great scene for some of the most iconic ones"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"

We are DOUBLE DRAGON. "
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"[Mild Spoiler](#s ""Yes, he shows up in a few scenes. Plus it sets him up to be more prominent going forward."")"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Double the length and twice as many?  That's even better.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Ahh, thats great news! It felt like an introduction to the beginning of the series. I think I shall watch it all again while I clean up before the weekend starts."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I just noticed your username.  I'd buy the shit out of ringside seats for that fight.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I keep forgetting this is a horror show and not a TV adaptation of the racing games.

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I’ll be honest, I am a huge huge fan of Flanagan but after hearing the general idea of this show and seeing  the lack of promo compared to his “fall of the house of usher” show, I assumed this show would be some in between project of his that’s decent but not as memorable as some of his better stuff. But after reading the article you can really see that this is an important adaptation he wants to do justice and has clearly put a lot of thought and effort into, which makes me excited. We’ll see in October though"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Hyped for this! Loved Pikes books when I was younger.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I predict 2-3 monologues per episode, at least."

Horror elements - Check

The most diversity of diverse diverseness of the cast - Check

Mike Flanagan - Check


Yep, this is a Netflix show."

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Highly unlikely we'll ever get a street racing series. Even fast and furious had to pivot to hotwheels, not that they were ever particularly based in reality. ""Granny shifting, not double clutching like you should"" Really Dom? REALLY?

(It's my favorite line of the series and it's utterly stupid. It's uttered like sage wisdom and essentially does nothing)"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I feel like I’ve been waiting decades for this show.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I haven't been disappointed by any of his work so far, and I'm definitely interested to see what he does without his usual ensemble cast!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Oh, I would predict many many more monologues!

Seriously though, I’m no fan of Flanagan’s monologues, but if there’s any book adaptation where I’d let it slide and actually go into it excited for some of his monologues it’s this one. The book is essentially about a much of kids telling weird stories at midnight. I can’t think of a more appropriate story for Mike Flanagan."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Just don't watch it than?
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I could deal with monologs. I couldn't deal in bly manor all the terrible British accents from non British actors, not sure about those creative choices"

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,hamish linklater dominates every scene hes in idk what youre on about
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,That's good to hear...not sure why I'm getting downvoted.  If it's a quality show aimed at YA audience and it's great than I'm happy for that audience...I'm just not a young adult.  I'm sure I'll give it a try either way.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,uh this is based on the old christopher pike book lol
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I think mainly people are downvoting u for making assumptions for a show with no footage out. plus Flannagan has mad half a dozen movie or shows damn near probs more and only one show has had monologues so weird to predict he will do it again
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Didn't you just give a monologue?
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Yeah, absolutely captivating guy."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"They’ve all had monologues, and they’ve increased as he’s made more shows."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"No?

Do you know what a monologue is or…"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,*Hush* didn't even have dialogue dude
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,No they havnt his last show just leaned into it more. There’s legit no reason to believe his new show will have any specific amount
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"…and then his later works had more and more monologues, like I said in my comment. That’s how time works."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Technically speaking, you said 'they all had monologs' 

But they definitely just didn't, even ignoring the obvious example of Hush"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Alright you win I concede
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Thanks man
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I loved Midnight Mass, and I had to be convinced to see it. I ranked it as one of my top 5 shows of 2021 (along with Succession, Station Eleven, Yellowjackets and Reservation Dogs).

I know some people are put off by the monologues, but there’s this one point in the show where 2 of the characters are having a conversation and each one goes in to a kind of lengthy monologue. In the final episodes, I found the payoff of that for the characters so amazing and beautiful. I still think about it."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"It's not too often that a show gets the time to slow down and ponder it's own internal philosophies and message in such a deliberate and thoughtful manner. Lots of bemoaning of the monologues around here at the time (I also had trouble with a couple of them as I was watching) but now I can appreciate them as part of the show's stylistic approach.

It deliberately went down a different path than it initially set down on. At first I was wondering what supernatural direction the show was going in, and when it was shown to be >!vampires!<, I expected a different type of story than it was. But I ended up appreciating the less hurried approach, and used the supernatural stuff to assist the story as opposed to being the main point. It's nothing new to use supernatural elements this way, but I liked the way it was done in this show."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"I literally just finished this last night! 

I agree with some criticism that it’s very monologue heavy in parts and so can be a bit heavy handed with the messages it’s trying to get across but I like the story it tells and the view on religion it takes while having some good horror in there. 

Some of the twists felt a bit telegraphed though like >!Paul’s identity and his connection to one of the other locals!< but it’s a deep dark ride with some great performances in the form of Father Paul, Bev, Erin and Zach."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"One correction in my sub comment - it was Genetically Modified Skeptic, not Rationality Rules, that made me curious about the show…. My bad"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,It was definitely a slept on show.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Beautiful dialogue. I know some would say it's slow, but I'm an atheist and loved the deep theological discussions, particularly the one between the sheriff and his son about Islam and especially the one between Riley and Erin about what happens when you die.

You never, ever see deep discussions like this in television about religions. It was damn refreshing."
