Ahiru no Sora,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Ahiru no Sora,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Ahiru no Sora,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Ahiru no Sora,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Ahiru no Sora,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Ahiru no Sora,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."
Ahiru no Sora,People who like sports and people who like anime are not overlapping categories.
Ahiru no Sora,[removed]
Ahiru no Sora,"Tbh heard some bad things about Prince of Tennis especially with the super powers on display, tried to aim more towards the grounded shows."
Ahiru no Sora,"Yeah there's tons more football ones, it actually gets a bit overwhelming so thought I'd limit it to the more interesting ones. Personally I found Clean Freak! to be really hard to watch."
Ahiru no Sora,"Really? Someone should tell that to my volleyball club then, most of our post game chats are anime."
Ahiru no Sora,[removed]
Ahiru no Sora,"The more ridiculous the sports anime, the more interested I'd be."
Ahiru no Sora,Volleyball. Ok
Ahiru no Sora,[removed]
Ahiru no Sora,"Is that not a sport now? There's lads in my 6-a-side team who watch anime as well, and you see tons of crossover on reddit.

Seems like you're just being dismissive for reasons I can't comprehend, is there really much fun in being objectively wrong?"
Ahiru no Sora,[removed]
Ahiru no Sora,"Dude. You get what I’m saying. These aren’t aligning demographics. 

People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime."
Ahiru no Sora,">People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime.

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Ahiru no Sora," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"In a decade or so, we’re gonna look back at the early stages of streaming and wonder what the fuck everyone was thinking. These companies took on billions of dollars of debt to build a library of content that was supposed to be the bedrock of their service. The idea was to load themselves up with so much content they would be able to take their foot off the pedal in the future and produce at a much more sustainable pace, buoyed by a huge backlog of content that would keep people subscribed.

 The problem is, almost everything they produced immediately dissipated into the cultural ether. They burned billions of dollars on content that’s worth essentially nothing. Once Netflix started to slow down their production schedule, they immediately started hemorrhaging subscribers because they didn’t have anything they wanted to watch! I’m not sure how they or any other streaming company can address this in the long term, the business model just doesn’t seem sustainable."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,What I hear when I read this:  Prepare for services to get shittier
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Hopefully no more price hikes
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"> It’s one of the more pressing questions facing the streaming business right now: Was Q2 just a blip, or has streaming finally entered a new era of slowed growth?

> Despite some robust international expansion, the last quarter saw a slowdown in the domestic market for many of the major SVOD services. **Netflix lost 1.3 million subscribers — the biggest domestic decline for its streaming service to date — while Disney+ added just 100,000 members in the U.S. and Canada, marking its own worst quarter since launching in 2019**. NBCUniversal’s **Peacock “stayed relatively flat,” according to Comcast’s earnings release, stalling out at 13 million paid subscribers less than two years after launch.** 

>  Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery’s direct-to-consumer platforms — **HBO, HBO Max and Discovery+**, whose user bases were lumped together in WBD’s latest quarterly report — **lost 300,000 subscribers, even when accounting for the company’s “new harmonized definition” of a paid subscriber, which eliminated about 10 million accounts from the tally.**


> **Consumers are still adding subscriptions, albeit at a lower rate**; there were 31 million gross additions in the U.S. in Q2, down 18 percent from Q1, while cancellations remained constant at 28.5 million. **It all added up to a quarter that saw net U.S. subscriber gains at their lowest point since 2018**, according to analytics firm Antenna — in other words, before major players like Disney+ and HBO Max had entered the streaming wars.

> With that in mind, any streamer looking at those numbers must be concerned. **This was not just a slower quarter for the market but a historically slow one, with subscriptions growing just 1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, the lowest rate since Antenna began tracking the data in 2017**. The great streaming slowdown everyone has been fearing is, it seems, finally beginning to manifest in earnest.

> Of course, **streaming remains highly popular among consumers, and its usage is likely to continue growing over time.** Streaming’s share of TV viewing time rose throughout Q2, hitting record highs each month, according to Nielsen data. **And the average number of services accessed per household ticked up in Q2 after plateauing the previous quarter, while household penetration also rose**, per Kantar.

> It appears likely, then, that **domestic subscription growth will remain below historical levels in Q3 and possibly beyond**. The results of a recent survey by SmithGeiger indicate as much, with a majority of those polled about their streaming subscriptions saying they planned to neither add nor cancel a service in the next month. The streaming business is apparently settling into something resembling stability.

>  Indeed, this is the issue at hand: **A business that became accustomed to soaring growth must now adjust to that growth slowing, and transform from an ascendant business to a stable, long-term one. Streaming, in other words, is becoming what the cable business used to be — albeit with a much lower barrier for cancellation should consumers tire of a service.**


> That last point, already a major concern for streamers, will continue to be a key issue as the market matures further. **With marquee titles like “Stranger Things” and “Obi-Wan Kenobi” failing to prevent the historic slowdown in Q2, it’s clear that more than blockbuster content is needed to lessen churn**.


> The solution, in all likelihood, will be for **streaming’s transformation into cable to accelerate: bundles, advertising, linear channels and maybe, one day, the return of long-term contracts**. When that era is finally in full swing, its origin will likely be traced back to the second quarter of 2022."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"This is why live-tv still dominates V.O.D. , but I do like having both, but tend to be far more selective with V.O.D. than live-tv.....it also takes me far longer to find anything I want to watch with V.O.D. than with live-tv.....and lastly V.O.D. still feels like i'm renting a video from Redbox and watching that On-Demand title content while eating a frozen ""tv dinner"", it is depressing in a way. But with Linear/live-tv I don't feel that way, it is just more lively and less artificial I guess."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Growth is over babyyy all about profitability now
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It's gotten to the point with so many streaming services available that people are starting to bounce between them depending on what show(s) they are watching. If I wasn't trying to help some family members out I would only continuously have Amazon(more for Prime shipping that Video), YouTube Premium, and Motortrend Plus. Then I would have one, maybe 2 others on rotation depending on what show I was watching."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Not if VCs have any say
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Well yeah, this is what happens when one of the best new shows on streaming platforms (The Patient) airs in 20 minute segments once a week, when it really is meant to be binged. Gimme back my all at once content dammit."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,A lot of businesses need to do this but won't.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"> The problem is, almost everything they produced immediately dissipated into the cultural ether.

That's part of the problem wth short seasons all released at once, which is still Netflix's bread and butter. I think Netflix looked at streaming numbers for shows like Scrubs, How I met Your Mother, Parks and Rec, The office and a myriad of streaming shows and thought they could replicate that. 

They did not think through the fact those shows already had a fanbase and a back catalog of seasons (or were completely finished). Netflix is littered with projects that lasted 8-20 episodes. Are there a lot of people who are going back to rewatch a lot of these things, and going back again and again? 

We have had the opportunity to watch some amazing projects, but with the exception of a couple shows, the vast majority of streaming shows have completely been forgotten, even if they were well received. There is just so much content now, its hard for anything to stick, unlike the past where shows might get a chance to stick around and find its footing for a year or two before becoming successful.

I think we are going to see a big change in the TV landscape over the next couple of years."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It’s a fairly classic tech expansion strategy. Spend a lot of VC money upfront to dominate the market and drive out competitors, then once you’re big enough, make more revenue. Trouble is, it didn’t turn out to be possible to ‘win’ and dominate the streaming market in the way it was possible for stuff like search / maps / etc."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Unless you have The Office or Friends, most 'back catalogue' probably isn't worth much. Most content is ephemeral."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,[removed]
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"> In a decade or so, we’re gonna look back at the early stages of streaming and wonder what the fuck everyone was thinking.

Wasn't everyone, plenty of people were pointing out how streaming was only going to be cheap if you watch a very small amount of very specific content because every content producer was going to try to make their own streaming platform."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Netflix meets Buffetts criteria of a bad business model.  Increasing costs to churn their product to stay relevant in a competitive environment leading to poor returns.  A lot of these streaming companies are going to be bought out leading to only a few major players.  The pivot to advertisement with Netflix is interesting and changes the narrative though.  Now that we are heading to recession, investors are going to want to see companies produce actual cash."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"No ifs, ands or buts, we are going to see commercials. The commercial free tiers are going to be way over priced that the commercial filled tier will be the most used option. 

Companies will make more money with selling commercials than selling commercial free tiers. The question is, with at least in the US, will the government be in step with saying what companies can advertise to whom and how much they can advertise to whom like they did with radio and television? I'd hate to see a free for all."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,I think it’s more: Prepare for fewer streamers.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"That will likely happens. Part of the expectations of super fast growth is you don’t care about making profit yet. Paramount+, Disney+, peacock, and HBO max don’t make money. If they can’t expect to reach their super high sub goals they will  settle with less more expensive subs to achieve profitability."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Everyone's drill in landgrab phase, once market share settles down a bit everyone will raise prices."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Gee I can't imagine why HBO Max lost subscribers. It must be the streaming era coming to an end, and not any other reason."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,These are crucial points you make.  Netflix churns so much that shelf life and archives are unheard of. There's always a new thing where you didn't get a chance to finish last week's thing.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Netflix will smarten up and eventually will only release one new episode per week to avoid these subscribers doing this to them. I agree about short season shows though...with only 8-10 episodes per season it will never make it to syndication or beyond Netflix itself because there will never be a lot of episodes in the entire shows run, so the actors and production team will not get royalties years down the line and viewers will most like forgot the show even existed because it will not stand the test of time and be shown on other channels."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"> That's part of the problem wth short seasons all released at once, which is still Netflix's bread and butter. I think Netflix looked at streaming numbers for shows like Scrubs, How I met Your Mother, Parks and Rec, The office and a myriad of streaming shows and thought they could replicate that.

The thing that I don't understand is that beloved sitcoms are widely recognized as the most successful streaming back catalog element and no one seems interested to actually make real efforts there (which would be way cheaper than making flagships shows which are way less rewatchable even when they're great, on Netflix I'm constantly rewatching Friends or Community, not Stranger Things, Dark or The Queen's Gambit, even if I love all those shows). 

Do modern sitcoms have no chance because it's also an expression of nostalgia power like we see elsewhere?"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,There's also the issue that they cancel shows without an ending. What is Netflix's catalogue worth if no one has any incentive to watch the shows when they end?
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I dont think so, pirating is simply a matter of clicking on the picture of the show you want to watch and it starts playing. You don't even have to login so it's easier than Netflix."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"There’s value in direct reliable reoccurring revenue. I don’t think we will see over priced tiers. But prices will surely go up regardless the introduction of ad tier plans. If the ad free plans are reasonably priced from a business POV there’s no reason to favour the extra work of selling ads and uncertainty of it. The ad market for example is in major decline right now and everyone is making a lot less money. Not because service problems or because usage is down but because outside companies don’t want to spend as much on marketing.

It’s also gets more complicated when you consider that ad intolerant people who you lose by simply not having an accessible option. Then there’s competition who believe in the option that keep each other competitive in pricing.

What your saying could happen but that’s the pessimistic/worse case."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I can't see myself paying for a streaming service that has commercials. Even if it was free I'd have to really want that content to deal with them. 

Hopefully the expensive tiers don't get too ridiculous in price."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,We can fight this.....don't buy the ad tiers and if ad free is too much. We don't buy it.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,It's too easy to pay $0. I think anything over $20 ad free high def will lose their subscribers to piracy.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"> Do modern sitcoms have no chance because it's also an expression of nostalgia power like we see elsewhere?

I think nostalgia is a part of it, but not all of it. There are some pretty popular shows that were released between the late 70's and ~2010 that have no streaming traction. Some are available, but they don't get memed or talked about like Seinfeld, Friends, and The Office.

I don't know why shows like The Nanny, Happy Days, Facts of Life, Northern Exposure, Coach, Wings, ER, Home Improvement, Designing Women, Suddenly Susan, Caroline in the City, Spin City, The Brady Bunch, or Everybody Loves Raymond don't have larger streaming presence outside of maybe they weren't great shows? A lot of people watched them at the time. I know they all have fans, and some may just be too old for younger generations to enjoy, but it seems people Binge and meme the same 10-15 shows. 

I think one issue is shorter episode counts make things more plot-driven and far less throwaway episodes like we had when shooting schedules were 22+ episodes."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Ascendance of a Bookworm,[removed]
Ascendance of a Bookworm,[removed]
Ascendance of a Bookworm," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Rat King is coming
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,[removed]
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The lack of action started in episode 3
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Ascendance of a Bookworm,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,[deleted]
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
Ascendance of a Bookworm,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
Ascendance of a Bookworm,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
Ascendance of a Bookworm,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
Ascendance of a Bookworm,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
Ascendance of a Bookworm,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,[deleted]
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"A lot of the issue with the apparent lack of Canadian stories likely has to do with the ability for parts of Canada to either downplay the fact that they are in Canada or switch some of the wording to make the audience believe that the story takes place in the US. For example, a story could be filmed and set in BC, but changing some of the dialog to say that the story takes place in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, or many other US states, might lead to a larger international audience. *First Blood* could've make just as much sense if set in the actual filming location of Hope, BC, but was instead set in the fictional Hope, WA."

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,Are HGTV shows and Hallmark Channel movies/series CanCon compliant? They would be notable exceptions as well.  *When Calls the Heart* is starting its eight season.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"I mean, this is obvious and at the root of the problem of lack of Canadian voices.

If it's a US production (see: US dollars) Canadian locations are gussied up to look like US locations.  Vancouver or Toronto is almost always portrayed as Seattle, Portland, NYC or Chicago.

If it's a Cdn production with (Cdn dollars) we do the same in the hopes we won't turn-off American audiences.  We never have the courage to tell our own stories in our own places.  

Canada has a hell of a history and a lot of stories to tell.  But again, our studios and investors lack vision and courage."

There's lots of truly Canadian stories from the 19th century which I'd love to watch on the big screen.

Canadian studios are just to cowardly to stray beyond the very basic formula.  We'll never succeed as an industry separate from the US until we find the courage."
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,This is a dumb statement.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"> It is not an accident that the foundation of America is Fuck You.

If by ""fuck you"" you mean a group of people feeling disenfranchised by their government half a planet away and attempting to form a new society based on Enlightenment principles but marred by their own subjugation of the native population and the institution of slavery, which ultimately lead to multiple states attempting to leave the Union to preserve that institution, causing the Civil War and resulting in a stronger federal government, sure."
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,It also explains how they're able to put unfathomable amounts of episodes for shows like one piece.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"I didn’t beyond the first season (so things might have changed) but I think the worst was how Orphan Black was explicitly shot and set in Canada but the creators took this “It’s just set in a generic North American city, not actually Canada!” stance that was so frustrating. Like it’s set in fucking Toronto, just call it Toronto!"

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,I'm still mad they took one of the coolest villains and turned him into a useless good guy.  Sylar should have ruled the world!
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"If you want to know how bad Heroes fell off... In its heyday, ""Save the Cheerleader,  Save the World"" was everywhere. You heard that catchphrase and you wanted to know what the show was about. Heroes was pulling 20 million viewers an episode in season 1. You can name a lot of shows. I know someone's already pointed to Westworld. But very few had that instant cultural capital that Heroes did and that massive viewership. Heroes is not only an example of one of the steepest quality declines but also a prime example of a show completely botching its work with a fandom that was massive."
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,I feel for season 2 as it was heavily impacted by a writers strike but season 3 just killed every single character and story development from the 1st for good.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"I’m going to offer kind of a weird candidate: How the States got their Shapes on History Channel. My wife and I loved season 1 and all the best facts about each state. Season 2 was abysmal. It was reduced to a half an hour and featured weird “man on the street” game shows of themes like “states where Bigfoot is spotted vs those with UFO sighting”. It was awkward, contained too few facts, and was very influenced by reality show sensibilities"
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,Not sure it's worse but Altered Carbon has to be a candidate.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Mork & Mindy. After coming in at #3 in the ratings for their first season, it was decided to retool the show.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"I always say Zachary Quinto killed the show by being too good in his role of Sylar to kill him off when the show couldn't function with him still being around.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,Westworld is a contender imo
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,True Blood literally got worse each season to the point where I gave up halfway through season 7 and never bothered to watch the finale.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,Yes. Season 1 of Heroes is one of the greatest seasons ever of tv. Then it was terrible after that.
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Not an S2 fail, but I was so disappointed by S3 of Umbrella Academy. For a show with that level of production value, still couldn't finish it. Loved the first two seasons and thought it was stunning the breadth of the show and the depth of the characters, then S3 just seemed to go off the rails. They went from having a huge cast of very weird but incredibly likable characters, to a smaller cast of less weird but more cringey and rather unlikable characters."

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,It's certainly up there. Heroes is a show that has a good idea for 1 story and then nothing.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Tim Kring should never have been showrunner after season 1. The success was due to other writers.  He was unable to cease doing the very tropes that brought it down. 

Here's what should have happened.

&#x200B;

Each season should have had a whole new cast of characters with limited connection the previous. So season 2 and beyond should have followed new heroes.

&#x200B;

Or

Keep characters like Noah, Nathan, Peter, Hiro, Parkman, and Niki but have them actually work together. Four seasons and Hiro barely gets to talk to anyone. When he does, it's glorious. The best parts are when these people hang out together. 

&#x200B;

But don't do this  ""I want to live a normal life"" plotline every season. 

&#x200B;

or

Combine the two. Sylar is done. I like the actor. I like the character. But they were unable to leave him behind and it was a detriment. How do Adam and Sylar at least not team up. 

The season 3 trailer promised this big bad team of villains and we got none of it.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,The Legend of Korra's second season was a pretty steep decline in quality.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"My vote goes for Twin peaks.  Supposedly Lynch had no desire to reveal Laura’s killer but the ABC execs forced him to, studio felt they needed a new “big bad” each season  - it wasn’t until the end of S2 when the show had already been cancelled that Lynch was again able to do what Lynch does ending on a high note in the black lodge."

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Yeah, Heroes S1 was great and then it tanked after that.  

I'd also nominate Prison Break - first season was outstanding but of course the whole show was premised on them breaking out... so season 2 was once they were out and on the run which was good at first but it quickly dovetailed into the secondary conspiracy plots which were terrible and not compelling.  Third season back in (an even worse) prison which was too contrived but at least its where the show was at its best.  After that it was complete garbage. 

Altered Carbon - well, it was only two seasons but that was a good thing because season 2 was pretty awful after season 1 which was brilliant.  Basically universe allowed people to change bodies - so season 2 dumped the cast and hired new actors.  And story just wasn't very good at that point."
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"True Detective.

First season took years to conceptualize and write.  Second season was rushed to production by comparison.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,The Walking Dead?
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Apparently the idea after the end of Season 1 was to go and look at other characters.

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,Didn’t watch Heroes so can’t say for sure. But bloodline on Netflix has to be up there for steepest decline. Season 1 was incredible. Great television. Season 3 was dogshit. Season 2 was somewhere In the middle

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"nah, i still finished season 2 after the quality drop.

Altered Carbon saw a larger quality drop than Heroes to me. I couldnt even finish the first episode of Altered Carbon s2."
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious,"Yeah. That show did a 180. 

I felt Killing Eve, while always a Hannibal ripoff, had a good first season than really got bad."
Rhythm + Flow,"I checked it out and I'm three episodes in and am enjoying it. I don't usually watch talent show type things but some of the fun of this one to me is:

\- Obviously, spotlighting rap rather than outlawing it.

\- An uncensored talent show is funny and even though the show is obviously edited and all that you still get some moments that are just raw and would be unseen on any other show. It makes the concept of judging and watching people judge others by their talent more entertaining.

\- I like the more real way they approach giving us insight on the contestants and while it's still dressed up a bit for sure like any other show it still feels more real and relatable.

Probably most of all though is that I'm actually pretty surprised at the contestant talent levels. Honestly the reason I checked it out was because I thought it might be bad to have a rap talent show and just thought how American Idol-ized could this be? And while there's some bad stuff the show actually doesn't make it a point to make it about spotlighting the lack of quality so much as it's about getting behind the participants and they mostly get decent feedback. Cardi B is still hilariously entertaining regardless of how ratchet of a human being she may be behind the scenes, and while I don't necessarily agree with the show's focus on primarily just finding a mainstream star who would be big on radio I understand it and respect that they're at least honest about it. A lot of these shows try to play off like they're trying to find the flat out best person here but they're not, they're trying to find the most popular one. At least Rhythm and Flow is pretty transparent saying they want someone with a look, with stage presence, who connects with fans and would be able to make hits.

Whether or not the winner becomes all of that should be interesting to see."
Rhythm + Flow,This show made me like Cardi B again
Rhythm + Flow,[deleted]
Rhythm + Flow,"I remember like 10 years ago Missy Elliot had a Music competition show which was incredible, if I remember correctly it was all about artists writing and performing their own original music."
Rhythm + Flow,"First episode seemed more about showing what the judges were driving and wearing, looked god awful... I could only really stand snoop before I had to turn it off... I wish they would have made it more about the contestants. Either host auditions and show the best of the best or have challenges to get to know the contestants better and build their stories... I don't need to know who Snoop, Cardi B and TI are or when their albums are coming out... cringe."
Rhythm + Flow,that looks amazing.  and when nipsey's name went by... [heart-broken emoji]
Rhythm + Flow,Her voice is grating for sure but she's genuine and a nice person.  Definitely worth watching.
Rhythm + Flow,It is really good.
Rhythm + Flow,"And it will get canceled after a season or two, with no fanfare."
Rhythm + Flow,How can newer artists like this even have the merit to be a judge? Chance hasn't even released a full album. 
Rhythm + Flow,"Netflix's reality and talk show lineup already sucks, I don't see it improving by having a reality star turned weak rapper judging anything. "
Rhythm + Flow,And Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are judging a chef competition
Rhythm + Flow,"Loved that guy on ""I Love New York""!"
Rhythm + Flow,This show turned out to be phenomenal.
Rhythm + Flow,"Nah, I can see this being quite popular. Cardi is super popular"
Rhythm + Flow,"Dude dropped acid rap, he has plenty of merit."
Rhythm + Flow,"They've had plenty of ""popular"" people do talk shows, comedy, and reality on the service and it generally goes no where, as people aren't tuning into Netflix for that type of content."
Rhythm + Flow,[deleted]
Rhythm + Flow,"Its not actually the demos I'm concerned about its the ""Netflix Audience"".  Netflix just isn't the service people go to for stuff like this.  It would do fine on VH1 or BET, hell it would probably be fine as a short(er) summer type show on Fox.  This isn't filling a need the Netflix audience wants from Netflix."
Rhythm + Flow,"I've had a lot of fun over the 8 seasons of Korean Hip Hop survival show Show Me the Money, so I'm pretty excited about this."
Rhythm + Flow,"Kermit's wrong. The rhyme is star/are, which DOES rhyme. Fozzie has an interjection which isn't included in the meter. 

It's still dumb, but not for the specific reason you mentioned. And as others have said, expecting good music from a kid's show is kind of a stretch."
Rhythm + Flow,Wow this is a weird complaint about a kids show
Rhythm + Flow,This is totally demented and made me bust a gut 😂
Rhythm + Flow,Who the FUCK is Summer?
Rhythm + Flow,"I like adventure! I like romance. I love great jokes. Animal dance! I’ve got my computer. I swing in the air. I play the piano. And I have blue hair. Me, I invent things. Mee mee mee!

Is everything alright in here?

Yes, Nanny!"
Rhythm + Flow,Here’s the song for reference: https://youtu.be/kUT_50RhjIM
Rhythm + Flow,[removed]
Rhythm + Flow,This is a strange complain about a kids show.
Rhythm + Flow,Sometimes I swear kids show's theme songs sound terrible on purpose. Why not do it in the delightful style of the original show's theme?
Rhythm + Flow,">Wow this is a weird complaint about a kids show

If this is weird to you, don't go to /r/danieltigerconspiracy , your head will explode."
Rhythm + Flow,"I have a 4 year old, so I hear this song almost on loop"
Rhythm + Flow,Wait until the OP hears the Netflix 2015 reboot theme song for Inspector Gadget.
Rhythm + Flow,A muppet baby
Rhythm + Flow,"Is it just me, or does it sound like she's singing ""my big babies""?"
Rhythm + Flow,I don’t think the “crime against humanity” comment was meant to be literal. One would have to be deranged to actually believe a kids show theme song would qualify as such.
Rhythm + Flow,You must be fun at parties
Rhythm + Flow,"Having a 4 year old is basically sound torture. My ex's 4 year old watched some fuckin cartoon I don't remember the name of, but one of the characters just screamed and made weird fuckin noises and god damn if he/she/it didn't have a lot of lines.

Nothing else she watched was much better. Theme songs that just grated my ears, characters with voices that seem to be able to liquify your brain matter.

Not everything can be as badass as DuckTales or Rescue Rangers or Darkwing Duck, I get it, but damn."
Rhythm + Flow,"Looks like an angry bird. 

I guess it’s a new character…
Didn’t she make it to adulthood?"
Rhythm + Flow,"i don't attend children's parties but if I did I would probably entertain you with the magic removable thumb trick for hours,  this is not a subject adults have cocktails and canapés discussing. Go to any local bar and start your conversation with ""so what do you all think of the current Muppet Babies theme song? Is it not a crime against humanity?"" and se how actual people react. Go on, mark yourself as a weirdos in real life, not just a Reddit retard. This is the kind of shit even The Big Bang Theory wouldn't cover and they were fictional dysfunctional caricatures/ If you are for real, what is your deal? How fucked are you?"
Rhythm + Flow,"I'd rather they get whoever did episode 1 of season 2 tbh, the fight in ep 6 was cool (and better than most of the fights in S1) but felt too overedited with all the slo-mo and CGI stuff. Just give us a clear, well-shot fight with realistic camerawork like in episode 1 of both seasons."
Rhythm + Flow,"Is that the slo-mo episode? If so, those are the worst fights in the whole show."
Rhythm + Flow,"First episode was the only one I really enjoyed. Witcher is best when its just Geralt doing Witcher things. The political stuff don't come across very well and aren't interesting to me. 

Yes I read the books and played the games. Erectile disfunction."
Rhythm + Flow,The Witcher is *not* trying to be a “Game of Thrones style ensemble story”
Rhythm + Flow,"To me, the most compelling thing about the Witcher is how romantic it is. In Baptism of Fire, Geralt says something like ""When a time comes that you need my help, call my name into the night, and I promise I'll return.""

There's a lot of cool fairy tale logic and geralt constantly wants to be the knight in shining armor. What makes me love the witcher specifically is that the characters don't live in a world that inherently rewards that kind of behavior. It's really fucking hard to be chivalrous, but that makes the moments where he succeeds feel better. 

Episode 1 of season 2 is the one that captured this feeling best imo. We get our enchanted castle and our cursed friendly noble, but we're also put into a difficult moral position, where the one with the curse pretty clearly deserves punishment.

I love all the scenes with voleith mir right up until they do the whole ""YOU HAVE TO FIGHT, YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH"" bullshit I've seen a million times."
Rhythm + Flow,"this is one of the downsides to a show releasing all at once. When I binge a season, all the episodes run together in my mind. So it's harder to engage in satisfying discussion about all the elements."
Rhythm + Flow,"I wish they could just scrap the whole witcher show and let literally enyone try again in a few years. Henry Cavill will still be the perfect age then, and hopefully we get a good show."
Rhythm + Flow,"> I'd rather they get whoever did episode 1 of season 2 tbh

What a hell of an episode that was. Kristofer Hijvu coming out of the gates swinging in this episode."
Rhythm + Flow,Slo-mo fight scenes are always a let down. Guarantee movies like John Wick would not have become popular if all those gun/ fight scenes were in slo-mo.
Rhythm + Flow,"It was. The dude's tooth flying out triggered me. By the end of the fight I felt satisfied, but man was that a cheesy shot."
Rhythm + Flow,"You may not enjoy the political aspect of the Witcher, yet it is part of  the lore.

Without it the show would just be a bunch of fight scenes with the monster of the week, which would get people here to complain about the lack of plotlines 😆

I really think people are really spoiled and complain too much with this show."
Rhythm + Flow,"Exactly, people blame the show for not being smth it never ambitioned to be."
Rhythm + Flow,Can you give examples of how it isn’t? Contrasting the perspective shifts?
Rhythm + Flow,">voleith mir

Ya watching that scene I kept hoping for some other out come rather than that. Help from an unforeseen corner, rather than, oh Ciri is just too strong for the Big Bad. How is the Wild Hunt going to be a threat to Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri if Ciri can just overcome Voleith so easily?"
Rhythm + Flow,He looks 14 years old without the beard
Rhythm + Flow,"I'll give the Matrix a pass, maybe Dredd. Everything else? It's just cheesy."
Rhythm + Flow,"The Witcher is about Geralt and his close friends. I havent watched the show, but read the books and its more like Lord of the Rings than GoT.

In GoT there is no main character until like S6."
Rhythm + Flow,"You think every TV show with a somewhat ensemble cast that is exploring different POVs is trying to be GoT? I mean come on.

It's unashamedly high fantasy for one. It's clearly about 3 characters and not the whole ensemble around that, as another example."
Rhythm + Flow,He looks like Alan Tudyk if he worked out non stop for 5 years
Rhythm + Flow,I would have liked Wonder Woman if it wasn't for the slo-mo fight scenes. Show me her beating people up in real time and guarantee it would be way more badass.
Rhythm + Flow,"The show has many, many scenes that don’t feature the 3 main characters, and just deal with the political intrigue between factions (The Brotherhood, The Elves, The Redanians, etc.)"
Rhythm + Flow,"Yes but a lot of the time those other scenes are talking about finding ciri.

The Elvish stuff was a thing for a bit but it all came full circle to finding Ciri."
Rhythm + Flow,"I thought that was half why people watched.  
  
Reality competition shows I like without sob stories:  
  
- [The Great British Bake Off](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877368) (2010)  
- [RuPaul's Drag Race](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1353056) (2009)  
- [Survivor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239195) (2000)  
- [Ink Master](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1865740) (2012)"
Rhythm + Flow,The worst is on Shark Tank. They almost feel like propaganda. Like as if you have to suffer and have your whole family get cancer or whatever in order to start a business and be successful. There's something about standing up in front of five rich people and trying to win their money based on how sad your story is that feels really nasty to me.
Rhythm + Flow,"I don't generally enjoy them either, but you have to remember that people watch shows (and generally engage life) differently. Some people are emotionally-motivated. Including these segments makes the shows appeal to the widest possible audience. There are audience members who wouldn't watch the show if they didn't ""feel"" like they know the contestants a little bit. It's similar to how action movies will have random love story subplots. Widest appeal. But I'm with you, I could live without these all day long. The ones on Ninja Warrior really grate, especially since of them seem like the producers are asking the contestant, ""Do you happen to have any friends with cancer?"""
Rhythm + Flow,"I love the Food Network show 'Chopped' but *every* chef has a sob story, almost as if it is a prerequisite to put on the application. Some of them almost seem to be satirical in their martyrdom."
Rhythm + Flow,"i have a friend who auditioned for The Voice and is a really good singer, she got called back for a second round of auditions and they outright told her that they would've had her in the show but she doesn't have a good sob story and a sad past, they make the stories required and exaggerated so the audience can ""connect"" and grow ""emotionally attached"" to the people preforming which sucks"
Rhythm + Flow,Yeah they are usually reserved for the singing talent shows.. .though they do sneak into the ones you mentioned as well just not very often ( and that makes them allot more interesting)
Rhythm + Flow,"They come up on Ru Paul’s Drag Race from time to time. On season 10 they had someone called Blair St Clair, who failed in a challenge and fell to pieces when the judges were giving their critique. Upon being questioned she said (while crying) that her first sexual experience had been a rape. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s horrible. But I couldn’t help but think that it wasn’t really relevant."
Rhythm + Flow,"They have them on Survivor sometimes but since you're spending 15 episodes with the same people and they don't really shove them down your throat they tend to feel more earned. Like I vaguely remember a winner a few seasons ago saying his mom had cancer or something while he was playing and that he was doing it for her, but at the end of the day he won of his own merits and not because of that."
Rhythm + Flow,"Oh yeah, none are immune to someone thinking they're going and opening up with their struggles. At least it's not every week."
Rhythm + Flow,Cody please stop spamming your fan fiction everywhere.  Especially when you angrily claim the stuff you say is supported by the show itself.
Rhythm + Flow,"You sound a bit like a schizophrenic seeking patterns in things to the extreme. 

Either that or someone deeply procrastinating doing their work to finish the PhD in which case enjoy your ABD degree likely in 20 years."
Rhythm + Flow,His name is Cody Holder and his family is very worried about him.
Rhythm + Flow,"Nice, typical Reddit comment attempting to troll away from the main content of the post. Thanks for your ‘contribution’ (boring)."
Rhythm + Flow,Really?
Rhythm + Flow,"The fact that you don’t see how manic and schizophrenic this post and details reads is disturbing. And mental illness and math degrees do go hand in hand. Apparently even the WW sub has deleted your posts for going from fandom to obsessive.  You literally created a sub for this stuff where you are the only one posting many of these long essays. Really, you could have two PHDs with this level of effort on actual things."
Rhythm + Flow,Yeah he revealed his name on Reddit which wasn’t very smart of him (and then confirmed it was his name which was even dumber).  He also admitted to not sleeping for literally days before writing that garbage manifesto of his.
Rhythm + Flow,"Man, I’m sorry but I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already and I’m working with many people about it already. If your issue is concern for me, please, you don’t have to worry. I’m just highly enthusiastic about decoding this puzzle that was built for us, the audience. It’s like our own personal maze to navigate here. Along the way we get lost as we fall down the rabbit hole. At the end we find the real story and the tree of life, take from that what you will. 

The narrator of WestWorld is literally schizophrenic. Perhaps that’s what you are picking up on, the story itself is madness and it’s about descents into madness, at least part of it. 

Anyway, I’m here to discuss the details of the show and not my personal life."
Rhythm + Flow,"He created multiple subs to post this nonsensical trash... AND he posts using THREE accounts at least.  And sometimes his accounts talk to and compliment each other.  It is truly a sad state of affairs.

As for the mania - here is the type of ""logic"" you get from him.  The show is set in 2058 on Earth.  Last season coordinates from an AI monitoring system occasionally would show up in the show.  So Cody here thinks hey, Google Maps in 2020 will give me clues about a fictional 2058.  That's already a leap.  But then what does he do?  He goes to the coordinates, then wanders around and around on Street View or Satellite view, and then is MILES off from the coordinates and comes up with a finding.  

But his findings are insanity:  

\- He saw a city bike rental kiosk (4 miles off from show coordinates) sponsored by Ford the car company and thought it was an amazing finding because a dude in the show is named Ford.  

\- He found a train musuem in Africa and a bus station in Indonesia and this lead him to conclude a company in the show has an OCEAN TRAIN that travels 50,000 miles through the ocean in 2058.

\- He zoomed out and saw a face in a field (more like a vaguely egg shaped silhouette) decided it was a specific character's face, then wondered if there was some conspiracy with HBO paying farmers to draw stuff in fields.  Because some random field looked like an oval / egg.

&#x200B;

Dude is NOT well at all and is completely delusional and in denial of his total lack of critical thinking skills."
Rhythm + Flow,"I was the one who deleted my WestWorld posts. I was harassed there, doxxed and brigaded, it was viscous. To read the atlas post and associated material, people can find it all on r/WWElevatedScrutiny now.

Edit: I do see how schizophrenic this might appear, especially if you haven’t looked into the google maps coordinates of the divergences yet. It might seem like I’m picking out shapes in clouds here, basically, and inferring meaning from that. Ducking nuts!"
Rhythm + Flow,">I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already

Oh yeah, ""nonsense"" sure thing there Mr. Ocean Train and I Can Hear the AI Talking To Me Inside The Music Of The Show Guy."
Rhythm + Flow,"I get it now. I thought it was explaining what the “events” on the circle in the show meant regarding the happenings on the show. It seems the ring does seem perhaps to be a time line of the year of the show as he says. I just can’t see what he is saying about those “divergences”. 

The searching google maps is the part that indicates a bit of mania here, but that’s mostly just sad. I was hoping to figure out some cool story about the “parallel realities” that was hidden in the story. But it’s really not convincing other than some stairs that change color."
Rhythm + Flow,"It’s more that it is a “hobby” that is obviously occupying you for more than the hours most people are awake. Putting off the dissertation work, it seems."
Rhythm + Flow,"Cody, you spammed the board repeatedly, and used multiple accounts to do so.

People ""harassing"" you kept asking for evidence, kept asking you to explain yourself, and you got mad and would end up blocking people.

And you can't get Doxxed when you stupidly revealed your name to everyone and then rather than try to claim it was an alias admitted to everyone it was your name.  Like that's really really dumb dude.  But of course now you are claiming otherwise.  Your dishonesty is astounding."
Rhythm + Flow,"Like I get it, there COULD be some clues, some meaning, in the AI Graphical Interface Circle in the show.  Fine.  But that's the last reasonable thing Cody argued and then went off the deep end.  

He thinks there is time travel in Season 3, people living entire lives as other characters, he thinks a phone app in the show is a physical place in the Middle East for some reason, he thinks one character in the show is actually Teddy when the show itself and the cast and showrunners have explicitly said otherwise publicly a hundred times.  He thinks the splatter on the floor from an injured robot is a secret map, he thinks an AI from the show is talking to him through the music of the show.

He's just a bundle of illogical nonsense and is quite obviously not thinking clearly."
Rhythm + Flow,"It’s true that I’m putting off my dissertation work (I mention this in the introduction of my atlas post). Again, this is a personal detail and IMO (not yours) its irrelevant to the current state of the project. The questioning of mental health and motivations was an early phase of the project that I’ve now moved past. If one aims to discredit the project, I suppose taking a personal angle on why I’m pursuing this hobby makes sense. It might make more sense though, in my view, to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory. One could start with the premise that the coordinates provided in the show are relevant to the story, and go from there. Perhaps one would take an entirely different path than I have. Anyway,   Hopefully my hobby doesn’t interfere too much with your Reddit experience."
Rhythm + Flow,"Don’t get me wrong. I’m with you. I’m just here cause WW.  I actually though when watching it that some of the androids were brought back in different bodies.  I am kinda slow in that show though, so I guess I was wrong in that."
Rhythm + Flow,">to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory.

The show is set on Earth, the coordinates in the show are from the fictional 2058 year Earth the show is set in.  Boom, a bazillion times more compelling than your horseshit."
Rhythm + Flow,A LOT of people thought that was a possibility at first.  But then the show revealed what occurred.  And everyone but Cody accepts the show (and show runner and cast interviews).  He apparently knows better than everyone who made the show smh.
Rhythm + Flow,Pose is phenomenal.
Rhythm + Flow,"Doom Patrol had no right to be as great as it was, even with its fantastic cast.  Easily my favorite of the year, so much so that I can't imagine another show passing it."
Rhythm + Flow,"I’m so glad you mentioned *The OA*. Brit Marling is a genius and her body of work as a writer/actress over the last ten years is phenomenal. I’m really excited to see what she does next.

I’ve also really enjoyed season two of *Killing Eve* and *Tuca and Bertie* (if only for Lisa Hanawalt’s art)"
Rhythm + Flow,"Mine have to be Wayne, What We Do In The Shadows, Chernobyl, Big Little Lies, Dark, Derry Girls, Line of Duty, Killing Eve."
Rhythm + Flow,"**Dark** on Netflix. As intense, intriguing, mindboggling, gripping, and yes, dark as ever. Without question, the best Netflix original and one of the best supernatural, sci fi series I've ever seen.   

**Chernobyl** on HBO an incredible take on a real life horror story. I mean, my goodness. 

**Animal Kingdom** on TNT one of my favorite shows right now. So so so underrated.

**Warrior** on Cinemax was a very gritty, action packed, entertaining stab at a rather glossed over period in American History. So much ass-kicking.

**When They See Us** on Netflix is yet another damning show that will just make you angry at the world.

**Billions** on Showtime: I lost my shit at the crazy season finale

**The Chi** on Showtime: unfortunately at least two characters' storylines end on cliffhangers because they wont return for another season. Sad!

**Love, Death + Robots** on Netflix: just awesome all around. I think these anthology shows are really gonna be my thing.

**Hanna** on Amazon Prime was every bit as entertaining as the original film, and yet even more substantive. Glad it's coming back for season 2.

**Good Omens** on Amazon Prime was just fucking awesome. 

**Lucifer** on Netflix: as entertaining as ever! 

I have so many more I'm leaving off this list and it's only because I'm a little buzzed from a touch of whiskey and can't quite remember them.lol"
Rhythm + Flow,"The 100 has really stepped up their game this year.

I feel like it's a strange phenomenon for a show to make a later season one of the best and reinvigorate a lot of intrigue. They cleaned house in the writer's room, brought back the old writers who knew what they were doing and brought in new writer's (some have experience on The Expanse). The shark was jumped at the end of season 5 to say the least, but the world they've built, the mythology they've developed, and the quandaries they're discussing just feel really new. The directing, writing, and acting have all been on point with a lot of stand out moments and some ballsy choices that have been paying off pretty well, putting this season on par with season 2 if not higher."
Rhythm + Flow,"Chernobyl, Love Death & Robots and Kingdom are my favourites so far"
Rhythm + Flow,Osmosis was a very nice surprise watch for me. The last episodes were a bit flat but I loved the art style and overall tone of the show.
Rhythm + Flow,"What We Do In the Shadows, Chernobyl, When They See Us"
Rhythm + Flow,"The walking dead, City on a hill, Bosch,"
Rhythm + Flow,Now Apocalypse was the worst show I watched this year like wow
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

---

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I loved DP, Welcome to Utmark, and Anna"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Thanks for putting all this work into your list. Makes it much easier for me!
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,A best tv shows of 2021 lost really isn’t complete without Succession
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Check out Yellowjackets, The Shrink Next Door, Scenes from a Marriage"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,That Arcane isn’t on this list is really sad - but each to their own!
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"What the hell. I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles. Also, where's Succession?

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Okay, I have some specific praises to give that may make this list make a little bit more sense.

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Yellowjackets?
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Why?
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Ted Lasso anybody?
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Nordic shows are great
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,You're welcome. 😊
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Personally I'd put Dr Who in the 60s list, it blazed a lot of trails. From the perspective of 60s TV nothing else \*sounded\* like it at the time, which in the days of 405 line broadcasts viewed on 18"" screens was actually a pretty big deal.

For the 70s I'd nominate Roots, it's difficult to overestimate the cultural impact it had on middle class America, again it's a show which has a living legacy today.

The Prisoner ? Really ? Patrick McGoohan's vanity project where he was thorwing shit at the wall and filming whatever stuck. It started off as a nicely left-field sequel to Danger Man but rapidly sank into chaos, seriously, read up on the backstory to the recording of the last few episodes. Great theme tune and title sequence though."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Dallas should probably be on the list. 

I can’t believe you didn’t include LOST, as it fits both your key criteria perhaps better than any other show you’ve listed."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"You could have included Oz in the 1990s, the first prestige drama from HBO even if the Sopranos quickly outshone it."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I see a lot of praise for I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, Lost, and I’m debating on it but Sons of Anarchy."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I can't exactly pin-point it to Arrow but it did create a renewed intrest in live action superhero TV-Shows . While it cannot compare to the gems that have been listed above, the show however did spark an renewed interest in the superhero genre ."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"50's- gunsmoke

60's- andy griffith show /beverly hillbillies/smothers brothers/hogans heroes/dragnet/rowan&martin laugh-in

70's- brady bunch/medical center/sonny and cher show/sanford and son/happy days/flip wilson show

90's- northern exposure/ buffy the vampire slayer/friends"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Miami Vice deserves to be in the 80s. It was once described as the first TV show to look and feel different since colour tv was invented. It's also a damn fine cop show with a terrific soundtrack
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I know it's for very little kids but Sesame Street has to be on the list. It's a daggum American treasure. It pretty much raised and taught 50 years worth of children and had a major impact on educational tv. It never shyed away from subjects that are difficult. And while it might not be directly on the show it covered stuff like race and racism, homelessness, trauma, Autism, divorce, incarceration, HIV and even death. This show and Mr. Roger's neighborhood weren't afraid to get real with the kids. Before it came around kids shows were 100% for entertaining. Like pies in the face, cartoons, nothing of any educational value. Sesame street changed the game. It is absolutely peak children's television.

As for Peak medical shows ER is by far the peak. It was filmed like a movie and is notable for being the first show to air live in real time for two different audiences. Once for the East Coast and once for the West Coast."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Guessing you think the walking dead fell too far out of the zeitgeist?  I think The Office has to be put on here.  Not my favorite but it’s popularity is huge even more so now and for me it kicked off the era of single cam comedies on broadcast tv.  Apologies to Scrubs and Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac show that came before it but they don’t have that impact imo.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Educational TV, Animated series and Anime not being in this list is a darn slight."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,[deleted]
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Don’t know if anyone mentioned Deadwood but, first of all, it furthered a lot of what Oz, Sopranos accomplished in terms of what the OP mentioned re: large, ensemble cast. But the reason Deadwood is an absolute must-include, is because of the way it ushered in TV’s era of the auteur, in earnest. Yes, we saw some of this with David Chase, but in Deadwood and with HBO, David Milch shattered TV’s glass ceiling on singular creative control.

30 Rock was a huge influence on the type of comedies that audiences sought, post 2010: smart as a whip, incredibly fast and quick-witted.

I also believe BoJack (which I was very late to) will be looked back on as highly influential, in terms of its existentialism and also the way it raised expectations for what a cartoon can accomplish in terms of dramatic feelings.

If you’re including foreign series, I would also add Gomorrah."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Agree completely with your take on Doctor Who, however, I disagree with your take on the prisoner.  You're right that it is a Patrick McGoohan vanity project, but it's an overwhelmingly successful vanity project, and was way ahead of its day.

I'd say it's as important as Star Trek if you're setting up a list of essential TV Sci-Fi."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Roots and Dr. Who are really good choices, I don't know a lot about 60s who so I wasn't sure what to write about it, same with roots, but I think they'd be good additions. Thank you!

I said at the start I hadn't seen a lot of these shows, I included ones I'd seen talked about a lot so I wasn't sure about The Prisoner, I heard it did the mystery box element before any other show, but that's interesting, I wasn't aware it was so controversial!"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Agreed, you can't make a list like this without Doctor Who"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Dallas definitely makes sense, as does Lost. I hesitated with both of them because, with Lost, it has such a bad reputation due to the ending (I think the last few seasons are fine, but that made it seem to disappear a bit from the cultural consciousness). It definitely was really influential though, so it probably should be included. I'd also heard a lot of mixed things about Dallas so I wasn't sure whether to include it, and I haven't heard much about it. I'm interested to look more into Dallas though, thanks for your input!"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"YES, not only did it blow up the superhero genre on tv (after smallville arguably lit the spark), it really kicked off the whole thing with networks trying to create a shared universe. Without the Arrowverse, the bigger shared universes like the Chicago-Whatever shows wouldn't have happened. Sure, tv has always had spin-offs (perhaps most popularized by Buffy, which should have also been on the list) but Arrow and its connected shows expanded upon that in a way that no one else did, and just recently had the biggest, most expansive crossover in tv history (Crisis On Infinite Earths) that brought shows from decades ago back into the conversation."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"This is a great point, I didn't think of Arrow because season 3 and after is so spotty, but it started out amazing and it was pursuing the shared universe right around when the MCU did. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a deluge of superhero shows and shared television universes in the next decade that make this a no brainer. However, I think I'd probably put ""flarrowverse"" or ""cwverse"" as a whole on the list rather than just Arrow, since I feel like the year end crossover events are what have been most influential"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Heard lots of great things about Miami Vice, really important that it tried to change up the look of TV. I also heard that it was the first TV show to use licensed music as a background track? And honestly I think several of my best TV moments of all time use licensed music in some way"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Absolutely great choice, Sesame Street definitely defined children's television. I've been trying to track down early episodes and haven't been successful, I wish it was more available as a historical document of what kids shows were like when it debuted.

Also heard a lot of great things about ER! The ""filmed like a movie"" aspect is so important and way ahead of its time, with shows like Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Falcon and the Winter Soldier definitely going for that ""movie made for TV"" aspect that I think we're only going to be seeing more and more of in the 20s"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Yeah, I think if it had maintained the quality of the first season/first few seasons it'd definitely be a contender, but the ""showing that genre tv can appeal to a mainstream audience/can be ""prestige"" "" ended up happening more with Game of Thrones. I think The Walking Dead did kind of set Game of Thrones up for success, and I think if I was making this list in maybe 2012 or earlier it'd be a no brainer.

The Office is a good choice, I didn't end up picking any comedy for the 00s but it would be between Arrested Development and The Office. I definitely think The Office was more influential and had a huge influence on modern shows, it makes sense to include it. It also continued the cynical streak of Seinfeld/The Simpsons, but then it wrapped around into being more optimistic by the end. 

It kind of feels like we've come full circle, where I Love Lucy was super lighthearted and optimistic, and then we got more and more cynical peaking with Seinfeld/Larry Sanders Show, and with The Office, Parks and Rec, Ted Lasso, Schitt's Creek etc it seems like hopeful/idealistic TV is the new trend, and I think the US Office making Michael Scott more sympathetic kind of kicked that off.

Do you think you'd include the US version, the UK version, or both in the canon?"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"He's referring to canon in the sense of the ""literary canon.""  Basically:

>the list of works considered to be permanently established as being of the highest quality

That term itself is derived from an older usage related to which books were included in the compilation of the Bible.  They were 'canon' if they were considered the official world of god.

The definition you're referring to - used for 'official' entries in pop culture universes (""Star Trek canon"") is much newer bastardization of that concept."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"This was kind of my thought, I heard it's quality varies quite a bit but it seems to have done the ""person wakes up in a mysterious place and has to solve a sci fi mystery"" thing before anyone else, and it became such a staple of TV in the past 30 years"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I think the hate LOST gets is wildly overstated. The ending was controversial, for sure, but it was enjoyed by many and misunderstood by more. The false narrative that “they were dead the whole time” quickly spread into the social consciousness such that even folks who never watched the show knew “how it ended and it sucked.”

Interestingly, many of the people who have binged it for the first time recently (due to lockdowns, etc.) go to the r/LOST subreddit and gush about how much the loved it and are surprised at how much they enjoyed the ending, since they had heard it was terrible. I think the show was ahead of its time and was one of those zeitgeist-altering experiences that are few and far between, whatever one thinks of the final episode."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I know. It also brought lesser known comic book characters into spotlight. I wish they made a live action sereis about Red Robin.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I thougth they were synonymous arrowverse and CWverse.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"> best TV moments of all time use licensed music in some way

Such as?"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I think the early episodes might be on Netflix labeled as sesame street ""for adults"" since it was a bit trippier, had characters smoking out of a pipe and taught things like civil disobedience (it was a show made in the 60's after all). They might also be available on HBO max too. I know for a fact that they exist on DVD."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I would say just us version.  There are many big British sitcoms but I can’t pick one
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,Til there’s more than one version of canon. Cheers
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Yep, this is it exactly, canon has two definitions. Also, my personal list of ""best shows ever"" doesn't look anything like this, this is more ""shows that received a lot of critical acclaim and influenced the medium."" Basically, I'm looking for the TV equivalent of Citizen Kane, Moby Dick, Shakespeare, etc"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"It's also a really early, and still very good ""What does it mean to be human in a world becoming increasingly built to stamp out humanity and individuality"" show."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"You make a good point, I wasn't aware that so many people still liked it so much, that's good to hear. I also started a pandemic rewatch (didn't get past season 2 just cause it's such a long show), and thought ""wow most of the mysteries people complain about did actually get solved.""

I think you're right that it definitely was a huge cultural moment, and it made big long form genre shows more popular. Another big thing is it's flashback structure, which still gets copied constantly."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Definitely a really interesting theme for a show to tackle, especially in the 60s!"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Yeah, I think it popularized the use of in-depth flashbacks (OitNB used flashbacks in a similar way, for example). 

Another hallmark is the use of non-linear storytelling, which really set the show apart at the time. It is still a lesser-used technique, but when it does show up, you can see a lot of LOST’s influence (e.g., True Detective, Westworld, Bloodline, etc.).

The show has is fair share of flaws, but it’s difficult to overstate its influence on television."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"The main problem with this season is the pacing.  Every plot got too much or too little attention, and they kept pushing each other off screen.

The twist at the end of episode 9 caught me completely off guard, easily the best moment of the season.

The way the season ended can only be described as amputating the narrative with a chainsaw."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"I really appreciate your thoughts here.  I watched this over the last couple of weeks and as you say, it caught my attention and it had so many possibilities.   I normally watch a few episodes of a show, and if it is any good, will restart the series and have my wife join.  I didn't with this show. But I never stopped to think about why not?  You have captured the issues very well.

I hope they take note and make adjustments because they are still set up well for a second season"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Yeah, I had a lot of high hopes based on the Trailer but it seems like they just went for AS GENERIC AS POSSIBLE as the default position for any decision that would be made."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"Nah, it's just simply a bad series."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"The fight scenes were done really well especially the scene where the ninja nun had the veil, but the show did have some hard to ignore flaws."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"so many plot lines set up and they managed to bring a total of none of them to completion at the end of the last episode. 
You want to drop a mad twist to cause a cliffhanger at the end of the season finale, thats fine. but close out a plot line or to so i don't feel like I wasted my time getting to the end."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,It seems you have an issue with the production team rather than the creative team. And what were you expecting it to be? A super serious edgy gritty murderthon?
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"How I would've written the show is singular episode revolving around each nun, giving backstory through showing not telling and the nuns fighting demons every episode to have some that WARRIOR part of the damn show. Then have Shannon die, then finally Ava joining in one or two episodes, not seven. This show just screams slow CW show and it's so painful."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"It was really attractive to me, but I came away from the first episode basically thinking ""this would be better if *everything* in it was better"".

In my dream world, it gets remade but from a heavy christian art nerd perspective. Rather than having the show's aesthetic revolve around the instagram-influencer image of party Europe, with a side of overly clean gothic in the vein of every otherhorror movie since 2000, really hone in on spanish-Christian architecture and traditions. It would require a total revision in all other aspects, too, but a boy can dream"
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,What a bunch of dog food.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,"The whole “angel bones” plot should have been saved for season 2. The science portal seems like an utter red herring. They should have let Ava run off with the Coachella Bunch, have the cardinal mess up the order because they lost the halo, endanger the squatters get attacked by demons and that sends Ava back to the order, where she teams up with Mother Superior to get the band back together. That’s a first season."
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,the last 2 episodes shouldve been the 3rd or 4th episode. It took  6 episodes for here to make friends then drop them completely and do the will she wont she act
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,I am getting this feeling more and more with Netflix tv shows.  Their need to push out as much content as they can I think is hurting.
Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia,And they couldn’t even land on a cosmology! Is God real? Are angels and demons just beings from another dimension? Establish your fucking premise!
BEASTARS,"Wow! I didn’t know it was gonna have a third season, I’m so pumped!!"
BEASTARS,"This was one of my most “well damn, didn’t expect it to be this good” anime. Gave it a shot on a whim and it absolutely did not disappoint!"
BEASTARS,"That's probably for the best, they can dip out before the manga became awful."
BEASTARS,"Good, cuz s2 wasn’t that great imo"
BEASTARS,"So the first 3 arcs, that were told across 99 chapters collected in 11 volumes in 22 episodes. How much what is left in TV episodes? (Just reminder they skipped back story chapters) 

I hope that the release in Netflix will be (almost) simuldub"
BEASTARS,"Yeah, very excited myself. Also really glad the end of season 2 wasn't the final for the entire show."
BEASTARS,"It def has some aspects that appear questionable from the outside - then it turns out it's one of the best, most thematically mature anime in years."
BEASTARS,"I haven't read the manga but there are 22 volumes. So, unless season 3 is 2 cours (around 24 episodes), then it will be rushed. But maybe it will still turn out great."
BEASTARS,"I was not disappointed by the end, yet I was eager for more so I totally share your sentiment 😄"
BEASTARS,"Season 2 was good but not as impressive as season 1. I think the focus on other characters was great but it ultimately took away from our two leads that barely hang out together.

I'm looking forward to season 3."

BEASTARS,It's a shame how bad the manga got after how great it was.
BEASTARS,"The manga ended just fine, you all should just stick to writing fanfiction."
BEASTARS,Season 1 was really something special.
BEASTARS,"Unfortunately, the manga is very similar. It feels like the romance plot gets side lined and it becomes a fighting manga."
BEASTARS,same can be said about the last episode of season 2.
BEASTARS,"On top of that, it just... doesn't really go anywhere.
[Spoiler](#s ""It just kind of ends, none of the school stuff is relevant, there's a weird snake security guard that's never mentioned again, the beastar is semi evil (and never resolves.) There's.. a whale, for some reason. The beastar stuff in general, even though its the name of the series, isn't important what-so-ever."")

The whole manga is a mess of ideas that has not got any pay off."
BEASTARS,"To be fair I think the person you responded to wanted more Louis and legoshi interactions instead of being off doing seperate things almost all season and nearly no interactions.

In my opinion juno and Haru are the worst part of the series and the worst examples of cliché female characters in shonen. Pretty much their only traits are romance, the less of them on screen the better.

Bill/Aoba/Pina and their child better get a full episode next season"
BEASTARS,"There's not a lot of things that are more disappointing than a manga that ends in a shitty way. 

Lately I've been sticking to reading stuff that's already finished, so I can check the comments and reviews beforehand to see if the ending is worth reading hundreds of chapters for."
BEASTARS,"Like we get one more good season really.
Then it goes tits up"
BEASTARS,"Eh, I think Haru is a nice inversion of the 'main female protag' that we seen in other anime. She appears the typical love interest, but she's actually got a lot of depth. Promiscuous, but not presented in that sort of way characters like that usually are. The show doesn't try to shame her for it either. I can't think of any other anime that writes realistically like that."
BEASTARS,I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me
BEASTARS,This was one of the best shows from last season.  Great characters and worldbuilding.
BEASTARS,"So the author of this manga, her father is the famous author of Baki- The Grappler"
BEASTARS,"About my one complaint I think I have for the Netflix translation is they decided to call Louis ""Rouis"".  I know Ls and Rs are interchangable when it comes to Japanese, but this was a name that seemed pretty clear the name is Louis.  

Oh well, it isn't going to stop my enjoyment as I love the manga and liked what I've seen of the first episode."
BEASTARS,I've initially wrote this Anime off due to the 3D animation. But damn was I impressed by the story. In fact the CGI works in well in enhancing it. 10/10 recommended.
BEASTARS,"It's such a shame that people call this ''zootopia but anime'' or ''furry anime''. It's def the most ''human'' show I've seen in a long time.

Studio Orange (previously did Land of the Lustrous;please watch that one too) did a remarkable job creating this gem of a show with excellent Music, animation and Direction.  
  Seriously even if you are not into anime, give this show a try. And calling it furbait is being very ignorant."
BEASTARS,I misread this as Beast Wars and got excited. Now I’m sad.

BEASTARS,the manga is a standout right from volume 1. don't really watch anime but i was hoping the adaptation would be done in the style of wes anderson's fantastic mr fox. it would have been perfect for beastars. ah well
BEASTARS,"I forced my way through the first episode, and once it was over, I immediately went and started to read the manga instead. I hated the animation so much.

Anyway, I like Beastars overall. It's **very** weird, and it does have a lot of things that I thought were stupid, but in the end I kind of liked it in a weird way."
BEASTARS,Holy shit the English dub on Legoshi. :F
BEASTARS,"Watched the first episode


It's impressive how incredibly unlikeable they managed to make every single character. Seriously, every single character in the first episode acts like a douchebag and I can't get behind anyone. I simply can't buy into the cynical atmosphere of the world, it's also way too mature/edgy for my tastes whereas something like Bojack Horseman is built as a dark comedy so it works better.


The character designs aren't that imaginative and the style of animation doesn't work for me much like the whole show. Maybe it gets better but not for me
I also despise teen angst shows"

BEASTARS,"> Furries: The CGI Anime

So as a furry I'll say:  you're not wrong.

But, it's one of the best animes in 10 years.  Calling it ""the furry CGI anime"" woudl be selling it horribly short.  All of the reasons it's good are non-furry.  Character writing, world building, and shot composition are all master class.  It's dark, it's tense, it's dramatic, and it's a helluva ride all the way through.

&nbsp;

I can't promise it won't awaken something in you, but the anime is just damn good.

&nbsp;

Prolly the first furry anime I'd actually call good and it's more than good it's top tier.  hataage kemono michi is good too if you like it's bizarre humor, but it's still nowhere close to Beastars."
BEASTARS,"> So I'm just watching the first episode right now but I guess it's a campus slasher for furries. And this stag feels a bit homoerotic... but maybe that's just me.
> 
> 
> 
> EDIT: OK, in the final scene the stag was going to meet the wolf at a door labelled ""BACK ENTRANCE.""

Since you're prolly writing it off I'll add a bit more here.  This is more of an in depth struggle with one's own nature and the exploring of a deep nuanced society while a romantic relationship develops with the normal angst involved.  All of these things combine with that real sense of danger from that first episode to create a cohesive narrative of not only the main characters but the world around them.  No single aspect would be entirely new but the way they're all interconnected and weave into and around each other is extremely well done so the overall package ends up being super compelling.

&nbsp;

Slasher is actually completely off base in this case and the stag...well...let's just say that he doesn't need to say ""no homo"" because there are no suspicions of that lol."
BEASTARS,"Yeah, the show has very little to do with the first episode. It literally does nothing but introduce a few premises that later episodes build on, but the real meat of the show is the battle between instinct and compassion, and it's actually shockingly well done. Took me by surprise when my gf and I realized we binged the first season in a few hours."

I'm going to take a different approach than the other poster.  If everyone else is the problem, maybe the problem is you.  

&nbsp;

I've been in the fandom for about 20 years in multiple cities.  I've found furries to be pretty similar to gamers and comic book nerds overall.  Just a nerdy group enjoying their nerdy thing where some enjoy their own nerdy porn.  (Have you seen Overwatch lol?)

We're just considered weirder for the moment.  But when I grew up (I'm 35) gamers and star wars/star trek nerds were also considered weird.  Especially the ones that cosplayed.  But now that's gone mainstream so it's totally normal.  They didn't change, how society viewed them did."
BEASTARS,"Loud minority meme imo. Most people are just like you.

Edit: Most furries, for anyone that struggles with context."
BEASTARS,>what is anime
BEASTARS,Japanese people tend to live by different standards huh?
BEASTARS,What is this a crossover episode?
BEASTARS,"Well, Land of the Lustrous (their previous work) is literally about sentient gems being adorable and finding new and exciting ways to suffer, it was kind of unavoidable"
BEASTARS,"""I heard"" there is a new anime that is literally about interracial fantasy creature brothel-testers, not totally explicit, but as close as they can get to it on japanese tv (not even sure it even is on tv)."
BEASTARS,"> I’ll put it on the list to watch. My fingers are crossed that this isn’t some weird furry show.

Beastars is a brilliantly written heavy world building character drama with mature dark elements and great shot composition.  It's furry, but it uses the nature of it's characters and world to paint a rich tapestry.  It's not trying to appeal to X fandom or demographic, it's just telling a damn good story.

&nbsp;

If you want a weird furry show that's another anime.  Watch ""hataage kemono michi"".  Furry Luchador gets transported to another world and helps bring about furry acceptance one suplex at a time.  It's weird, it's bizzare, it's hilarious, and it's got the funniest suplex in anime."
BEASTARS,"Well the two main characters are seconds away from oral sex by the end of the second episode, so it does get weird. But like Frank said, there's only one life so let's get weird with it"
BEASTARS,Same
BEASTARS,Great show.
BEASTARS,"Is it like evangelion darker, or Marquis de Sade darker?"
BEASTARS,Is it zootopia with furry sex and cannibalism?
BEASTARS,And graphic.
BEASTARS,Most anime is based on manga.
BEASTARS,"Did you save any whales today? No? Then you show captain kirk some goddamned respect. He fought Klingons, Romulans, men who thought they were gods, actual gods, and motherbearin' Tribbles and the federation was better for it. He watched his best friend die and then brought him back to life. He boldly went, in a ship rumored to be propelled by his libido. Unlikable? Green alien women want him and ensigns want to be like him."
BEASTARS,"Oh, I wasn't writing it off at all. I loved the first episode."
BEASTARS,"Wait, I care now. Now I care!

It's too late..."
BEASTARS,Depends. Is the fur your's or your dog's?
BEASTARS,Ummm most people are NOT like that
BEASTARS,"What a supid thing to say.

I'm sure there's a lot of anime that makes plenty of sense out there."
BEASTARS,"Sorry, what's your point?"
BEASTARS,"Joe Hill did the same thing.

It's not uncommon in general."
BEASTARS,"Not necessarily. Look at Nick Coppola.  Or, as you probably know him:  Nicholas Cage.

Although generally yes Japanese society is way better than Western society- just not in this specific instance."
BEASTARS,"[LoL](#s ""'Oh my god a piece of her broke off' 'Oh they can put her back together' 'Oh my god she shattered in a thousand pieces' 'OK she might lose some memories but we can kind of make her again' 'Oh wow now she's got parts that are mixed with other materials' 'Its cool that actually gives her special abilities once she learns how'"")"

BEASTARS,"> ""I heard"" there is a new anime that is literally about interracial fantasy creature brothel-testers, not totally explicit, but as close as they can get to it on japanese tv (not even sure it even is on tv).

So I've watched it.  It's hentai, but it isn't.  

Let me explain.  It has alot of content that 100% qualifies it as hentai, but its genuinely funny and it knows exactly what it is.  It prolly has better world building than most shonen in existence somehow.  It's just a fun and funny show, that is also hentai.  It's weird.  I don't even know how to draw the line on this one.  It's both an anime and a hentai lol.  Thanks Japan, you finally made the line so blurry it's both.

I'd recommend incognito watching 3 episodes.  You'll either finish it or you'll walk away.  I enjoyed it about the same way I enjoyed Shimoneta, for laughs.  Only with a few additional boners lol.

If it awakens anything in you, I'm sorry :p."
BEASTARS,On no it got taken off air when it showed the sex scenes in the third episode
BEASTARS,Yup I binge watched it weeks ago. It is really good and the few scenes that dealt with sex didn’t seem fan servicey.
BEASTARS,Or Evangelion hospital scene dark?
BEASTARS,Not as dark as either of those imo but this is more mature if you get what I mean
BEASTARS,"*and* high school angst thrown in!

It's actually a great show, I was originally turned off by the look of it (both the furry aspect and the CGI), but the studio (Orange, who also did Houseki no Kuni) did a great job with it."

What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Dead to Me starring Christina Applegate.  I loved it.  It was a great show with a good ending but watching her character go through the grief process was hard for me to watch.  And I consider that a compliment to her performance.  Loved the show.  Cried a lot.  Don't think I can watch it again.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Lots of folks saying LOST and I would’ve agreed but I rewatched it recently with somebody who had never seen it and it brought all the fun right back
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,I loved HIMYM when it was on but the ending killed any rewatchability. Also the character Barney has aged terribly.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"I don't think I can pick up Bojack Horseman again.  


I watched it for a fair while and realised it was actually making me depressed.  
So I stopped watching it.  


Which is a shame because it's a really great series, just way too heavy for me."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Dark - I really liked the show but it’s just too taxing and loses some of its appeal after you watch it once.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Lucifer. I loved the show because of Tom Ellis' performance, but nothing else about the show was good. ""Lucifer"" was single handedly carried by his charisma, and the entertainment you get from watching him. But all the other characters were boring (not because of the actors, the writing was just bland for them) unless they were interacting with Lucifer. Also the procedural elements were always insanely predictable and not interesting and took up way too much time.

I can just look up the Tom Ellis as Lucifer highlights on youtube if I want to rewatch the good components of the show."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"There is no show I love that I wouldn't rewatch.

There are in the case of movies, but shows for me are generally very rewatchable. At least after some years passed."

What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Full Metal Alchemist. I was ok up to the episode ""Night of the Chimera's Cry"".   That episode was straight up brutal!"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Neon Genesis Evangelion

Its really well produced and written, but I don't know if I'll want to go down trauma lane again any time soon. I don't even know if I can recommend it to people, it gets so dark. Then there's the End of Evangelion >!which was just a hour and a half of ""What if none of these traumatized characters got a happy ending?""!<"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"I was \*literally\* just talking to my husband about Bojack. We have a hard time getting friends interested in this series for some reason, but it was probably one of the most well-done shows I've ever watched. When it hits, it hits."

The main character goes through so much trauma man its pretty hard to watch."

What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Honestly everything except The Office. That is the ONLY show I can actually rewatch. Doesn’t matter how good a show is, I just can’t any enjoyment out of rewatching tv shows"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Sharp Objects
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"It's boring but... Basically every drama show that I've loved. It would be easier to say which of those I've actually rewatched. The Leftovers... I think that's it, actually. The Leftovers is the only drama I've seen that I've watched more than once.

Band of Brothers is probably the one drama I love that I don't want to rewatch the **most**. Anytime someone mentions the show, I think of that Bastogne episode and flinch."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Too many new shows can’t watch old stuff
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Right now?  The Last of Us.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Hannibal.  Awesome show, great story arcs, acting, etc.  But I know the storyline, I'm ""good"" with not watching it all over again."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,All of them. I have a hard enough time keeping up on new shows I want to watch; there's no way I'm going to go back and rewatch something.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Harlots  was soo good but cant do it again bc it just ends. Sad.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Lost 
it all lives in my mind and I think about it daily"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,All of them. No shows have managed to hit the same for me after a 2nd rewatch.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"On the flip side, I’ve rewatched Bojack maybe 4-5 times. It’s heavy but for the reasons you mentioned it has so much substance. Most scenes have some sort of visual gag in the background that I pick up on something different each time."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"All of them I guess. I never really rewatch tv shows, except for community maybe."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Lol bojack is one of the most rewatchable tv series.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Oz
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,Most of the shows I watch tbh. Shows I rewatch tend to be stuff I comfortably put on in the background for dinner and can enjoy at leisure. Like Futurama or B99.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Six Feet Under, great show I loved it but I don’t think I could watch it again, it made me feel more depressed lol."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,None. If I loved it I have or definitely will rewatch it.
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Sons of anarchy, anyone who tells you different is a liar"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,I Agree on Bojack. That show wrecked me
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Reading the title I instantly thought of Bojack as well. I lost track of how many times I rewatched the earlier seasons.
The finale may have released at the beginning of 2020, but I didn't watch the final episodes until late last year. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

And watching the end felt like a goodbye. It would feel like a betrayal to go back to the show now. Maybe I won't feel that way some years from now, but today I choose to leave it in the past."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"Done, return please"
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,"12 Monkeys, The Leftovers, and Penny Dreadful."
What Did You Eat Yesterday?,">For me, it’s BoJack Horseman. I just finished watching it for the first   
time and I don’t know if I have it in me to go through it again. Between  
 all the funny animal puns and sight gags, there was just too much   
self-destruction and heavy stuff going on. “That’s Too Much, Man!” and   
the subsequent reveal in season 6 regarding the ending was just a huge   
emotional gut punch that I don’t think I can ever revisit. Loved the   
series, thought it was phenomenal, but don’t think I can ever revisit it

Yes, the scene with Charlottes daugther is one of the biggest gut punches, and this is earlier in the series. I can't watch it again."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I totally thought that the show was over lol
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Jewel of Wilson’s foul domain
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Seeing as she’s literally married to He-Man, I’m not surprised."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Didn’t fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,This show is still on?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Super
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don’t think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine’s daughter:

https://youtu.be/YJku_F1cXow"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,She was super girl right?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Didn’t they already ruin this franchise?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,How has this not been cancelled yet?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"My take is it just needs to be a “He-Man” show… like the original was… 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it “He-Man.” You can do that, it’s a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans… that’s possible… but it’s not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,…..and it’s cancelled
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Why won’t Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she’s involved in.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Good. She was miscast.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I don’t think SMG was good in the role, but I also don’t think the show was very good period."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Would anyone even care?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Please don’t destroy my childhood, I can’t go through another Footloose situation"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I wouldn’t touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,This show was utter garbage
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Boooo
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,… and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Had no idea this was in the works
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"She doesn’t like to work. 

I don’t mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn’t so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn’t want to work on a second one at the same time."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,They did not say.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I’m assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Maybe she watched the first series
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,AND HE PRAYS!
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I loved it.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"No, just noisy Internet people."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Yes we did
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i’ll give credit where it’s due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Yup
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,sounds like a continuation
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we’re getting more, though."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,The Tron one hasn’t been renewed yet.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,See if it works out for 'em
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,They love losing money
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Read the show title again...
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"One could even say they’ve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they’re married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,Who doesn’t?
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
Legend Quest: Masters of Myth,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
Manhole,Full episode: https://youtu.be/Sh-LdHahQw0?t=20m11s
Manhole,Jay's favorite place.
Manhole,"Watched it 5 times, still can't make out the joke part..."
Manhole,"Should have followed it up with ""Sorry...it just slipped out""."
Manhole,"The game is about picking between three stories as to which is true and Gabbys story was about her friend falling down a manhole.

So as the panelists say *'I think we will go with manhole'*, they mean the manhole story, but Jack Dee takes the chance to interject with *'call her Gabby'*, and like all classic innuendo, he fakes being polite and referring to her by name, but the double meaning is she is a man hole meaning,..well if I have to explain that part as well, theres no hope for you sorry.

And now after dissecting and explaining the joke, I feel I have rendered it mirthless and dead. But I hope you now understand more of this earth thing called 'humour' so the joke did not die needlessly."
Manhole,Calling someone a hole for men effectively.
Manhole,"You shouldn't be downvoted. That, if delivered deadpan, would have been golden."
Manhole,"> I hope you now understand more of this earth thing called 'humour'

OP has shortened the clip to the point where the lack of context subtracts from the joke. Even as a regular WILTY viewer, it took a while for the line to register with me.

Putting the penultimate line in the title doesn't help either. "
Manhole,What does 'Gabby' mean?
Manhole,"> 'call her Gabby'

Ah, thats what he said that I couldn't make out, ok makes sense now"
Manhole,i dont even watch this show and i got it immediately. queso
Manhole,This is a clip I put on Youtube. I realise it's short but it was meant for a specific purpose. Sorry.
Manhole,"'Gabby' is the shortened version of the female name 'Gabrielle'. The female in the clip is Gabrielle Logan, a sports presenter better known as Gabby Logan in the UK. 


As an aside, in the UK referring to someone as 'gabby' can be intended to mean that they are talkative. There is a phrase 'They have the gift of the gab', which means that a person is chatty or that they are able to get people to do things for them through the their ability to talk convincingly. That's not relevant to this particular instance, but answers your question more fully. 

Edit: As u/JustAnOrdinaryGirl92 correctly pointed out, it's Gaby Roslin and not Gabby Logan. My bad."
Manhole,"If you edited in the start of Gabby's story and Rob's summary  , it would make more sense. I had to watch the whole clip to see who Gaby was, and hence who Jack was insulting."
Manhole,"Just to let you know, that's not Gabby Logan I'm not sure who it is though."
Manhole,Gaby Roslin
My Country: The New Age,Thanks Jim Nantz.

My Country: The New Age,This show is so brutally bad. It is so needlessly over dramatic. Wildland firefighting is hard tough work but it is rarely glorious.

My Country: The New Age,"Cbs didn’t have a budget for real fire? Or better fire effects lol. You would think that would be the main source of expense for a firefighter show. This show is so bad, i think the only reason it got so many views is because it has some hard hitters as the cast, three that i know from other stuff."
My Country: The New Age,Omg so many cringy one liners in this show… “this isn’t a uniform. It’s armor”.  Man it’s so bad. My favorite so far is the beginning of episode 3 when the guy runs out from the hills on fire and the two firefighters with hoses and water going don’t even turn around while the main characters knock the guy over the beat the fire out.  This show is painful.

My Country: The New Age,It could be done poorly just to see if it catches on.  Let's see if season 2 gets better. It might be cheap just to see if it bombs they don't lose as much money

My Country: The New Age,"you know, you’re never going to enjoy a show about your line of work because they always inevitably fuck it up 

in fact, the only movie that ever nailed the reality of the job was “waiting”"
My Country: The New Age,"Question, why not watch a documentary if you're expecting realism? I believe that network also made an actual documentary about firefighing and Calfire (had to look it up - it's called *Bring your own Brigade*).

I have no idea why people watch fictional shows and then complain that it doesn't mimic reality. 

And then 5 minutes later they'll be happily watching something like Cobra Kai, which has such a laughingly unrealistic and stereotypical portrayal of martial arts that it's impossible to watch more than 10 minutes of it."
My Country: The New Age,"I don't think the show is meant for people who actually do the job. My dad is a retired firefighter and I tried to get him to watch Chicago Fire but he hated how unrealistic it is, so I figure it's the same with this show. Honestly the target demographic is probably people 30+ with boring low risk jobs. Just like cop shows, I'm sure actual cops find them offensive to their job or an embarrassment. It's a tv drama, it's gonna be fictional. It's just for entertainment, if you want realism, watch a documentary."
My Country: The New Age,I live in the heart of wildfire country in Canada. Thank you for what you do.

My Country: The New Age,"Oh totally fair. I just don’t understand why they couldn’t up the quality. For instance the movie Only the Brave. Did a pretty accurate portrayal of the culture and brotherhood experienced on the line. It has its moments but at the same time you can tell they did their research. In Fire Country.

Raising Dion,I'm sorry the kid can't act. I couldn't get past that. I feel like the casting should have been better.
Raising Dion,"No surprise whatsoever. Season one was pretty good, but man was season two a letdown. The writing, especially in the last 2 episodes, was shit terrible."
Raising Dion,I know we all wanna be mad about Netflix canceling stuff but how many do you actually watched this show? I watched the first season and thought it was absolutely awful. I’m less surprised that it got canceled and more surprised that it even got a second season in the first place.
Raising Dion,I have a feeling there will be a wave of cancellations of Netflix series coming due to their panic of losing subscribers. They already gutted their animation department so let's see which shows survive.
Raising Dion,"I really loved season 1!! But season 2 kinda fell off…

I think the story just went into a direction at times that felt like the most boring direction possible. Near the end stuff got serious with his mom, and like yes, it was an interesting and high stakes concept, but then it all got solved very easily and I just hate when shows do that. 

Tbh I can barely remember how season 2 ended, but I vividly remember how season 1 ended..?"
Raising Dion,"Whaaaaaaat Netflix cancelled a show after two seasons?!

_faints with shock_

/s"
Raising Dion,Two seasons at Netflix is like five anywhere else.
Raising Dion,It got a second season?
Raising Dion,"This is probably a fair cancellation.

I thought it was a fun show but season 2 didn't do enough for me to care about a lack of a third season."
Raising Dion,"I never watched this show but eventually people are gonna catch on and not watch shows on Netflix until they have a final season and wrap up. No use wasting your time on a show without knowing if it’ll be cancelled (it probably will)

This will ultimately affect their viewing numbers. Probably won’t make a huge dent but it will be there."
Raising Dion,"""Canceled After Two Seasons"" and Netflix, iconic."
Raising Dion,"""NO ENDINGS!!!"" screamed the netflix executive, jumping up and down on his desk, turning redder and redder and throwing his paperweights at anyone who got too close."
Raising Dion,if you haven't cancelded your netflix sub yet you should there is going to be next to nothing left. You get way better content on HBO/Max and Hulu.
Raising Dion,*Canceling Dion
Raising Dion,Suppose for the 4 people who watched it this isn’t good news
Raising Dion,let's get ready for the mass cancellation of other series
Raising Dion,Damn it....am just almost done with the 2nd season and am feeling gutted after seeing this lol
Raising Dion,Problem with netflix. Shows appear and disappear without anyone knowing they existed. They are blowing their load on exclusives most people don't even know are there.
Raising Dion,I blame Netflix’s method of production.  Complete lack of oversight.  Leaves things like this to chance
Raising Dion,"Do Netflix make much/any children's content? I'm thinking of this + The Babysitter's Club being cancelled, and I figure neither really lend themselves to the metric Netflix usually uses (28 day windows, how many new sign-ups it encourages), so I'm wondering if it's something they're just not doing a lot of generally... or if there's loads I'm just not aware of"
Raising Dion,"For those curious the viewership of this show the first week was:

English Language Shows:

Raising Dion: Season 2 -> 49.1 Million Hours

Raising Dion: Season 1 -> 26.5 Million Hours

Makes me worried about smaller shows like Heartstopper with only 14.55 million hours viewed.

(I know its not a fair comparison because the episodes are longer and hopefully more expensive on Raising Dion)"
Raising Dion,"This was the definition of a mid level performer going by Netflix top 10s. Not amazing, but not bad either. Did arguably slightly better WW than domestic. Most other networks keep their mid level performers.

Here is my scoreboard for scripted shows US top 10 starting from week of November 22nd on (1st = 10 pts, 9 = 9 pts, etc.)

With the cancellation of Raising Dion, Archive 81 and Lost in Space the message is clear that shows at that range isn't enough. Vikings Valhalla was renewed but is a stronger international performer. Woman in the House is supposed to be a miniseries so they can quietly not bring it back, though I bet if it was a bigger hit they would."
Raising Dion,Shocker
Raising Dion,Surprised this was even made in the first place
Raising Dion,"Why would I invest my time in any Netflix series right now when they are cancelling a load of them?

&#x200B;

Except Better Call Saul of course."
Raising Dion,This is the first time I've heard of this series.
Raising Dion,"They lost a lot of the charms of the first seasons. 

That said, Netflix needs to stop making shows they have no commitment to when the shows really need to be renewed to tell the story, or worse, when the writing indicates they didn't expect to have to carry the story on for multiple seasons."
Raising Dion,Am I only one who thought Titanic and shuddered?
Raising Dion,"I’m not mad that they cancelled it, I’m more mad that they didn’t give it a proper ending. Season 2 ended on such a big cliffhanger."
Raising Dion,Great show.  It was awesome.  Can't believe they canceled it
Raising Dion,Honestly everyone’s acting was ass. It felt like they were only given one take every time.
Raising Dion,Guaranteed that kid is the nephew of a Netflix exec
Raising Dion,"I'm mad about Netflix canceling stuff without giving it a chance and because they do an ass job of promoting shows. I've never heard of this show. I've never heard of most of the stuff they've canceled. No, I wouldn't have watched everything if I'd heard of it before it got canceled, and I'm sure some of the canceled shows were just not good. But the issue isn't that they cancel stuff, it's that they don't do a great job promoting their stuff so I don't hear about it until after it's canceled anyway. It feels like Stranger Things and Big Mouth are the only things that DIDN'T get canceled.

Thank God for Mike Flannagan's limited series - can't cancel a show after one season if it was only gonna be one season long in the first place!"
Raising Dion,Is the Dragon Prince officially cancelled then? I liked that show and was holding out hope it came back eventually.
Raising Dion,This is not panic. It pulled very similar viewership numbers to Archive 81 which also got shitcanned. Both did around 20 million over 28 days. Obviously Netflix deem that not good enough for US dramas on the service.
Raising Dion,"Oh lawd, I hope Castlevania survives."
Raising Dion,TWO seasons is actually shocking.
Raising Dion,I thought it was a movie so I'm even more shocked lol
Raising Dion,This is a problem for every streaming service and every channel. You never know when a show will end. Statistically speaking your chance of watching a show from Netflix that gets cancelled is the same as most other places because the cancel rates are the same. The difference is Netflix creates way more shows than everybody else so the raw cancellations are higher they’ve had the wheels in motion for years and aren’t limited by technology on how many shows they create. The only exception is Probbaly Disney but most of their shows are limited series and their output is significantly less.
Raising Dion,"Netflix isn't the first company to cancel shows, it has been a thing on TV since forever. When you start a show in its first seasons, you never know if it'll get an ending, that's like part of the medium. 

Netflix is canceling like the others, they just have way more shows overall so the raw numbers of cancelations are pretty high. And they often at least get a full season or two. Before shows were canceled mid-season sometimes. We just forgot those because they failed and didn't have audience like what Netflix is canceling. Most people didn't care about Raising Dion now and certainly won't in like 10 years"
Raising Dion,This did have an ending though. The show wasn’t great but if S2 was announced beforehand as the “final season” the ending would have been satisfying enough.
Raising Dion,"thing is, netflix is available pretty much everywhere. hulu is us exclusive, hbo max isnt active in my country either"
Raising Dion,"They still put out more content than anybody else lol, but yeah nothing left. Without counting that for international, they are far above the others.

Also this is a show that 99% of people on this sub probably didn't even know about and nobody cared. This is normal to cancel stuff.

It's like people think Netflix is the first company to cancel TV shows that are failing."
Raising Dion,"I'm waiting for Stranger Things season 4 to drop. After that, I'll probably cancel. I already have Prime, and can probably pick up another service as well and still not pay as much as I do for Netflix right now."
Raising Dion,This hyperbole is getting so ridiculous lol
Raising Dion,Basically Netflix / D+ and Amazon Video here in U.K.  won’t be getting HBO till like fucking 2026 or some shit
Raising Dion,"This one KIND OF has an ending. Definitely had potential to go on longer, though."
Raising Dion,"Rasing Dion had arguably one of the biggest PR pushes in Netflix history. If you didn’t know about it, you probably weren’t on the internet at the time"
Raising Dion,"Netflix, by nature, gives every show a chance.  It doesn't do pilots, it doesn't cancel shows mid-season, it doesn't move shows that are failing to less desirable places on the schedule.  It puts a whole season of TV out there for people and, if it's successful, it gets renewed.  If not, it gets canceled."
Raising Dion,Raising Dion S1 was one of top 10 most watched shows of the year. So pretty you just weren’t paying attention
Raising Dion,"Not sure how you missed it, it was trending when the first season released and often at times appeared on Netflix’s genre categories."
Raising Dion,"No, the production company is just taking way too long to put out season 4. They had a Twitter post around Christmas time about it."
Raising Dion,No it's just taking long. It has actually be renewed for 4 seasons which would be the complete show.
Raising Dion,Still upset that Archive 81 won’t get a second season. Grrrr
Raising Dion,Didn't Castlevania already end?
Raising Dion,Cries in Teenage Bounty Hunters
Raising Dion,"Fuck in the old days shows would get pulled halfway through a season.   Something like 60% of network shows were cancelled before a second season.


Everyone acting like Netflix cancelling things is some sort of unique phenomenon is high"
Raising Dion,"Apple has been solid lately, especially for 4.99 a month."
Raising Dion,"Nah, that cliffhanger was too big. This didn’t get an ending, or atleast not a proper one."
Raising Dion,"I've been on the internet regularly, don't know anything about it other than passing it by when I last had access to Netflix."
Raising Dion,"I don't fault them for cancelling shows because they more then anyone know can tell if viewers are watching the show. I'm fine with them cancelling a show after one season because you shouldn't throw good money after bad. But, I think anything that gets two seasons should get a 3rd season to wrap it up."
Raising Dion,"""If it's successful, it gets renewed"".

&#x200B;

Then you have something like Dark Crystal Age of Resistance, which got cancelled after one season, even with how much praise it got."
Raising Dion,"A Dragon Prince season 4 update from two weeks ago - 6 episodes done.

Raising Dion,"Someone else already told me it's still going, they didn't mention it's going to end though. Did they only plan for 4? From what I remember of the story it would make sense, you just never know with Netflix."
Raising Dion,"The thing that kills me about Archive 81 is that could've totally ended in a movie. 

Just find a way to get him out of the other world place, nothing more, nothing less and wrap it up in like 90 minutes."
Raising Dion,Dude this is the first Im hearing that! Oof guess I have no reason to sign up for Netflix anytime soon!
Raising Dion,"Yes, but they announced a spin-off a while back."
Raising Dion,"difference is in the past  you cancel a show and it gets forgotten

now its permantly part of netflix's library unfinished"
Raising Dion,"Definitely! They’re #1 on my list at the moment. I had a trial a while back, but the selection wasn’t good enough for me to stay on. However, they seem to have added a lot of great stuff lately."
Raising Dion,Praise doesn't equate to people watching
Raising Dion,Yeah they basically said to Netflix that's what they needed to plan the rest of the story (4 seasons in addition to the 3 there are already) and got this number of seasons. So basically it's the best possible scenario there. A planned ending (and with a lot instead of just one season that could have been rushed) and not going on without an end in sight which can lead to worse writing IMO)
Raising Dion,I think people are trippin over the animation thing. Days after that news came out they announced that kengan season 2 will be coming out soon.
Raising Dion,That’s what I was referring to.
Raising Dion,"I'm surprised that's not more of a concern for them - or maybe it is and Raising Dion just fell on the wrong side of the equation still anyway - given that you'd think they want this stuff to still be attracting new viewers indefinitely, and it'd be more attractive to them if it had an ending"
Raising Dion,"What is your definition of successful?  Even shows like Raising Dion (one of the most top 10 watched shows of the year), just recently ended up getting cancelled."
Raising Dion,"Of course it was one of the most watched shows of the year when it premiered, it premiered in February lmao. That doesn't mean it had enough total viewers for Netflix to think it was worth renewing."
Raising Dion,"On the flipside, you have Netflix shows like Hilda, Green Eggs and Ham the series on Netflix, or Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts) that aren't insanely popular, yet Netflix chose to renew them still.  Netflix's choice to renew a show isn't always black and white and about numbers, but sometimes it could be about arbitrary reasons."
Raising Dion,How exactly do you know they aren't popular? Do you see the ratings?
Raising Dion,"I didn't say they aren't popular.  What I meant by they are not ""insanely popular"", is that while the shows don't reach anywhere near the most watched shows on Netflix, Netflix still chose to renew them.  Example; as someone who has been following the Green Eggs and Ham series since it premiered in 2019, the show did gain some attention; there was not much attention to the show aside from Saberspark bringing the most attention to it, and it mainly gained a dedicated small fanbase that wanted the show to get more attention. This is what I noticed with the show since its premiere as someone whose followed it for three years, despite Netflix hiding the show's numbers.

If Raising Dion got cancelled despite its high numbers, and something like Green Eggs and Ham seemed to very likely be way less in viewership, than it's clear that Netflix's renewal decision is not always based on an incredibly high number of viewers, but it could for arbitrary reasons, such as general reception of the show, etc. 

Speaking of how cancellation is not always black and white, it's possible that Raising Dion got cancelled for reasons that did not involve viewership, since what one of the stars said about the cancellation, suggests that season 2 did just as well as the first season in terms of viewership. 

“Sad to say that Raising Dion is CANCELLED. Thank you for all of the amazing support we got from all of our wonderful fans! **Season 2 was a success, equal to season 1 , even if just looking at how many people watched all of it and wanted a season 3! **” - Cancellation is not always about a show reaching viewership. Link below to the article. 

https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/04/27/why-was-raising-dion-cancelled/"
Raising Dion,"So the only idea you have of the ratings data is the star of the show saying it did well? Lol what?  You seem to just be measuring a show's popularity based on how much you personally see it discussed on the internet, but you have no idea how many people are actually watching it."
Raising Dion,"lol, what?? I said it's *possible* that the show got cancelled for a different reason other than low numbers, especially considering how there have been Netflix shows that were never even in the top 10 that still got renewed and continued to be invested in by Netflix. Example; Green Eggs and Ham and Kipo were not in the top ten when they premiered. Doesn't mean that they weren't popular; that just means that if they weren't in the top ten, then clearly didn't reach the heights of something like Raising Dion's popularity, and yet they *still* got renewed, lol."
Raising Dion,"You're putting way too much stock in seeing something in the top 10, which just means something is relatively popular at the moment compared to everything else.  And that and the metric of seeing something discussed on the internet, and seeing an actor say a show was successful, is all you're judging by.  None of those actually tell you anything about total viewers.  To the contrary, Netflix values total hours watched.  The Top 10 is just a way another way to recommend content to subscribers.  So I don't know why you'd think it got canceled for anything besides not getting enough viewers."
Raising Dion,"""You're putting way too much stock in seeing something in the top 10, which just means something is relatively popular at the moment compared to everything else.""

Seeing something in the top ten means that the show has enough attention at the moment to potentially skyrocket from there.  Arcane is a perfect example of this, where it started off as relatively popular and ended up staying in the top ten for four weeks, with millions of hours accumulated.  Then you have Raising Dion, which spent four weeks in the top 10 and got 2.74 billion minutes of view time, in the four weeks after it's premiere (article below). And no; I'm not arguing that viewership for Dion couldn't have dropped off after week 4. My argument, is that clearly the top ten has more of a purpose than just recommending any content to subscribers.  

 https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-cancels-raising-dion-2-seasons-1235135811/

Whether a top ten show skyrockets or falls off, if a show never even reaches that top ten in the first place, then it clearly wasn't popular enough to reach such a level and potentially take off even further from there.  That's not me putting too much stock into it.  It's just a simple concept to grasp. Green Eggs and Ham and Kipo never even reached the top ten once, which is why even without metrics, they were clearly less popular than a show that racked up over 2 billion hours and stayed in the top ten not for a couple days or a week, but for four weeks. Yet those shows got renewed, while Raising Dion was axed. Maybe Netflix is harder on some shows when it comes to hours watched, while for other shows, general reception may be more of a determining factor than simply just total hours."
Raising Dion,"Again, seeing something in the top ten just means it's what's being watched the most at that particular moment. It's just a marketing tool, like the ""here's what others are buying"" feature on Amazon. 

Viewership can peak and fall off, and you can wind up with less viewership than a show that never made the top 10, but had consistent, longer lasting viewership anyway.  And that's what Netflix values. Sorry, Raising Dion just didn't accumulate as many hours watched as those other shows."
Raising Dion,"I'm back; was away from a while.  

""Again, seeing something in the top ten just means it's what's being watched the most at that particular moment. It's just a marketing tool, like the ""here's what others are buying"" feature on Amazon.""

lol, what?  The fact that something is in the top ten to begin with, vs something that was never even in the top ten, means that the latter was never *as* popular in the first place.  Literally none of what you said changed my point. 

""Viewership can peak and fall off, and you can wind up with less viewership than a show that never made the top 10, but had consistent, longer lasting viewership anyway.""

That is literally what I said in my previous post, that viewership can drop off.  Not sure what point you're making, since you're just repeating what I said.  Also, the other two shows didn't have anywhere near the viewership of Raising Dion, because they never even gained a place in the top 10 or became one of the most top watched shows for days.  At this point, your argument no longer names sense, and it just feels like you're throwing something at the wind to see if it will stick."
Raising Dion,">The fact that something is in the top ten to begin with, vs something that was never even in the top ten, means that the latter was never as popular in the first place.

I'm guessing you keep on dwelling on the Top 10 and it's become your only argument because it's the only way you think Raising Dion might have possibly been more popular. 

So let's break this down with simple numbers.  Over the course of a month, show A gets 100 views in the first week, 50, in the second, and 20 views in each of the next two.  Over the course of a month, show B gets 50 views a week.  See how a show can get more views throug

And the biggest thing is that the top 10 is determined by *hours watched*.  Raising Dion is an hour long show. Those other shows you're complaining about are a half hour lmao.  It's just simply not an indicator of what is getting the most views overall"
Raising Dion,"Here is what is wrong with your argument. You keep trying to argue that Green Eggs and Ham and Kipo were more popular, despite the article that I posted showing that Raising Dion got billions of viewers (which is enough for something to be in the top ten in the first place and stay there for a month, vs. something that was never there).  At this point, you're just ignoring the numbers, in favor of repeating your own argument that Dion was never that popular, when the peak viewership completely negates that.  Also, I **never** said that being in the top ten is all that matters, and I never said that a show cannot drop off even after being in the top ten. 

I said that if something is in the top ten, it's more popular than other shows that aren't in the top ten which may *still** be popular at the time. But the fact of the matter is that said shows are still not popular enough to be on the top ten, if they never appear there in the first place, compared to the other shows that are there. And like I said before viewership may skyrocket for the top ten shows.  At this point, it seems like you are creating an argument for things that I never said, and now I'm having to repeat myself."
Raising Dion,"What's wrong with your argument is you're using a metric that is based on hours watched (millions of hours watched, not billions of viewers.  That's a weird lie.) and comparing an hour long show with a half hour long show.  And despite not saying that that's your whole argument...it is. And you're disregarding that Netflix has said what's important to them is total viewers and consistency of viewing over time because that's what matters for keeping subscribers, not peak viewership.

And you just repeated yourself, didn't correct any of that.  So...I feel like repeating yourself several times in the thread, lying, and using misleading metrics is enough for you in this thread."
Raising Dion,Esperanza is the best character so far
Raising Dion,[deleted]
Raising Dion,"Got to the second episode and the whole stolen watch thing really hit hard and brought so many bad childhood memories up I had to stop it for a second and recoup myself. 😂

I remember growing up as a tall black kid in a majority white school and it was *not* fun. Bullies always won because I knew and they knew that if I stood up for myself , I'd end up the loser or the ""aggresive black kid""  in the end , regardless of what happened to me...

Ended up becoming a very quiet child buried in books."
Raising Dion,"I personally loved the show, up until they decided to make Pat evil. It didn't make sense at all, and I don't think I'll even watch season 2 because of how upset I am. He genuinely cared about them before he knew Dion even had powers. I can get why it would be important to portray boundaries, but I feel like they're just trying too hard to make it seem like white people are all entitled or bad. It would've been interesting to me if they had made Mark (Dion's dad) evil. Like he didn't have to be actually evil, just a cause of the powers, but I never got any weird vibes from Pat and I think it was dumb to switch up like that. Definitely got those vibes from that one little kid who gets the evil at the end, but Pat was super sweet and they just always make it seem like the 'loser' can't win. He and Nicole were totally vibing, they just wanted a villain."
Raising Dion,"The kid is terrible at acting. Maybe he’ll get better. But I would like to think that could have found someone better. The mom character is consistently struggling, it is important to show just how difficult single motherhood is but the delivery is terrible. It’s either the acting or the writing. Can’t decide. 

I wonder if this is a show made just for the sake of diversity. If you find things to be cheese that’s probably because it is written by someone who is literally clueless or who wrote this so that it’s mild enough for “general population” consumption.

I’m on episode 5 and the storyline has convinced me that a kid with an attitude who also has super power is just a terrible and irritating.

Some of the specialFX is not very believable but given the budget maybe that’s the best it has to offer.

Oh Jesus and the dance scene. Should have gotten a double. It was terrible camera work trying to hide the fact that she can’t dance. Or maybe I’ve just watched too much so you think you can dance. 

Will keep watching maybe it’ll get better."
Raising Dion,"Ok, I really liked this show - it was great!! I'm gonna have to disagree with a lot of you on the acting - I think they all did awesome, including the actor who plays dion - He's supposed to be 8 - Totally believable. I really liked how the mom addressed many of the issues - especially explaining it to Dion. She did not show any disrespect or Hatred, but explained both the racism idea AND the boundary idea in a very good way - i think the way it should be explained to your kids. 

My issue comes in with the PLOT TWIST! I was SHOCKED - absolutely taken back. I mean - i had been wondering the whole time how pat Didn't manage to get powers, but good grief. I feel like his character development took a right angle and came out of left field. I can see it, I suppose, with everything he has been through. I was just really rooting for them to get together, I guess. He was portrayed as such a nice guy. But, after he started acting crazy...probably very true to real life abusive relationships."
Raising Dion,"It  could be a cool show - it has a good story - but it has this janky, Christmas special, Hallmark channel, family-themed soundtrack that makes it feel cheap. Which really sucks because the actual songs they use are really good and tonally are much more in line with the rest of the show. The soundtrack feels so out of place."
Raising Dion,"Mom is annoying, kid is annoying."
Raising Dion,"I'm on episode 9. The first few episodes are interesting, but a little tough at times. There might be enough to grab your interest, but Dion is a constant annoyance. Once you've reached episode four the evil, that presumably Dion will defeat, plot runs parallel with that of his mother. Nicole being the main character becomes more obvious as the show continues forward, which is more than acceptable as Wainright is the best in cast. And even White as Dion starts to get into his character.

I'm not going to spoil anything, but it is a good show. It really is very well executed despite having a turbulent start."
Raising Dion,"The basic idea of the show was good, but that kid, please recast him for next season. His acting makes this show unwatchable. I have never been so annoyed by somebody's acting. I'd rather watch somebody scratching chalkboard than this again."
Raising Dion,"I like the show after watching the first season. I especially like how the kids are portrayed realistically. Kids that age are annoying, goofy, loud, and they don’t listen. Esperanza is amazing and funny it had some issues but it was good for the most part"
Raising Dion,I liked it very much. Good show...
Seis Manos,"Such a great show, and the fact it has such a great latinx cast. A+. Love seeing a part of my culture in an Anime."
Seis Manos,/r/seismanos
Seis Manos,"I watched 3 episodes, I couldn't stand the choppy animation, the old film filter and the colors (everything looks sepia). In my opinion it felt like a Robert Rodríguez movie with martial arts."
Seis Manos,"Castlevania was great but the animation was terrible, the  worst part of the whole show. 

I mean the look of it was awesome, but the actual animation, how the characters moved was like amateurish and choppy and terrible."
Seis Manos,Latino*
Seis Manos,I think the film filter is to match the setting.
Seis Manos,"I suppose that’s true but I guess I didn’t mind because the story was dope, and what was seen was pretty cool. It also wasn’t some kind of weird stuttery motions like a 3D anime.

But if you liked castlevania, check this out."
Seis Manos,"The 70's? Mexico? In my opinion the filter has nothing to do with the setting. It's an esthetic decision, after all the series is influenced by old martial movies and 70's movies, so they're aiming for that ""retro"" feeling. Robert Rodríguez does the same in some movies and this series is made by his cousin."
Seis Manos,Fair enough and that’s what I was meaning. It was put into match the time period.
Seis Manos,"I see. Yeah, it creates an atmosphere. I want to give this show a chance, so I'll watch the rest later."
Seis Manos,I found what was going on plot wise worthwhile and definitely made me want to watch more to see what happens.
Seis Manos,"There is a futuristic animated series based on the Ramayana called 'Heaven’s Forest' that is in the works at Netflix. It's by the Castlevania studio and by the same writer Warren Ellis.

Ellis went through some drama himself so I don't know if it's still in development or if he has been taken off as writer, but that's what I'm most looking forward to."
Seis Manos,">As everyone knows, “Arcane” is taking the world by storm right now.

The highest it ranked on UK Netflix was 8th.

>is now the highest rated animated show on IMDb

Not surprised when you have multiple posts on reddit encouraging people to rate it 10/10. But it was a good show so whatever.

[It also had a 9/10 before it even released.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qoabj7/arcane_show_hasnt_even_premiered_and_its_getting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

>which show coming do you think will receive a similar amount of attention and praise?

Very few. Arcane is a pretty good show with animation far better than most animated series and the backing of a huge pre-established fanbase.

I think the Avatar spin-off will be bigger though and the biggest animated show announced currently.

- Chainsawman will be huge (nowhere near Demon Slayer big though) but I doubt it will be as big as the Avatar spin-off.
- Pluto will be great but I don't think it will be mainstream at all.
- Dota: Dragonblood S1 didn't seem all that popular so I don't think S2 will compete with Arcane at all.
- It could be another adaptation of a video game, like the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077: Edgerunners.

I think:

1. Avatar Spin-off
2. Chainsawman
3. Arcane S2
4. Invincible S2
5. Uzumaki
6. Spy x Family
7. Akira TV Series

I think if Invincible has better animation in S2 it could be huge though."
Seis Manos,I think I'm gonna give Arcane a few years before I watch it
Seis Manos,"I heard something about an X-Men show being created by Disney.

That has the chance of being pretty amazing."
Seis Manos,i thought the live action Cowboy Bebop blew Arcane out of the water
Seis Manos,"All of the other video games with a stigmatized for a reason fan base might get it, Overwatch (once they get rid Pedo Bobby) and Genshin Impact. There is also a Splatoon manga."
Seis Manos,"Honestly,  whoever writes a cartoon with a brain and puts some money behind the animation

Yeah it helps to have existing fans but avatar didn't.  It got popular because it was elevating the medium.  That's why arcane is big. It's really well written and animated. 

Everyone's trying to make the next game of thrones or the next sopranos or avatar or whatever.  It's not about picking the game genre or funding the right fan base, it's about making something great"
Seis Manos,"An Elder Scrolls TV show, although I would actually prefer if they went the live action route…Dragon Age, Dishonored, and Jade Empire are other contenders"
Seis Manos,Hideo Kojimas company might make something good.
Seis Manos,"The only IP that has as much power as LOL world wide is one piece. I don’t expect the live action to be good though.

I’d say whatever big plans Pokémon has will be as big or bigger than arcane. Just due to mainstream popularity"
Seis Manos,Depends if powerhouse gives it their all or not. I just watched “Blood of Zeus” and the animation in that is so incredibly bad it makes certain low budget anime look good in comparison. So it depends if it’ll get the same budget as Castlevania and He Man.
Seis Manos,"''As everyone knows, “Arcane” is taking the world by storm right now'' while OP's describtion might be off, I feel like you are underselling it a bit in your comment. It was the most watched english tv show on Netflix last week globally, it was 2nd most watched the week before and it is currently sitting at 4th. Not as a strong of a performance compared to when a mainstream tv show becomes a hit but considering how this is an animation, it is a good step forward toward changing people's perceptions about the medium in Europe and North America since many seem resilient toward taking similiar shows seriously."
Seis Manos,"I mean, UK is one place. It was topping the Netflix charts mostly everywhere. Some exceptions where the traction wasnt top 10 worthy, but in many European, Asian, Middle Eastern and Western countries it was #1. And the times it wasnt #1, it was usually top 3 or 5. A couple exceptions where its out of Top 5 seems a bit nitpicky. 

It very clearly was highly loved on Netflix. 

As to the IMDB rating, god knows I dont value it that highly. But lets not pretend similar brigades didnt happen with pretty much all other majorly highly rated IMDB shows. I remember Breaking Bad and GoT being brigaded by Reddit giving 10's as well. Most of those shows had 9+ ratings before release just like Arcane. It isnt an Arcane problem, its an IMDB problem. I think using that to belittle Arcane is a bit silly. It had the same advantages as all other shows in the top 250 on IMDB. 

Hell, Chernobyl is like my favourite show, but even that was heavily brigaded. 

I'll be very surprised if Avatar Spin-Off gets the reception of Arcane. I want it to blow up because Im a fan of the series. I even liked Korra. But if Korra's popularity is any indication, I have a feeling even if the spin-off is good, it wont be as popular as the original or Arcane. I hope Im wrong though."
Seis Manos,"Invincible was already huge.  And I thought it's animation was mostly good.  I liked it,  and liked the comic,  but both with the same exact caveats- the writing is pure Kirkman in both,  which means it's very good drama but very very overwritten dialogue. People will just talk forever, needlessly,  and grind things to a halt, and it often feels unnatural.  Same was true of the walking dead comic. 

It says a lot imo that despite that issue,  invincible is really good"
Seis Manos,[deleted]
Seis Manos,"I do think chainsaw man will be more popular than demon slayer in the Western Hemisphere at least. Demon slayer still gets a lot of flack for pretty much just being a generic shonen anime despite having a lot of care put into the visuals.

Forgot to add Uzumaki, thanks for reminding me that that show is coming out. Though it’s probably far more niche than Pluto.

I do agree with you that the avatar show will be massive, especially if they aim for a pg13 rating like they did with Arcane."
Seis Manos,Why?
Seis Manos,X-Men just doesn't work that well when its made for children.
Seis Manos,"The fact that you were down voted is the same reason why I can't take Reddit suggestions on anything seriously.

The Redditor is literally the ""Basic Bitch"" of the internet. Just cultural blandness."
Seis Manos,Overwatch is a definite. I think Genshin is way too “anime” for it to reach a wider audience. It would probably win over anime fans though.
Seis Manos,How was Seis Manos?
Seis Manos,"> think using that to belittle Arcane is a bit silly. It had the same advantages as all other shows in the top 250 on IMDB. 

Did I belittle it? Pretty sure I mentioned it was good immediately after. I am just pointing it out as OP mentioned iMDb.

Also, let's remember it has far less votes than Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. So the birgading impact would be more significant.

>I'll be very surprised if Avatar Spin-Off gets the reception of Arcane.

Avatar is extremely popular without the bad reception LoL seems to have. People have been waiting since December 2014 for more animated content from that world.

> I even liked Korra. But if Korra's popularity is any indication, I have a feeling even if the spin-off is good, it wont be as popular as the original or Arcane. I hope Im wrong though.

Nickelodeon prevented TLOK from being as good as it could have been.

- Censoring content.
- Cutting funding for episodes after the writers already planned things out meaning they had to turn one episode into a recap.
- Not telling the writers how many seasons/episodes they would have in advance.

With how big Avatar has become and the fact it's going to be on a streaming service instead of tv I am pretty sure it will be less censored, have better management and funding. Leading to a bigger and better story than TLOK. Leading it to be bigger than Arcane."
Seis Manos,Yeh but the posts of people encouraging others to give it 10s is also a little off-putting and the people getting upset it went from a 9.4 to 9.3 is also a bit odd.
Seis Manos,"You're probably right. Chainsawman will probably be bigger in the west.

Uzumaki will be on Adult Swim, Colin Stetson is also scoring it, it's a horror and there are very few good animated horrors so people will probably check it out.

Do you think Legened of Vox Machina will be big? I think it could be."
Seis Manos,Because when ppl talk about it the way the op is talking about it...ugh. I like watching a show for what it is instead of what other ppl think it is
Seis Manos,"What do you mean? The Cowboy Bebop live-action remake was pretty reviled. Of course there is nothing wrong with liking it. But there is nothing wrong with liking Arcane either. I hope you aren't snobbish against beloved shows.

I haven't watched the original Cowboy Bebop, but I almost always despise live-action remakes of classics as something insulting to the art of animation itself. Wish this trend would stop."
Seis Manos,Haven’t tried it
Seis Manos,"I hope youre right about Avatar. Ill probably like it regardless, but if it gets the reception that Arcane got, or even more, Ill be ecstatic."
Seis Manos,"Vox machina is on Amazon prime so I think it would be huge (like invincible levels), but I doubt it would be as big as Arcane. 

I think the biggest barrier to Uzumaki is the animation style and possibly even the way the story is going to be told. Junji ito manga have never been all that mainstream."
Seis Manos,Ok I get this mentality a bit but why wait years when you can form your own opinion now and use it in discussions? I too don’t like over hyping shows but I’m interested why it prevents you to try it right away?
Seis Manos,"Guy, just relax and watch the show without any high expectations. Just expect decent enjoyment. Same for any other show. And don't be annoyed that people love something you might not, you would be a jerk acting like that"
Seis Manos,"The thing with Vox Machina is it doesn't have a pre-established fanbase, right? So it probably won't be as big.

Mangas are usually not as mainstream in the west compared to anime to be fair so this Ito anime might be big if done right. The animation is gorgeous from what I have seen.

[Pluto's animation is gorgeous but I don't think it will be mainstream.](https://youtu.be/biG3OUtrj3M)

The Avatar spin-off is practically gauranteed success. As long as it streams outside the U.S. (not sure how they are handling it considering it will stream on Paramount+) it should be the biggest animated show by far."
Seis Manos,Critical Role is a major reason DnD is entering the mainstream. The fanbase may not be as big of LoL but it exists.
Living Undocumented,"No one actually watched this did they?

There's a dude who came from Laos as a child.  Legally.  Got caught selling drugs, spent 12 years in prison, ordered to be deported.  Laos refused him.  Legally, the US cannot deport him under these circumstances.  He has to check in with an ICE officer every month.

Dude legit is reformed.  He even said he would love to be deported if he could be, at least there would be certainty.  But he's been in this sort of limbo for years.

Also, it's kinda telling about which people are viewed as ""illegal"" and the ones who all got rounded up, when you find out the origins of the one family that somehow managed to not only stay hidden, but build a thriving life.  I'm not saying they deserve to get deported either, they also are in the same shitty situation.  But it would be remiss to not acknowledge the privilege they have in all of this."
Living Undocumented,"It wasn't a bad show at all. Im one of those ""*do it legally*"" kind of guys. But this show really highlights how much reform we need in our system. There has got to be a better way than what we are doing now. We can do it faster, more accurate, and more efficient. And maybe sprinkle in a tad bit of compassion, we dont even need a full table spoon full of compassion, just like a pinch of salt."
Living Undocumented,Wow. All these comments on this post is showing us is just how racist we have become. I mean come on. Someone is getting downvoted for stating its available now on Netflix. Take your hate elsewhere. Just the first episode alone is fantastic.
Living Undocumented,"Let me guess, this documentary is going to be “impartial” about immigration and make it sound like there is absolutely nothing wrong about illegal immigration while portraying anyone against it as a racist."
Living Undocumented,This is available on Netflix now.
Living Undocumented,a good doc. people who shit on it are probably afraid that the people they demonize for simply chasing the american dream will become actual humans if they watch this - and not somebody you can blame for shit going wrong in your life.
Living Undocumented,"you know, for how polarized this country is and how bad it appears on the news, just remember that there are literally MILLIONS of people who will risk life and limb to come and live here.

Not saying that we can't work to be better, just pointing out something I personally don't think about often."
Living Undocumented,"We as people have to learn is that we are all immigrants. Our family line for most of us are from Europe countries. As history states we migrated to this land. While not ours we stole the land by force from the native American. So in essence our ancestors came illegal to this land. Yet no one wants to take that into consideration. Yes I understand if you are a criminal either born here or illegally enter this country you should be held accountable for your action. You should be in prison or send back to your country. From what I see in this documentary. For the most part these people have came to this country to change their lives and get opportunities. Just like our acenstors.  As far as how people blame immigrants for taking their jobs. Is such bull shit. You know nobody wants to pick strawberries for $4.00 per hour or work in any field for less than minimal wage. So stop complaining. 




Let the down votes commence.


Edit : over stayed visas  are one reason some are here illegally. I kinda figured I was going to get down voted. Just because people can't and won't come to GRIPS that EVERY ONE IS ILLEGAL as HISTORY IS WRITTEN.  We traspassed on native India land  but let's just keep lying to ourself and Claim this was ""our land"" to begging with."

Living Undocumented,cesar chavez says hi
Living Undocumented,I agree. I just started watching and wanted to see what others opinions are. It’s so hard because I’m also a “do it legally” person. But then you see the families and the heartache and the situations you came from and it’s not so easy to point the finger because I would probably do the same thing. We need to use our power as a country (USA) to somehow help reform the countries these people are coming from so people want to stay there and feel safe there.
Living Undocumented,"Shame on you for even thinking you represent America, and how quickly or not we can do it. These laws passed are inhumane, and a pinch of salt is not America.

Living Undocumented,"When “Americans” came to this country and took land from Native Americans and wiped them out with the virals they brought, was that “do it legally?”

I guess you like the cages because it is like prison and since prison is legal, you just like the people and children kept in cages."
Living Undocumented,"This is the strawest of men. 

Wanting people to come into the country legally is not racist. Additionally illegal immigrants aren’t a “race” at all.  They consist of many different races and nationalities coming to the US illegally."
Living Undocumented,"Immigration laws discriminate on the basis of citizenship, not race.   Calling everything hate or racism that you disagree with has become the radical left's way of avoiding debate."
Living Undocumented,Definitely a brigade.  It was up around 8 originally but took a dive all of a sudden.
Living Undocumented,"It features at least one Trump supporter whose undocumented wife is being deported and several undocumented immigrants in what I've seen of it so far have expressed their regret or understanding about breaking the law.  I think it's fair to say that nobody wants to be undocumented, and this show seems to do a good job of expressing the reality of why people are and what they deal with as a result."
Living Undocumented,"Looks that way.  In the trailer there's a young girl talking about how her undocumented mother isn't a criminal.  Let that sink in.  'My law-breaking mother didn't break the law.'    It looks like a total leftist propaganda, feelings before facts, virtue-signaling orgy."
Living Undocumented,"Yeah except no one is shitting on anyone for chasing the american dream.

You can chase the american dream without breaking the law."
Living Undocumented,There's a literal Trump supporter in the show.

Living Undocumented,Ah yes the people who risk life and limb by overstaying their visas. Truly heroic.
Living Undocumented,"If they're undocumented, as the title suggests, then they came here illegally.  As you've said:

> ...illegally enter this country you should be held accountable for your action.


So which is it?  You can't have it both ways.  If someone is here illegally, then it doesn't really matter what their intentions are.  They broke the law."
Living Undocumented,"If you watch, you'll find you're the same.  They have to wait in the same lines, and for many there aren't even lines to wait in."
Living Undocumented,"Lol, had you waited until after Trump you might have never had the opportunity of getting Visa, you should count your blessings and not dismiss other people's plight."
Living Undocumented,Thank you for correcting that.

I guess you like the cages because it is like prison and since prison is legal, you just like the people and children kept in cages.

Do you understand that people come here because if corrupt countries around the world and the circumstances they live in do not allow “do it legally?”  It is literally, “do it legally”’or die and by your clear opinion, you would rather them die.

American has also fucked some of these countries in the past and created the violence there.

Living Undocumented,">  Because immigration all boils down to race.

No, it doesn't.  Immigration laws make no reference to race.  The race of the illegal immigrant is completely irrelevant.  You're spouting hysterical nonsense.

Living Undocumented,"Nobody ever said they were not people.

The suggestion that it be done legally doesn't change that."
Living Undocumented,"um, what laws are you talking about that everyone likely broke in the past?  And what does being native american have to do with immigration?

Living Undocumented,"I'm not sure what your point even is.  You're just saying ""This thing is illegal therefore it's illegal.""  Yeah, okay fine.

But counterpoints:

* It shouldn't be illegal.
* We shouldn't have such harsh penalties for it.

Bullshit.  They're absolutely unjust, particularly under the Trump administration.

Any security or system in place that results in millions of people being in a country illegally is broken.

Moving to another country legally is expensive and takes a long time.  If someone doesn't have the time or the money to do it the right way, then boo-freakin-hoo.  I've been to dozens of countries and some of them would offer me a better life, but I can't afford to move there legally.  That's no one else's problem but mine.  If I snuck in or stayed illegally, I would expect to eventually be caught and deported."
Living Undocumented,"Nothing grey about laws.  If I don’t have tickets to a concert, I’m not showing up and expecting to get in, and then pretending to be victimized when I don’t."
Living Undocumented,">  It shouldn't be illegal.

Your opinion about whether or not it should be illegal doesn't change the fact that it IS illegal.

>  We shouldn't have such harsh penalties for it.

Like what?  Being sent home??

>  We shouldn't violate international law.

What are you talking about?  Who is violating international law?  If you're talking about the UN agreements on asylum and refugees, we aren't violating anything.  We've been the most accommodating country in history when it comes to welcoming refugees.  Coming here seeking better economic opportunity does not make you a refugee, or make a valid claim for asylum.

>  We shouldn't operate concentration camps.

We don't.  Stop watching CNN.  Those detention centers have been around for a long time.  And could you be any more disrespectful to the experience that people endured who actually went to a real concentration camp?  For fuck's sake.

> We shouldn't deny people their human rights.

What human rights are being denied?  No one has a human right to be immune to immigration laws.

>  We shouldn't terrorize minorities and American citizens in order to enforce a bad law. 

Enforcing laws that every nation has isn't 'terrorizing' anyone."
Living Undocumented,"Do you understand why we have laws?

If you think a law is unjust, the correct response isn't to just break it and then defend yourself by declaring that you find the law to be unjust.  Laws are not carved in stone.  They can be amended, even repealed.  

I never said that you have to agree with a law just because it's the law.  Your thoughts and opinions are not under jurisdiction.  You do have to obey the law, regardless of what you think of it."
Living Undocumented,Nice. /fistbump
Living Undocumented,"No answer. How about ""Jews will not replace us.""  Do you remember his response? I'll wait again."
Living Undocumented,Any of his executive actions towards immigrants in his early stages of his presidency.  Start there.
Living Undocumented,"How do you know the asylum claims are bogus? Trump is on track to cut the number of refugees to new lows - how does that help?

Seeking Asylum is 100% legal. again, families that trek 1000s of miles should have good reasons - to think they are lying and doing that for fun is just sticking your head in the sand. 


i think you really dont see the desperation people face from the gang violence, political violence, poverty they experience in their countries, and the USA is seen as a shining light of freedom. I think you speak from a position of privilege that you even have the *option* to stay safely in your home country. Some of these people dont have that luxury. Both of my parents were refugees, so maybe that helps me understand the systema and actual people better, idk."
Living Undocumented,"So if the family of 4, infants included; were denied an asylum hearing and can’t walk back 4000 miles to their hell homes- what’s your solution?

Let them rot outside of the gates? Shoot at them till they go somewhere else? These are human lives and not something as trivial as a music show"
Living Undocumented,"I know, but that's the point.  You're just sayings it's illegal.  That's hardly a point worth making.  Your point is ""it's illegal"".  My point is ""It shouldn't be.""

And originally I was just correcting you because you said they ""came here illegally"" which is untrue for most undocumented immigrants."
Living Undocumented,"I'm not breaking it; I'm advocating against it.

> Laws are not carved in stone. They can be amended, even repealed.

It seems you don't understand this since you're the one appealing to ""it's the law"" as some kind of thing that matters."
Living Undocumented,"They're not doing it 'for fun'.  That was never suggested.  Don't be an ass.  They're seeking better economic opportunity.  That is NOT a valid claim of asylum.  

Wise people think with their heart and their head.  You're thinking with only your heart."
Living Undocumented,"It’s idiotic to make the 4000 mile trek, putting your children’s lives in jeopardy, when you know you’re not getting in.  The children so easily become a pawn in these games and yet it never seems to be the parents who are the bad guys for doing this to them in the first place.

You can’t just show up and become someone else’s problem.  Do it legally and everyone is fine with it."
Living Undocumented,"But your opinion that it shouldn't be illegal doesn't matter.  It's still illegal. You can disagree with it as much as you want to.  It doesn't change reality.  That's what I'm saying.  The law is the law no matter what you think of it.  If you don't like it, you can try to change it."
Living Undocumented,"OK I'm just going to give up because you're completely missing my point.  I'm stating a basic fact, not making some elaborate argument.  It's very very simple and you're overthinking it to the point of complete miss.  I'm not going to just keep paraphrasing it until it clicks.  Have fun."
Living Undocumented,"Don't bother replying. Check out their comment history, you'll find a bucket full of questionable opinions."
Living Undocumented,The American dream is only for the select few.
Living Undocumented,"You didn’t answer the question- what do you do?

Seeking asylum is legal as far as the mom in Honduras knows. She is putting her children at risk just by staying in her Pueblo, she needs to make a move. So she goes to the USA. She gets to the gate and is told “nope can’t seek asylum” and she doesn’t leave- because she can’t. What do you do?

This assumption that people abuse the system isn’t based on facts, it’s based on nonsense spewed by places like Fox News to divide and other these people. Instead of saying “let’s fix the asylum process”, let’s make actual centers where they can be housed and treated like humans while their cases are heard (again- seeking asylum is legal), let’s get more judges down there so we can run through cases efficiently. Let’s work with the countries in Central America so that they aren’t so terrible to live in that people need to flee. 

I’ll go back though- what do you do to the family that won’t give up and keeps trying?"
Living Undocumented,So you understand most undocumented immigrants don't come here illegally?
Living Undocumented,">let’s make actual centers where they can be housed and treated like humans while their cases are heard (again- seeking asylum is legal), let’s get more judges down there so we can run through cases efficiently

Yes.  This can and should be done be done.  We should have the proper housing and processing facilities to accomodate immigrants, detainees and asylum seekers.

>I’ll go back though- what do you do to the family that won’t give up and keeps trying?

If this was me, and my 2 small kids, and I was from a central american country and was refused entry to the US (for whatever reason) I would stay in Mexico.   I would probably work and save money and hire the best coyote I could.  Might take a few years but that's how I'd do it.   Maybe in the meantime I would realize that it's not worth it but who knows."
Living Undocumented,"So now it’s our job to fix the shitty country they’re leaving?  They can do with them whatever they wants they uses the least amount of my tax dollars.  Medical, housing, etc shouldn’t be presumed because you go show up on someone’s doorstep.  They took their lives in their own hands and failed."
Living Undocumented,[deleted]
Living Undocumented,"What do you do?

If you bus them to a border town- they walk back to the gate. If you fly them back to their country- the parents come again, maybe alone this time, but they still come back. They come by sea to another port, they come through Canada. 

It’s easy to blame them, instead of trying to think and find a solution. Clearly you can’t just ignore it- eventually you need to do something. 

Also, seeking asylum is legal, which we shouldn’t overlook. They are allowed to come to the gate and try- it’s how the process has always worked."
Living Undocumented,"Considering we helped break it, it's the least we could do.  And either way, it would be better for us so for purely selfish reasons we should help improve their home countries."
Living Undocumented,"If that's the case, then give them all amnesty so they're not here illegally.  Then everyone can be happy."
Living Undocumented,"I just started watching today, it’s really good"
Living Undocumented,"Agreed! A lot of the response I've read on Reddit has been quite negative, which is quite sad to see - we've really fallen so far as a country to view human beings going through these situations as they do."
Living Undocumented,"LOL.

Negative on Reddit?  I keep telling people on here, Reddit is a racist place and everyone downvotes.

These idiots believe that Netflix hired a actor to play ICE, grab a person holding a kid, throw down a US attorney and then locked them out the building.

Welcome to Trump country.  America is still racist in 2020, oh wait, we are in 2019.  America is still racist, it is a fact that many white people I meet somehow other do not believe, refuse to believe it or think people are lying."
Living Undocumented,"Just found this comment after searching for discussions about the show. I'm only a few episodes in and I already wanted to throw my phone at the screen and frustration of hell terrible these people are treated for no fucking reason. 

I don't know why anyone would find it hard to believe this is real. There's nothing outlandish being depicted from a realism point of view. Maybe the people are being coached on what to say in front of the camera to make an impact, big whoop. That doesn't mean these things aren't happening."

Come and Hug Me,"Ah, a fellow of culture. Kris Straub (creator of the Candle Cove creepypasta) made a webcomic, Broodhollow(unfortunately I think he stopped after book 2), and the YouTube series Local 58, which very much keeps the Candle Cove spirit alive and well . Recommended if you haven't seen them!"
Come and Hug Me,It was 11 years ago
Come and Hug Me,yt reccomentdations and i didnt know what it was
Come and Hug Me,"As an American, my experience with Channel 4 is that it tends to have more absurd or experimental comedies than the BBC does."
Come and Hug Me,[Local 58](https://youtube.com/c/LOCAL58TV) has some genuinely unsettling content. The first time I saw Contingency was half asleep in the middle of the night. It left me feeling a certain way. Its a shame he hasn't made anything in awhile.
Come and Hug Me,Yeah I'm fucking old.
Come and Hug Me,"Hmm, you ok?"
Come and Hug Me,"It's definitely true, for better or worse. BBC is funded by the TV license so tends to be a bit tamer than the independent channels."
Come and Hug Me,"if /u/somemorestalecontent was 8 when DHMIS came out then he's 20 years old now. I'm 20 too, right? No, wait, I'm 21. I must be 21 because I'm old enough to drink and I do it a lot...But no older.

Surely I'm not already 32, still spending my idle hours on this same social media site, reading about the same viral video content I watched over a decade ago. Were I that old I'd have much money in the bank and an ascendant career, a wife, a family, a house. Not living essentially the same indolent life I lived all those years ago.

Surely that can't be true. I, too, was 8 when it came out. There's no other explanation."

Come and Hug Me,What's your favorite idea?
Come and Hug Me,"Just went back to watch the original (which is over 10 years old now, wtf) and got spooked that the calendar said June 19th."

Come and Hug Me,Malcom be praised!
Come and Hug Me,Let’s get creative!
Come and Hug Me,"A cam quality version of the pilot was floating around a while ago, seems to be 30 minute episodes, probably 6 given the format."
Come and Hug Me,"Really cool to see the Channel 4 logo at the end, hard to tell if they're involved in the production side of things but this is exactly the kind of big, creative British media that works perfectly for Channel 4. Really excited to see it featured on Gogglebox and shit."

Come and Hug Me,It makes me miss shows like Monkey Dust. Really balls to the wall stuff that they aired in the middle of the night and you'd catch like 10 minutes of it before falling asleep and then wonder if you'd dreamed that utter madness.

Come and Hug Me,"I worked in a video department with an overzealous creative director. Didn't know a thing about video making or tastes, but her light Googling made her an expert in shutting down all our ideas. The whole department started calling her e-mails GINACC notes because of that video."
Come and Hug Me,How do you get the idea?
Come and Hug Me,"Yeah, there's actually a bunch of that kind of content on All4 now because they've got all the Adult Swim and Vice stuff there, so it's great for watching Eric Andre and stuff."
Come and Hug Me,"But the calendar in every episode is June 19, and Father's is the third Sunday of June, rather than the 19th. Just curious if there's some kind of significance."
Come and Hug Me,"Would be interested to hear what happened, the production has always been VERY high quality and expensive, and moving to (essentially) 3 hours of content and the pandemic must have made things a creative nightmare too, but at the end of the day this will probably end up as the biggest achievement in British animation and puppetry in years and years, getting a high budget abstract series made in Britain is a huge achievement, before even considering that Adult animation funding is basically nonexistent outside of advertising too."
Come and Hug Me,You just have to think creative-ly
Come and Hug Me,Yeah I've been rewatching the Venture Bros on there recently (it's even better than I remember).
Come and Hug Me,"I know that in the [original trailer](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/tkFpNVxzhTs) from 2018 that's now been made private, there were three production companies:

* Blink Industries
* Conaco
* Super Deluxe

Blink Industries is Joe and Becky's personal production company, responsible for all the DHMIS stuff so far.

Super Deluxe was a directly-owned production company of Turner Broadcasting which got shut down in October of 2018, about a month after the Wakey Wakey trailer. When that connection to Turner Broadcasting ended, and then Time Warner got corporately reorganized into WarnerMedia in 2019, that probably screwed the pooch on any co-production with Turner, and thus Conaco by extension.

Note that the pilot has actually been complete for years, and has been shown at festivals and I think leaked online. As a result of that, Channel 4 did announce in 2020 that they were picking up DHMIS for a series, so I think it's just taken two years since then due to the high production values and pandemic issues."
Come and Hug Me,"Now when you look at this orange tell me please, what do you see?"

Come and Hug Me,Green is not a creative color!
Come and Hug Me,I can't be the only one who thinks that turning this into a whole-ass tv show will ruin what made the youtube videos so cool.

Come and Hug Me,"Adult Swim mostly runs shows which they produce themselves, or which have been produced for other networks and released via syndication (especially Funimation dubs of popular anime). Their budget is relatively small, and focused on Williams Street productions and games. I'd imagine they'd pick this up once it goes into international syndication, though - keep an eye on it for next year."
Come and Hug Me,TBS was originally going to premiere the show years ago. Conan’s production company was attached to it. But nothing came from it. No idea what caused the jump to channel 4.

Come and Hug Me,"It's a risk, but it seems like with the teasers over the years the creators always wanted to do more than they got the chance to. I'm excited to see their vision."
Bad Papa,"I feel like maybe you just didn't watch this season as closely as you could/should have?

11 never loved Papa and went back to him because of this, she just knew she needed to get her powers back (both for plot reasons and for character reasons-11 has always defined herself as a superhero since season 1) and the only way to do that was via Papa. 

Plus, you need to consider that she very likely has ptsd/trauma from her past time in Hawkins lab. Going back to get her powers from the same person who did that to her must be very traumatic for her, and they're intentionally playing on that to get her powers back. I can't imagine what must be going through her mind at various points throughout this arc, getting to the bunker and seeing Papa there, learning that what he's forcing her through is actually working and she'll need to keep working with Papa to get her powers to keep working again, etc. 

And they did explain how she lost her powers, something about straining them too hard and something stroke something, right? 

Honestly I don't even think the stroke part of the explanation was needed. I was fine with leaving it as she strained too hard. Not like they ever really explained how 1 and the rest of them got these powers in the first place, anyway. Always kinda figured it had something to do with the experiments Papa did on the mother's when pregnant, combined with whatever experiments he did on the kids after birth. But 1 disproved that, he just kinda developed them on his own. That honestly might be the biggest disappointment for me, this season. 

Literally the last big Papa/11 scene has her calling him out as being the real monster. What was wrong with that? How did it ruin the show?"
Bad Papa,"
>she's tried to kill him like 3+ times and everytime she's back to I love papa. The last scenes with them two pretty much ruined the entire show.

It's almost like she is a child that was raised by an abuser and has a complex relationship with that abuser.

>Also never explained what papa was doing in the first place and why. The gates weren't even open when he was tatting the children

He was trying to turn children into weapons. It's MK Ultra stuff"
Bad Papa,"Papa was trying to recreate more 001's which is what all the kids were, and Vecna/001 had an inhibitor that sedated him until 011 broke it."
Bad Papa,"Honestly missing things like Vectna having a chip that stopped him from acting out and being powerful amongst other things, probably just shows that you shouldn't rush binge every show you watch. Obviously don't take a lot in or consider everything. 

Last season is all 1 hour 20 min to 2+ hour episodes. If you're burning yourself out so much you can't pay attention in long episodes enough to understand things ofc it's more painful. Writing ain't great but watching without ability to pay attention makes it way way worse. 

Its like all the people that didn't pick up on Will being gay. The show basically shoves things down your throat. Things like 001 being freed twice by 11 etc were big plot and emotional points."
Bad Papa,"Are you sure you've not watched this whole season skipping sections, fast forwarding everything and / or doing other things instead of paying attention to the plot, dialogues and screen?

Because you're WAY off."
Bad Papa,">Also never explained why vectna just randomly snapped when 11 was young. He made it to his 20s and know one knew he was a lose cannon? 

I thought they were controlling his behavior with that thing in his neck; then he manipulated 11 to remove it for him so he could go on a rampage.  
>Also never explained what papa was doing in the first place and why. The gates weren't even open when he was tatting the children

I believe he was trying to find these kids with powers and teaching them to control it for ""governmental"" purposes.

It all seemed pretty clear to me.  The writing and pacing wasn't great, but it all was pretty logical."
Bad Papa,"I'll be honest, I stared at the title of this thread for a good five seconds confused since to me 'ST' has always stood for Star Trek and I was trying to figure out which Star Trek show had a character called 'Papa'"
Bad Papa,"Papa was not at all needed this season. You had Paul Reiser right there, give him more lines and screen time instead.

I agree that season 4 was all over the place. Some fun/cool bits and some real narrative slogs to wade through. I liked it more than Season 3 and about as much as season 2. Season 1, however, remains the best season of that show by far."
Bad Papa,So not a ST/Star Trek thread....
Bad Papa,"What?

Eleven goes back because Owens convinces her to. She tries to run from Brenner and ultimately stays because she wants to help her friends and he's her only avenue. Later she attacks him and tries to escape and when he asks her for forgiveness as he's dying, she refuses to give it. She also calls him a monster when she confronts Vecna later.

They also explain why Vecna snaps. Brenner had an inhibitor chip implemented in him which he tricks Eleven into destroying. That allows him to use his powers.

Maybe try rewatching and paying attention this time? None of these things were hard to miss."
Bad Papa,"But she got her powers back. Papa did her wrong AGAIN and she was still I love papa.

The last scene was in the desert and she walked to his body and was all lovey AGAIN"
Bad Papa,"Oh Ya that shit in his neck. But all these cameras and they didn't notice?

The lack of eyes on him was kinda suspect knowing what papa knows about him"
Bad Papa,I thought it was a tracking device. Why would I think a metal pill restricts powers
Bad Papa,"
>Papa was not at all needed this season. You had Paul Reiser right there, give him more lines and screen time instead.

Paul Reisers character wouldn't make sense in the role needed. Plus you lose the through line between 1 and 11 then."
Bad Papa,Ya the direction and writing in 1 was by far the best.
Bad Papa,"Disagree. First off, you needed Brenner around for the flashbacks to the massacre. Second, Owens would not have pushed Eleven to get her powers back - the show literally shows this as he consistently wants to back off the intensity of Brenner's training and also is more concerned with her well-being than anything else. And that's consistent with his portrayal in S2 as well. 

The show needed both Brenner and Owens. They used them correctly."
Bad Papa,The famous character of Papa from Star Trek...
Bad Papa,">she walked to his body and was all lovey again.

Uh, no.  Either you didn't pay any attention or you're really bad at interpreting human interactions."
Bad Papa,"Yeah you really did not watch this season as closely as you should have if those are the conclusions you're taking from this.

She got her powers back because she did what Papa had her do, she got them back because of him.

And she was not all lovey with him in the desert scene. She literally refused to fulfill his last request because she didn't agree with what he did."
Bad Papa,They had him under control until he manipulated 11 and they clearly punished him when they thought he was acting outside of his role as a tutor.
Bad Papa,"Because he literally tells you that it prevents him from being strong lol. He tells eleven that papa wants to keep him weak. This is the first time 11 frees him, then the second time is the world's merging. 

Again you just binge watched a show with super long episodes and probably couldn't pay much attention, especially after just getting through 3 seasons prior. 

I'm not saying ST is some masterpiece but it's OK. But even a master piece show would be trash if you missed multiple things and subtleties from being to burnt to catch key dialogue."
Bad Papa,"As soon as it was taken out he started using his powers, the link is kind of obvious"
Bad Papa,He could have helped her get her memories back or something. The narrative pretzel of bringing Papa back and 11 trusting him long enough to accomplish anything is much more of a stretch than just Reiser develops some gizmo and gadget to tap back into her powers through her memories and finds the memory of 1 along the way.
Bad Papa,"Yeah, no subsequent season got anywhere near as close to how excellent season 1 was. IMO."
Bad Papa,I bet Riker has told women to call him Papa.
Bad Papa,"She didn't trust him though, she was choosing to work with him because she wanted to get her powers back and protect her friends and was willing to work with someone she didn't trust to do so. Plus it's not as though she had much of a choice, she didn't have powers and didn't know he was there until she got there.


>more of a stretch than just Reiser develops some gizmo and gadget to tap back into her powers through her memories and finds the memory of 1 along the way.

That sounds way worse and incredibly goofy."
Bad Papa,"Incredibly goofy compared to ""psych, Papa isn't actually dead, 11 is cool to work with him again""...? Agree to disagree on that one."
Bad Papa,"But she clearly wasn't good to work with Papa again. As soon as he showed up, she fled. Then got sedated, and put In Nina, where Papa started on the memory stuff. After that, when she got out, she attacked Papa and tried to run again - when she discovered that whatever Papa was doing with her and the memories was working, but not fully yet.

 And that's why she stayed there at that point - because, as I said in my other post, a big part of her identity is as a superhero, and this was a way to get her powers back so she could be the superhero again.

 Plus, again, there's the whole being confronted with her abuser, and learning that he's the only one that can help her - that's gotta do a number on her mind."
Bad Papa,"Yes, having Paul Reiser ""build a machine to go into 11's memories"" sounds extremely goofy compared to Eleven having to confront the person the raised her with her powers, is connected to her and the villain and overcome the childhood abuse and trauma she suffered by his hand."
Bad Papa,George likes his chicken spicy...
Bad Papa,Well the chicken store called and they're all out of you!
Bad Papa,This chicken.... is MAKING ME THIRSTY!
Bad Papa,OMG he is so perfect for this.
Bad Papa,Hmm isn't this a conflict of interest with Tyler chicken?
Bad Papa,They've had some weird choices for celebrity Colonels 
Bad Papa,Wasn't he a former KFC spokeperson in the early 2000s?
Bad Papa,How dare he turn his back on the McDLT
Bad Papa,He was already halfway there when he was on [Criminal Minds](https://imgur.com/a/TEDssDl)
Bad Papa,norm was the best celebrity Colonel
Bad Papa,For 3 weeks and there'll be another one?
Bad Papa,Vandelay industries 
Bad Papa,I'm surprised he didn't have a non-compete clause with his time at Tyler Chicken. 
Bad Papa,I mean after that awesome McDLT commercial it was only a matter of time before he became the colonel 
Bad Papa,Just give Gilbert Gottfried the role permanently and we can move on from this rotation of Colonels.
Bad Papa,"Reminded me of the [""Too many cooks""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8) Adult swim video, and quite a lot i should say."
Bad Papa,[the commercial is hilariously random] (https://youtu.be/oB5GrmaxH8k)
Bad Papa,It’s the summer of George ! 
Bad Papa,Why not Kenny’s? 
Bad Papa,Clearly a conflict of interest considering his previous work promoting the massively successful [McDlt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh1kmVwS4Hw)
Bad Papa,"It's the best, Jerry! The best!"
Bad Papa,This definitely is The Summer of George!!!
Bad Papa,And you want to be my chicken salesman.
Bad Papa,"KFC $5 Fill-ups

♫Byyyyyyyy Sanders♫"
Bad Papa,"The colonel store called, their running out of you!"
Bad Papa,I was kind of hoping to read Michael Richards but he might not be ideal for a fried chicken restaurant
Bad Papa,Norm MacDonald was the best Colonel Sanders. 
Bad Papa,I won't be happy until they give me the role.
Bad Papa,Art Vandelay loves KFC!
Bad Papa,"I don't know how happy he'd be being called ""Seinfeld"" star.

https://youtu.be/0GK1ihFbMJU"
Bad Papa,Stay away from the chicken! Bad! Bad chicken!... Mess you up! 
Bad Papa,Did we ever figure out who the dancing Great America commercial guy was from about 10 years ago?
Bad Papa,We all need some more Jason Alexander in our lives. I hope we get to see him in an actual show again!
Bad Papa,"Isn't it a little weird, bringing back the colonel. He was a real dude who is now dead. It's not like bringing back a mascot or a breakfast cereal character. "
Bad Papa,I thought it was a fucking joke when I saw this on r/seinfeld
Bad Papa,"My, [how the tables have turned...](https://youtu.be/ScNv95dsDdQ)"
Bad Papa,You're telling me you became the Colonel just to find out the secret recipe?!
Bad Papa,"Colonel Sanders was the best Colonel Sanders.  Worked much of his life as a laborer.  Made a Kentucky Colonel defending his gas station against a murderer.  Finally found success in his 60s when he started franchising his locally famous chicken after a highway bypassed his gas station.   To try and maintain quality,  he sued KFC after he sold it for serving subpar product under his name after they changed his receipe.  He would pop in to KFCs to test the quality and would yell at the franchise if it was poor.  Continued to serve as a figurehead right up until he passed.  The man wanted to serve a quality product and make people happy.   What a legend.

Interesting 1 minute interview https://youtu.be/7pOEW6bGK1I

Unfortunately KFC quality has only gotten worse since. "
Bad Papa,"Remember when his character tried raping Pretty Woman Julia Roberts?

Colonel Sanders remembers 

No but seriously I love George...actually technically I love/hate him"
Bad Papa,Kenny??
Bad Papa,George Cosanders!
Bad Papa,Why is this a thing? 
Bad Papa,I feel like there are new col. sanders so often it’s not even newsworthy... am I wrong? 
Bad Papa,I get unreasonably upset at all the new Colonel Sanders'. The man holds the record in most commercial appearances since he always made time for his company. All they had to do was start airing the commercials from the beginning and be set for years. It would be cool for them to even uphold the older sales prices for each commercial's run time. 
Bad Papa,"I didn't believe this when it came out. I know he did some spots a long time ago, but was also a prominent animal rights activist. I mean, they dropped him in 2003 for speaking his mind. I thought it was some faker using old stuff.  
I eat chicken. "
Bad Papa,So when will they start selling pretzels?
Bad Papa,"THIS CHICKEN IS MAKING THIRSTY

Edit: seems I was not the first to make this joke."
Bad Papa,"Good, I had been staying up nights worrying he wasn't obscenely rich enough."
Bad Papa,"""""As the son of two working parents, there were plenty of dinnertimes when a bucket of chicken and all the fixins saved the day,"" Alexander said in the release. ""It's been fun to combine my personal love for KFC with my sitcom experience into a new take on the role of Colonel Sanders.""

This is a man who has died inside."
Bad Papa,Oh yay! A viral video made to be a viral video by an ad company to sell KFC. YouTube's never been better!
Bad Papa,"IMO This campaign is the longest running crap joke ever. 

Honestly, does anybody like this campaign?"
Bad Papa,"KRFC



Kenny Rogers' Fried Chicken"
Bad Papa,Reba will always be the best Colonel Sanders...
Bad Papa,"He ended up moving to mississauga, ontario, canada. I'm assuming he made a huge donation to ""trillium hospital"" here cause they have the ""colonel sanders family health care Centre"". I like to call the the ""KFC family health center"""
Bad Papa,[deleted]
Bad Papa,"Man, I love their ad campaigns but I cannot stand their food. "
Bad Papa,Yeah cuz nothing says Antebellum Southern Oligarch like a short bald Jewish guy from New York
Bad Papa,Is he not better than this? Wtf happened. 
Bad Papa,who gives a shit. 
Bad Papa,KFC's new buckets will [keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSdUOC8Kac).  
Bad Papa,The girl on the left side of the picture. What is she looking at?
Bad Papa,It’s perfect
Bad Papa,What happened to Norm?
Bad Papa,Eric Cartman will be the next Colonel.
Bad Papa,That girl on the left really doesn't want to be there.
Bad Papa,I'm sure it'll go about as well as that time he tried to sell us the McDLT.
Bad Papa,Getting back to his roots
Bad Papa,WHAT THE FUCK!!
Bad Papa,"They could have Michael Richards next, he was *hilarious* as Kramer! He'd be even more hilarious as an old Southern man!"
Bad Papa,"Yeah, well the chicken store called, and they're runnin' outta you!!"
Bad Papa,He really took that job as hen supervisor and ran with it.
Cheese in the Trap,"Another way to write this headline 
“HBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year”"
Cheese in the Trap,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they’re the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
Cheese in the Trap,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
Cheese in the Trap,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
Cheese in the Trap,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
Cheese in the Trap,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
Cheese in the Trap,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
Cheese in the Trap,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
Cheese in the Trap,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
Cheese in the Trap,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
Cheese in the Trap,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
Cheese in the Trap,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
Cheese in the Trap,The writing has been superb.
Cheese in the Trap,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
Cheese in the Trap,It’s a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
Cheese in the Trap,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
Cheese in the Trap,"It’s a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn’t play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
Cheese in the Trap,This is the way.
Cheese in the Trap,It’s because House of the Dragon didn’t cast Pedro Pascal
Cheese in the Trap,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
Cheese in the Trap,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
Cheese in the Trap,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
Cheese in the Trap,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
Cheese in the Trap,"While the show has been strong I feel like they’re making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven’t hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
Cheese in the Trap,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
Cheese in the Trap,HoTD > TLoU
Cheese in the Trap,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
Cheese in the Trap,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
Cheese in the Trap,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
Cheese in the Trap,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  🤔

This is why making well written content matters."
Cheese in the Trap,Bring back WestWorld!
Cheese in the Trap,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
Cheese in the Trap,God I Hope so
Cheese in the Trap,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
Cheese in the Trap,How the hell?
Cheese in the Trap,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
Cheese in the Trap,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
Cheese in the Trap,Pascal Power.
Cheese in the Trap,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
Cheese in the Trap,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
Cheese in the Trap,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
Cheese in the Trap,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
Cheese in the Trap,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
Cheese in the Trap,if only they did halo correctly.
Cheese in the Trap,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
Cheese in the Trap,[deleted]
Cheese in the Trap,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
Cheese in the Trap,Its a much better show so thats great
Cheese in the Trap,Good
Cheese in the Trap,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
Cheese in the Trap,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
Cheese in the Trap,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
Cheese in the Trap,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
Cheese in the Trap,Good. It was better.
Cheese in the Trap,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
Cheese in the Trap,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
Cheese in the Trap,Deserved. It's a better show.
Cheese in the Trap,"That’s crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
Cheese in the Trap,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
Cheese in the Trap,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
Cheese in the Trap,Was it really THAT good???
Cheese in the Trap,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
Cheese in the Trap,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
Cheese in the Trap,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
Cheese in the Trap,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
Cheese in the Trap,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
Cheese in the Trap,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
Cheese in the Trap,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
Cheese in the Trap,It's a vastly better show
Cheese in the Trap,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
Cheese in the Trap,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
Cheese in the Trap,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
Cheese in the Trap,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
Cheese in the Trap,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
Cheese in the Trap,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
Cheese in the Trap,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
Cheese in the Trap,It was better.
Cheese in the Trap,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
Cheese in the Trap,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
Cheese in the Trap,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
Cheese in the Trap,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
Cheese in the Trap,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
Cheese in the Trap,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
Cheese in the Trap,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
Cheese in the Trap,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it’s going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
Cheese in the Trap,What’s the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
Cheese in the Trap,…. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
Cheese in the Trap,Can’t wait for season 2
Cheese in the Trap,Fucking Obviously
Cheese in the Trap,"I’m still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it’s backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a while."
Cheese in the Trap,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
Cheese in the Trap,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn’t even compare to the game.
Cheese in the Trap,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
Cheese in the Trap,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
Cheese in the Trap,…because it’s a much better show
Cheese in the Trap,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I’m surprised white lotus didn’t beat house of dragons"
Cheese in the Trap,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
Cheese in the Trap,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
Cheese in the Trap,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
Cheese in the Trap,"Fungos \&gt; dragões, simples."
College Romance,Holy wall of text
College Romance,I think Star Trek Enterprise would have really hit a sweetspot with the whole romulan war and stuff that would've happened had it not been canceled.
College Romance,"So, CBS had a whole NCIS universe happening, and through various crossovers, it tied into the Peter Lenkov reboot universe (Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.) as well as Scorpion.

At one point on Five-0, Kono leaves the island to go hunt sex traffickers, never ti return. IRL, her departure was tied to a contract dispute (fuck the producers, she deserved the raise, but that's another story).

However, it would have been so cool to have a massive, season-long crossover event where Kono went coast to coast chasing those traffickers, guest starring on the various shows in the shared universe as she continued her hunt. She could have teamed with NCIS: LA, then gone elsewhere in California with Team Scorpion, petitioned the Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver) to help somewhere, stopped in New Orleans, and made her way to Washington to come all the way back to the original NCIS. 

Epic fucking fail, CBS."
College Romance,"I wish that Harper's Island had spawned a series of ""who-dun-it"" type shows where the fans could interact online with different clues as to who the killer was. That was the original idea behind the show but it only had one season and very few viewers.

I always thought there was a lot of room to grow a show where each season was a different mystery and you could go online to their website and look for clues, interact with other fans, watch video shorts, etc.

I still haven't seen a show do this, and I think there is a huge missed opportunity here."
College Romance,"1. Friends - Ross should've stayed together with Emily. They seemed to be more equal , have more in common. Ross and Rachel made ZERO sense. I think if Emily stayed it would've been refreshing for the show which got stale at that point. 

2. LOST - the mystery of ""What's the deal with Walt?"" never got addressed satisfactorily and IMO, was one of the more tantalizing mysteries on the show 

3. Dawson's Creek - Andi was by far more interesting than Joey or Jen ever was. She should've stayed with Pacey. And i think they should've gambled by writing off one group of characters and following the other - either have Dawson go to USC and retool the show to focus on his time there OR write out Dawson and follow Pacey/Joey in Boston. 

4. Felicity - Season 1 was fantastic. The rest sucked. Felicity never really grew as a person. She ended the way she started. She should've dated Noel and stuck to art. I would've written off Megan, Elena, and Sean early on. And frankly, write out Ben - he clearly was failing school, didn't belong."
College Romance,Jackie and Hyde should have stayed together.
College Romance,"Quantum Leap should've gone through with it's planned crossover with Magnum PI

And while never planned like that one was... Murder She Wrote and Columbo should've also had a crossover."
College Romance,Star Trek Picard should have really killed off Picard at the end of season one. Rios’ ship should have then been renamed “The Picard”.  Any seasons after that would follow the adventures of Rios and the rest of the gang without Patrick Stewart.
College Romance,"In Doctor Who, The Doctor and Master's relationship should have evolved after season 10 when Missy wanted to join his side. The character had a clear progression in that season, so I wish he didn't revert back to 'hehe I am evil and I just want your attention' psycho that we saw in Season 12. Of course, the characterisation of the Master is the least of the problems with that run of the show, but it really upset me how they flushed down one of the better character arcs for the sake of cheap villainy. He could have been a friend/advisor/companion/rival. Many things really."
College Romance,"A Faith the Vampire Slayer spin off could have been amazing. The rumored concept of Faith travelling from town to town like the Littlest Hobo would have made for a cool niche of its own between Angel's big city LA and Buffy's small town Sunnydale, well predating Supernatural & Co, but could also have been used to function as essentially an anthology. I think she would have been a really interesting character to see out there, cut off from any better or worse influences, and having no safe havens or support systems to lean on. 

It would have allowed for a huge amount of storytelling flexibility, and the format would also have played to Eliza Dushku's strengths way better than Dollhouse. 

The only caveat is that I was never sure Whedon (all else aside) really understood the character's appeal. A lot of her best moments/episodes were steered by other writers.

Supposedly it was proposed to Dushku but she was afraid of being typecast."
College Romance,"Grimm should gave left both love interests as they were(no redemptions, stay dead, etc), and stuck to no magic, everything being biochem/bio stuff"
College Romance,"The Flintstones had success with the future spin off, The Jetson, but I feel a current day spin off would have garnered the same sort of success as The Simpsons. Being able to reference current events in the jokes would have given the show a lot wider appeal than the predecessors."
College Romance,OP should have picked one example…
College Romance,"yea, i just upvoted n scroll down to the comments. lol. don't have time to read all that sorry OP. 😅"
College Romance,Sometimes I feel like the only person who really liked Star Trek Enterprise. The Romulan War would have been amazing :(
College Romance,"Yeah, they should've been focusing entirely on the Romulans and the first steps into the Federation from the very beginning.

Not that Temporal Cold War crap."
College Romance,Luckily haven’t seen a single one of these lol
College Romance,I highly disagree about Heels.. it was a well written show with good drama.
College Romance,A worst shows of 2021 list is incomplete without Apple TV's Invasion included.
College Romance,I will not stand for Heels slander.
College Romance,I'm not entirely convinced half of these shows aren't made up.
College Romance,"i had to sit thru Sex/Life. Wife loved it, for me every minute was torture."
College Romance,"I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin. It was canceled the same day it was released (hyperbole).

Also, where are Wheel Of Time and Foundation? Again, I enjoyed both, but I spent a considerable amount of time on both subs and both series are very divisive 

Heels doesn't belong on this list. A Best of 2021 series..

I agree with Yasuke. I was expecting historical fiction that made me Google a whole bunch of terms, but instead we got some science fiction junk. Did have a great soundtrack."
College Romance,"Never heard of Them but it's got a great iMDB score. I don't know if I mind a little ripping off, that's how new frontiers are explored. There wouldn't be a lot of great bands if they never ripped off Black Sabbath."
College Romance,"Katla is fine imo.

Invasion and Cowboy Bebop deserve to be mentioned on this list."
College Romance,Wheel of time for me. Expected and wanted better.
College Romance,"Gossip girl reboot was so painful. I would argue that *some* of the case is talented. The actor playing Julien makes me want to stab myself with her delivery. Max is like Chuck bass lite. Audrey is like only the nice parts of blair with none of the spice. There’s not as much plotting which is what made the original so much campy fun. I think they need more monet and Luna to inject some life into this thing. I feel like zoya julien and Obie and aki don’t have much charisma to speak of 

Also I literally couldn’t  believe how cringe the writing/ dialogue on sex/ life was. I’m shocked I finished either of these shows but I was couch bound for a period of time so that’s probably why"
College Romance,"lol Didn't even know there's a remake of I Know What You Failed at Last Scream Ripoff.

Speaking of which, that wasn't even a great movie to begin with. I don't know why anyone would bother to remake it."
College Romance,Definitely agree with Katla. The first episodes I was hooked because you want to find out how and why these things are happening. But the season falls apart more and more with each episode and characters doing incredibly incredibly stupid shit.
College Romance,Lee Pace is solely responsible for Foundation not being on this list. It should be though.
College Romance,The most remarkable thing about this list is that Foundation and Invasion are not on it.
College Romance,"Thankfully haven’t seen these. And the ones I know of, I actively avoided. The worst show I watched was Nine Perfect Strangers. Couldn’t even finish it."
College Romance,Have a feeling the 4400 reboot will make this list when it comes out. Only saw Katla was hyped for it due to who was involved but just your average Netflix/SVOD drama.
College Romance,"I know it's not a new show, just a new season, but Snowpiercer season 3 has been pretty disappointing. First three episodes were okay, then five where basically nothing happens, and now one moderately good one leading to the season finale which just looks like it's going back to the first season."
College Romance,"I thought Gossip Girl was entertaining as hell, and I enjoyed having the Hawaiian setting of I Know What You Did Last Summer on in the background as I was doing other things. There's way worse stuff out there. Like Invasion or The 4400 reboot."
College Romance,"My full round-up of 2021 television (including this post):

*Thank you guys so much!* 💕"
College Romance,Book of boba fett started in December right?  Lol
College Romance,did only watch katla from the list. i wouldnt say one of the worst but that review couldnt be more agreeable. writers sucked badly about a good premise and cast did really bad job on this.
College Romance,"Wondering what Sex/Life would be like had it bee made in the 80s and if Patricia Rozema directed all episodes. Maybe it's the times, but shows about a woman's rock phase now has less bite than it did forty years ago. 

Also, another friend of mine tweeted about how Sarah Shahi plays a psych major but can't figure out her basic bitch of a husband which is accurate."
College Romance,"Yasuke instead of being what it should have been - probably something like Rurouni Kenshin, wanted to be Samurai Seven and just couldn't make it."
College Romance,I actually watched I Know What You Did Last Summer and even enjoyed most of it in a so bad it's funny way for the most part but the ending was just offensively stupid.
College Romance,I don't think I've even heard of a single one of those.
College Romance,This is literally the first time I've ever heard anything negative about it.
College Romance,"Definitely. Heels is a gem with a 8.1 score on IMDB after 6.2K votes. Ace, Wild Bill, Jack and Crystal are interesting characters with nice tension between some of them and the plot, which feels authentic, made me very invested."
College Romance,Nor will I sit for it
College Romance,"If you only use reddit as proof, then any book adaptation is going to be garbage. Outside of the diehard book fans, wheel of time did really well. It had good reviews and great viewership. Even the ratings are good when you consider the fact that diehard book fans brigaded and gave one star reviews"
College Romance,">I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin

Not even close.  Yasuke was clearly worse."
College Romance,"It's not really a rip off, black horror is a popular genre now. Jordan Peele is not the only person that can make black horror films."
College Romance,"They could've at least not titled it ""Them"" considering there's a recent release called ""Us"". Like if you're going to rip off Black Sabbath you probably wouldn't want to call yourself Dark Saturday."
College Romance,i agree with invasion.
College Romance,Yep.  It’s one of the worst shows I’ve ever watched.  And I’ve watched a lot of cheap sci fi/fantasy made in the 80s & 90s.
College Romance,"Agreed. My expectations were tempered as I knew cuts would have to be made.  But they introduced entirely new scenes, rewrote character personality and motivations, and switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

It was an expensive, poorly constructed vehicle to promote The Message."
College Romance,"Second this, because from all those in the list above, I expected shit, and we got shit.

Wheel of time with its budget and potential was probably the biggest let down."
College Romance,"The 4400 reboot has been out actually, it premiered last year in October, I believe.

I saw maybe one and a half episodes and uhh... Well, personally, I just hated the dialogue, can't comment on much else as I didn't get very far :D"
College Romance,"Giving ""worst performance"" to a 6 year old is certainly an opinion lmao"
College Romance,"It’s almost a bit disrespectful regardless of how good the film is to force that semantic “Us and Them” connection, normally reserved for spiritual sequels, to a film they have no relation to, purely for marketing reasons.

It reminds me of a book I read where a superhero called Battery (because she charges energy) is forced to take on a partner who calls themselves Assault, purely to completely change the meaning of Battery’s identity through the automatic “Assault & Battery” association."
College Romance,"For a second I thought I was on the Witcher sub cause everything u described happened with the Witcher lol.

>	switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

The only difference being that the achievements were mostly given to one character, Yennefer. So much achievements and character arcs were given to her that folks speculate there is some [self insert](https://reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/rwhzzh/the_show_is_in_love_with_yennefer_and_it_will/) going on with the showrunner. It probably also doesn’t help she said Yennefer is her favorite. The cherry on top is that I wish the only change they made was giving her so many achievements and character arcs, they also decided to just completely change her character from the books.

Season 2 is 90% made up with the first episode being the only one that is somewhat based on the short story from the first book. The rest is I kid you not all made up. Even the “deathless mother”, which is a huge character in S2, doesn’t even exist in the book. To add insult to injury it was the showrunner’s second time promising the season this time would be a close adaptation with little to no original content. With s3 coming she is once again promising the same thing on her twitter lol.

Edit: linked one thread talking about it"
College Romance,"Honestly, I couldn't look past them cutting out the boat training montage. It was my fav part of book one lol."
College Romance,[deleted]
College Romance,What’s wrong with honesty? Not like he said it to the girl just gave his opinion.
College Romance,"lol i don't know if you've seen this series, but if you did, i don't know *how* you could and this kid's performance not standout to you because of how atrocious everything was everytime he appeared on screen. 

there were even a few memes of the kid on twitter. lol. everytime he had to deliver a line the entire flow of the show just crumbled. worst child actor I've ever seen."
College Romance,"I did read Cavill has supposedly negotiation for more story control, and he said he intends to keep it closer to the book.  We'll see.

Unfortunately, WOT has no actor or celebrity with enough clout to do the same."
College Romance,The showrunner shoved in filler for over 25% of the season.  And the filler did nothing to drive the plot or make the adaptation better for tv/visual medium etc.
College Romance,You got any extra addy?
College Romance,">worried that it will take a crude ""family guy clone"" approach

Mindy Kaling is directing it. It's not going to be a Family Guy clone. It's also a TV show, so they won't be pushing extra gore into things to get an R rating.  I don't know if it'll be good or bad, but it sounds like it will be a Scooby Doo flavored mystery show.  Which doesn't seem as far removed from the franchise roots as folks are suggesting."
College Romance,There is already a lot of gore and nudity so lol.
College Romance,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that’s what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It’s been overlooked and it’s an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
College Romance,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."
College Romance,"Do you ever get bored about watching shows featuring race, gender, privilege, or journeys of self-discovery? Seems to be every show on this list just about.
 
Surprised reddit didn't love it actually."
College Romance,ITT: People criticising OP’s taste because it’s not mainstream enough
College Romance,Cool list! Nice to something different recommended.
College Romance,"Holy shit, people are downvoting you! Thank you for the list and review man, so many unseen ones!

To me, this year was saved by Raised by Wolves"
College Romance,"I love your style of writing dude, I barely know any name on that list but your description made me want to at least check two of these! Great diverse taste that is not the same mainstream stuff as we can see everywhere, great post!"
College Romance,"I'm in the US, anyone know how to watch The Minister (Raoherran)? It sounds interesting and I'd like to check it out."
College Romance,"
Ráðherrann and Kalifat seem so interesting. I love learning about shows outside the US and Britain. I gotta find a place to watch these shows.

Thanks!"
College Romance,I May Destroy You?
College Romance,Sounds like someone needs to see Ted Lasso.
College Romance,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
College Romance,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.

College Romance,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
College Romance,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
College Romance,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
College Romance,is OP a feminist?
College Romance,"Great list, keep up the great work"
College Romance,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
College Romance,Bad list is bad.
College Romance,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
College Romance,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
College Romance,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
College Romance,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that’s just what you like.
College Romance,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I’m glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I’m not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it’s good, let alone one of the best of the year."
College Romance,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
College Romance,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake? These have all been released this year so I was wondering if you'd watched them. I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
College Romance,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
College Romance,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
College Romance,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
College Romance,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
College Romance,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.
College Romance,"> the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters

What show do you mean?"
Tunnel,How does Epix still exist? Difficult to believe it hasn’t been absorbed into another streamer like Hulu.
Tunnel,"If this show was ok Netflix it’ll be a hit, I can see a lot of ppl liking it"
Tunnel,It doesn't anymore. It is about to be become MGM+.
Tunnel,Well then MGM needs to resurrect Perpetual Grace Ltd!
Tunnel,Isn’t MGM owned by Amazon?
Tunnel,"This show is quick witted and hilarious.  

The best way I can describe the style is a Canadian version of Gilmore Girls/Ted Lasso/Arrested Development for dudes.

Edit: Bums in seats."
Tunnel,"As with Letterkenny, the Shoresy soundtrack *fucking* **RIPS**

Great show, couldn't recommend it enough.

Also, all them rockets? YEW!"
Tunnel,The show feels like a movie. Its very focused compared to Letterkenny. The season flies by. I highly recommend the show.
Tunnel,The Jims are fucking beauts!!!
Tunnel,This show has absolutely no right to be as good as it is.
Tunnel,Unbelievable
Tunnel,Allegedly
Tunnel,You ever seen such beautiful tough natives?
Tunnel,I reckon its got every right
Tunnel,Settle down
Tunnel,That’s a Texas sized 10-4 good buddy
Tunnel,Tough Natives is redundant
Tunnel,"I like the reckon, but seriously… A spin-off starting the most one-note character in a series with a lot of one-note characters, starring a bunch of dudes who aren’t actors. And it became probably my favorite new show of the year. Makes no sense on paper."
Tunnel,"What's weird is that in the Cyberpunk world there's a street gang that modified themselves to be The Brady Bunch, which means there's a gang member out there looking like Cindy Brady. This fact will never stop being weird to me."
Tunnel,"CDPR Developer:

>“She's best girl, but I feel a little bit guilty to say it because I was one of the people on the creative team to actually vote Rebecca out of the original cast during pre-production. CD Projekt Red first got the character design for Rebecca and they were like 'She's a loli. Lolis don't exist in Night City. It doesn't fit the Cyberpunk 2077 aesthetic'"".

Trigger:

>”No, the loli must stay.”"
Tunnel,"I've watched the whole series, and I never saw her as a ""Loli"" character. She's just a short girl. She's clearly an adult, and written as an adult. She's just as competent as everyone around her."
Tunnel,Is this a good show?
Tunnel,"Literally all the outrage in this thread is based on a mistranslation.

Here's how [the interview](https://twitter.com/SieteSeventh/status/1571161774115659776) actually went:

CDPR felt that the character design of Rebecca was ""too cute"" for a dark setting like Cyberpunk 2077. Trigger said that the cuteness was going to make the action and violence pop-up more. Once CDPR saw her in animation, they agreed that her design made her more interesting. 

People frothing at the mouth because they think Studio Trigger was gleefully rubbing their hands going ""yes...yes...we MUST have sexualized children in this anime!"" are getting mad over something that didn't happen."
Tunnel,"i don’t really see anything wrong with them not wanting to redesign her. she seems to be similar to a lot of their usual female side characters like Nonon, Sucy and Lucia; and the design itself doesn’t really look too out of place from the cyberpunk world.

the phrase itself is weird but i feel like there’s maybe some lost context from that conversation or decision."
Tunnel,"The creator of the show recently gave more context to this on Twitter. 

“Just a comment to add context for us wanted to cut Becka. We were quite against it when Trigger wanted to introduce a new character to existing scripts but once we saw this early design we were in. She is a super important part of the story and my personal fav. #Edgerunners”

https://twitter.com/gwentbro/status/1571159352848924672?s=46&t=lOuEBSPB4IA3KBT7FbxoLg"
Tunnel,"She's a loli character? She doesn't come across as one. 

Honestly, from the start she just seemed like a small adult. The way she acts doesn't feel loli in any way."
Tunnel,"Well that dev's paraphrasing really is a trashfire. Without direct actual quotes from Trigger, that's the stupidest way they could describe their reservations."
Tunnel,I never got the impression Rebecca is a loli. Short people exist.
Tunnel,In all my years of Reddit browsing this has to be the worst comment section I’ve ever seen.
Tunnel,"I'm looking at her design...  


That doesn't look loli at all. She's just short and flat chested. That doesn't mean Loli. Loli tends to be pretty explicitly juvenile and childlike. That's just an angry short flat adult. Those exist.   


I wonder if this is CDPR being a little out of touch of what a Loli is and were just concerned she didn't have enough anime tiddy?"
Tunnel,This is cringeworthy
Tunnel,She’s a fucking bad ass is what she is!
Tunnel,"I looked up some scenes and she’s just an adult that’s a little on the short side compared to giants like Jackie and sometimes has a haircut that’s on the more youthful side? Maybe she has big anime eyes?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m fully willing to criticize the whole “five hundred year old vampire dragon that looks and speaks like a child” trope, but she just comes across as a twenty something. Older than David, even, if only by a few years."
Tunnel,She's hardly a loli compared to other anime. I didn't think she was one till seen this
Tunnel,"Yeah Trigger never actually called her a 'loli'.

Also short woman = loli I guess."
Tunnel,"Having just learned what a “Loli” actually is, I am conflicted to say the least. I still don’t think it would be that ridiculous for a character like her to exist in NC. Who would expect someone like her to be able to blast them to bits? It’s like a sort of camouflage. Also, she is just a really good character. She’s competent, loyal, and a good friend to David and co till the bitter end. At the same time, if the trope exists simply to sexualize minors, then I’d rather see her character be portrayed as a normal 18+ as it wouldn’t change her character that much."
Tunnel,"“The Loli must stay” has to be publicity bait right? That or just really oblivious and stupid. The term loli is so volatile and charged it’s guaranteed to light every thread on fire. But the disgusting degenerate loli characters the general public thinks of when they hear the term are nothing like the Rebecca character though? Trigger is generating backlash for a character by associating it with a term that doesn’t really fit well. Like this is marketing isn’t it.

Edit: maybe it’s just a trash article."
Tunnel,Its weird that this discussion even existed cuz in the show shes clearly just a short adult. I never even thought of her as a loli.
Tunnel,"This is Trigger. Sure, lolis don't fit Night City, but pretty much anything Trigger touches turns into gold producing machine. Think star wars visions, it was so good not many people gave a fuck that it shouldn't be possible to cut your sister without killing her with a lightsaber when jumping into hyperspace."
Tunnel,"Between her and Uzaki, is every short character considered a loli now?"
Tunnel,"I just saw the main crew as having an admirable variety of body types. To start, you had a few average or skinny builds, two big and bulky muscle heads (one male, one female), her brother, who was long and lanky, and then her, who was short and petite."
Tunnel,"You guys sure love to clutch pearls on this subreddit, you'd think it was mainly frequented by Facebook moms. Good lord."
Tunnel,"you know, what upsets me is that the show is genuinely an incredible piece of work that deserves conversation and attention around it, but the mainstream discussion is likely to be magnetized around the developers describing the character as this term

I think anybody who's seen the show would just classify Rebecca as a short woman; don't think it ever even crossed my mind that she was juvenile. Voice acting, demeanor, overall presence was of a dangerous, tough outlaw. 

CDPR should really be more careful with their words. damn shame, this'll get remembered as the ""slightly pedophilic character design"" because that's the connotation of the phrase they used"
Tunnel,Its so common place I didn’t even notice it.
Tunnel,She stays
Tunnel,"I never thought of her as a loli 

She was always a one of those fast moving goblins to me."
Tunnel,Gotta read that like it's a Gus Fring Quote.
Tunnel,"Honestly, we could do with less sexualized lollies, and more psychotic lollies with a long history of violent behavior"
Tunnel,"Short adults can exist, especially in a world where most people don’t have organic parts left lmao"
Tunnel,"I’ve been loving this discussion, so many shit takes, its been a blast reading through it all and saving comments kek

Rebecca is a loli and people saying she isn’t have no understanding of the concept of what a loli."
Tunnel,Idk thought of her as someone with dwarfism then a loli.
Tunnel,"She was a great character, so im glad they kept her in."
Tunnel,"If their goal would have been to have a sexualized loli character, they wouldn't have designed her with zombie-like bloody eyes."
Tunnel,"CDPR probably just didn't think she matched the Night City aesthetic of a loli. Because in night city the children just look like tiny adults.

Night city must be rough living, because all the kids walking around look like 3' tall 35 year olds."
Tunnel,Short = Loli. Murica brain
Tunnel,I’m scared to ask what a Loli is lol
Tunnel,Trigger just can't stop being based.
Tunnel,Was there an outcry or something?
Tunnel,"Bro shes just short, let short people exist in anime"
Tunnel,"At the risk of sounding like some creepy weeb content connoisseur, this is not at all what lolis look like."
Tunnel,I don't know what a Loli is but I just saw her character as a smaller woman with robot gorilla arms who is also delightfully mad
Tunnel,"Fuck all that noise. Until I start hearing complaints about the 17 year old minor, I don’t care what anyone has to say really."
Tunnel,This title is completely meaningless to me.
Tunnel,Bruh she’s just short
Tunnel,"After seeing all these comments I feel inclined to say that all in all loli characters in some instances are ok especially when depicting a full grown adult, where I draw the line is hentai that depicts grooming of loli’s, that is fucked up and don’t say it isn’t, my nail in the coffin is that when I was younger my preference was loli’s now I’m more a petite and over all everything else guy, if me as a child liking loli’s isn’t a sign I don’t know is"
Tunnel,"first off, she's just short. I read her like 17 at youngest.
second, she's not even sexualized. This isn't some harem anime where the main character buys her as a slave and then has some ""will they/wont they"" doe eyed relationship BS. She's just a character like any other."
Tunnel,Murder goblin is one of my favorite archetypes
Tunnel,i was kinda on their side until they said 'loli...'
Tunnel,"She looks from the screencaps that shes meant to fit that Jinx/Harley Quinn ""Manic Pixie Gun Girl"" trope, not a loli."
Tunnel,"The hell? She's like 4'10 and has A or B cups and developed hips. She's not even a loli, she's just a petite woman."
Tunnel,I’m what universe is this chick a fucking loli? She does not come off as a child at all lol
Tunnel,"Regardless of how the character turned out, a sexualized child actually fits a dystopian cyberpunk future quite well. It makes the dystopia more fucked up. I'm sure other cyberpunk media have at least touched upon the topic."
Tunnel,I thought she was short?
Tunnel,Was she a Loli? She had a pretty mature sounding voice actor plus she is an adult the whole series.
Tunnel,"Same guy that made an anime about girls panties turning into weapons is ok with lolis, not a surprise"
Tunnel,"Loli being a constantly evolving term makes it incredibly hard to define properly when a character either is or isn't. It doesn't mean child as much as it means small and cute. It's more petite but naturally you can't brand underage characters other things so they got lumped into the group. Japan doesn't have a term like shortstack either, so you end up with a over-encompassing term that covers literally anything shorter than average height.   


Hell, her size changes according to the scene to force her manic energy. I'd personally call her more of a Lolita since she's more manic gremlin than underage child, but whatever.  


Big day for annoying people, anyway."
Tunnel,"Wait, she was supposed to be a loli? I thought she was just short and the gag was that this shirt woman is a badass psycho."
Tunnel,"Could not care less about any of this, but the show is fucking great. Animation is SOOOOOO good. Knowing now that it was Studio Trigger, it should have been obvious while watching."
Tunnel,"If she looks like a child, she’s a loli"
Tunnel,Non-Weebs and Lolis. The timeless combo for a cesspool of a comment section.
Tunnel,Hot take lolicon is equivalent to our toddler/child/teen beauty pageant shit
Tunnel,"Loli is derived from ""Lolita"" a story about a guy who grooms a kid

Rebecca is a 20-something woman (who's hot as hell)

Can we not conflate the two I'm so tired of this"
Tunnel,Always fun when eastern culture becomes mainstream and suddenly people learn anime is more than Pokemon and Dragonball
Tunnel,Honestly fuck the west and its attempt at making japanese animation as boring as western media.
Tunnel,This show is awesome! Good!
Tunnel,**The Loli Must Stay**
Tunnel," Leave the gun, Take the Loli."
Tunnel,"smh, why is so much of anime pervy af?"
Tunnel,"Not going to take a game ""journalist"" account of what happened as face value with the years of attack on gamers.  This article is clearly bait.  Would not be surprised if this is taken way out of context, especially with a foreign speaker."
Tunnel,People really have forgotten what loli actually means
Tunnel,What the fuck
Tunnel,"Fuck sake because of this thread I now know what a Loli is, I'm getting off reddit today."
Tunnel,You really don't get a say when handing the keys to a Japanese studio to do the animation. West written shows with an anime studio for the animation doesn't happen.
Tunnel,[removed]
Tunnel,"Redditors: “I didn’t see her as a loli character and here’s why”

The studio that literally created her: “she’s a loli character”"
Tunnel,"""The loli must stay! How else would be garner the anime pedophile crowd!? Which is a lot of them!""

Is basically the convo I hear them having."
Tunnel,"People romanticize Japan to no end but no one ever talks about their rampant pedophilia problem. And this ""loli"" shit just proves it's being more normalized over here now due to anime culture. There are tons of popular anime that just straight up sexualize their underage characters very overtly. Bottom line if you use the term ""loli"" you're a fucking weirdo degen"
Tunnel,[removed]
Tunnel,That’s what they deem a Loli!?
Tunnel,digi bro must be ecstatic.
The Liar and His Lover,I've always thought she'd make a good Lara Croft for the inevitable reboot.
The Liar and His Lover,Many amazon shows are book adaptations.
The Liar and His Lover,Always felt bad for her. Was probably so excited when cast only to be torpedoed unfairly from soulless corporate media.
The Liar and His Lover,"She's a good actress. Unfortunately, she did what she could with the Star Wars material. I don't know this book, but I'll watch the trailer."
The Liar and His Lover,Sounds interesting.
The Liar and His Lover,She’s a dud.
The Liar and His Lover,yeah yeah yeaa yeaa yeh
The Liar and His Lover,I wonder what this might mean for a potential future commitment to a new Star Wars film.
The Liar and His Lover,Daisy Ridley blows.
The Liar and His Lover,"I’d never thought about it, but I think she’d be killer"
The Liar and His Lover,Haven't they already rebooted that?
The Liar and His Lover,Just building on the company’s history from selling books to making movies about books 😏
The Liar and His Lover,They got the data about what books are gonna be hot so they probably got an inside track no one could even believe.
The Liar and His Lover,"She went from a nobody to a B-Lister. The last movie in the trilogy was shit, but her career prospects are all thanks to Star Wars and that soulless corporate media."
The Liar and His Lover,">only to be torpedoed unfairly from soulless corporate media

I feel more bad that she got put in the crosshairs of the abysmal elements of the fanbase. She went from a corpse on CSI (or a show like it) to being the lead protagonist of one of the biggest franchises in American cinema. Totally unprepared for how awful she would be treated online, tbh, and that sucks."
The Liar and His Lover,Way to commit
The Liar and His Lover,Why
The Liar and His Lover,I only saw her in the first movie of the Star Wars™ reboot. That script was total dogshit. She did a good job with what she had
The Liar and His Lover,Yea the rebooted in already.
The Liar and His Lover,It works well because Amazon can direct people that like the show to buy the book on amazon or audible.
The Liar and His Lover,"True, but it was a hard journey that I'm sure weighed on her. The writing was just awful trash that left her with no real chance to shine."
The Liar and His Lover,"She's a great actor, I'll definitely be giving the poster a passing glance."
The Liar and His Lover,Lots of options nowadays :p
The Liar and His Lover,"Got plucked from obscurity to star in the biggest franchise in movies, and could not parlay that into anything."
The Liar and His Lover,"Truth be told, she was one of the only bright spots of that movie. It was very similar to Daenerys in GOT Season 8. Emilia Clarke had spent the entire show becoming better in the role, and in Season 8 she puts on her best performance by far of the series, but it gets forgotten since the writing is shit. 

True talent shines through shitty writing, and Daisy definitely has a bright future as an actress."
The Liar and His Lover,[deleted]
The Liar and His Lover,she is also literally a supermodel … she’s doing just fine
The Liar and His Lover,"She has done nothing.

What was her best film since Star Wars?"
The Liar and His Lover,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
The Liar and His Lover,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
The Liar and His Lover,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
The Liar and His Lover,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
The Liar and His Lover,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
The Liar and His Lover,Why is he Sonic
The Liar and His Lover,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
The Liar and His Lover,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
The Liar and His Lover,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
The Liar and His Lover,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
The Liar and His Lover,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
The Liar and His Lover,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
The Liar and His Lover,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
The Liar and His Lover,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
The Liar and His Lover,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
The Liar and His Lover,Never meet your heroes
The Liar and His Lover,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
The Liar and His Lover,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
The Liar and His Lover,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
The Liar and His Lover,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
The Liar and His Lover,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
The Liar and His Lover,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
The Liar and His Lover,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
The Liar and His Lover,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
The Liar and His Lover,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
The Liar and His Lover,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
The Liar and His Lover,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
The Liar and His Lover,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
The Liar and His Lover,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
The Liar and His Lover,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
The Liar and His Lover,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
The Liar and His Lover,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
The Liar and His Lover,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
The Liar and His Lover,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
The Liar and His Lover,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
The Liar and His Lover,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
The Liar and His Lover,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
The Liar and His Lover,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
The Liar and His Lover,Never go full John K
The Liar and His Lover,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
The Liar and His Lover,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
The Liar and His Lover,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
The Liar and His Lover,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
The Liar and His Lover,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
The Liar and His Lover,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
The Liar and His Lover,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
The Liar and His Lover,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
The Liar and His Lover,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
The Liar and His Lover,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
The Liar and His Lover,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
The Liar and His Lover,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
The Liar and His Lover,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
The Liar and His Lover,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
The Liar and His Lover,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
The Liar and His Lover,Ah geez 😳
The Liar and His Lover,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
The Liar and His Lover,100 years
The Liar and His Lover,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
The Liar and His Lover,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
The Liar and His Lover,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
The Liar and His Lover,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
The Liar and His Lover,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
The Liar and His Lover,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
The Liar and His Lover,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
The Liar and His Lover,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
The Liar and His Lover,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
The Liar and His Lover,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
The Liar and His Lover,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
The Liar and His Lover,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
The Liar and His Lover,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
The Liar and His Lover,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
The Liar and His Lover,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!

Is it an *accurate* account of exactly how the industry was back then? No, it's a fictional drama piece that focuses more on the fictional characters' stories than historical accuracy. Having said that, there are references to actual historical events and technologies to satisfy the geek in you. 

Honestly, the last few episodes have been really good, so keep watching. They found their groove.

Engineering Girls,"Yes I'm watching it.  It's okay, you're not missing much if you're not watching,  but it's not bad either.  I don't know if its accurate. "
Engineering Girls,"This looked interesting, but it seems certain that it will be canceled. The latest episode had 500k viewers. I can't imagine AMC will renew it."
Engineering Girls,[deleted]
Engineering Girls,The first few episodes were a bit rough but the last two have been superb. I'm glad I've kept watching. 
Engineering Girls,"I gave up, the loud music being a stand in for ""I'm coding/doing my job really well"" and fucking the main male character being a stand in for ""I'm not coding/doing my job well"" got really annoying."
Engineering Girls,"Steve Wozniak is a fan of the show.

Wozniak himself hosted Halt and Catch Fire’s post-screening panel at SXSW and praised the show for both its accuracy and production values.

“I give this show a 10 and that’s so rare for me,” he said.

"
Engineering Girls,Took me awhile before I watched it because it sounded boring on paper. Watched the show and was very happy that other people's recommendation rang true. It's like a series of unending pitches which livens things up. There's a few cheesy lines but Lee Pace's delivery saves it. It looks really well conceived and consistent in tone through out the 5 episodes I've seen. Watching it per episode or binge-watching it both works. There's enough of a storyline to keep you tuned but it doesn't have any dangling plots to make you impatient for another episode. 
Engineering Girls,"Episodes 4 and 5 have been my favorites so far. I really disliked 1 and 2. You are off about the sexual relationship they are telegraphing, but a relationship does emerge between 2 main characters."
Engineering Girls,My problem is that any interesting conflict that arises is instantly resolved in less than 5 minutes. The only real long arced conflict is between bearded guy and wife.
Engineering Girls,"I couldn't care less about the character development in this show, I just want them to build the damn PC."
Engineering Girls,"Copy and paste of some waffle I wrote in a couple of minutes earlier today about Halt and Catch Fire in /r/apple when asking who there had watched it:

The pilot was 'cool' but rather meh too - the characters were too cliche/thin. It wasn't until around ep. 3 or 4 that it 'caught fire' in my mind. But I almost always find that I need to give a new show about 3-5 episodes to create its world and characters with semi-believable backgrounds and direction before it comes to life in my mind. Unfortunately, recently a few shows haven't done this until their second season, and just as they are becoming compelling they get cancelled before their third. All bets are off with this show as to how long it will last and what about it will/may pull in new viewers - the references to the technological roots of the PC Era, the personal challenges of the characters as they become part of pseudo-tech-history, or just the revealing of new dimensions/angles of their personalities that we may be able to relate to our own lives or 'characters' in recent/present companies. 

I feel the show has an aesthetic that can rival Mad Men's, but it feels both weaker and stronger for giving story time to more characters from the start. It's what's pulling me in the more I watch it, but at the same time, I wonder if the equality the writers are giving to the characters will dilute some of its 'vision'. Then again, so far that vision/message appears to be the democratising nature of (affordable) technology - much like Jobs' vs IBM, we see Joe vs IBM - trying to bring a new PC to life that will (r)evolutionise PCs as much as Apple. I guess the writers are succeeding by intriguing me as to whether Joe's character will 'keep it together' or self-combust amongst the chaos that he's partly created with his 'disruptive' ideas and the team he's picked - to build their combined vision. 

That's the part that is both the weakest and strongest in the show, because without the supporting leads and other characters, Joe's vision couldn't be turned into reality. So I guess all my hopes for the show making it are based on the other characters becoming real in parallel with Joe's vision - to keep his character from self-combusting and stealing all their oxygen as characters (and destroying the show overall) - to save their combined vision, of a new PC becoming materialised successfully. If they fail to, then that vision will be burnt, and the message and value of the show will die with the writing that lead to that. I think my reference to Joe's American Psycho like nature (in parts) in my OP is relevant here - because he (and his team) have every chance of progressing their fictional tech history into fame, but when they get caught up in their own internal/personal dramas, halting their tech progress, their success has every chance of catching fire, as we've seen so far. 

It's a really tricky balance for the writers to find - how much air(time) to give the visionary in a story where the world and his vision needs his supporting leads/characters as much as he does. If he's too strong and 'unreal', then the show looks stupid, but if he looks too fallible/real, his supporting characters look weaker for following him into an unstable future, and his vision isn't incendiary enough to keep us watching.

However, all that aside - it's just fun to time travel to when LCD TV watches were cool! It puts rumours of the iWatch in perspective and makes our chronocentrism regarding technology look _dated_. (Excuse my essay like waffle - it could do with editing - but I'm just having quick fun with some 'casual writing' at the end of the week! ;)"
Engineering Girls,"I've watched the first 4 episodes, and I have the 5th waiting for me on the DVR. There's a little too much needless drama for me, and a couple of WTF scenes (the ""traffic stop"" for one); but there's enough nerd cred to keep me watching. "
Engineering Girls,I was getting that from the 2nd episode. There seems to be a lot of tension there but they also enjoy each other's company. Also he avoids telling his wife who Cameron is. However after catching up with the rest of the episodes they have very little contact and bearded guys marriage is on the upswing. 
Engineering Girls,Ok. Good to hear. I'll be sure to check out the subreddit when I'm caught up. Thanks 
Engineering Girls,After enjoying mad men and breaking bad so much I hope AMC find a way to deliver good content. Sad to hear that this show may be dead in the water. 
Engineering Girls,"Are you talking about the character or the actress playing the character? I.e do you hate the idea of the character that the writers have written, or do you hate the way these actresses are portraying them?"
Engineering Girls,I don't know if I'd give it a ten but I'm sure he is glad to see something that is tech related that is more grounded in reality compared to what we've seen in the past . 
Engineering Girls,Haha can't blaim you there. I imagine the PC will be finished at the end of the season. 
Engineering Girls,"> However after catching up with the rest of the episodes they have very little contact and bearded guys marriage is on the upswing.

The *upswing*? Dude's basically the worst husband in the world, if they're not divorced by the end of the first season i'll be amazed."
Engineering Girls,[deleted]
Engineering Girls,Haha you're right he's not the most responsible husband in the world however great men also need a great woman. They  saved the day together recently and she is doing better with her own career. He knows she and his family are at stake if he fails but I see him pushing the envelope as far as it will go before she leaves him. I don't think they will seperate. They are at the cusp of making something great together and I hope that they can make it through to enjoy their success together as well. 
Engineering Girls,"I want to know where she acquired all of her skills. I'm willing to suspend disbelief that she's a hard core coder geek that looks like that (doesn't happen), but you never even see her in front of a computer except at work. People like that are on a PC every waking hour. That's how you get good. "
Engineering Girls,"No, she saved the day and he robbed her of the recognition by giving a fake name. Did you see how much that bothered her? I don't know if you saw the last episode, but her boss is definitely going to be a love interest. "
Engineering Girls,I agree. Something will definitely happen between she and her boss. I don't know what though. I was surprised she wasn't offered a job after saving the HD though. Do you think they will offer her a job? 
Engineering Girls,"He gave her a fake name because she's an engineer for TI and if was known that she did work for Cardiff, while under TI's employment, there could be Intellectual property issues. I believe Joe explained all this because of the reporter being in the office that day. "
Engineering Girls,"I doubt it, I think the whole point of that storyline was to show us how much her husband takes her for granted. Now contrast that with her boss. Yeah, he snapped at her, but he apologized and followed up by complimenting her work. Then there was the whole sexual subtext in their peach pie conversation, and after the call she added some vodka to the pie (implying her trust and interest in him). At the very least she's going to end up separating from her husband for a while."
Engineering Girls,"I think Joe was more worried about the appearance of professionalism. In any case, it bothered her, that's what's important."

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses!"
Inmates,"Holy shit, what a coincidence.

I grew up in Jeffersonville, Indiana (the city which has this jail).  A friend of mine went in there for 30 days for not paying child support.  At the end of the thirty days, he ran home (approx 4 miles).  We were sitting on the balcony, he was shaking, smoking a cigarette, and he told me of his time in there.  It was 11 years ago, so I'm only vaguely recalling the details.

He told me that he barely got anything to eat... He had to give away food, or else he'd get his ass beat.

He told me that the guards were corrupt... There was a panic button they could press if something was happening to them...  He was getting his ass beat, screaming at the top of his lungs, pressing the panic button whenever he could.  The guards were standing outside the room, doing nothing.

He was utterly terrified of that place.  I thought he was embellishing... until I saw this.

Inmates,just for reference this is pretty much the same stunt that nellie bly (first ny times female reporter) pulled to get her job. She wanted to be a reporter so bad and they wouldnt let a woman become a reporter so she went to them and pitched the  idea that she would pretend to be insane and get herself committed to the big loony bin there in new york at the time and after a month they would come pull her out. She got the job and the story she wrote brought about huge changes in the mental health industry and to me stands as one of the greatest examples of muckraking reporting ever and one of the bravest things i'd ever heard of. People should know her name. 
Inmates,"20 years ago I was in county jail for fifteen days, witnessed a few things. One was an inmate taken outside of his cell and getting mercilessly kicked by the sergeant while an entire crowd of guards encircled the crime. The sergeant kept saying in between each kick, ""Who's the big man now?""

Jail is something you want to avoid.

edit: To clarify the situation at the time, I was a white guy serving out a driving without insurance fine ($1500 or 15 days), the guy in question was a dark skinned guy who came into the jail like it was some kind of a welcoming home party (""Jeff's"" back!).

Inmates,"I have a feeling that the inmates thought that the cameras were there part of one of the any ""Lock Up"" shows that they air. While I am sure some of the inmates played up certain aspects for the show, after a while the cameras probably became an after thought. Theres no way that that many people could be in on staging this show. The only thing I could see being fake is the behavior of the inmates who want to show off for the camera. Also you have to realize that if the inmates get in trouble for anything their time can be extended or they could be put into solitary so for the most part they just want to keep their head down and do their time. There are obviously outliers who don't care about getting more time or any type of additional punishment so theres that. Many people do not realize the difference between jail and prison, yes prison is quite different than jail. The thing about prison is for the most part you have MORE freedoms as these inmates are doing hard time and they want to keep the inmates happy for the safety of the inmates as well as the general population. The scary thing about jail is a lot of the inmates are waiting to go to trial so if you're in their on a murder charge or some sort of violent criminal act you usually are put in a pod with others with similar charges. They typically keep violent offenders in one pod (as they are classified in different ranks) - which it seems Robert has made it to, so there is definitely a risk factor. A lot of the drugs come in through people who are working on work force (inmates who go out and pick up trash / do other tasks) or inmates who have work release. They are probably saying that drugs are cheaper on the inside because money is harder to trade than say ramen noodles or soup. "
Inmates,"Oklahoma County Jail -- I knew a guy who got put in this jail and the first night got his jaw broken. The inmates could get out of their own cells and three big butch guys ganged up on him. He couldn't talk, and it took three days for the jailers to get him to the jail clinic. If he'd gotten hit just one more time it would have killed him. The inmates ran the jail and the jailers let them. 

Someone here commented about cruel and unusual punishment and was CORRECT. It all stems from a twisted attitude that is learned early in childhood... that corporal punishment or TORTURE is how misbehavior is corrected. And THIS attitude springs from authoritarianism... the doctrine of OBEDIENCE to authority... no matter how right or wrong authority really is. 

This is INSANITY begetting more insanity. It is a medieval mindset that the priests of old days used against heretics and witches. Power corrupts... and absolute power corrupts absolutely... and in a place where everyone's ego and power urges are given full reign... it is INHUMAN. Modern civilization... bah humbug."

Could it be argued that prison in its current form violates a person's constitutional right not to be subjected to such punishments?"

60 Days In,"Holy shit, what a coincidence.

I grew up in Jeffersonville, Indiana (the city which has this jail).  A friend of mine went in there for 30 days for not paying child support.  At the end of the thirty days, he ran home (approx 4 miles).  We were sitting on the balcony, he was shaking, smoking a cigarette, and he told me of his time in there.  It was 11 years ago, so I'm only vaguely recalling the details.

He told me that he barely got anything to eat... He had to give away food, or else he'd get his ass beat.

He told me that the guards were corrupt... There was a panic button they could press if something was happening to them...  He was getting his ass beat, screaming at the top of his lungs, pressing the panic button whenever he could.  The guards were standing outside the room, doing nothing.

He was utterly terrified of that place.  I thought he was embellishing... until I saw this.

#TL;DR: I grew up here.  This jail is terrifying."

60 Days In,just for reference this is pretty much the same stunt that nellie bly (first ny times female reporter) pulled to get her job. She wanted to be a reporter so bad and they wouldnt let a woman become a reporter so she went to them and pitched the  idea that she would pretend to be insane and get herself committed to the big loony bin there in new york at the time and after a month they would come pull her out. She got the job and the story she wrote brought about huge changes in the mental health industry and to me stands as one of the greatest examples of muckraking reporting ever and one of the bravest things i'd ever heard of. People should know her name. 
60 Days In,"20 years ago I was in county jail for fifteen days, witnessed a few things. One was an inmate taken outside of his cell and getting mercilessly kicked by the sergeant while an entire crowd of guards encircled the crime. The sergeant kept saying in between each kick, ""Who's the big man now?""

Jail is something you want to avoid.

edit: To clarify the situation at the time, I was a white guy serving out a driving without insurance fine ($1500 or 15 days), the guy in question was a dark skinned guy who came into the jail like it was some kind of a welcoming home party (""Jeff's"" back!). According to another inmate, a guy who looked like George Foreman  (I'd play Scrabble with him), ""He was a mouthy n****r."" And that's how it went in Nassau County jail in the 90's."

In fact he had his meal blended in front of her, then insisted on trying to feed her her meal so she would hurry up. I hope he has a horrible time.

60 Days In,"I have a feeling that the inmates thought that the cameras were there part of one of the any ""Lock Up"" shows that they air. While I am sure some of the inmates played up certain aspects for the show, after a while the cameras probably became an after thought. Theres no way that that many people could be in on staging this show. The only thing I could see being fake is the behavior of the inmates who want to show off for the camera. Also you have to realize that if the inmates get in trouble for anything their time can be extended or they could be put into solitary so for the most part they just want to keep their head down and do their time. There are obviously outliers who don't care about getting more time or any type of additional punishment so theres that. Many people do not realize the difference between jail and prison, yes prison is quite different than jail. The thing about prison is for the most part you have MORE freedoms as these inmates are doing hard time and they want to keep the inmates happy for the safety of the inmates as well as the general population. The scary thing about jail is a lot of the inmates are waiting to go to trial so if you're in their on a murder charge or some sort of violent criminal act you usually are put in a pod with others with similar charges. They typically keep violent offenders in one pod (as they are classified in different ranks) - which it seems Robert has made it to, so there is definitely a risk factor. A lot of the drugs come in through people who are working on work force (inmates who go out and pick up trash / do other tasks) or inmates who have work release. They are probably saying that drugs are cheaper on the inside because money is harder to trade than say ramen noodles or soup. "
60 Days In,"Oklahoma County Jail -- I knew a guy who got put in this jail and the first night got his jaw broken. The inmates could get out of their own cells and three big butch guys ganged up on him. He couldn't talk, and it took three days for the jailers to get him to the jail clinic. If he'd gotten hit just one more time it would have killed him. The inmates ran the jail and the jailers let them. 

Someone here commented about cruel and unusual punishment and was CORRECT. It all stems from a twisted attitude that is learned early in childhood... that corporal punishment or TORTURE is how misbehavior is corrected. And THIS attitude springs from authoritarianism... the doctrine of OBEDIENCE to authority... no matter how right or wrong authority really is. 

This is INSANITY begetting more insanity. It is a medieval mindset that the priests of old days used against heretics and witches. Power corrupts... and absolute power corrupts absolutely... and in a place where everyone's ego and power urges are given full reign... it is INHUMAN. Modern civilization... bah humbug."
60 Days In,"Not only did law enforcement officials allow this to be filmed...it was the brainchild of one... ""Lol, come film how shitty we do our jobs for reality tv..."" "
60 Days In,'It's just a prank dude!' 
60 Days In,It is reality tv. You can rest assured that about 80% of what you will see in that show is fake. 
60 Days In,"Is placing a person convicted of a crime in a poorly-controlled situation that they can't escape from and where they are subjected to physical and sexual assaults, not from those tasked with running the facility, but rather from other inmates, a *de facto* Cruel and Unusual form of punishment (with emphasis on Cruel)?  Could it be argued that prison in its current form violates a person's constitutional right not to be subjected to such punishments?"
60 Days In,its takes lots of guts to do that
60 Days In,Unless we can prove this is real I am just going to assume this whole show is fake.
60 Days In,"Let me guess... did it suck?

It probably sucks..."
60 Days In,Lmao what am I reading?? Only white people would voluntarily go IN to a jail. Now I've seen it all.
60 Days In,"> 80% of the inmates were in for drug-related charges

Well there's the fucking problem right there."
60 Days In,">This is the most bizarre show I've ever seen. 7 civilians are put undercover into an overcrowded county jail.
I still can't believe it's real.
  
That's because it's pretend.  There's zero chance people were just randomly housed in gen pop.  ZERO.  Were allowed to go to programs and pretend they were housed elsewhere?  Maybe.  "
60 Days In,Why are the guards using paintball guns
60 Days In,"There's a reason why they don't pick Canadian jails. It's like summer camp for adults. Stand up,  you'll be fine. People who complain about our prisons have no idea what real prison is like. "
60 Days In,">New inmates were expected to fork over food or items bought in the prison commissary in exchange for bathroom privileges, according to Noel.

This quote is great, it wasn't an expectation it was them testing you, you either fight and keep your stuff and get your privileges or give stuff up and then they keep taking. "
60 Days In,I feel like a lot of people need to forget what they have learned from works of fiction.
60 Days In,If that lady keeps running her mouth shes gonna wind up dead...
60 Days In,I expect prison is like high school but with adult intuition. So the worst high school you can imagine all day every day.
60 Days In,80% there for drugs. Drugs cheaper in jail. Wake me up when the world unretards itself. 
60 Days In,And what happened if someone died who went in?  This is one of the most stupid things A&E could do.

60 Days In,Or they could've just asked the real inmates. I hate when networks come up with false motives that make them appear to be noble when they're really just exploiting an already screwed up system. 
60 Days In,Could someone please explain to me how drugs could be cheaper in jail than on the street?  That can't be right.
60 Days In,whoaaaaaa
60 Days In,"In the trailer for next week, I can't help but think piggy got stabbed.  Dude that came after him looked like he was holding a sharp object."
60 Days In,"Used to work for D.O.C., we opened a new facility and had regular employees from D.O.C. live there to test the facility out for a week. Well, it was SUPPOSED to last a week, but after only a day they had to cut it short because, even though the C.O.s knew everyone was just there to test the place, it was too much for a lot of the people there.

Seriously, couldn't handle a week of paid vacation at a prison.


Kind of messed up.
"
60 Days In,It's a god damn war in there.
60 Days In,"> Participants also confirmed to Noel a long-held suspicion: that some inmates had purposely gotten arrested because drugs were cheaper in jail than they were on the street.

**WTF????**"
60 Days In,Ok i watched the video and after it was over there was a picture of a decapitated head paused???? 
60 Days In,"Uhhh did anyone else see a still of a decapitated inmate, after the preview for ""60 Days In"" ended at the end of the article? 

WTH was that about? No way that happened on this show."
60 Days In,60 days in jail seems like forever. I was only in there for two weeks and it still seemed long as fcuk. Lol.
60 Days In,">Participants also confirmed to Noel a long-held suspicion: that some inmates had purposely gotten arrested because drugs were cheaper in jail than they were on the street.

This is incredible to my mind. Also if 80% of the people there are there for drug crime it seems like the system is like a school yard and brings out violent dynamic? "
60 Days In,"I'd love to see this exact same scenario done in other ""first world"" countries. "

60 Days In,"Can confirm, Indiana jails are miserable... just like the rest of Indiana."
60 Days In,"TIL a lot of Redditors have been to jail/prison.

Also, this ""documentary"" is complete bullshit. If the regular surveillance cameras covered all the angles the show provides the inmates and guards would not be getting away with all the things this show portrays. Criminals would see the new installments the second they appeared and they are either getting paid to act particularly outrageous or they simply like the idea of being on TV. The waivers they signed undoubtedly included a stipulation that they would not receive any additional punishment for the acts caught on tape. "
60 Days In,"It's from A&E people, nothing to see here."
60 Days In,The lengths some people go to for anal!
60 Days In,"Here's what it looks like when you shine a light on the system. You can see how everything works, and it's obvious. You just can't think of a way to fix it. "
60 Days In,I watched this last night. Weird and scary as fuck.
60 Days In,"Just FYI, I have personally witnessed a ""documentary"" being filmed at a county jail (for the show ""jail"").  Believe it or not, a lot, if not all, of filmed events are scripted with multiple takes.

Also the jail or the county has the final say as to what was to be published which is usually agreed per contract."
60 Days In,Bossier parish jails would make you learn what bad jails are all about
Top Wing,"Interesting. I'd never even heard of it, though I loved NYPD Blue back in the day. I only disagree about Bosson- I think the only reason she works is nepotism. 

But I love that you keep an eye on actors like this-I do too, and my husband thinks I'm a weirdo! I'll even IMDB someone to find out where I've seen them before."
Top Wing,"Good write-up!  I was glad to see that it got a physical release

I remember Benzali on a CIA drama in the early 00s that started off more grounded than most spy shows but it got kind of looser and a bit ridiculous by the last season.  Aside from Benzali's character suddenly wearing Panama hats all i can recall is a running bit where every time Will Patton's character flirted with or even smiled at a woman she'd end up being murdered lol"
Top Wing,"My 2nd favorite show from the 90's! (#1 will always be Twin Peaks.) The cast, writing, setting, and even Mike Post's soundtrack blend together so well in Season 1. It's an underappreciated predecessor to the serial drama that HBO popularized in the 2000s. Benzali and Tucci are the clear standouts of the cast, and their characters play off of one another so well. The inclusion of plot points like the jury selection do really help to make the whole thing more realistic. And although the resolution of the murder mystery is a tad bit underwhelming (>!I agree with the late Stanley Kamel that his character, the psychiatrist, should've been the murderer!<) it still ends strongly and the final shot of the season finale is perfectly dark.

Season Two... Pruitt Taylor Vince gives a good performance in the third story and that's about it."
Top Wing,"I usually refer to season 1 of this show as being my all time favorite TV Show. 

Such a great arc, superb atmosphere (that I can appreciate to this day, but I like some retro vibes every now and again) and truly stellar acting. Tucci's performance to me is one of the best I've ever seen (and I'm not adding ""him do"". I'm talking ever, everyone.) In fact, close to all performances in this show regularly made me wonder ""Why haven't I seen those guys more often?""). 

I do agree with the ending being rather ""Deux Ex Machina""."
Top Wing,"I'll grant that nepotism probably played a part in Bosson getting the role, but she was still a lot of fun in it,

Yes, I do have an eye for actors.  We also got a young Adam Scott in a couple of episodes, Brittany Murphy, and a pre-""Breaking Bad"" Dean Norris."
Top Wing,"Yes, I believe the show you're talking about is called ""The Agency"".  Apparently, they ended up seriously changing the show after 9/11.  I got to meet one of the actors on the show (Gil Bellows) when I did background on a film years ago and he talked about how smart the show had been initially."
Top Wing,"Oh, I love to catch 'em early in their careers :)"
Top Wing,"And speaking of the West Wing, there's that one episode with Richard Schiff!"
Top Wing,"New Top Gear: Perfectly spray painted rainbow flags with neat edges

Old Top Gear: Presenters spray painting the flags themselves, no edges and Hammond gets the colours in the wrong order.

Edit: Thanks for the gold random redditor!"
Top Wing,"If it had been the previous group of hosts, they would have painted two men fucking on the cars instead."
Top Wing,"Brunei is a weird ass place. The same sultan who twenty years ago allowed his playboy brother to throw massive hooker-filled parties on royal property (and would fly models to his palace to have them give him a bj) is imposing basically Sharia law. 

On the other hand, it has the only actual speakeasy I've ever been to (an illegal bar in the hotel I was staying in-- you had to know to knock on a specific door in the hotel). And it has so much oil wealth that it's been willing to preserve its rainforest from logging."
Top Wing,"Wasn't it Hammond sprayed ""Man Love"" on his car in redneck country?"
Top Wing,[deleted]
Top Wing,"A lot of well deserved hate for new Top Gear in this thread, but I just watched the new episode and I gotta say it's the best since clakson/hammond/may left. It's not doing anything new (a cheap car challenge in africa like they've done many times before), but the new presenters seem to have good chemistry and the cringy over-scripted feeling is way less. 

I'm not getting my hopes up for another few episodes, but I'll be watching next week"
Top Wing,">Thought to be the first time the BBC Two motoring programme has shown solidarity with the LGBT community

Fake News, Clarkson, May and Hammond wrote [Man Love Rules OK](https://grandtournation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1267678556313462631.jpg) in hot pink on a pickup truck and drove it around the deep South."
Top Wing,"I know why people are rightly upset and vocal about Brunei over their treatment of gay people, but what gets me is that killing people for being gay is common in the Middle East and parts of Africa. In Saudi Arabia for example they execute gay people in a multitude of ways ranging from stoning to death, pushing off buildings or hanging them from cranes but they don’t face any kind of boycott or outrage from anyone what baffles me 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Top Wing,This reminds me of the time they got shot at when driving though the Deep South.
Top Wing,Now drive them through Brunei again.
Top Wing,So incredibly brave of them to do it from the safe confines of England
Top Wing,top gear really went to shit when the old trio left
Top Wing,The BBC are getting REALLY desperate for viewers for Flop Gear.
Top Wing,"Some of us here do not agree with whatever the elites says here we keep our mouth shuts out of fear from reprecussion. Mind you everyone is somewhat dependent on the generousity of the rule to survive here but we do our part not to discriminate or tell others to not act or behave like an idiot, especially racism or Infringing basic human rights. Old kooks might run the show but the newer generations can persuade the future leaders not to act that way.

I for one am excited to see this episode, no one knew nor was aware top gear went here.

For a small country we were always excited to hear whenever the country being mentioned. The earliesr one i remember was back on ps1 rampage. Out of the 100 levels I finally reached a stage where its listed as my own country. But lately with the lgbt law and boycott news, its saddening and most of us did not ask for it."

Top Wing,"""Countries threat to stone gays"" Why can't they just come out and say what it is? Sharia. I suppose it would offend people.
I'd be more impressed if they drove the cars through Brunei instead of just painting them when they got back."
Top Wing,Didn't the old hosts do something like this and drove around the deep South(US)?
Top Wing,Fuck this top Gear Chris Harris is a dink
Top Wing,"Interesting (or not) aside: the BBC announced a few years ago that 1 in 6 of all characters on-screen would have to be LGBT+ by 2020. 50% of all roles would have to be female. IMHO it reeks of tokenism and, like most big companies, is diversity just to proclaim diversity"
Top Wing,Meanwhile on Grand Tour they're still using gay and trans as a punchline.
Top Wing,Top Gear died when Clarkson left.
Top Wing,"Dear LGBT crowd: Now that it's socially acceptable and now that the asshole bigots who used to run this show when it was relevant/popular have moved on - we wanted to make this low effort, low risk, high publicity effort to show that we support your Lifestyle TM."

Top Wing,"New top gear is such a corporate wank.

It's so... unimaginative, carefully calculated, viewer polled, focus-group tested, dull monotony. 

They took the heart out of the original and put a filing cabinet inside, then hooked up a modem in the top draw to auto-connect to Facebook data mining to determine what those whacky kids are into this werk."
Top Wing,"As a fan of the show and a homosexual, i prefer the old cast"
Top Wing,That’s not Top Gear...
Top Wing,New top gear sucks. It’s almost sacrilegiously bad.
Top Wing,That’s gay.
Top Wing,What would stoning in the 21st century look like? How would it go down? Rock guns?
Top Wing,New show only really missing a pissed Oliver Reed.. 😄
Top Wing,That’s a step up from Richard Hammond’s stance on eating ice-cream.
Top Wing,"This is fabulous, but I like this."
Top Wing,"Wait they did the paint AFTER the segment was shot?  So they didn't drive rainbow pride flag cars in Brunei, just in the UK?  That's not brave.  At least old Top Gear drove through the South with their slogans."

Top Wing,That’ll show ‘em
Top Wing,WOAH WOAH WOAH WHICH COUNTRY?!?!
Top Wing,"The Sultan of Brunei used to be a VERY different cat. Once upon a time, he was best known for throwing extravagant parties, flying in playboy bunnies to spend time with him, and spending a fortune to fly a barber from New York to Brunei every time he wanted a haircut.  

Then again, he also married and divorced his cousin. And then a flight attendant. And then a newscaster. And also maintains a harem."
Top Wing,Which country?
Top Wing,Okay might have to watch this show now. Deserted for the Grand Tour.
Top Wing,The old top gear team would probably spray paint LGBTQ+ slurs on their cars and race to see if they can get out of the country before being killed. Like what they did in America
Top Wing,"Better headline: “TV show accomplishes more for gay rights in the Mideast, in an active protest, than 99% of the self-righteous groups who have protested in North America the past 20 years.”"
Top Wing,"But won't raise awareness for Sudan, smh"
Top Wing,British men would never travel to Brunei.
Top Wing,"They only did this because they're cunts, not because they actually give a shit about gay people."
Top Wing,The real top gear did this in Alabama like 10 years ago.
Top Wing,Haha that’s awesome
Top Wing,Why not drive them through Brunei? Seems like really hollow gesture they're making.
Top Wing,Yess that will show them!
Top Wing,Well that’s not going to go down well in the part of the world
Top Wing,Drive them through Brunei!
Top Wing,What are you talking about? I'm arguing against what basic civil right?
Top Wing,"This is stupid ... 

why don’t you go to Brunei and make this statement 

You are painting the cars after the fact  ..."
Top Wing,Garbage tier tv-show
Top Wing,This show is so awful that leaning on social issues is really the only desperate play they've got left.
Top Wing,That'll show them!
Top Wing,they rocking the gay
Top Wing,Remember when they drove through the deep south with all manner of gay friendly slogans scrawled on their cars?
Top Wing,I’ve always loved this show. Glad to see they haven’t stopped doing whatever the hell they want 😂
Top Wing,"This is the difference between real corporate gestures and fake corporate gestures. 

Here Top Gear is actually putting itself and its product in between a government and its policy. 

This is brave."
Top Wing,"Okay. My take on this... I'm a Christian. With at least 10 years of understanding of the Bible. But what I'm about to say could be interpreted even by an athiest.. very simple. When God made man (and woman) he set one law. Don't eat the damn fruit. Well they did. We're kicked out and had to face a dark lawless world. As time progressed (passed the original sin) man was sinning rampant. ( Fast forward to the great flood to jesus) yes it ""a man laying with another man"" and abomination. However all sin is 100 percent equal to God. If not. Jesus dieing on the cross means nothing. Since you can't be more saved or less saved because of certain sins. It shows how he paid for them all. Even for people who still sin.

Being a liar is a sin.. but only the active lie. 
Therefore being gay and not acting on it is perfectly fine. But still we all fall short of the glory of God and sin daily.
Sorry for being long winded. :) God bless"
Top Wing,And this is why old top gear is better. And this is why the grand tour is better than the new top gear
Top Wing,"When America eventually gets around to invading that place for whatever reason, they should paint their tanks and drones the same way."
Top Wing,"Are they seriously still trying to keep this show going? I know it didn't start with the previous hosts, but the show transformed into something completely different with them and trying to replace them is just never going to work. It was a show about three bickering idiots more than it was a car show, and now that our lovable idiots have moved on, they've brought the show with them."
Top Wing,That’s really gay
Top Wing,"I miss Top Gear. 

This is not Top Gear.

It's official: Top Gear is dead. They got woke, now they're gonna go broke."
Top Wing,"**Silence, brand**"
Top Wing,I’m didn’t even know it was still on the air.
Top Wing,Unpopular opinion: this episode would’ve been way better with the old hosts
Top Wing,Wait that's not Clarkson. Or Hammond. Or May. Who cares? Back to The Grand Tour!
Top Wing,that should convince 'em!
Run with the Wind,The studio politics surrounding this slow moving trainwreck must be fascinating.
Run with the Wind,[everyone disliked that]
Run with the Wind,"No one will ever top Trebek but Jennings is a naturally funny guy and he's grown into the role. He's already good and he'll be even better in a few years, this whole thing is fucking asinine."
Run with the Wind,"Read the room, Jeopardy producers"
Run with the Wind,God Ken is so much better at being charismatic and ad-libbing additional info on the fly. This makes no sense to me unless there's some unbreakable contracts in place.
Run with the Wind,She waits waaaaaay to long to respond if the answer is correct or not. The look on the contestants face to knowing they got it right has to be obvious to the producers lol.
Run with the Wind,[removed]
Run with the Wind,BOOOOOO
Run with the Wind,How can creators be so blind to fan demand?
Run with the Wind,"I’ll take “She’s boring as shit, for two thousand.”"
Run with the Wind,Guess it won't be a Jeopardy summer for me
Run with the Wind,Are they trying to kill the show off?
Run with the Wind,"Its like Mayim has dirt on the producers, so she's blackmailing them into making her host more often than Ken."
Run with the Wind,"""Gretchen, stop trying to make Mayim Bialik happen! She's never going to happen!"""
Run with the Wind,"Christ, why?"
Run with the Wind,"Does anyone like Mayim Bialik? I've never seen anyone compliment her appearances as host and the couple times I've caught snippets I really wasn't impressed, so I have to wonder what those producers are smoking."
Run with the Wind,"lol everyone saying it was ""essentially confirmed"" that Mayim was only doing tournaments last time this got brought up on this sub. Nailed it."
Run with the Wind,"With Ken they literally couldn't have built a better Jeopardy! host in a lab.  Why do they continue to force-feed us Mayim when she is pretty universally disliked and objectively subpar?  Oh, well, more free time for us during the summer months I guess."
Run with the Wind,"I liked her as Blossom. But as host of Jeopardy she is stilted, awkward, unfunny, and forced."
Run with the Wind,"I enjoy Ken best, but I've heard he doesn't want to move his family from the Seattle area. So there needs to be another host since he can't host full time. I liked Buzzy when he hosted.  


I do not like Mayim since she admitted that she did not watch Jeopardy before she got the gig. She also does not do a good job hosting and breaks up the flow of the game. I was okay with her hosting of the celebrity version of the game, but Ken keeps the flow of the game, puts the contestants at ease, and is a warm presence. Mayim is coming off as a cringey actor."
Run with the Wind,I hope he returns. He's the best of the two
Run with the Wind,"I’ve watched growing up and I still watch every time I go visit my parents while eating dinner but we don’t watch a single episode that she hosts.

She’s truly ruining Jeopardy for us, and I’m sure a lot of other people feel the same. I refuse to support the show while she is the host.

Ken or nothing, and it seems they want nothing."
Run with the Wind,"What I don't get is that this may have been the easiest decision for a hosting change ever. 

Once Alex announced his cancer diagnosis, we all knew the clock was ticking, whether they wanted to admit it or not (plus he was already older). 

Ken has everything the show wants: witty, funny, knows the game well and is THE most famous contestant.  As long as he didn't screw it up during his trial run of hosting, which he didn't, the job should have been his. 

Maybe it's a male v female thing but I don't understand why Ken isn't full time. It almost seems like there is something else we don't know."
Run with the Wind,Tracy Morgan should host the show
Run with the Wind,That is…………………………………….. horrible.
Run with the Wind,BOOOOOOOOOO
Run with the Wind,What the fuck. Why are they so insistent on shoving her down the viewers' throats when the viewers clearly don't want her?!
Run with the Wind,"This is the worst news as a Jeopardy fan. It's becoming painfully obvious that the studio is hellbent on Mayim. I can't stand her random giggles and constant pauses.

Another cringey aspect to her personality is how she evidently feels threatened by real doctors. She is always rude to anybody with a PhD and  once even told the audience that an anesthesiologist is not a real doctor. It just shows how absolutely massive and fragile her ego really is. She wants to be the star of the show, how dare the contestents steal her limelight."
Run with the Wind,"Is it true, that viewership drops, when she hosts the show? Is she *that* unpopular?"
Run with the Wind,"So desperate to make fetch happen. Tsk, tsk. I guess the publicity is just too enticing..."
Run with the Wind,"I remember being okay with Mayim's run during her like ""audition"" phase. But after slogging through episodes with her, her faults stand out and irritate me enough to make the show unenjoyable. 

""...IT'S A DAILY DOUBLE!""  
""OH MY GOSH A TRUE DAILY DOUBLEEEE""  
\*takes a second to confirm it's the right answer\* ""..That's correct."" I think this one goes down to preparation. I think I remember a BTS of Alex reading the clues and everything ahead of time. I can't remember all of it, but he was familiar with every inch of that board every night I feel like. Same with Ken. 

Ken has the same respect for the game that Alex did, but Mayim just doesn't have the hosting chops. The same way I don't think Ken would be a decent actor."
Run with the Wind,Then I will stop watching April 28. Wtf are they doing?
Run with the Wind,Just fucking keep Ken
Run with the Wind,Literally no one likes bialik.. what the fuck are we doing here?
Run with the Wind,"I’ve been watching Jeopardy for forty years but if Bialik becomes the primary host I’ll be moving on.
Signed,
Team Ken Jennings or Bust"
Run with the Wind,Looks like I'll be taking some time off from Jeopardy this year.
Run with the Wind,I can’t even watch when she hosts
Run with the Wind,HORRIBLE NEWS
Run with the Wind,Booooooooo
Run with the Wind,She’s terrible
Run with the Wind,I thought he was the new permanent host and she was doing celebrity jeopardy? It’s complete bullshit that they keep yanking these people around. Just let it be!
Run with the Wind,I was a long time Jeopardy Fan but not anymore
Run with the Wind,"I started watching jeopardy only in the past few years so I'm not some Alex die hard, but even as a newer viewer watching Mayim is very hard. I'll honestly just watch reruns with trebek."
Run with the Wind,"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH

That is all.   


Nope, I lied. SHE IS THE WORST. Her timing, her little jokes that aren't funny, her pacing, her voice....I just hate all of it."
Run with the Wind,I don't even watch jeopardy and this headline made me cringe just from what I've learned about the fiasco on here.
Run with the Wind,This is a matter of likability. I really don’t understand the person who keeps “jeopardizing” their own career in an attempt to get Bialik to lead the show. She clearly is unliked by most viewers and she also isn’t particularly good as host. Why the “daily doubling down” on this?
Run with the Wind,Hoping everyone stops watching as soon as Kens run is over. If they won’t listen to fans they will listen to the ratings and money they lose from advertising
Run with the Wind,I’ll be watching old episodes any time she hosts.
Run with the Wind,It’s going to be sad when the show gets cancelled because the producers can’t figure out that Mayim is the wrong choice.
Run with the Wind,Nobody likes her
Run with the Wind,!remindme may 1 cancel DVR series record of jeopardy
Run with the Wind,"Goddammit Blossom, just take your bucket hat and go."
Run with the Wind,Booooooo
Run with the Wind,Yuck.
Run with the Wind,"If I were Ken, I would just be like ""You know what, I'm out. Have your fun.""."
Run with the Wind,"I don’t believe that there’s some grand conspiracy by the Jeopardy producers to keep pitting these two against each other. I feel safer assuming it’s something with contracts, angling for exposure with a different audience who knows who she is, or just trying to balance the production schedule in a different way. 

All that said, Ken is the far better host for the regular show. Mayim is adequate for the special events but not dynamic."
Run with the Wind,What is: Worst idea?
Run with the Wind,Has there ever been a more tone-deaf group of producers than the current ones in Jeopardy?
Run with the Wind,Boooo.
Run with the Wind,well - it's nice of them to let me know when not to watch at least.
Run with the Wind,"Bialek must know the public sentiment that she's not a good host, right?"
Run with the Wind,Can we just get Hugh Laurie to play House hosting jeopardy and call it a day?
Run with the Wind,"Ugh, I hate Mayim Bialik. Ever since that idiotic millenial advice video I just can't stand her. Especially because she ""apologized"" in such a lame way, like it was written entirely by her pr person. Fucking barf."
Run with the Wind,im sure they'll just scratch their collective heads when viewership goes down in May.
Run with the Wind,"Why do they insist on jerking Ken around?

imo Ken should tell them that unless he gets to host all the daily episodes, he's not coming back.  I'm guessing Sony would fucking love seeing their ratings go into the ground after that."
Run with the Wind,[Fuck ‘em.](https://youtu.be/WZnKJkgmvhI)
Run with the Wind,Absolute travesty that he doesn’t get the spot.
Run with the Wind,Jeopardy! is dead to me on April 28th.
Run with the Wind,"not a fan of Mayim as a host. I like her as a person but she doesn't have very good conversations with the contestants and a lot of her corrections/responses are awkward. Ken is natural, witty and comfortable"
Run with the Wind,"they have such a great recipe if they want it.

him for the regular jeopardy and her for celebrity and the one-off's, like the current kids tourney going on right now. the guy is just dialed in and mayim is perfect for the random ones especially the celebrity jeopardy.

i don't understand why this is such a difficult problem to solve."
Run with the Wind,why do they hate us? we want ken.
Run with the Wind,"Well, I'll be travelling for six weeks from June 10 to July 21, so I'll miss most of her run. 

My GF just got back from two weeks in Hawaii, and we watched the Teen show tonight together (I haven't been watching while she's away). In the middle of the first round, my GF says ""It is so annoying!"", and when I asked 'what?', she says ""that pause before she says it's correct."". I noticed it as well, and I've read other people's comments about it. 

Leave her the Celebrity Jeopardy and the kid tournaments; leave the real games to Ken."
Run with the Wind,They still haven’t settled on a host yet?
Run with the Wind,I’m sick of hearing about this. Please just pick someone and move on.
Run with the Wind,RIP Jeopardy
Run with the Wind,"Watching ""Jeopardy!"" commit suicide to placate the Mayim Biyalik contingent is beyond hilarious. LOL! Not exactly helping with ""bought & sold, completely and utterly out of touch Mainstream Media"" narrative either, is it? 

The dumbest move in TV history.    

What is not giving Jennings the job from day one, for $1000, Alex?

Correct!"
Run with the Wind,SNL should do a skit with this as a subject. Two hosts fighting over who presents.
Run with the Wind,The only reasonable reason for me would be if Ken doesn’t want to do it year round.
Run with the Wind,It's kind of insane that the producers did not have a contingency plan or another person in mind to permanently host in the event of Alex Trebek dying/leaving the show. It feels like they just thought he'd be on it forever and/or wanted to kick the can down the curb and deal with that problem when they got to it.
Run with the Wind,"Does Ken Jennings secretly eat babies or something, and the producers are afraid this will be discovered and they get canceled? I can't understand why they are so insistent on refusing to make the obvious choice."
Run with the Wind,"Ugh, that stinks. I don't think I've seen them finish an entire round (without running out of time) on any episode she's hosted. Her timing is terrible."
Run with the Wind,Then I will stop watching on April 31st.....*no wait?*
Run with the Wind,"I have a not-so-implausible theory that the show execs know exactly what they’re doing. To have Ken on full time would mean a slow fade back into the obscurity that Jeopardy! Was before Trebek got sick. 

But now they’ve got two people they bring on back and forth to stir endless controversy and gain sporadic attention. They will only have Jennings on full-time when this Schtick plays out and we become bored of seeing an ET! Article every few months recapping how much people hate Mayim and love Jennings which boost ratings temporarily."
Run with the Wind,"Damn, watching from Australia and Ken is brilliant. Mayim needs some help, she just can’t break away from sounding like a video game. A few times I’ve seen contestants have mini freak outs because she’s too slow after answers to affirm them or not."
Run with the Wind,The 2 second pause before she confirms or negates an answer is infuriating.  I cannot watch.
Run with the Wind,"Continuing to fuck up a slam dunk obvious decision has definitely put a stain on the continuing Jeopardy legacy. I don't think it's enough to destroy the show (I sure as hell hope not), but it's just a bad look all around. Ken is so much better than Mayim that I don't think it's much of a debate. Maybe they should let the two play Jeopardy and the winner gets permanent host. Ken could spot Mayim $15,000. That would sure make for interesting television."
Run with the Wind,Nooooooooooooo!!!! Ah dammit
Run with the Wind,"Train wreck is the right word, why won’t they consider what the people want? It’s a microcosm of what’s happening in society these days"
Run with the Wind,Fuck this headline again.  Tired of this story
Run with the Wind,Guess I’ll stop watching again.
Run with the Wind,Boooooo
Run with the Wind,"Bummer this teen tournament has been a snore and celeberty was bad too 

Ken's finally getting into the groove now too"
Run with the Wind,This is crazy. I legit loved Joe Buck- can he do her weeks?
Run with the Wind,"ugh, well I guess a summer break will do fine."
Run with the Wind,Oh for FUCKS sake
Run with the Wind,But WHY
Run with the Wind,What a fucking train wreck the show has become.  How could they fuck this up this bad.....
Run with the Wind,"What the hell? Is it an unpopular opinion that 
Bialik is a good host? I love her! I think she's doing a great job. I am excited to watch her back in the full time saddle this May!"
Run with the Wind,I just don’t watch any episodes that have Bialik hosting.
Run with the Wind,"Why TF has this gone on this long. Clearly, Jennings is the choice people want. Why drag this out for YEARS NOW. Cmon it’s a damn game show."
Henry Danger,"I""m guessing WandaVision will start rising up with all of the episode 4 and after reveals. Will be interesting to see how it compares to Falcon and the Winter Soldier which looks to have longer run time and feel more traditional Marvel. Especially as one ends and the other starts."

Henry Danger,💖💖💖💖💖💖
Henry Danger,😜😜😜😜😜😜
Henry Danger,🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇
Henry Danger,It looks like Netflix dominated the top 10 again. Cobra Kai is still in top 10 too. Getting Cobrai Kai was really smart decision for Netflix.
Henry Danger,A lot of people probably checked out of WandaVision after 1&2 were purely 50s/60s sitcom. I feel like the numbers should definitely increase with the following weeks as the story’s opened up and people have caught back up.
Henry Danger,"Most weekly shows have a bit of a dip after an episode or 2, wandavision is definitely still a success and I expect it's viewership will pick up after the whole season is out"
Henry Danger,Two weeks ago I said Netflix will dominate the Nielsen ranking forever by at least taking 6 or 7 spots and r/Television downvoted me..
Henry Danger,"And you'll be downvoted again because this isn't really evidence that Netflix will dominate the top of the list ""forever.""

The streaming wars are only just getting started. Until a month ago, the only major D+ show was The Mandalorian. Now it's getting several new MCU shows this year, and several Star Wars shows next. While HBO MAX isn't a major competitor yet, I think it would be a mistake to rule out the Game of Thrones prequels. And while we're at it, Amazon has been investing a lot in their upcoming Lord of the Rings series.

It won't happen quickly, but a few years from now, I do think other streaming services will become serious rivals. They won't dethrone Netflix any time soon, but Netflix may not always hold a monopoly on the most-watched content."
Henry Danger,Same old stories over and over again…
Henry Danger,"Of course it's on Starz. Oh, well. I'll wait for the season to be done and get the free trial or something."
Henry Danger,"Fwiw this does seem like a new way into a story about the Tudors (which admittedly has been done a lot), setting it right after Henry VIII’s death."
Henry Danger,"For all the rich history of Royals (British or otherwise), we get another Elizabeth show. Likely thrown together to make bank off the  jubilee."
Henry Danger,All you had to do was read a short synopsis before making an uninformed comment.
Henry Danger,This is about Elizabeth I. Not the current queen. Are there a lot of shows about the first Elizabeth?.
Henry Danger,Are there even a lot shows about the second Elizabeth?
Henry Danger,[Tons and tons and tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_Elizabeth_I)
Henry Danger,"Well, there is at least one current popular one"
Henry Danger,"By the way, anyone who is a fan of Warehouse 13 NEEDS to watch a miniseries called The Lost Room. It has the same premise as Warehouse 13 but imagine if the artifacts weren't contained but different groups had control of them and were vying for power."
Henry Danger,"I liked the show, but when they did the time travel/alt timeline thing it went a little more dramatic and just didn't click for me... other than that, I liked it."
Henry Danger,There's a scene I still remember to this day. Rarely have I laughed that hard from a movie or tv show. I don't remember the context but the sheriff got electrocuted or something going in to or leaving an elevator. Hilarious show overall!
Henry Danger,"Eureka. I watched the whole show but I have forgotten just about everything. Even reading your description nothing clicks about it in my brain. It was a fun but unmemorable show for me even back then. I used to watch it while doing some homework for class.

But Warehouse 13 was really good. I loved that show for a while."
Henry Danger,Eureka didn't know what exactly it wanted to be so it never embraced a style and stuck with it. The show really suffered for that as they picked up and dropped plots and characters constantly trying to find their footing.
Henry Danger,">Just finished Eureka and I LOVED IT!!! Here's my review

You buried the lead. [Jo Lupo](https://www.google.com/search?q=jo%20lupo%20eureka&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CAEQpwVqFwoTCJCQyIOO0vACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAC&biw=1690&bih=861)"
Henry Danger,I was rooting for Fargo and Claudia!
Henry Danger,"I just finished a rewatch myself. 

Tess was ruined because the actress got a leading job in another show IIRC.  But I definitely preferred her to Allison.

Larry was amazing!  I hated him at first, but the recurring donut gag was hilarious.

Parrish sucked, but honestly Wheaton kinda exuded charisma in that role which made him enjoyable."
Henry Danger,Yeah I think this show will always be one of my favorites to come back and watch. It's just so wholesome to watch.
Henry Danger,"If you like Eureka and Warehouse 13, try The Librarians."
Henry Danger,Ok what's the run time of each individual episode?
Henry Danger,"Hmmmm i don't recall that, he got electrocuted several others times, but I dont recall in an elevator. I know i should know EXACTLY what your talking about since I just finished it lol but I dont recall any electrocution in an elevator. Do you remember if anyone was with him?"
Henry Danger,It was the episode with the high school science fair. There was newly installed gravity plating in the floor.
Henry Danger,Picked up and dropped character constantly?? Umm I disagree on constantly
Henry Danger,Huh?
Henry Danger,Already did
Henry Danger,"It's 6 episodes 45 minutes each, so 4 1/2 hours total."
Henry Danger,"Hmm just saw this reply in my messages, but ok, I do remember that episode, but can't picture him being electrocuted.

Ohhhhh wait, I think I just found that scene on YouTube, if its the right scene it wasnt electrocution which is why I was confused."
Henry Danger,They're saying sexy lady sexy.
Henry Danger,How? How does burying the lead mean sexy?
Henry Danger,"burying the lead means did not put the most important thing first.  

They are saying Jo Lupo is the most important thing about the show."
Henry Danger,"Ohh ok I kind of figured that, but I never said the way the names were listed was in any particular order which is why i was confused why they said that."
Henry Danger,"Wait Margo Martindale, beloved character actress??"
Henry Danger,"Pros: Costumes. Disguises. Acting. Keri Russell. Character depth. Music.
Cons: Pastor Tim"
Henry Danger,"I agree with everything you said.

One thing I would add, is the subtle way elements of the 80s cultural zeitgeist are infused into the story without it being heavy handed: EST, David Copperfield and the Statue of Liberty, Mary Kay, Brooke Shields's famous ad, and lastly, the music. It acts almost as a kind of tonal grout holding all the tiles of the series together, culminating in last night's perfect use of Leonard Cohen.

I encourage everyone to watch this show. The first 3 seasons are currently on Amazon."
Henry Danger,"It is a very good show, and you are right it has been consistently that way. In your ratings though, I think some of their plotlines are a little dull. I would say it has been a solild 8-8.5 in all four of its seasons though. The acting from the main characters is extremely well done."
Henry Danger,"I completely agree. The only frustrating thing about this show is the lack of public following -- I always want to discuss its greatness with people! 

And fwiw, it's very rare to find American-made shows about the Soviet Union that do a good and accurate job with their portrayal. My family is from the SU and everyone loves it and approves. "
Henry Danger,"The Americans is one of my favorite shows of all time. It's up there wit h Breaking Bad and Lost for me. It's amazing. The tension is palpable especially this season.  Cold War politics are fascinating (to me) and although it took a while for my fiance to get on board with the show too, the characters are just SO GOOD "
Henry Danger,Greenwald is that you Baranski?
Henry Danger,"***SPOILERS***

I like the show a lot and it's one of the ones we watch every week without fail.  I think it's one of the best shows on TV right now at the moment, but that's probably as high as I'd go.

The show has a weird habit of writing in little side plots that last for one scene and are never mentioned again.  Paige and Henry escaping from a creepy guy they hitchhiked with, Henry breaking into the neighbors' house, and Matthew giving them beer while Stan wasn't home.  Oh, and the blonde girl Paige befriends on the train and exchanged contact info with and was never seen again.  None of those had anything to do with anything and were never mentioned again.  Maybe someone paying more attention can explain, but to me these are all seem to be blatant plot threads they just flat out dropped as quickly as they were introduced.

They also don't seem to know what to do with certain characters.  Nina basically had no purpose episode after episode until they killed her so they wouldn't have to write her anymore.  What exactly is Oleg's purpose at this point? (fyi I haven't seen the most recent episode yet)

Also, most of what's happened lately (at least the interesting bits) have hinged entirely on the incredibly dumb decision of letting Paige in on the secret.  That just always felt like an easy way to create more plot lines as opposed to staying the course and writing something that might've been a little more difficult but, in my opinion, more compelling.

I think the whole show from top to bottom is well above average, it's just not fantastic in any category in my opinion.  The recent couple of seasons have been good but I found the first two to be thrilling.  Lately it's simply been interesting to me to see what happens, but I'm not enthralled in any way.  

"
Henry Danger,"I miss Hannibal, but this show softens the blow.  Very high quality."
Henry Danger,"I can vouch for the accuracy of the mail robot shown in the FBI headquarters.  When I worked for ARCO, they had one at the research center in Plano, Texas.  I about jumped off the sofa and shouted when I saw it.  (we used to mess with it lol)"
Henry Danger,"I agree - however, I do think that it can be pretty slow at times. But that's okay considering that it's more a show about the people than it is about the action."
Henry Danger,"This show is unbelievably good. The acting is superb, the cultural references are not shoved down your throat. 

And the quality has been extremely consistent."
Henry Danger,"After last nights final ,Im somewhat convinced Dylan Baker is going to take home the Emmy for best guest actor "
Henry Danger,"thanks, this is the kind of discoveries I come to this sub for. gonna give this a shot"
Henry Danger,"I watched the first season or so and just found it so fucking slow. I know it's a suspense and such but it became boring to me.

"
Henry Danger,"Always catch myself thinking ""fuck the FBI, hope the Russian plan works out"". Know it's a good show when you unintentionally want your country to lose. "
Henry Danger,"I'm on the second season, going to marathon the 3 and 4 this weekend."
Henry Danger,"I'm really glad to see this post because I'm currently in the middle of my season two binge.  This show is consistently fantastic.  I haven't seen a ""meh"" episode so far, and I find myself saying ""just one more and then I'll go to bed"" a lot more than I should."
Henry Danger,I love *The Americans*!
Henry Danger,Not to mention that it isn't afraid to use subtitles and hires actors fluent in Russian for parts that heavily use the language. 
Henry Danger,"I love the Americans. In a lot of ways the pacing is similar to Rubicon. It's not all action action, but they have a way of wrapping up episodes that gives a little cliffhanger without being lazy about it. 

"
Henry Danger,"Aside from all the things said praising the show, what I love is that:

**All the side plots contribute to the main plot**. There is no ""Dana"" plot from *Homeland* that goes nowhere and just annoys you. Paige doesn't have a love interest at school who turns out to be a drunk or something and then she gets lost in the woods and attacked by a mountain lion. 

The side characters you meet are well-developed and they in-some-way contribute to the plot of the main characters - either by moving the main arc of the season along, or by contributing to character development of the main characters. 

Very few shows are able to accomplish this. Usually you get weird side plots that serve no purpose other than the fill space. *The Americans* does just a masterful job at weaving these plots along."
Henry Danger,"never heard about this till now..  
will try it out.."
Henry Danger,It's so slow though 
Henry Danger,It's one if the rare shows that gets *better* every season. Just finished the S4 finale and I have no idea what they're gonna do next season.
Henry Danger,"It's good, it's not quite Game of Thrones or Fargo which in my opinion are the top tier shows at the moment but it's there in the next tier with Mr Robot."
Henry Danger,"I really liked this show, but there is one thing that made me stop watching it. The relationship between the husband and wife.

At first it was an interesting dynamic. They were basically forced to live together and love was never a priority. Then they start to develop some feelings for each other, but they're not sure if the other would feel the same way. It also has a cool tie-in with their careers, where they can't truly know if the other is being honest with them. The dynamic seemed to be headed toward either getting closer or getting further apart. A little bit of back and forth on this is fine, but it felt like every single episode would just undo everything that happened before.

One person will start to love the other, but the other won't be ready to love them yet (or something). Then, when the other is ready to trust/love them, the first person will do something to sabotage the relationship. Repeat this over and over. It started to feel like they were creating drama for the sake of drama, and it got old fast.

I might try to revisit the series if someone can convince me it gets better."
Henry Danger,"Well I'll embrace for the inevitable downvotes because that is how /r/television works: like a popular show go up, have an opinion outside the hivemind go into the negative quickly.

But I felt it was just okay. I only made it half way through season 2 before I decided it wasn't for me, so this is about those episodes only.

It was pretty complacent with it's storylines, and enjoyed doing the ""spy mission of the week"" a lot. The relationship between the leads is painful at best. The way they intentionally made it so that whenever one was ready to dive in, the other one wasn't, is cliche tv. They literally just see-saw the relationship with who is ready and who is mad repeatedly to keep that tension people watch for.

I just was bored by the repetitive will they/ won't they, spying teenager, mission of the week, sudden plan change that feels so overdone in television. Quality acting from the stars and interesting premise wasn't enough to gloss over that for me.

I literally fell asleep the last episode, and had to rewatch. I then fell asleep again the next day at 6 pm trying to watch the next episode, and since have yet to rewatch it. It just wasn't worth it for me. In the end, it just bored me and was about as down the middle as you can get for a tv show."
Henry Danger,"I think the production is of a higher quality than you're giving it credit.  The editing, music, sets, and even the ridiculous wigs are all as good as any other show I've seen and there are some truly compelling shots in every episode.

It's the best show on TV."
Henry Danger,"If you like cold war 80s espionage also check out ""Deutschland 83"". Only one season so far and in German but also great. 
http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt4445154/"
Henry Danger,"Sadly there will never be another show to fill the void...and the whole in my heart. I lived and died on that island.

WE HAVE TO GO BACK!!!"
Henry Danger,Nope
Henry Danger,"I'll have to give it another try.  The first season started ok but pretty soon it got to a point where it seemed like they werent going anywhere with the plot.  They'd have an issue of if there relationship meant anything to them and they'd resolve it and fall back in love and the next event would happen and it would start all over with them questioning their relationship etc.
"
Henry Danger,"I started watching the first season, but it was way too focused on the relationship between the two characters than I wanted. Every episode was 'he banged someone for Mother Russia, and she was pissed' and then the next 'SHE banged someone, and HE was pissed' and back and forth, and finally 'HE banged someone not for a mission! Surprise! She's pissed again!'. I stopped after the 8th or 9th episode. "
Henry Danger,[deleted]
Henry Danger,"Gah, I might have to give this show a shot. I'm binging on [Orphan Black](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) now, but it won't be long until I need another show to fill that void."
Henry Danger,"This is one of my favorite shows. This and GoT are the only things I currently watch on TV. But, even I have to disagree about the acting being 'god level'. It isn't. It's great, but as I often say to a friend I am trying to encourage to watch this show, it's not on the same level as Breaking Bad or The Wire. It is a truly awesome show. But, it is missing something that would otherwise place it in the very top tier."
Henry Danger,">My favorite character on the show is definitely Paige

Each their own but goddamn she's the worst. Her plot is pretty annoying considering she caused a bunch of drama then does a 180 about it for no reason.

I've been a big fan of this show from the first few minutes of the pilot, but I have to admit I really disliked this most recent season. 

The acting and everything else on the show was great but the writing really dropped the ball IMO. They got rid of a couple characters but overall this season was total wash. You could skip it entirely and watch S5 right away without missing much. 

>The 'training' they received from the KBG have pretty much gave them PTSD

Not sure what you mean here but that's not what PTSD is..."
Henry Danger,"Well, you convinced me to check it out. Good Job"
Henry Danger,"> Production wise the show isn't at it's best.

I think the production is spot on. The premise, on the other hand, is rather unbelievable. ""Sleepers"" were not supposed to be active and even so, active agents were never so successful for so long.

The story outline is more of a former CIA agent's fantasy: diabolically smart Russians are the real reason behind the agency's failures."
Henry Danger,"for a throwback, try Smiley's People"
Henry Danger,"I'm noticing a lot of people saying they couldn't get into it after the first few episodes.  My favorite show to compare The Americans to is Mad Men.  And I'd say that season one of both shows is the hardest to get into.  But it just keeps getting better and better from there.  If you stick with it, you won't regret it."
Henry Danger,"Please explain, do you like this show?"
Henry Danger,"It's not quite at the very top of my best all-time list, but it is probably at the top of my best currently-on list.  I think it has taken a while to build to that.  When it started out, I found it very enjoyable for the mad-men-esque time period moments, with a tight but perhaps less enthralling story arc.  Each season, the story arc has gotten better and tighter and now it certainly is the main driving force behind the quality of the show.  That is very hard to do.  Very few shows in history have done it."
Henry Danger,Definitely my favourite TV drama on right now. 
Henry Danger,yeah favorite show since prison break 
Henry Danger,"Not to mention the violin score used in the show 10/10, Nathan Barr is a genius! Anyone know where can i buy the OST of the show? Not to mention [this track](https://youtu.be/r7QbWAPagzU) created for the show just for that assassination scene  Fucking Amazing!!"
Henry Danger,In a way this show gave us True Detective S3 with Stan and Oleg
Henry Danger,"I'm almost done with season three and having grown up in the eighties, this is spot on. I remember when Atari just came out and can relate to how Henry is so interested in Video games.  I could never understand why all of the Russians in the show (illegals and ones who work at the resident) are all dark complected with dark eyes. Russia wasn't invaded by Turks like Serbia and Greece and most of the ethnic Russians I've encountered have a very light complexion. Am I reading too much into this?"
Henry Danger,"Just finishing season one but so far I love it. From the comments here, it seems like you either love it or hate it. I was born in '69 so maybe that's why I like it so much. There are so many references from my youth."
Henry Danger,"I think it's funny they apparently didn't know what to do with the son, Matthew?(forget his name atm) Paiges brother, I mean, I love the show, and we do need to see Paige talking alone to her parents... But it seemed like we hadn't seen him in so long, he looked like a different actor when he was finally in a scene. They got lucky with Paige, younger kids always grow up too fast in these shows, but she seems to be aging more consistently than her brother.

As I said, huge fan of the show, I just thought it was kinda funny, but I realize there's not much they can really do."
Henry Danger,"I've wanted to try to watch this, I'm just not sure the subject would hold my interest."
Henry Danger,"Reasonably enjoyed the first season, but was bored to death by the 2nd. Any hope I'd enjoy the 3rd and 4th? The 2nd felt slower and got confusing with too many new characters and alliances."
Henry Danger,I agree with a lot of what you say.  As someone who grew up during the height of the cold war I love this show as it also reminds me a lot of my youth.
Henry Danger,"I have not seen the finale, so keep that in mind:

I think the Paige plot is second only to Martha as being one of the most annoying and unrealistic aspects of the show. There is NO reason Martha should have been kept alive. The fact that they risked everything because Philip is such a softie annoys me. The fact that their handlers sit and cluck over Philip and Elizabeth like mother hens instead of as their superior officers is also lame. 

I think Paige finding out was a great idea. But the fact that they allowed Pastor Dollar Bill and his wife live, especially after directly threatening them, has to be the dumbest decision ever. You know the old story, the best way two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead. But no, they let them live and continue to be a threat. Meanwhile, every five minutes Paige is whining about lying and the parents just let her get away with it. My favorite scene was when Elizabeth finally lost it on her and laid down the law, but sadly that was short lived. She is NOT a spy. She is not an adult. She isn't entitled to know all the details about what they're doing. I don't know why they won't say that. How can they have been effective spies all these years without having had the balls to stand up to their own annoying children is beyond me."
Henry Danger,"I got a little bored in the beginning of season 3 during some of the parts. I kind of felt like it was in a little bit of a holding pattern. But other parts of it ended up being interesting to me. For some reason I am really interested in Martha's story arc, her character ended up growing on me quite a bit, as well as agent Beaman's storyline. "
Henry Danger,"I'm currently in 2nd season, but it's really hard to get into. I always struggle at the begging of the season. "

Henry Danger,"I can't get over the fact that it's supposed to take place in DC, but is so obviously not in DC. That kills it for me. Otherwise, I agree that it's one of the best shows on TV.

The Loud House,If I’ve known anything about live action nick….this will not end well
The Loud House,">More Loud House is on the way at Nickelodeon. The network has ordered a new 10-episode live-action series based on the Emmy-winning animated show The Loud House, for premiere later this year on Paramount+. It was announced Thursday during Nickelodeon’s virtual upfront presentation.

>The network also renewed the original toon series for a seventh season.

>The series greenlight follows the success of the live-action movie, A Loud House Christmas, which drew 3.1 million total viewers in Live+same day when it premiered in November to become TV’s top kids’ entertainment telecast of 2021. Cast members from the movie will return to reprise their roles in the series.

>“As one of Nick’s most beloved animated franchises, The Loud House has made its way into the hearts of millions of fans across the globe,” said Shauna Phelan, Co-Head of Nickelodeon & Awesomeness Live-Action. “When we brought the animated world of Royal Woods to life with A Loud House Christmas, it instantly became a holiday favorite for both new and loyal fans alike, and I just know that they will love what our amazing creative team is preparing for this new live-action series.”

>The as-yet untitled series will follow Lincoln Loud, an 11 year-old boy with 10 sisters, as he navigates everyday life while living with such a large family. Known as the “Man with a Plan,” Lincoln enlists the help of his best friend Clyde McBride to tackle the obstacles and mayhem that they encounter during their daily adventures.

>The series will see the return of the beloved Loud family from A Loud House Christmas reprising their roles: Wolfgang Schaeffer, as Lincoln Loud; Jahzir Bruno, as Clyde McBride; Brian Stepanek, as Lynn Loud Sr.; Sophia Woodward, as Luna Loud; Catherine Ashmore Bradley, as Luan Loud; Aubin Bradley, as Lucy Loud; Ella Allan, as Lola Loud; Mia Allan, as Lana Loud; and Lexi Janicek, as Lisa Loud. Additional casting news will be announced at a later date."
The Loud House,"I don't really have any interest in actually watching this, but I am still sort of curious as to whether it'll be ""canon"" to the animated show or an AU. They could make it canon by saying it takes place *after* the animated show and then just never aging anybody up on the animated show."
The Loud House,The Loud House isn’t interesting anymore. It’s just become the new Spongebob.
The Loud House,"Live action, way to ruin a good cartoon, jesus"
The Loud House,Damn 3.1 million is pretty damn good these days.
The Loud House,"> Cast members from the movie will return to reprise their roles in the series.

Huh. So the guy who plays the dad will presumably be on both the animated and live-action shows at the same time."
The Loud House,They shouldn’t make it canon imo
The Loud House,One of the few cartoons my kids like that I enjoy. They'll be stoked to hear about this.
The Loud House,"This show started out strong and was at one point looking like the series to finally retire *Spongebob*, but it has steadily dropped in quality ever since.   Makes you really appreciate when shows can maintain their excellence for years and years without a hitch."
The Loud House,"In the loud house, in the loud house!!
1 boy 10 girls
Wouldn't trade it for the world!

As a parent I vote this cartoon 10/10. I make sure we never miss a new episode."
The Loud House,This cartoon is so bad idk why people like it
The Loud House,Bob’s Burgers is one of those shows!
The Loud House,The creator of the show turned out to be a diddler and got fired so that's a big thing that changed the show.
The Loud House,I have never seen it tbh. How does it compare to other animated sitcoms?
The Loud House,"I love the Simpsons with every fiber of my being but I had the startlingly revelation the other day that Bobs Burgers has managed to maintain a more consistent quality for longer than The Simpsons ever did. Bobs Burgers has never reached the highs of The Simpsons and has never been the cultural phenomenon The Simpsons was in the 90's but it's managed to keep a steady solid quality past when The Simpsons hit their ""zombie"" era. I'm rewatching The Simpsons now and I'm on season 10 and watching all of it in such a short condensed span of time you really see the style and tone of the show change a lot more clearly and it happens far quicker into it's run than I remember. I find myself saying ""Oh we're at THIS episode already?"" a lot lately."
The Loud House,Arguably no one has done it better than *South Park*.  *King of the Hill* was also excellent all the way through.
The Loud House,IIRC Chris Savino was busted for soliciting nude photos and sexually harassing staff.
The Loud House,"Personally, I rather enjoy it. Whenever I'm home alone or staying at someone's house for a housesitting gig (side-business I started when I was in middle school that's stuck), I'll usually watch it when it's on."
The Loud House,You're not missing anything. It's Nickelodeon's 2nd over played cartoon next to Sponge Bob. There was a cross over Legends of the Hidden Temple episode but its super rushed and not interesting.
The Loud House,"King of the Hill is great. I even enjoy the show that takes place in the same universe called Bless the Harts. It’s definitely more silly than KOTH, but they got heart."
The Loud House,"South Park has insane consistency.  In large part because of Matt and Trey's commitment *to each other*.  Also Trey is a creative behemoth with accolades on TV, film, and stage."
The Loud House,I’m a huge fan of Fox’s new animation domination block so compared to those it’s not good?
The Loud House,"Not really comparable.  This is a kids' show, with kid problems, kid jokes, and kid content.  I would argue *The Owl House*, *Infinity Train*, *Amphibia* are doing more interesting things in this space, and *Glitch Techs* scratches the nostalgia itch far better."
The Loud House,I love Owl House and Amphibia!
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,"It really is just what u/Siphillis said. It's basically a Nick live action series that sometimes has some zaniness to it, but for the most part it's kid problems and kid content.

Most episodes are Lincoln has an issue, he makes a choice, it causes a problem and he learns a lesson. Typically his sisters bail him out of whatever it is, or it centers on one of his sisters instead, but in most cases it's specifically geared towards that demographic. Like, Lincoln wants to be bunk mates with his friend, it doesn't work out, he schemes, learns a lesson, works out because change isn't bad."
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,"There are no twists in this show. It’s kids content for kids. They also have a sister show called the Casagrandes, it is also great. But the target audience would be kids 6 - 10. Adults like it because there isn’t anything overly annoying about it like most cartoons for kids."
The Loud House,"> as long as the twists are good

I'm not sure where you got twists from what I say. 

It's stuff like, kids have a vacation and they get their parents to take them somewhere new. Of the 11 kids, five take one side, five take another and the remaining one is undecided. Both sides try to win the vote in their favor, but it ends with the last vote realizing the original plan was best so some people aren't unhappy. 

It's things like that. I mean, it isn't a bad show, but it is like King of Queens for kids. It's something to have on but I wouldn't say it's something worth rushing out to see like Owl House."
The Loud House,"It’s also purely episodic.  There’s hardly any connective tissue between episodes, so the events in each episode are inconsequential."
The Loud House,"I don’t get why Viacom didn’t save these projects for Paramount+… You know, the service they own?"
The Loud House,"Viacom sold this to Netflix back in early 2019 before they merged with CBS, and Paramount+ was previously CBS All Access. Viacom didn't have a streaming service at the time."
The Loud House,"He was suspended yesterday and he was just officially fired.

Statement from Nickelodeon: 

> Chris Savino is no longer working with Nickelodeon. We take allegations of misconduct very seriously, and we are committed to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment that is free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct.
> 
> The Loud House, which is currently in its second season, will continue to air on Nickelodeon and be in production. Season three is scheduled to premiere in early 2018."
The Loud House,Anyone else enjoying The Great Pervert Culling of '17 for all the wrong reasons?
The Loud House,[removed]
The Loud House,"What will happen to the Loud House Now?
"
The Loud House,Damn I have no idea what's on Nick anymore
The Loud House,Dan Schneider is next...
The Loud House,"I hope he finds a nice, low-paying job somewhere where he can't be a creep to women. Car wash?"
The Loud House,"Why can somebody be fired for an allegation. Does allegation mean there is proof or are we at a point now where somebody just saying they were sexually harassed gets the accused an instant dismissal. 

In one of my first jobs a case of sexual misconduct was brought against a manager by a woman and her friend in the business. It was investigated and her story did not match up with camera footage. 

(She said he had groped her in a room when she was alone and the video footage showed him standing a considerable distance away from her in the same room and then her leaving. Her friend had also said that the same man had touched her inappropriately under the desk at a meeting she couldn't give a date for.  From the manager it was a dispute about her wanting an early pay check so it was ignored)

So in today's society from what I am led to believe if the accused was a public figure then they are dismissed without investigation. 

Now to clarify i know my story is anecdotal many women do experience sexual misconduct in the workplace stemming from inappropriate comments to touching and even further still. I have many more anecdotes of women being sexually harassed then I do of women falsely accusing. 


I'm not going to go in to details but I have my own issues that I personally have looked back on recently and have realised that in some of those cases my silence is a problem that allowed these women to be harassed by my senior colleagues. I have never knowingly been a participant of sexual harassment but due to my own fear, having only just started in a workplace, of fitting in and being able to work in comfort even if those around me were being harassed that is something that I have to live with and something that i am purposefully trying to change about myself going forward."
The Loud House,"Lol I guess that takes care of all the sexual predators at Nickelodeon. /s

Also I'm sorry but The Loud House is almost unwatchable."
The Loud House,Hope they cancel his shitty cartoon now
The Loud House,"Crazy. I wonder what goes through your head when you realize your career and life's work is essentially over, and on top of that it's because people found out you're just a terrible person. "
The Loud House,"Just curious, what are the wrong reasons?  "
The Loud House,[removed]
The Loud House,Theres absolutely zero evidence that he had ever done anything wrong. Not even an accusation
The Loud House,"Thank you for posting this. 

WE NEED THE RIGHT PERSON TO SEE THIS. THIS NEEDS ATTENTION. HE DESTROYS THE BRAINS OF CHILDREN, FORCES THEM TO TAKE DRUGS AT A YOUNG AGE.

This isn't a fucking joke, it's horrible. He destroyed Amanda Bynes, that poor woman. She doesn't deserve to be subjected to being... ""the example"". I hate bringing her up. She's more than that, she's a human being that this fucker molested
god i fucking hate this guy.  "
The Loud House,Nick and Cartoon Network have kept shows going after firing their creators. The rest of the writing staff is normally kept intact.
The Loud House,Season 3 is still happening next year.  No production has actually changed.
The Loud House,"Quality nose dives, goes into cancellation after 3 seasons."
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,It'll get cancelled hopefully
The Loud House,Dan Schneider has been a staple on Nick since I was a kid. I can't picture the network without him.
The Loud House,"Allegation (s). In the initial report it said that a double digit number of women came forward with accusations against Savino, and that led to a couple of others admitting that Savino has had that reputation within the industry for over a decade. And yet, it only came to a head last week."
The Loud House,"Multiple allegations for years

And i guarantee Nick executives have more info"
The Loud House,"They won't, people would cry sexism or the LBQTFDAlphabetSoup crowd would pitch a fit.

Now if it were about 1 girl (that looked foolish) in a house of a bunch of boys, in a traditional household without the homosexuality shoved down your throat it would have been canceled after the pilot
"
The Loud House,"Looks at screen name ""Ratchetbro"" draws easy conclusion."
The Loud House,"Gleeful, cackling schadenfreude at watching the accused burn. "
The Loud House,Hatred for the entertainment business.
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,"So she made a video for attention, and all she did was say vine a bunch

Yeah this is actually nothing"
The Loud House,I feel very icky now. 
The Loud House,"Do you have anything with actual proof or even real allegations?

As far as I can tell, no one's ever even accused this guy of anything. It's just a bunch of people in the internet who think he looks creepy and come to their own conclusions because of it. "
The Loud House,Do you have literally a single scrap of evidence
The Loud House,"It happened with Clarence, whose creator was also fired due to sexual harassment. "
The Loud House,Article says they will continue production.
The Loud House,"Why ""hopefully""?"
The Loud House,I somehow glanced over the number. Yeah i suppose when you have that many people coming forward it's a cut and dry case.
The Loud House,"...you mean literally the one episode where they show the girl is a lesbian for one second

Or the fact that there's a gay couple who is never once even mentioned to be out of the ordinary"
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,[deleted]
The Loud House,[removed]
The Loud House,I mean isn't that exactly how we got into the situation we are in with harvey we ignored it because nobody came forward.
The Loud House,"It was removed by the mods but they actually provided [this image](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1419/40/1419404871992.jpg) as ""evidence""."
The Loud House,"Yeah, that and it happened after he went off his meds. So, um, yeah, moral of the story is don't sexually assault people and don't go off your meds without consulting your doctor."
The Loud House,It's their most popular show. No way they'd just end it like that. 
The Loud House,Cause I hate it
The Loud House,"Hey its me, Robert Downey Jr on an unverified account, on a pathetically small blog

Dont be an idiot"
The Loud House,Its literally the pizza gate thing. They make some joke and a bunch of tards take it seriously
The Loud House,[removed]
The Loud House,"There's literally nothing coming out about Dan Schneider. It's *all* ""look how creepy this guy looks and he makes kid shows. He probably fucks kids lololol."""
The Loud House,The problem is Chris Savino directed almost every episode of The Loud House. Makes me wonder what will happen.
The Loud House,"Wanting something to cease existing just because you don't like it is pretty goddamn childish, dude. "
The Loud House,[removed]
The Loud House,"Hes just a fat guy who works with kids

Ive actually read hes a very sweet man "
The Loud House,This is bs. The allegations come from industry rumors and an internet Hollywood leaker. Whether or not they’re true is debatable but it’s not just “oh he’s creepy”
The Loud House,Maybe the ren and stimpy treatment
The Loud House,"well, maybe one of his assistants will do a good job?"
The Loud House,"It depends on how far along Season 3 was, before his firing. 

For the most part, it can be assumed, he'll still have had a hand in it. "
The Loud House,"It's... television. It doesn't matter. You're allowed to hope shows fail without consequence, because it is all meaningless anyway."
The Loud House,But there aren't any allegations from insiders. The closest thing is that blog that's likely just some high school kid posting whatever for attention. 
The Loud House,you think someone would go on the internet and tell lies
The Loud House,The allegations come from a 4chan trolls brain. Dunno why conspiracy theorists take 4chan posts as gospel. 
The Loud House,An adult reboot on Spike? 
The Loud House,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to... Ah never mind.

Of course it matters. These shows have millions of fans, and of course create hundreds of jobs. "
The Loud House,"Nah, I think we forget that people's livelihoods depend on these things. The show ends, a lot of people will be out of a job."
The Loud House,"No, I meant when John K (creator) got fired from the show after 2 seasons for multiple reasons. Afterwards people felt like the show went down in quality over the last 3 seasons. John K took care of every Ren and Stimpy before he got booted."
The Loud House,"So every show ever made should just go on forever, to keep people employed. Got it."
The Loud House,Same thing happens when a coal mine shuts down but no one on this site wants to keep those open.

Bard of Blood,"“De Barra’s past credits include working on Netflix and Marvel’s Iron Fist, which sets expectations relatively low, and Blood Origin still manages to limbo under them.”  Damn get them some aloe for that burn…"
Bard of Blood,Lonesome Dove demonstrates how awesome a 6 hour TV movie can be. Maybe execution and writing have a lot to do with it.
Bard of Blood,"That wasn’t really the main problem here. If it was a competently written 6 hour movie, people would have enjoyed it a crap ton more. There is an audience for long form cinematic experiences, but there isn’t much of an audience for shit writing. And what really sucks is that the people the show attracts (fans of the franchise) are exactly the people who will be the least happy with the writing, since the writers have made clear their disdain for the original writing and intent to do the stories completely differently."
Bard of Blood,"I’ve been saying this for a while. People kept asking for fewer episodes with tighter storylines, but I insisted that reducing the episode number would make no difference because you simply turn a dragged out 13 hour movie into a dragged out 9 hour movie. Fewer episodes certainly didn’t help The Defenders. Sandman avoided this usual Netflix mistake because Gaiman insisted that his stories be translated faithfully, so every story was as long as it needed to be, whether it be 5 episodes or 15 minutes."
Bard of Blood,"We also need to start questioning where these writers and showrunners come from.

It seems, the barriers to entering the industry are insanely hard, but somehow equally the industry is flooded with absolutely incompetent writers and showrunners. What exec signed off of on the iron fist showrunner being given a show like this?

Edit, sorry it wasn’t Scott bruck who worked on this but Declan de Barra, who helped write iron fist, a few episodes of the Witcher and was a producer on Iron Fist s2"
Bard of Blood,"If this doesn't ruin the chances of the writing team then there is no fixing Hollywood fantasy series 

These people shouldn't get anymore work anywhere reputable"
Bard of Blood,"This is an interesting observation. While the show clearly was missing fundamentals, the breakneck pacing of all but the first episode was a major problem. And damn, that line about De Barra’s prior credits was savage… Lauren Hissrich and her coterie will certainly have some ‘splaining to do when this franchise is done and dusted."
Bard of Blood,Witcher blood origin teaches us absolutely nothing other than that completely disrespecting source material should get you fired.
Bard of Blood,More like the dangers of letting incompetents ruin a good IP.
Bard of Blood,Well at least they subverted the trope that fantasy was supposed to be fun and entertaining.
Bard of Blood,"it also demonstrates that garbage showrunners shouldn't be given any work to begin with, especially big IPs that will not get a proper treatment for years because of their incompetence"
Bard of Blood,"The solution here is simple, Hollywood needs to stop hiring anyone who doesn't want to adapt the original source material faithfully to do adaptations of existing beloved IP.

If these writers were good enough to write their own Witcher -- they'd have already done it and they'd be busy working on that series instead of the Witcher. So don't let them fuck up a sure bet with their own low IQ 'fan' fiction.

If they don't want to adapt the source materially faithfully, don't hire them to work on an existing IP."
Bard of Blood,">De Barra’s past credits include working on Netflix and Marvel’s Iron Fist, which sets expectations relatively low, and Blood Origin still manages to limbo under them.

Savage!"
Bard of Blood,"This explains the disjointed story.
Episode 1-2 started a decent flow.  In ep 3 they try to explain character development as an off screen after thought. They're in love? She's escaped or overpowered a cabal to lead?  The sorcerer's left the dark side and reunited with adopted family?
Black's Books spontaneously comes to rescue? After like days? They ask way too much for the audience to accept.

The only portrayal with no flaws- Meldof. 10/10. Second place Brother Death. 3, scian"
Bard of Blood,The reason these kinds of shows keep failing is obvious. The writers hate the source material and write shit that directly contradicts established Lore. How hard is it to write within boundaries? If anything it's easier.
Bard of Blood,The Witcher demonstrates the danger of completely straying from source material and making Witcher’s not human and most importantly NOT HENRY CAVILL
Bard of Blood,"BWAHAHAHAH

More like it demonstrates the danger of having a show run by idiots.  I swear to god The Witcher was just such dogshit from start to finish. The had a great lead and heaps of cash and just blew it.

>  The Witcher: Blood Origin Demonstrates the Danger of Thinking of TV as a Six-Hour Movie

But there are so many shows that demonstrate how awesome that can be!

-  Stranger Things
-  Season 1 of Daredevil
-  Mare of Easttown
-  Season 1 of True Detective
-  The Wire
-  Band of Brothers
-  Chernobyl 

and on and on."
Bard of Blood,"Depends on the writing or the team behind it. I think the benchmark is Twin Peaks: The Return for looking at tv this way, and I only know it was achieved because David Lynch is a madman."
Bard of Blood,"Show writers have the biggest egos, they feel the need to insert their identity into an already well made story. This comment isn’t even geared towards The Witcher. RIP Quentin Coldwater"
Bard of Blood,"No it doesn't. 

What it demonstrates is hiring bad writers write bad material that causes shows to fail."
Bard of Blood,Are we sure it isn't the casual lore butchering in fantasy shows that is ruining them?
Bard of Blood,Netflix's old Marvel shows were the original poster children of this problem. Taking what should have been a 3-5 episode miniseries or a 2.5 hour film and turning it into a 8-12 episode slog.
Bard of Blood,I was looking forward to this show / story and now……. They fucking  rushed everything the CGI the story the writing everything they could of done so much better with more time instead they slapped this garbage out and messed it all up. No wonder why Henry left
Bard of Blood,"Blood Origin shows how horrible ""Made for a modern audience"" has become."
Bard of Blood,This is one of the worst shows I’ve ever seen
Bard of Blood,"We like tv, that’s why we watch it. We don’t like this because of how Netflix handled the Henry Cavil Witcher conflict. 


We don’t want showrunners “making something their own”. You literally have all the market research you could ever want in the bestselling game and book series. Make that, be gentle and subtle in the things you touch. Don’t wrestle creative control from the written work to tell your own shitty take because you don’t like the source material."
Bard of Blood,"So it’s no good then? I saw it pop up in my Netflix feed, and it started auto-playing…I immediately got the vibe that it looked very cheap and hokey."
Bard of Blood,"It demonstrates what happens when companies don't listen to what the fans actually want and they force their idea of making it a ""show for the modern audience"" (aka insertion of modern day identity politics where it doesn't belong) instead of following the source material or its most popular game version."
Bard of Blood,"The real issue here is the lack of respect for the source material leading to a complete collapse of the story, which will ultimately result in the death of the series (hardcore fans had already dropped out after season two, followed by most everyone else on the news of Henry Cavill's departure).

The Witcher series had amazing potential. Netflix chose to not only ignore the source material, they actively ridiculed it, and the fans. This dumpster fire is the sad but predictable result"
Bard of Blood,"fucking hollywood..... You made a new history (that makes no sense) for a well established universe, had terrible writing, bad story, mediocre acting, got rid of the star and then sit around and wonder why it failed.  

and your conclusion is that it failed because of the format."
Bard of Blood,"Nah, this poo-pile shows whats wrong with media these days.

&#x200B;

Through nepotism or just negligence, the people in charge hire shitty writers that don't want to adapt the source material. The writers see the title as just a ""Guaranteed fan-base"" for w/e story THEY want to make, so they use it to push w/e narratives they wish and feel like they're safe because they can slap ""The Award Winning GAME is now a SHOW"" on it.

&#x200B;

Sometimes changing the story can turn out good when you have respect for the source, like Da Boys. I read that comic, the show stays true to it in a number of ways but is completely different in most others ... I never thought they would be able to go for a 1:1 with a comic where one of the main protags hires a homeless guy to jack off each morning to leave a puddle of cum and blood at the door of another protag.   


Most of the time? Changing the story is just the writers trying to piggyback on the success of a different media's IP to get people to watch their pet project. Takes a lot of balls and convincing to make something completely new that stands on its own, much safer to change a few names and tell your story using established characters and worlds so that fans of that may watch YOUR story."
Bard of Blood,"No, long form movies for mini series is great. Having show runners you did not hire for thier talent is the problem."
Bard of Blood,I couldn’t get past episode one.. the acting is so bad
Bard of Blood,Witcher had such promise after season 1. Now it seems all but dead.
Bard of Blood,"The problem wasn’t the length, the problem was it sucked."
Bard of Blood,This is what Henry Cavill was warning us about!
Bard of Blood,"Oh yeahhhhh! THAT’S why this show flopped! 

Not because of horrible writing that tossed the source material in the garbage and piss-poor dialogue that made the characters obnoxious.

Gotcha."
Bard of Blood,That isn't even in the top 50 issues that this show has.
Bard of Blood,"Incorrect. Making it into 4 episodes of actual episodes wouldn't fix the god awful writing.

Also, remember

They made a witcher who barely controlled himself, then stopped controlling himself, then they had to kill him, and then decided to make many more of those"
Bard of Blood,At least it has a diverse cast of people who have been selected because of their talent.
Bard of Blood,"I'm really tired of genre tv being treated like this. It means that each episode has almost no arc to it at all, you don't feel satisfied or happy after watching an episode - you have to see the whole season to know what the fuck is going on....

I was so happy when Strange New Worlds was very much episodic and light-hearted. It felt like a breath of fresh air with only the minor stink of Akiva Goldsman"
Bard of Blood,No it shows the dangers of having writers that hate the source material and hate the fans
Bard of Blood,"Honestly, fuck Netflix for what they did to this franchise. Actually just fuck Netflix in general."
Bard of Blood,That’s a foolish takeaway.  It should demonstrate the value of hiring actual writers.
Bard of Blood,"Oh THAT'S the issue with it, right? Lol"
Bard of Blood,"While I agree with much of what’s says here, the writer doesn’t really understand the editing process."
Bard of Blood,I think that's the least of this show's problems
Bard of Blood,Also the dangers of going forward without Henry Cavill. James Gunn beware!
Bard of Blood,"Main problem is the terrible writing and production from the writers, production and showrunner.

It was so overly political correct with mediocre writing in almost every scene I wanted to vomit.

Why can't they just use the source material and follow the books and original witcher universe writer's intentions? Is it so fucking hard?"
Bard of Blood,It also didn’t help that the entire production writing and acting were total garbage
Bard of Blood,"Showrunners these days are completely delusional. Ive been saying it for years. Those greedy shareholders and executives are Dumb. As. Fucking. Rocks. 

They see the green revenue line go up and they literally could not give less of a fuck about the consumer."
Bard of Blood,Watching this honestly made me believe the writers either hate the source material or hate the fans. Or both.
Bard of Blood,"I binge watched the whole season 3 of *Daredevil*, all the whole 11 hours in front of a TV with only two bathroom breaks. There isn't a problem with making a show that feels like a long movie, there is a problem with making shows that have cohesion and good pacing."
Bard of Blood,"Do you think that these guys even care how terrible their shows are anymore? I genuinely believe theay don't give the slightest and the willingness to throw money around and lose it is really odd. Rings of Power had such an insane amount thrown into it, while having the least amount of care as to whether it would be any good or not. So many shows are having this paradigm shift into a complete cesspool of childish incompetence and they just follow up the flops with denial."
Bard of Blood,Lol yeah. That's it. That's the reason.
Bard of Blood,This was seriously their main takeaway from this trainwreck?!
Bard of Blood,It also demonstrates the danger of talking an already established lore and shitting all over it.
Bard of Blood,The writing are absolutely shit. I’m so glad Henry left these toxic people for Warhammer 40K series on Amazon.
Bard of Blood,I beg to differ. I think what it actually demonstrates is the danger of truly shit writing.
Bard of Blood,"I like The Witcher (I think it gets too much hate). I love and books and games and the show isn’t a great adaptation but I enjoy it for what it is

Blood Origin was absolutely terrible though"
Bard of Blood,"And what happens when you shit on the original lore for your shitty show. I don’t get how writers can take an already established IP and say “I’m gonna do this so dirty and wrong it’ll be unrecognizable. They’ll love it!” I mean ffs there aren’t supposed to be any elven witchers, yet the first Witcher here apparently was an elf. Witchers are sterile upon completing the trials, but in this apparently that’s a lie. Don’t even get me started on Eredin and Avallach. And the blatant (and cringey) attempt to try and connect the main Witcher show with this shit was pathetic. Add to that some of the CG looks choppy and the writing is just ass, and not the good kind"
Bard of Blood,"If everyone really thinks it was the length Of the show and not the writing, casting and direction, then look forward to more crap."
Bard of Blood,"Honestly, the lesser runtime is a blessing for the 12 people who watched it."
Bard of Blood,"No, it doesn’t. It’s just a bad show."
Bard of Blood,"Yeahhh... if only THIS was the problem of the show...

... and not the dozens other ones"
Bard of Blood,"It comes down to good writing.

The overrated Wednesday really should have been no more than 5 episodes but make the show about a ""mystery"" you can drag it out. 

In fact, turning shows into mysteries has become the standard to extend seasons.

Shows like Wednesday should be a sketch show or every episode self contained.

But this is Netflix formula these days"
Bard of Blood,It’s literally the most dangerous thing I’ve ever thunk
Bard of Blood,"The Witcher adaptation already sucked.  Bummer to see this is not great as well.

Hollywood always blows me away with how it hires non fans to adapt things.  I feel so bad for Cavill being so annoyed at this show’s creatives that he quit, dude was born to play geralt"
Bard of Blood,Loki seemed to do it well enough. Maybe get better writers
Bard of Blood,Meh I liked it.
Bard of Blood,"I’ve just started this show and I keep saying to myself “man ,  this kinda sucks “  does it get better guys or should I give up ?"
Bard of Blood,Also the danger of bad writing that seems to be mostly concerned with appealing to an audience that doesn’t watch fantasy rather than telling the damn story
Bard of Blood,Good writing takes time and Netflix is all about quantity over quality. So they hire writers who can churn out a screenplay in rapid pace no matter how shitty the script is.
Bard of Blood,"man people hate this show, I didnt think it was all that bad lol"
Bard of Blood,When are producers gonna stop giving the worst writers in Hollywood all of the fantasy IPs?
Bard of Blood,"A weak-ass story with weak-ass characters and weak-ass setup is going to deliver weak-ass entertainment, no matter the format.

I'm still wondering how that mage escaped the magic-proof cell - maybe that was part of the 2 hours that was cut and patched with horrible narration...???"
Bard of Blood,It was alright but kind of on the bad side of alright
Bard of Blood,"Bring back 20 minute shows. I’m sick af of the slow burn shows, they are boring as hell. And no boring ≠ artistic. I miss the old concise tvshow formats. These 1:30hr min shows just are such a drag on attention as well as time. I just want to chill . Not worry about if I’m going to waste my time giving another long format show a chance . Enough"
Bard of Blood,"I think what it really demonstrates is that if you want to bait and switch IPs, the built in audience for those IPs will not like it."
Bard of Blood,It seems to be that a lot of story lines that would make for a good two hour movie get stretched out into an 8 hour movie. The result is I lose interest and never make it to the end. But then I was never a soap opera fan.
Bard of Blood,"Oh, like, The Watcher??"
Bard of Blood,Yea I'm not sure that's the right take away for the disaster that blood origin is
Bard of Blood,The six hour thing is what you’re going with? Did you do ANY research at all? I don’t even watch the Witcher and even I know why it completely failed.
Bard of Blood,I am not proud but I watched this. There was exactly one scene that I enjoyed and it was mostly stuff taking place off screen. I am talking about the scene where we are introduced to the female dwarf and she climbs in a window and beats (kills?) everyone inside and walks out with a pipe she stole (I think) and lights it up. I actually laughed a little. The rest was pure shite.
Bard of Blood,Kenobi beat them to the punch
Bard of Blood,And there is me thinking it demonstrates the danger of thinking you are smarter than the author of the works you are screwing up royally.
Bard of Blood,I just binge-watched 1883. I was blown away. Superb acting and gripping storyline. And whoever wrote the script - especially the narration - deserves an award.
Bard of Blood,Or the problem is this show just fucking sucks.
Bard of Blood,"Not really into the Witcher but seen season 1 & 2 and a bit of the third game.  


This series however, while I liked it, it just felt like, wtf is going on lol"
Bard of Blood,"People confuse me. TV shows drag 6 episodes of story over 10-12 episodes and people bitch. Now they try to craft tighter stories and people bitch. 

There is no problem with creating a 6 hour movie. There is a problem creating a *shitty* 6 hour movie.

I would much rather show creators try to trim the fat and tell a sleek, compelling story then give me filler. ]"
Bard of Blood,"There needs to be a good balance between episode and serial storytelling, DS9 did this so well"
Bard of Blood,It also demonstrates the writer's poor ability to make a good show. But when you've already mocked the source material you can't really expect much anyway.
Bard of Blood,"If you put ""Demonstrates the Danger of"" in your article title, then someone needs to have died or been seriously injured. This is a bit hyperbolic."
Bard of Blood,"I don't understand why this show's budget was so low. Witcher was quite a popular in viewership rankings, they definitely didn't got Cavill for cheap. Meanwhile Blood Origin seems to be priced less than 2 episode of Flash. Yeoh is the only somewhat recognizable actor, the CGI is terrible, they clearly didn't have money to polish the shots, so much of design is all over the place. I struggle to find anything positive to say abiut this production."
Bard of Blood,I enjoyed the show. I really liked the Dwarf lady. I hope the actress does more work as she was really funny (plus a badass).
Bard of Blood,Bro who are all these Asians
Bard of Blood,No. It shows the danger of pumping your show full of intersectional feminist woke BS.
Bard of Blood,I felt this way about Andor and I loved that show.
Bard of Blood,"I don’t give two shits about the Witcher or this spin-off (tried out the first season or so of the Witcher - not my bag).

All that said - while the point this writer is making is a fair one this article just makes the same point 5 different times. I find “entertainment journalism” to be particularly guilty of this and its ironic that the author would make a key point of their critique the tendency of modern shows to stretch a one or two episode arc into a meandering multi-episode season."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,I've been rewatching some dragon ball Z lately and really thought the music was incredible. What a legend.
Dragons: Rescue Riders,"Time to gather the Dragon Balls boys

But seriously RIP, his music is so essential to the show and plays a huge role in the emotional investment we all have in the series"
Dragons: Rescue Riders,"Sad, I just rewatched dragonball and the music as usual stuck out to me.

Hugely inspiring and a source of constant magic in my childhood, RIP"
Dragons: Rescue Riders,"This man is a pioneer, thank you for what you did sir, and Rest In Peace."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,"What a sad day.  The man's work was as integral to the iconic works he was a part of as any of the story, characters, designs, or events.  

I can't help but go over an old post of mine fanboying over his work in r/dragonballfighterz a few years back.

____


1. [**Cha La Head Cha La**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno) - Off to an obvious start.  This song is as iconic to the series as Goku's spiky hair.  A sweeping, toe-tapping, adventurous song with a catchy chorus, impressive range and a sparkly 80's synth intro that got everyone excited and prepped for the world of talking pigs, capsule cars and blonde aliens.

2. [**We Gotta Power**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSOjj8Q_9b4) - Let's get this out of the way as well.  From it's illustrious and majestic intro to it's sharp turn into 80's synths and big choir choruses...we 'gotta' have it.  Also, I would have loved to have seen [We Gotta Power's prologue variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72ca3NfUkM) as the character select theme but I don't think that's too likely, sadly.  Ahhhh well.  (Also, for everyone wondering, here was [Cha La's prologue variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVYeJyZCwzE).)

3. Trunks' Themes : [**Break Point Unlimited**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMYt9sGOcTU) (DBZ was all horns sections and strings up to this point, so it was fitting for our futuristic hero to have something futuristic as well.  Well...90's futuristic, anyway), the *very* renowned [**Hikari no Willpower**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjllfs0QyEo) (which speaks for itself), and the hopeful and bright [**Aoi Kaze No Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z00VOo6kdKM) - I wish we could have them all.  Trunks' amazing themes were one of the reasons I loved him so much as a character, and I suspect many others did too.

4. [**Solid State Scouter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm77VCkf_do) - You may have seen this strange song mentioned here or there from ardent DBZ fans...and there's good reason for it.  Bardock's synthetic (practically Megaman X-esque) battle music is as catchy as it is 80's.  Which (given his son's 90's dominating series) is pretty fitting and clever. 

5. **Battle Tracks**: [**This one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu1UWdfX2xY&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=8) and [**this one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaG5XiiNuEM&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=1), specifically - Brilliant horn sections, dynamic arrangements and a flurry of strings that Kikuchi used to bring the battles to life and gave the world of dragon ball the charm and character it has.  Also, [**Chikyuu Marugoto Chou-Kessen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_AuzE2pgs), a track that is so inherit to the dna of the dragon ball soundscape that it has been in everything, from Dragon Ball to Z and all its sagas and even into the films.  Pure Kikuchi, through and through.

6. [**Piccolo's Theme**](https://youtu.be/C55vYFOEuwA?t=7m5s) - a suitably enigmatic, colourful theme for our favourite enigmatic, colourful alien.  Like Williams' score for Star Wars, Kikcuhi used leitmotifs to transform and stretch themes to suit many different situations and moods; that means one character's melody had many variations - from battle music, to heroic music to sad music.  Piccolo's theme had as much (if not more) variations than most character themes throughout the series and stood out every bit on the soundtrack as he did in the cast.

7. [**Vegeta's Theme**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2JPaSpi7Tg) - one of the most recognizable pieces of the series; regal, prideful and somewhat tragic, just like our tragic prince.  Vegeta's theme fits his character as perfectly as his trademark armour.  That said, it doesn't really make for great battle music.  For that, we turn to the fantastic and must-be-included [**Majin Vegeta Battle theme**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmsRJzUlk8&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=10); one of the best battle tracks in the franchise history.  I'd love for one to be the intro for the other; one starting the fight off and the other exploding as the fight takes off.

8. [**We Were Angels**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhnTCpa-Jo&index=7&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - though not as iconic as the series' [famously quirky end credits music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgvK17jGys0&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F&index=6), that one leaned more towards the series' roots in tone and zaniness whereas this track was much more inherit to DBZ and what the new soundtrack was becoming.  Big, bright and optimistic with a great '80's training' vibe to it.  And it had a [TON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ZRIFpMRvk) of [variations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmi-a1WU20s) that made it as central to the series as it's title theme counterpart.

9. **The Incredible Movie Songs**: [**Hero**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ZeOvfFm9s), [**Dragon Power Mugendai**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBcuHA3fWCo) and [**Kiseki No Big Fight**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthiRid8Mck&index=16&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - Fantastic vocal tracks by *Hironobu Kageyama*, who was nicknamed 'Mr. DBZ' since he not only sang most Dragon Ball Z songs but was the most recognizable voice in terms of the music.  I love all three of these tracks, though...let's be honest, they probably won't make the game.  Shame...but fingers crossed anyway :)

10. [**Ginyu Tokusentai**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezrbyf6t9mY) - the theme song for the ~~circus act~~, I mean ~~clown factory~~ ...I mean, *eccentric* few that is the Ginyu Squad; every bit as ridiculous and over-the-top as the crew themselves.  If this isn't in the game, we riot.  (And yes, the singer is doing that with his voice *on purpose*.)

11. [**Unmei no Hi: Tamashi tai Tamashi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGnL9Lk_4pk&index=21&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - Gohan's legendary SSJ2 theme from the Cell Saga ; I don't think it makes for great battle music but that doesn't mean it isn't a great song.  It made that moment feel as impactful and powerful as when his father first turned gold and glowy on Namek years earlier. (Also, I'm pretty sure if I didn't mention it, somebody would jump me in the street. Dbz fans are passionate about this song, to say the least...).

Finally, tracks that won't be in the game (I'm sure) but to help flesh out the feel and sound of the original series, here's a few honourable mentions.  [Goodbye, Son Goku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiGRRougbQ4) was the series' go-to sad music that sounded a bit Morricone-esque which is high praise as far as I'm concerned.  [The End of Buu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyzDkdWgQvc) is a majestic song that feels like just pure relief and apotheosis after a huge and grand battle...which is exactly how/where it was used.  And [Saikai!! Tenka-Ichi Budokai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg63tCkesqg) the bombastic and colourful music of the bombastic and colourful world tournament (listen for Piccolo's theme sneaking in!)

Oh and there's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj_9CizolQ4)...but...well, we don't talk about that.  ^^^^......shoopa-shoopie ^^^^shoopa-shoo...

Skylines,Is there a version of this with subtitles
Skylines,Looks good hopefully Netflix grabs it
Skylines,[deleted]
Skylines,All of Us are Dead meets Skyline?
Skylines,"Fuck me, I remember reading this manwha. It wasn't an action manwha, it was somber asf manwha with themes of teenage years being lost due to government duty.

It was just teenagers dealing with war and loss of their friends as manwha progressed."
Skylines,I imagine it'll get some.
Skylines,"Most TV shows can be described as this, wherever you are."
Skylines,[deleted]
Skylines,I would say the most well-watched and liked Korean shows are decent to high quality.
Skylines,I agree this season took a step back. The drone-machinegun thing was done horrifically. I was honestly thinking it as on-par until the final two episodes (This season was Eagle Strike btw)
Skylines,"I thought the reasoning behind the laptop was that Kyra hacked it somehow, though I could be wrong. Although if this is the case it doesn't make it much better. Her hacking skills are way too convenient and practically better then Smithers? Come on. Your right the drone scene was ridiculous and such an unnecessarily long scene. And yeah I don't know what they did with damian cray and Alan Blunt but both were not handled great. I have to admit other then that I loved this season. It might be because I'm a teenager so I wasn't paying much attention to the pacing and setting of the instead, instead enjoying the action. Plus, aside from Tom who annoys me a little bit I really love the characters and think otto farant is a perfect choice for Alex. 

And hey at least its not as bad as that 2006 stormbreaker movie. I don't remember much of it but I do remember I absolutely hated it."
Skylines,Why did they find the only English actors who can’t do American accents to play Pres Walker and the CIA lady.
Skylines,"
*SPOILERS FOR BOOKS***



Dude the book was so epic, like def my fav Alex Rider, like the video game fight was only the first time, and he does it again but it’s FOR REAL. I would have been awesome to see that. Plus it was would make more sense with Sabina because he meets her in the third book where there’s some story to that instead of the random gas explosion and where the whole 4th book starts. Idk, there was a lot that was missed for the whole season to make sense. If there’s is a third season, I would hope for it to be a bit darker and hope for more of Alex’s situations where he has to figure stuff like with gadgets and such"
Skylines,Didn't realise season 2 was out. I remember enjoying season 1 (except for some weird anticlimactic moments). I'll give S2 a go but this doesn't sound amazing.
Skylines,"I don't like drugs so I'm gonna nuke a few south American countries and need like 4 monologs to justify it....what a shit character. The Cray actor was my favorite though, great performance."
Skylines,"Could you explain something for me, OP or anyone else? You could spoiler tag just in case.  What was the reason behind the main villain’s actions? Like I’ve seen some pure idiotic reasoning when it comes to a bad guy’s plot but this was extreme.  I’m on 207 still attempting to figure out what the hell is the point of it all.

Not the worse season ever but Season 1 was clearly better."
Skylines,"The supposed spy organizations (MI6 & CIA) were thoroughly incompetent this season and were always steps behind while somehow maintaining their arrogance. And I don’t get why so many people said this season fixed its pacing issues, for me it was even more obvious.  
  
But my biggest issue with this season is that it lacks the edge-of-your-seat Adrenalin. For something this high stake, the whole season just felt flat. The characters also lacked emotional depth, especially when major revelations were happening."
Skylines,"I completely agree. I think there were some good moments - first 2 or 3 episodes were okay imo - but it went downhill from there. 

What ruined it for me the most was the suspension of disbelief & ridiculous plot armor this season. It took away the stakes and from the immersion. The most offending moments imo:

* >!Agreed - that drone machine gun. It was so ridiculous that none of them got shot or even injured in a completely open field with clear vision.!<
* >!Gregorovich - one of the most dangerous assassins - missing every single shot the entire time while chasing Alex even when he didn't know who it was. He's not a stormtrooper lol!<
* >!Alex cutting his \*plastic\* ziptie bonds with his \*fabric\* shoelaces... I mean seriously?!<

I also thought Otto's acting was subpar. He had two faces: wide eyed insane kid (justified, since that was what they were trying to portray) and ""I'm dead inside"" with no facial expressions whatsoever. I thought his season 1 performance was fine, or at least passable, so I don't think it's his acting. Wondering if they changed directors or something. 

As for character development - almost none, except maybe for Mrs Jones and Smithers. They had opportunity with Jack's new job, and spent so much time on it, but then...

>!... she loses that dream job and promo/position because of Alex, and they don't revisit the  emotional repercussions around that. They really should have fit this in, even if it was 30 seconds. So basically Jack became a way to move the plot forward, instead of it being a character dev moment between her and Alex. Huge missed opportunity.!<

I wanted to like this but it just felt sloppy and rushed, particularly the second half. I understand covid must've made this particularly difficult to get out in time, but it was so much worse than S1. If they renew for a third season, I hope they take their time to put out something higher quality, especially if it's around Scorpia."
Skylines,"I cant get over how terrible the acting is, first season I could deal with the woman who played Jack but they seem to be given her more unneeded screen time & her own boring scenes, I wouldn't care if the actor that plays her actually knew how to act, her delivery is always terrible, it feels stiff and emotionless not to mention the pacing at which she speaks is so weird and unnatural. Feels like they went to Gatwick Airport and grabbed the first American women they could find lol.  
 If they wanted to make the character black & were 100% set on that then there are FAR better choices of actors, either American or English that could actually bring depth and value to the character"
Skylines,"Oh no, I was looking forward to it. Not sure how to even set up IMDb TV and now thinking if it's going to be worth the effort!"
Skylines,Yep.. season 2 ..BORING!!
Skylines,I had a blast with season 2. Can't wait until season 3
Skylines,"Season 2 was a big let down. An MI6 special agency seemed out of depth.  Alex the teenager becoming super agent with his teenage friends. 

Kinda all over the place ."
Skylines,"I know it's an old thread, but I just finished S2 and I agree, it's not as good as the first one. I didn't like how we went from an organisation of smart competent adults using Alex to gain access to a place where only he could have gone, to adults who logically could have done without Alex's involvement being stupid in order for Alex and his Scooby-gang to save the day. I understand that this is a show for adolescents but adults being supid so that kids get to shine is a tired trope. The first season didn't fall into it but this one does and I didn't like it."
Skylines,"As a fan of the books, I watched the first season. I was disappointed at the deviations from the books (gadgets??) but accepted that some changes are inevitable when adapting books to screen. Over all I thought it was pretty bad but had future potential and at least they were starting to adapt the other books.


I’m a couple of episodes into season 2 and it’s awful so far. I’m wondering when the book is going to start being the source material… Anthony Horowitz books are always so interesting and engaging right from the start but nothing interesting has happened so far. I feel like the books would adapt so well to screen without the need for pointless changes and additions. 


Where are the gadgets? Why are Alan Blunt/Mrs Jones being made to look so incompetent? It just removes the mystery and top-secret power that surrounds them in the books. These are meant to be top tier MI5 management with unlimited sway and resources! They’re not meant to be doing field work and driving themselves casually round Bristol chatting where anyone can see/hear them. What happened to Alex being used as a spy without caring about the effect it has on him, which ultimately is absolutely KEY to his character development and eventual involvement with Scorpia? Why are they treating him like a human? Why oh why can’t we have a faithful adaptation?! D:"
Skylines,"I’ve not even finished the first episode and I’m disappointed. I assumed that a second season would revolve around the Skeleton Key plot, considering that it’s the following book after Point Blanc. I thought that skipping Stormbreaker was a good decision on the part of the creators, but I don’t see why they needed to pass over SK.

  
It’s been a while since I read the books, but there are various parts I’m sure came from other stories. The Cornwall part is definitely from Skeleton Key, and I believe Alex had already met Sabina at this point (who from what I recall, lived with both her parents, was called Sabina Pleasure - not ‘Pleasance’, her father was generally an agreeable man too). Tom was never present in Cornwall, nor Jack. I’m also pretty confident that Eagle Strike takes place in Southern France (at least the beginning does), which makes it all the more infuriating that Alex even suggests it as a holiday destination.

  
I know these are fairly minor gripes, but they still make me frustrated, especially because I don’t understand why.  Why the need to change Sabina’s surname (barely)? Was it in preparation for potential backlash due to the character being played by Charithra Chandran, a British-Indian actress. If that is the case, why give her practically the same name, and from what I’ve seen so far, the same characteristics? Why skip Skeleton Key? Are they just going to ignore all books with odd numbers? I can’t imagine skipping Scorpia will be a good decision."
Skylines,The drone killed me. Why was he strafing drone like a jet? It can just sit there and slowly move forward while shooting a steady stream. The amount of times he had to reposition due to his latest failed strafing run was disgusting. Just sit there and slowly move forward. That part really screamed teenage tv.
Skylines,"I'm a bit disappointed with the way the action scenes turned out. The Amsterdam bike chase is a great bit in the book. And I enjoyed the Air Force One bit, but it felt like they toned down the violence of the book and also didn't have the budget to go further with it."
Skylines,"I really missed Alex' out-of-the-box thinking. I felt that was completely missing throughout the season. He needed more alone time on screen. I like the fact that he has friends helping him, but I also wanted to see his genius, you know? He does not stand out against the rest of the characters and that's such a pity.

Also, the game could have been done so much better. 😭 I was so looking forward to it! The game in the book was so EPIC and I remember being on the edge of my seat. And then it was just a machine gun drone with zero aim? 😒 I kept waiting for the game to actually begin, but there was just nothing..."
Skylines,"Yeah in the books they make the gadgets such a big thing, getting them from smithers before the mission and how they help Alex, but in this show they really haven't done much at all. Would great to see more with the gadgets."
Skylines,"Yeah, that book was my favourite, too, ESPECIALLY the real-life game. I was really looking forward to it and to Alex figuring out how to get through it. It was so EPIC. I was quite disappointed with that."
Skylines,If there's a third season I hope its Snakehead. I think that could make for a really gritty season.
Skylines,"Alex Rider villains always have comically bad motivations. Maybe it's done on purpose but the books were the same way. The villains in those books are sometimes like: ""When I was a boy I once had a spinning top and I lost it in a rain gutter while my single mother worked 4 jobs to get me an education. Well, now that I'm a billionaire, I'm going to use my space station to terrorize entire nation-states."""
Skylines,Me too!! Every time she spoke something inside of me felt wrong.
Skylines,"We all loved season 2 over at r/AlexRider 

imdb tv is included with amazon prime"
Skylines,"Agreed. IMO they should’ve went for a plot where they pull Alex back in as an unwilling agent to do another undercover mission. The a big point of the first books was that Alex was a kid that no one would suspect and could do covert ops but in doing so the whole thing was morally questionable. Then as he continues, the missions have higher stakes and he becomes a bit more hardened and mature for his age. Now in S2 Alex just jumps in and gets his hands dirty like a big fun adventure where he gets to prove the adults wrong. Alex in S2 just felt off and from the events of S1, he and Jack should’ve been way more hesitant to get involved.

I think we needed a bit more backstory and character building before trying a season like this."
Skylines,"Having looked through this thread, it seems like elements of the Skeleton Key plot may exist. Still, I’d prefer a season focused on the third book entirely."
Skylines,"Lmao that’s right on the money with Season 2.  You’re a billionaire on top of the world and you want to do what? Had me making a dumbfounded every episode.  If a Season 3 happens, I’ll most likely watch though."
Skylines,"Thanks, I will be catching up over the Christmas break."
Skylines,"Assuming they're doing Scorpia next, I think next season should be really good. I remember that book being much more character driven than previous ones"
Skylines,I'm of the opinion that Scorpia blows all the other books out of the water.
Skylines,I’ve been loving all the European shows Netflix has been putting out. Money Heist has been good. Cocaine Coast I got really into. Dark was ace. Keep me coming. 
Skylines,Tribes of Europa and The Barbarians sound interesting. 
Skylines,"Babylon Berlin is my favorite German show, highly recommend it to anyone. I’m on Deutschland 83 right now and it is also quite good.  Excited for new seasons of both, and some of these new shows sound pretty damn cool."
Skylines,Das ist Goot
Skylines,'Dark' gave them a whole lot of faith in German TV i'm guessing. That was one of the best seasons of television I've ever seen. It's on the same tier as True Detective S1 in my book.
Skylines,Dark is excellent.  Will give Barbarians and Tribes of Europa a chance. 
Skylines,"Dang, still no [Space Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raumpatrouille_%E2%80%93_Die_phantastischen_Abenteuer_des_Raumschiffes_Orion) revival in sight. "
Skylines,Netflix needs more stuff in French!
Skylines,That's a lot of fake rain
Skylines,Tribes of Europa sounds pretty close to a lot scripts floating around these past few years. Glad to see one made it to production. 
Skylines,Are these shows only available on German Netflix or can anyone watch them? The Europa one sounds very interesting.
Skylines,"Maybe I should get into German TV, seems like there's lots of good stuff coming out of there."
Skylines,"I've been meaning to continue Hotel Beau Séjour - wife just wasn't enjoying as much as i was

cant wait for Dark s2 "
Skylines,Das good
Skylines,[deleted]
Skylines,If Tribes of Europa doesn't have a low iq tribe called Deus Vox that cosplay as knights in the post apocalypse and talk about physiognomy all day  I will be sorely disappointed 
Skylines,[deleted]
Skylines,"Call My Agent is fun, too! "
Skylines,Norsemen is really good too
Skylines,Yes to these.  Loved Babylon Berlin so much I’m reading the book. 
Skylines,"Babylon Berlin was surprisingly good. The third season just started production, so it's gonna be a while before we get to watch it (even longer if you're watching it on Netflix) "
Skylines,I am Goot
Skylines,Sehr gut
Skylines,"I'd still put season 1 True Detective as the best season of television ever, but Dark was damn good.  "
Skylines,"If you like French, the first episode of The Romanoffs on Amazon is fantastic.  "
Skylines,These would be available globally.
Skylines,"Unfortunately not. There is no money in German TV, so most of it is cheap junk with very few exceptions. The big internationals like Netflix and Amazon finally bring in some money to produce quality shows. And the few exceptions usually are recent reactions to the threat posed by Netflix / Amazon."
Skylines,"Start with 'Dark'... I will give you gold if you finish s1, come back, and tell me you didn't like it. It's about as can't-miss as any show on TV, not just German TV."
Skylines,German TV is shite.
Skylines,If that's the case I am all for it. The amount of great Norwegian and British offerings is fantastic. If additional shows are half as good as the Bridge and Dark I'm really excited to see more European offerings 
Skylines,Yeah I think they didn’t wanna step on house of cards or something. Stupid af 
Skylines,"> Call My Agent

not a netflix show. But yeah its really good!"
Skylines,"I just finished the book yesterday. I liked it, but i think the show is far superior. "
Skylines,"I'll check it out, thx."
Skylines,"> There is no money in German TV

In a way. But public tv has billions at its disposal, but mostly produces cheap crime tv trash for the eldery. Or even cheaper soaps."
Skylines,It says it’s a Netflix original show...? Maybe they just picked it up for the States 
Skylines,The best thing i can say about public tv in germany is that at least its not private tv in germany.
Skylines,"And by billions you mean 8,1 billion"
Skylines,"Yeah they label so many things as Netflix originals (especially foreign shows). Very misleading when they really only have distribution rights.

So in the case of Dix Pour Cent (call my agent) wiki says it's made my a French network (channel 4 or something)"
Skylines,Cody please stop spamming your fan fiction everywhere.  Especially when you angrily claim the stuff you say is supported by the show itself.
Skylines,"You sound a bit like a schizophrenic seeking patterns in things to the extreme. 

Either that or someone deeply procrastinating doing their work to finish the PhD in which case enjoy your ABD degree likely in 20 years."
Skylines,His name is Cody Holder and his family is very worried about him.
Skylines,"Nice, typical Reddit comment attempting to troll away from the main content of the post. Thanks for your ‘contribution’ (boring)."
Skylines,Really?
Skylines,"The fact that you don’t see how manic and schizophrenic this post and details reads is disturbing. And mental illness and math degrees do go hand in hand. Apparently even the WW sub has deleted your posts for going from fandom to obsessive.  You literally created a sub for this stuff where you are the only one posting many of these long essays. Really, you could have two PHDs with this level of effort on actual things."
Skylines,Yeah he revealed his name on Reddit which wasn’t very smart of him (and then confirmed it was his name which was even dumber).  He also admitted to not sleeping for literally days before writing that garbage manifesto of his.
Skylines,"Man, I’m sorry but I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already and I’m working with many people about it already. If your issue is concern for me, please, you don’t have to worry. I’m just highly enthusiastic about decoding this puzzle that was built for us, the audience. It’s like our own personal maze to navigate here. Along the way we get lost as we fall down the rabbit hole. At the end we find the real story and the tree of life, take from that what you will. 

The narrator of WestWorld is literally schizophrenic. Perhaps that’s what you are picking up on, the story itself is madness and it’s about descents into madness, at least part of it. 

Anyway, I’m here to discuss the details of the show and not my personal life."
Skylines,"He created multiple subs to post this nonsensical trash... AND he posts using THREE accounts at least.  And sometimes his accounts talk to and compliment each other.  It is truly a sad state of affairs.

As for the mania - here is the type of ""logic"" you get from him.  The show is set in 2058 on Earth.  Last season coordinates from an AI monitoring system occasionally would show up in the show.  So Cody here thinks hey, Google Maps in 2020 will give me clues about a fictional 2058.  That's already a leap.  But then what does he do?  He goes to the coordinates, then wanders around and around on Street View or Satellite view, and then is MILES off from the coordinates and comes up with a finding.  

But his findings are insanity:  

\- He saw a city bike rental kiosk (4 miles off from show coordinates) sponsored by Ford the car company and thought it was an amazing finding because a dude in the show is named Ford.  

\- He found a train musuem in Africa and a bus station in Indonesia and this lead him to conclude a company in the show has an OCEAN TRAIN that travels 50,000 miles through the ocean in 2058.

\- He zoomed out and saw a face in a field (more like a vaguely egg shaped silhouette) decided it was a specific character's face, then wondered if there was some conspiracy with HBO paying farmers to draw stuff in fields.  Because some random field looked like an oval / egg.

&#x200B;

Dude is NOT well at all and is completely delusional and in denial of his total lack of critical thinking skills."
Skylines,"I was the one who deleted my WestWorld posts. I was harassed there, doxxed and brigaded, it was viscous. To read the atlas post and associated material, people can find it all on r/WWElevatedScrutiny now.

Edit: I do see how schizophrenic this might appear, especially if you haven’t looked into the google maps coordinates of the divergences yet. It might seem like I’m picking out shapes in clouds here, basically, and inferring meaning from that. Ducking nuts!"
Skylines,">I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already

Oh yeah, ""nonsense"" sure thing there Mr. Ocean Train and I Can Hear the AI Talking To Me Inside The Music Of The Show Guy."
Skylines,"I get it now. I thought it was explaining what the “events” on the circle in the show meant regarding the happenings on the show. It seems the ring does seem perhaps to be a time line of the year of the show as he says. I just can’t see what he is saying about those “divergences”. 

The searching google maps is the part that indicates a bit of mania here, but that’s mostly just sad. I was hoping to figure out some cool story about the “parallel realities” that was hidden in the story. But it’s really not convincing other than some stairs that change color."
Skylines,"It’s more that it is a “hobby” that is obviously occupying you for more than the hours most people are awake. Putting off the dissertation work, it seems."
Skylines,"Cody, you spammed the board repeatedly, and used multiple accounts to do so.

People ""harassing"" you kept asking for evidence, kept asking you to explain yourself, and you got mad and would end up blocking people.

And you can't get Doxxed when you stupidly revealed your name to everyone and then rather than try to claim it was an alias admitted to everyone it was your name.  Like that's really really dumb dude.  But of course now you are claiming otherwise.  Your dishonesty is astounding."
Skylines,"Like I get it, there COULD be some clues, some meaning, in the AI Graphical Interface Circle in the show.  Fine.  But that's the last reasonable thing Cody argued and then went off the deep end.  

He thinks there is time travel in Season 3, people living entire lives as other characters, he thinks a phone app in the show is a physical place in the Middle East for some reason, he thinks one character in the show is actually Teddy when the show itself and the cast and showrunners have explicitly said otherwise publicly a hundred times.  He thinks the splatter on the floor from an injured robot is a secret map, he thinks an AI from the show is talking to him through the music of the show.

He's just a bundle of illogical nonsense and is quite obviously not thinking clearly."
Skylines,"It’s true that I’m putting off my dissertation work (I mention this in the introduction of my atlas post). Again, this is a personal detail and IMO (not yours) its irrelevant to the current state of the project. The questioning of mental health and motivations was an early phase of the project that I’ve now moved past. If one aims to discredit the project, I suppose taking a personal angle on why I’m pursuing this hobby makes sense. It might make more sense though, in my view, to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory. One could start with the premise that the coordinates provided in the show are relevant to the story, and go from there. Perhaps one would take an entirely different path than I have. Anyway,   Hopefully my hobby doesn’t interfere too much with your Reddit experience."
Skylines,"Don’t get me wrong. I’m with you. I’m just here cause WW.  I actually though when watching it that some of the androids were brought back in different bodies.  I am kinda slow in that show though, so I guess I was wrong in that."
Skylines,">to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory.

The show is set on Earth, the coordinates in the show are from the fictional 2058 year Earth the show is set in.  Boom, a bazillion times more compelling than your horseshit."
Skylines,A LOT of people thought that was a possibility at first.  But then the show revealed what occurred.  And everyone but Cody accepts the show (and show runner and cast interviews).  He apparently knows better than everyone who made the show smh.
Skylines,"What is this like as a show? Watching Hustle at the mo. Warren has just left, and he was the best part of that, so I need another fix"
The Politician,"Ok, I'll give it a shot."
The Politician,It's very good. There's great energy between the two sister leads and writing is witty and original. This is not a CW-style clone; it's actually good.
The Politician,"I loved this, finished it last night and I'm hoping that it gets a season 2, it was so much better then the title led me to expect it would be."
The Politician,"I started watching this because it showed up on Netflix reccommentions, and it was the at once brilliantly stupid and hilarious.  I binged watched the whole thing, it was fantastic.  I'm sick of all the dark and gritty shit, this was the perfect funny shit to watch.  I completely identified with their old boss guy."
The Politician,I was definitely a fan of this show. I’m not super hopeful of a renewal though as it does not seem very popular here in the UK where it has struggled to make an impact on Netflix’s top 10 charts.
The Politician,"Show is absolutely great, super witty and fun and more people need to watch it."
The Politician,"I put this show on simply because I was tired of the endless Netflix scroll, and I really enjoyed it. The title and trailer are terrible, but the show is surprisingly well written and hilarious in how simply dumb it is at times. It is satirizing a lot more then just private high schools."
The Politician,I-I like the politician.
The Politician,"I love The Politician, hilarious show"
The Politician,The title and poster gave off a very Disney channel vibe and it is not that kind of show at all. Glad we gave it a shot and ended up finishing in a couple days. Unfortunately the subpar Netflix marketing might mean it doesn’t get another season. Hopefully quarantine means more people give it a chance.
The Politician,"this was such a delight, I'm hoping with good word of mouth this show finds an audience; being that it's being produced by the people behind Orange Is The New Black and Glow I'm positive they must have some pull over at Netflix for this not just axed"
The Politician,"The subversive nature of this show is a delight. The two mains have incredible chemistry, playing best-friend sisters one moment and I-hate-you sisters the next. I loved every minute and was sad when the season ended."
The Politician,"Binged it all in one day, outstanding show. It's funny, writing doesn't force anything, every character is pretty great. One of my favorite shows in a minute."
The Politician,I liked The Politician.  Would I like this?
The Politician,"I want to watch it, but instead we watched Drunk Parents.  One of the dumbest and most unorganized movies ever."
The Politician,The politician is a really really good series. Wym?
The Politician,Gotta disagree. This is watchable but not in the league of Buffy or Veronica Mars. Very few of the characters seem fully realized.
The Politician,"What? I would definitely not have predicted that it's actually good.

Edit: I can see how it's a good show, not really clicking with me, though."
The Politician,"I'm not quite done, but liking this quite a bit. There's a development around episode 6 that left me perplexed, because [spoiler](#s ""the girl touched her arm and that instantly flipped a switch from 'i don't like this girl and i'm straight and i'm not into masturbating' to 'i love this girl and i'm gay or whatever and i need to masturbate right now'? that comes off as fanfiction bullshit to me"")"
The Politician,"""Except good.""  So a downgrade?"
The Politician,As the cities collapse into crime and anarchy private schools are the only place normal families can send their kids for an education
The Politician,"It's a lot better than I thought it would be. The teenage relationship stuff is a little campy, but I just skip over those parts."
The Politician,"The title does not inspire confidence, but the actors and writing really pay off.  The twin sisters have great chemistry, and their boss, Bowser interacts with them in kind of a charming way.  

The show is a little like Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.  You think the premise is outlandish, but you like the characters, so you stick with it.  I hope the show sticks around a while."
The Politician,"This was a helpful review.  I don't want to see dark and gritty and most r/television posts that something is ""good"" really means ""dark""."
The Politician,"It is strange that Netflix does not promote this show, though it is a well written show with relatively low budget.I think they might have planned to cancel this even before the release,But, may be due to a good word of mouth, it is now consistently on top 10 in many countries ,and continuous 3rd position in US only behind Korra and The Umbrella academy. So,there is still a chance of renewal."
The Politician,I don't think the trailer was great; I remember being rather unimpressed by it. The show itself was fantastic though.
The Politician,I'll be a little bit heartbroken if it's not renewed. The funniest Netflix show since the first season of American Vandal.
The Politician,"I like this show and The Politician. They're both pretty good, idk what this dude is on about."
The Politician,I loved Ben Platt's singing too.
The Politician,"It's apparently expected to get another season but not confirmed for sure. At the very least though, I would expect at least one more season."
The Politician,"this is far less outlandish, but honestly I found it's satire better than The Politician, it was bit more layered while The Politician is very smug about everything and very in your face and tonally its much campier, this is one tonally is more just quirky while staying somewhat 'grounded' despite the premise. I really don't see why this reviewer compared the two because honestly they couldn't be two more different shows, but just give it a shot, I enjoyed both."
The Politician,I liked the politician but not this show so to each their own.
The Politician,"> [spoiler](#s ""So I don't know if that's plausible or whatever even taking this into account.  But to be fair, she was kindof in the midst of some (by her standards) pretty intense sexual discovery.  I mean she had already made out with like 3 random dudes at the event, which is super out of character for her.  I don't know if that excuses it, but maybe it at least mitigates it some."")"
The Politician,Those are actually some of the best parts. Every time they start talking about kissing in front of the adult in the car I giggled so much and I'm a 30 yo male
The Politician,"Same.

I know i'll get flak for this, but i also had to stop and give it a break after a couple episodes because the dialog gets too fast and exhausting to process."
The Politician,"> The show is a little like Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.

I was just describing this show the other day as being kind of like dropping an early season Buffy Summers into the setting of *Veronica Mars*."
The Politician,"I’m pretty sure I only knew about this show a week in advance of its release when it popped up in the coming soon section. That prompted me to google it to see what it was about and when it sounded like it could be a fun show I stuck it in my watch list. I feel like that is the only reason it popped up on my feed on release day as it definitely does not seem to be getting a lot of hype on Netflix itself. 

I’m relieved to hear Teenage Bounty Hunters is faring better in other countries than it is in the UK! Gives me hope we might see a second season. I hope so as this is definitely one of the better new Netflix Originals I’ve watched this year. I was fearful though as the last show I seen making this little impact on the UK top 10 chart was Spinning Out and that got cancelled before I even had the chance to watch it!"
The Politician,Netflix struggles to promote movies they spend millions on
The Politician,"That is so interesting! I must admit that I never ever tried the trailer. I just read a wiki synopsis and thought it sounded like it could be fun so gave it a go. I was a little unsure about it in the first 10-15 minutes but was quickly sucked into the story and soon found myself rooting for the two leads. 

I just watched the trailer right now and it was definitely a bit full on in terms of the craziness. I’m not sure how I’d have felt about it had I not already seen the show. I can definitely see it scaring away a few potential viewers."
The Politician,Is the story closed?
The Politician,Thanks!  I'll give it 2-3 episodes and see if I like.
The Politician,"Those parts are fine. But the actual kissing, dating, etc. I skip those."
The Politician,"Actually we cant predict netflix algorithm, but I think Spinning out never reached even Top 5 in US.Also, must be higher budget due to already known actors and production value.In contrast, TBH has only one trailer with literally no promotion even in youtube and social media. But they at least achieved Top 3 in US and some countries, so there is still a slim chance."
The Politician,It could have been worse; it was originally named 'Slutty Teenage Bounty Hunters' which would have fully put me off ever giving it a chance!
The Politician,Massive cliffhanger :(
The Politician,That would have been so awful lol! I’d definitely have been tempted to skip the show had that been the name so I guess the marketing department did some good even if they do not seem to have managed to drum up much hype for the show.
The Politician,"Okay, so I've finished this entire show.

It's a very unique very weird show with a hard to describe tone that's well maintained.

It's one quarter tongue in cheek, one quarter drama, one quarter comedy and one quarter artsy thing and it mostly succeeds.

It kiiiiinda went off the rails at the end of the first season but righted itself at the last second.

The characters and their portrayal are bizarre, and much of the show is bizarre with a very unique style that takes odd choices that sort of start to fail in the third quarter.

Over all I enjoyed it, it brought out emotions for me that are not common from television these days, it made me laugh a bit, and I never knew where it was going.

This is a unique show, with a unique style and I think it's pretty great, it rides a razor thin line of absurdity that it's keenly aware of but also oversteps a few times.


The closest thing I can describe to it is a wess anderson movie. But not as over the top and not as consistant and unique in its own way.


I hope they make another season."
The Politician,"I feel like I'm watching a different show than most of the people in these comments. I just watched the first two episodes and I'm in love with what this show is putting out there. It's a pretty good satire. The performances are great. And it has America's Sweetheart, Bob Balaban, in it. I usually hate when people say ""You just don't get it,"" but I think that's very much the case here. Especially since so many of the comments are complaining about how over-the-top it is...when that seems to be the point."
The Politician,"This has to be the worst case of 30 year old actors playing high schoolers ever. They all look so old, especially the main character. 

I'm liking it enough. Like a lot of Ryan Murphy's shows, though, no one seems like an actual human being."
The Politician,Jesus fucking Christ Ben Platt can sing.
The Politician,The best thing about the show is Jessica Lange. Loving her over the top performance! I've been missing her since she left AHS
The Politician,Maybe he comes back but did anyone else really like the actor who played River? He seemed both charismatic and slightly Hayden Christensen-y.
The Politician,"Something I don't get. They're clearly in their senior year. Already getting their admissions to college.

So why is there an election for class president? That should have taken place the year before. Not near the end of their senior year. That doesn't even make sense."
The Politician,"Somebody please help me out: At the end of the first episode when Payton breaks down, does he ACTUALLY break down or is he pretending? I feel like he is pretending but the show is playing it so straight so idk. Someone please give me their take. Seems manipulative and fake to me but I just can't tell from the acting if it's serious or not."
The Politician,"I have liked a few of Murphy's shows and always enjoyed Jessica Lange's performances in them. While this is definitely not on the level of Feud (probably Murphy's best show),  I still thought it wasn't that bad of a first episode. It was a bit clunky and the pacing was off, but Ben Platt's performance, the visuals and the music elevated the experience."
The Politician,"I’m going to watch anything with Ben Platt. With that said, the premiere is a little rough. Are these guys supposed to be seniors or juniors? Cause at what point are students getting admission letters but not have elected a student body president.

I like that it’s not explicit about which ‘political party’ each are defending since they pull from both sides. I like the commentary on pretending and authenticity and am interested how it plays out through the lens of entitled rich kids. 

I really like the River character and hope he’s still in the rest of the series."
The Politician,[deleted]
The Politician,This show has the very Ryan Murphy problem of having very unlikable leads and not giving the audience any reason to root for them. This show really suffers for it as its not a straight comedy so you have to be invested in the drama.
The Politician,"I actually like Payton. A lot. And I also hate him. A lot. He's a self-serving narcissist with sociopathic tendencies but he worries himself to death over that very thought - so is he really a monster? I think his mother hits the nail on the head when she says something along the lines of ""does it really matter, if you can't tell the difference?"" with respect to his inability to discern real emotion from faking it. He is cold and ruthless at times, and he does some terrible things as a result of his ambition, but those things are punctuated by truly tender and loving relationships with River, with his mom, with his friends...he's imperfect to be sure, but there is humanity in there and that human is in a lot of pain. I want to reach through the screen and slap the shit out of him and then hug him and tell him he's going to be ok."
The Politician,"I finished the first episode and I enjoyed it. The pacing could be better (as much as I love Ben Platt’s voice, we didn’t need a whole song), but the performances are good and the writing isn’t bad.  I don’t think it’ll be anything groundbreaking, but it’ll be an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. I’m interested to see where the story goes from here."
The Politician,This is great so far. Have watched the first 4 episodes. The teenagers don't like look like teenagers at all. But the drama and comedy is balanced out very well.
The Politician,"Watched it over the week. Loved it, can't wait for season 2..."
The Politician,"I am only 10min in and I am already pissed off. The main guy looks 30, not 17 and so does River. Why couldn't this be set in college or something?"
The Politician,I feel like this is Ryan Murphy’s Strange imitation of Wes Anderson’s Rushmore with some random wokeness for comedy.  I don’t really like it so far... but it’s interesting in its derivative weirdness.... so I’m still watching...
The Politician,This show hits the area I like when it comes to edgy humor. It jokes about some tougher issues without crossing the line or making it seem like the issues themselves are jokes.
The Politician,"The satire is good but it does push too far and the internal logic is inconsistent. I tend to avoid Ryan Murphy shows for their lack of grounding, but I'm glad I didn't do my research beforehand or I might not have watched this one. Definitely a mess, but I enjoy it."
The Politician,"It's a Ryan Murphy show. It looks pretty and it has very little to say. But damn it hits you over the head with what it does want to get across. Having Payton drive Dustin Hoffman's car from The Graduate was a little too on the nose.

I can see why actors love working with him, he lets them go nuts. Don't think I'll stick around for the whole season."
The Politician,"Is it just me or did the overall plot seem super rushed? 

[For example](#s ""The time jump at the end of the season felt like something that should have happened a few seasons from now. Like, all of a sudden the main character has a drinking problem and lives in NYC. What?"")"
The Politician,"Platt’s stage presence translated really well to the screen

Excited for what he does next."
The Politician,It's not good. Was a chore to watch it so I'm going to take a pass at the rest of the season.
The Politician,"I'll try a few more but I thought the first episode was quite dark and slow. A lot of it was really quite grim. Which is the opposite of what I was expecting. There were a few sort of humorous moments but overall it felt a bit flat and none of the characters really stood out to me.

Edit: Ok, I got through three episodes. It's just really, really flat. It's slow and boring and there's barely any humour. I was expecting a lot of politically incorrect jokes and some sharp dialogue but there is none of that. It doesn't really lean into high school drama, politics or comedy. Nothing memorable has happened since halfway through the first episode. All of the characters are just so bland. For example, the lead has absolutely no charisma but he's also not some cutthroat genius either so he's neither likeable or interesting. Has to be one of the least memorable shows I've ever watched."
The Politician,"as someone with an irrational hatred for Ben platt, I was annoyed at how much I enjoyed the first episode lol"
The Politician,"The theme song is ""Chicago"" . Does the show even take place in Chicago???"
The Politician,"The show started off strong but ended on a mixed bag for me, due to mostly the super unlikable lead. I actually don't mind the over the top, highly stylized setting and story. I feel it carries the satire well and it works, for the most part. HOWEVER!!! You can only throw so much bullshit before even that nice view gets tarnished. For starters Payton is a jackass and unlikable. I thought for a moment that his narcissistic tendencies would be remedied but this never happens and instead they allow him to rail over actually likable characters. He never actually learns from River's death and makes all that melodrama absolutely worthless.  Hell, I even liked that crazy Nana more than him and she was the worst human being ever. Payton literally ruins his exes life at the end and he is best friends with his attempted murderer?! Also that NY senator is badass and hella chill why and how am I going to see her as a villain and why would I want her to go down? That crew was more likable in one episode than the gaggle of tweenie boppers we followed all season I just oof-  


Eesh idk guys. I dig what Murphy puts down often and this show was mostly great ( episodes 1 - 6), but I hope they rework what is going on at the end because thus far I am not vibing with the characters much anymore and it undermines the tongue-in-cheek fun that was the first half of the series."
The Politician,"Really bad, it felt like it was politics for 15yo girls. Rythm is so slow."
The Politician,"This show is just bad. As a shameless fan of Glee, I found The Politician to be awfully like the later seasons of Glee, too many plot points, too little time for us to actually care about. If the events occurred in maybe 2-3 seasons, we would actually connect to the characters and maybe feel something? I did watch the entire season only hoping for it to be revealed as a crackhead's dream tbh  


Also it is like 20% funny and 80% trying to be cringe-funny which helps no one I guess"
The Politician,"Loved it. Very entertaining. Great performances by all. Ben Platt is a star. 

Can't wait for S2! It is brilliantly set up."
The Politician,I absolutely hated this show. Completely soulless and sterile.
The Politician,Any skippable episodes?
The Politician,"Watched 30 mins of the pilot with my wife, and that’s all we could stomach, we just had to turn it off. The “kids” are in their 20s, why would they get adults to play high schoolers? Is this supposed to be a comedy? This show is very disjointed and the characters are weird. 

The main character is disgusting. When he started looking for someone with a disability to join his campaign, was that supposed to be funny? When he started talking to the girl with cancer, that’s when we bailed on this show."
The Politician,Is this the show with Gus Kenworthy?
The Politician,"So it's basically Beto(/Abrams) vs Buttigeig(/Gillibrand) but in high school. I couldn't make it through the episode, it's too much bland Murphy obnoxiousness and I can't bring myself to care about these rich mofos."
The Politician,"you described it sooo well, it's amazing. 

I never expected to like it, but it was a unique and interesting viewing experience.

Ben Platt really is fantastic, his voice is gorgeous."
The Politician,I think they are already renewed for a second one.
The Politician,Wow that's a great description and I got all of those vibes while watching the trailer. I'll have to check it out now!
The Politician,"This is a truly great description of the show. It felt like a mix between glee and scream queens overall, the former that I was never interested in and the latter that I loved."
The Politician,"> The characters and their portrayal are bizarre, and much of the show is bizarre with a very unique style that takes odd choices that sort of start to fail in the third quarter.

I think its comparable to movies like ""Election"" or ""Art School confidential"", or the TV Show ""braindead"", just a bit more over the top. though it is not as good as even the latter, I think its worth a watch alone for the great actors and political jabs."
The Politician,"I'm on the third episode and I absolutely agree. Its over the top, bizarre and I think it works to its advantage. I get people have differing opinions but it feels like the hate stems from being close minded and watching it trying to hate it from the get-go, though I can admit that there is a lot going on at once lol"
The Politician,"Honestly, I'm just treating it like Im watching a live action anime high school. These people obviously dont live in our reality, but when you just treat it like the over the top, high conceptual fun that its supposed to be, its actually quite entertaining."
The Politician,"honestly they just seem like they go in wanting to hate it. The show is amazingly over the top which is the point. In fact, the show seems more down to earth than actual politics these days."
The Politician,"> I just watched the first two episodes and I'm in love with what this show is putting out there. It's a pretty good satire. 

Without spoiling too much, unfortunately the writing does not stay as strong and of the event that should have been the high point they literally made a filler episode out of it."
The Politician,watch the rest of the episodes lol. I frickin loved it and it was still funny but everything that made it good falls apart super quickly.
The Politician,"The story is supposed to follow him over different elections in each season. at least this means they probably won’t recast him, platt kills it in the role."
The Politician,">30 year old actors

Ben is 26 :) 

But yes, they do look too old to be high-schoolers. Ben played a high schooler in DEH though so I guess I can accept him as one lol"
The Politician,Oh for sure but it works fine. It's all meant to be ott anyway and it's not meant to stay in high school throughout so nbd
The Politician,Yes. That is my number one takeaway. His singing is magical.
The Politician,"I did yeah, he was very calming? Like, I would have liked to see his character grow a bit."
The Politician,He’s freaking beautiful
The Politician,"You can apply to college before your senior year, or even in the first semester of senior year. Early admissions."
The Politician,"The way I see it is that he did feel those feelings, but he only allowed himself to display them because he knew that's what it would take to get Infinity on his ticket. So it was real, but a calculated dose of reality."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"If you like *Star Trek: Prodigy,* you may want to find [*Trollhunters*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2oNgZlbSKI) on Netflix. The creators/showrunners of *Prodigy,* Kevin and Dan Hageman, have [most of the story writing credits on *Trollhunters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunters:_Tales_of_Arcadia#Season_1_(2016))*,* which was showrun by Guillermo del Toro and Marc Guggenheim.  And two of the other *Trollhunter* writers, Chad Quandt and Aaron Waltke are also working on *Prodigy.*

As a sidenote, A.C. Bradley who also wrote for *Trollhunters* and *3 Below* is now head writer on *What If...?* and she also worked on *Ms. Marvel.*

*Trollhunters* was so successful, Netflix decided to expand it into the Tale of Arcadia franchise, which includes [*3 Below*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVmNGUA-eo), [*Wizards*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6adVDTR79n4), and [*Rise of the Titans*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H4Y21Hg2L8)."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I’m still somehow not use to millie with hair.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Not only is it bad on her psyche but the amount of weird ass tweets I saw, excited that she “finally” turned 18, was mind boggling. Imagine being a teen actor and knowing there’s a pretty sizable population of people just waiting for you to become an adult. It’s bizarre as hell."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Yeah, but the machine demands child-sacrifices, so..."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,Has it really been 7 years since season 1?
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,But is it more or less hard on the psyche to be groomed by Drake at 16?
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"I think she’s handled it well overall, very talented actor forsure. It’s definitely gotta be tough to pretty much blow up overnight and be worldwide success as a little kid. I like how all the kid actors all seem to be close with harbour and Winona, really feels like those 2 have always tried to look out for the kids."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"SexualizIng child stars and counting down to them becoming 18 isn’t even new as fucked up as it is, I remember being a teen and there was no Twitter or Reddit then but guys on message boards and chat rooms would still say shit about the Olsen twins turning 18 soon like, that’s gross as hell

Child stars will never be normal but they can get close to it, for every Feldman and Haim there’s a Leo and Natalie Portman who somehow found a way to navigate that and, from all appearances anyway, grow up to be sane normal adults"
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,He talks about all his younger costars in that interview. Kinda shitty to make it out to be about MMB alone.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Yeah and it must be hard when not only your peers are obsessed with you, but grown adults as well. It’s one thing to be a Disney star and maybe only kids your age love you, but the ST kids have kids and their parents coming up to them freaking out."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"> That's why Drake generously stepped up to try to groom her

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,Doesn’t help when you have Drake keep asking when your 18th birthday is
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Famine at 11 years old seems harder. Maybe I’m wrong. 

Hard on the psyche and easy on the wallet and base needs.

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I was convinced it was a wig
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"I thought she was blonde for the longest time, then I realized it was just because of the wig she wore in season 1."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"That happened with every single child actress who was remotely classically attractive and it’s fucking gross. I was only 12 when Emma Watson turned 18. Hermione was my absolute idol growing up, and I distinctly remember seeing all these grown ass men sexualising her and the countdown clocks waiting for her to turn 18. It made me feel so icky in a way I didn’t have the words or context to conceptualise at that age. 

Those countdowns to 18 happened with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, Lindsay Lohan, Billie Eilish, basically every young very famous girl over the last 30 years. It’s so indicative of the way these guys think; they’re already perving on teenagers and the only barrier in their mind is the golden tick that comes on her 18th birthday. Somehow the fact that those girls and women, let alone most women, wouldn’t touch them with a 30ft pole doesn’t seem a deterrent from their fucked up predations."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I remember the Olsen twins countdown clocks to 18…
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,There were widgets you could add to your MySpace that would count down to when the Olsen Twins turned 18. I'm sure they weren't the first either.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I used to be a moderator on a fetish message board and people would to post countdown widgets to when certain celebs would turn 18. I try not to kink shame but it was disturbing.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Not just waiting, but waiting only because it’s a law. i.e. they don’t *want* to wait…"
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"On the plus side, now that she's an adult, Drake is no longer interested."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,Drake checking in
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"What's worse is how she and her entourage were aware of this, and styled herself to be more adult like than her age. Not saying its her fault or she's to blame, but whoever decided to dress and beautify a teen girl needs to get kicked in the teeth."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,">all seem to be close with harbour and Winona

Hopefully Winona convinced a few of them to follow in her footsteps.

There were some interviews from when she was in Star Trek where she pointed out she never read articles on herself, and didn't spend time on the internet at all.

Her agent kept her informed if things were received well etc, but she said there was no upside at all to hearing what thousands or millions of people thought of you."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,">the countdown clocks waiting for her to turn 18. 

Sorry to make it even worse, but some of the usual suspects of ""newspapers"" in the UK had a countdown for her 16th birthday with it being the age of consent."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Man, she's only 18, I can't even wrap my head around thinking about her sexually now. Why do you even need to think of her sexually."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"I forgot about that… What’s also weird is, I remember people defending Drake because apparently Millie was okay with how he was acting. Like yeah, it’s almost as if a teen probably doesn’t know if an adult is being malicious or not…"

Clearly nobody bothered to watch that clip.

- Drake pulls her shirt down at the back of the neck to kiss her again. 
- Drake reaches both hands across her chest while standing behind her.
- **Drake says, “I like the way your breasts feel against my chest.”**

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,It used to be a much more widespread media habit
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,So let me ask you something. Do you think she has someone dressing her every day and choosing her wardrobe in life? Because if you do then that is just silly.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,It was such a fucking hit that summer. Came out of nowhere and dethroned House of Cards as Netflix's prime series. The first season is still 10/10 for me. No flaws
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I remember during interviews for season 1 Winona said her parents still screen all her reviews and send her the positive ones.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,That’s virtually impossible to do in this day and age.  Unless you just completely ignore the internet.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,Because she was media trained. Her recent Hot Ones made it pretty apparent how coached her media presence is.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Ya I totally agree with you, I look forward to seeing what she does after stranger things, honestly that goes for like the whole cast tho, all of the main actors do a good job so I think most of them will have nice careers after STs and I look forward to it. It’s been really cool watching all the kids grow up every season."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I wouldn't say she's mature for her age. More like she watches other people and imitates that behind of behaviour. Its a bit creepy to watch someone that young talk and act like a 30 year old.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"That’s the writing, not Millie. She’s very good as Eleven."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,I thought she was fine in Godzilla vs Kong. Her dynamic with conspiracy dude were funny from what I can remember.
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"That’s because the writing sucks not because she cant act, she’s got 2 Emmy noms for a reason. Very good at acting without speaking as well."

Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"Yeah, Billie Eilish defended his behaviour too. Feels like something they'll stop and think about once they hit their 30s and realize it wasn't ok."
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku,"right?!?  like, let's abolish statutory rape laws as long as the victim isn't complaining about the adult's behavior.   jeezus the logic from some people.  /smh"
Team Kaylie,"In 2015, Netflix was more like HBO than NBC. They used to take time and only release shows that passed whatever quality checks they had. Now it seems they pretty much buy any  show they can get their hands on, and hope something sticks"
Team Kaylie,Where’s “You” ? It’s one of their biggest hits.
Team Kaylie,Still can't believe they cancelled Tuca & Bertie & Sense8
Team Kaylie,"I remember when I started watching OITNB, the fucking sensation it was, even in my very-conservative country. It had the raunchiest sex scenes that somehow surpassed GOT's, it was nominated for just about every award show in every category. Then the show itself started to fade in season 4 (which is coincidentally the same time Netflix started putting out hundreds of shows). 

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects. 

I'll forever be grateful that it housed Bojack Horseman, Dark, and a few others, but damn, what a fall."
Team Kaylie,[deleted]
Team Kaylie,"You left out dark, elite, la casa de papel, and other foreign shows that are extremely popular on netflix"
Team Kaylie,Grace and Frankie is still the best Netflix original
Team Kaylie,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Team Kaylie,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."
Team Kaylie,"One word: fatigue.

Be it netflix, be it the viewer. Somewhere fatigue is showing up."
Team Kaylie,[deleted]
Team Kaylie,You was originally a Lifetime show
Team Kaylie,What does being a conservative have to do with it?
Team Kaylie,"Looking at his lists, his definition can’t be very accurate. Also, if something getting buzz doesn’t really say anything. I’m not sure why you would use that as a factor."
Team Kaylie,[deleted]
Team Kaylie,yeah wasn't sure what comparison to make for a network that has a lot of shows but some gems in the dust. Was thinking USA or AMC
Team Kaylie,"Here in Brazil it means being against things that are feminist, LGBT, etc. We're mistaken as a sex-positive, progressive country because of carnival but we're really not."
Team Kaylie,Sabrina started in 2018
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Damn I hope they get to the one about milking the creature
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Season 1, while full of shit acting, was somewhat entertaining. But season 2 definitely was blatantly geared towards the ""woke"" college leftist crowd...every protagonist is either a racial minority or lgbt person, and every antagonist is a racist white guy. It's so blatantly over the top about it too"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Just wait til you get to season 3.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Yeah no thanks, won't even bother with it."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Lol I DARE you to watch Season 3 Episode 9 Heirloom.  Its so cringe that I think its a new record, I laughed my ass off.  Just make sure to have a beer, vodka, and whisky all ready."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It is a huge sprawling mess across the board. I have the distinct impression that the first few episodes of each season are well thought out and planned and generally pretty good and then the writers just start making shit up as they go. I wonder if they have a huge dartboard with random shit written on it.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,1 and 2 are the good seasons. It just gets worse.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Unfortunately, if you don't like the first couple of Seasons, you're not going to like the later episodes.  It gets really bad after Freak Show."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No. It’s always the same problem:

1.	strong, intriguing start
2.	then show runner gets distracted by something shiny about halfway through the season
3.	then it goes off the rails
4.	awful ending

The only coherent season was the one about the girls school for witches."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"The writers don't understand story structure, and they never figure it out."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"It's hilarious that you feel this way because most longtime AHS fans feel like the show went downhill after season two with only some redeeming seasons/moments.

Although maybe if you hate the first two seasons you'll enjoy the seasons that the majority of other fans hate."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"American Horror Story is pretty much always a mess. Each season tends to start strong but loses direction after about 4 episodes and unravels into an incoherent, flabby disaster. S2 is probably the best season so if you didn't like it then it's probably not for you. I still enjoy it but my expectations for it are pretty low."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,If you think those are bad… just wait until you get to Apocalypse
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"The first season is by far the strongest and most cohesive. Second season is a mess but fun. Third season is a campy mess but fun. After that it only gets more laborious and convoluted and self indulgent. Season 4 is actually infamous for a lot of people not finishing it. I don’t recommend going past season 3, especially if you’re already finding it to be this way."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No it gets way worse
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Oh god no, lol. I mean, some later seasons are entertaining, but every one of them is a damn mess."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"My absolute favorite was season 3, American Horror Story: Coven.  That season had excellent story lines, phenomenal acting from the cast and it wasn’t predictable.  I tried to hang in there with each new season but it just kept getting more ridiculous.  I saw the previews for the latest season AHS: NYC.  The previews always make the show look so juicy and interesting but when you watch each episode, it just turns out to be really campy."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Lol no. Actually the first 2 especially asylum are the best.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"If you didn’t like those, you would have a terrible time going forward."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Hahaha. Nope
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It doesn't get better. Chekhov's gun is always being violated
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Season 1 is the only one I really liked
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No. It’s always like this, just in different flavors."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Those are the two best seasons. If you don't like those two seasons, then you just don't like the show. There are some okay seasons following those, but they range from mediocre to what-the-fuck-were-they-thinking level of awful."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Yeah if you don't like S1 and 2 you may like 3 but otherwise give up.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"It’s a fucking shitshow honestly, but some seasons are a ton of fun. I adore coven and 1984 since they’re just so goofy and cheesy"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,AHS: Coven (Season 3) is the best season of the series. IMO.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Every part of this show is a huge sprawling disasters mess. I honestly don't know how people can enjoy it.

I legitimately think they just make it up as they go. The season starts off with an interesting idea, then diverts into 50 different directions and loose ends that go nowhere and plot holes everywhere and nothing makes sense. Rinse and repeat."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,The first one was great. It progressively gets worse.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"That's how Ryan Murphy runs all his shoes, halfway through her just introduces new characters and plot points when he has wrapped up what has already started and no clear direction for where it's going"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Kinda seems like its the MO of the show. I will say NYC had a clear metaphor
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Hell to the no it doesn’t get better
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Coven, Freak Show, Hotel and maybe Apocalyse are the only descent ones."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It certainly doesn’t get ***better*** lol
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Congrats you got through the watchable seasons. Might as well stop now.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"It honestly was never good to me, but I normally hear people say they at least like the first two seasons."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I’d watch season 3 and season 8.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Not sure it gets crazier than the  one about the mental hospital, oh my lord."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I loved it until I got sober.  I don't think it's intended to be consumed that way.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Nope it just gets worse. And this is coming from someone that stuck with it for ten seasons. 

American Horror Story is such a great concept. It’s a shame it wasn’t in the hands of a more competent director. I wish Mike Flanagan had created AHS."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No they get worse!  The stories start out interesting but soon get bogged down in their own mythology.  Like the 1984 season, which I thought was going to be a straight slasher story got out of control at the midway point and never fully recovered.  Plus the same cast each season is getting tiresome.  Sarah Paulson gets on my nerves.  And the overtly gay themes really hinder the series.  Plus the glamorization of real life serial killers is unsettling…"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Are you watching these in weekly installments or binging each season? I ask because the series, to me, does not lend itself to binging. You need time between each episode to breathe… and forgot things. Overall, the entire series is batshit with some seasons having better arcs and episodes than others. Watch American Horror Stories if you’re looking for something in the same vein but in much smaller doses of absurdity."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Hahaha I kept yelling at my TV. Lock the doors and stop these weirdos from going into your house! But I did enjoy s1 and first half of s2
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No. They’re all awful shows that suffer from poor writing and a constant need to shock the audience with cheap tricks. Embarrassing stuff.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"I had such high hopes for it. The first few episodes of the first season were genuinely creepy. And then it all fell apart. I made it through season 1 & 2, tried 3 and gave up, and occasionally try again and give up every time."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No

it’s just gore for the sake of shock value. Especially in the later seasons."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,If you don't like the first two seasons then quit while you're ahead. It only gets worse.
Two Sentence Horror Stories, not at all
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Unfortunately not.  The format seems to always start with a premise that's compelling/has promise, does some interesting things here and there, then it goes a bit off-track when it starts to just try to tick boxes for horror in that genre, ends up forgetting/abandoning some of the interesting stuff from the beginning, and then the writers panic trying to wrap-up up as many plotlines as they can in the last few episodes.

The only season that I thought that faired a little better was *Roanoke*.  Though only because it followed the reality TV interview and re-enactment format and then there's a reveal about the veracity of the interviewee statements when all hell breaks loose.  It also featured Kathy Bates, Leslie Jordan, and Stefanie Germanotta.  It's still a heck of a mess though."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"As an AHS fan no, it gets worse."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Circus and hotel are legit
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No. It get more weird in a not scary way. Ryan Murphy grows his ego as time goes on, leaning hard in to identity politics, alternative lifestyles and political positions he disagrees with to create ""horror"". It just comes out outlandish."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Freakshow was the only good season imo. It actually felt like something resembling horror.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"I think the total messiness is kind of the charm of the show. It goes so far off the rails in every season and you're just along for the ride and the ""omg"" moments. It's really bad at many points but it's one of a kind at least."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Season 3 is pretty amazing. Watch that season at least before bouncing.

I agree though that Season 2 is all over the place without much payoff to the subplots tying into anything."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No, it just gets progressively worse."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,lol it gets progressively worse the longer it goes
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Season 2 was the worst mess in my opinion. They couldn't decide on a villain, so they just put all of them in and called it a day."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"The entire show, all of the seasons, I would compare to a fresh dog turd! Basically a shitshow to watch and only satisfying for whoever made it! Avoid like the plague!"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It gets worse and worse progressively.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"The best seasons by far are season 2 and 11, Asylum and NYC. Everything else is a huge step down."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Season 1 is ok, it is descent, it keeps up with a central idea. (for a first season it is pretty good by normal standards )

Season 2 asylum  they improve abit, but it gets confusing with all the aliens stuff. still it is ok 

Then \]coven, freak show and hotel They are pretty good. Hotel to be frank the only thing saving it is lady gaga and mat bomer. but coven and freak show are very good 

Went down hill with Roanoke and cult those are trash 

Apocalypse is a continuation of coven and it ties some of the past seasons together so I like how they did that. 

Then 1984, double feature, and NYC are all trash really."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"I watched the show completely out of order. I pulled a list of the ones I've seen:

  
Murder House	12	October 5, 2011	December 21, 2011  
Asylum	13	October 17, 2012	January 23, 2013  
Coven	13	October 9, 2013	January 29, 2014  
Freak Show	13	October 8, 2014	January 21, 2015  
Apocalypse	10	September 12, 2018	November 14, 2018  
1984	9	September 18, 2019	November 13, 2019  


I think those are the ones I watched. I'd have to say I really enjoyed 1984 it was a lot of fun but Coven was excellent, I loved the witches. Freaks was the first season I watched and I enjoyed that as well. I love the special guest in Coven and then the start of the one episode just fit so perfectly. But quickly looking at that list, yeah Murder house is my least favorite. Asylum was decent."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,YES
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"They usually start out pretty good, but almost always fail to stick the landing by the end. Some of my favorite stories are the one-off episode flashback stories, because that’s what they’re best at telling: short, contained narratives. 
With AHS, I found it was best to only watch the seasons that intrigued me from the outset and avoid the others. Murder House, Coven, and Apocalypse are my favorite ones."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No, this show was only good for a season. Considerably downhill after that. Weird thing is that all of the seasons turn about 8 episodes in and gets very very odd. Ending almost always sucks to each season. I would, however, recommend Ratchet on Netflix. That was a good series by Ryan Murphy that didn’t get too twisted or weird by the end."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It’s just hit or miss. Asylum and Hotel are among my favorites but even the first season I didn’t really like. Never finished the most recent season.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Those were the best two seasons to me. I’ve pretty much stopped completely after Apocalypse.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It starts turning into shock horror and it's just not for me. I'm sure the kids like it.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,AHS’s entire writing premise is throw a million zany ideas at the wall and see what sticks. If anything it gets even more incoherent as it goes.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,The one in P Town was actually the best and it was last year.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I found it all to be too torture-porny and couldn’t watch it. My wife loved it though
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No, it's all like that."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"I had completely given up on the show during the Hotel season, so my opinion is based off only those earlier seasons - 

Felt that S1 (House) and S3 (Coven) were the best of what I watched, with some of  S2's 'random shit thrown at you' episodes being the worst."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Style over substance. It goes downhill, more than you can fathom. 

Ryan Murphy is a mystery to me. As bad as American Horror Story was, American Crime Story (at least seasons 1 and 2) are exceptional."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Trust me….it gets worse, much worse"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It actually gets worse and worse lol
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"It gets worse. There are blips, where I liked a particular character or episode, but none of the seasons are very cohesive or coherent."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Season 2 is peak AHS cut your losses and quit now.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,It gets exponentially worse actually.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No. Watched a lot of them with my wife. It gets worse.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"The Ryan Murphy effect: Show starts with immense potential and intrigue.

*flash forward to 7 unfulfilled plots and awful pandering dialogue*

Or maybe I should say flashBACK since they took an entire season of Apocalypse and turned it into Coven 2.0"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Freak Show, season 4 was my favorite. Followed by 2, then 1. It falls off after 4. But please watch Freak Show. It’s great."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"No 8cbaul no 9t really,it sort of stops being. It sort of start stops being about a story and instead beyond visually focuses on the most a couple who haven't seen it focuses on the married couple who typically is the most annoying married couple history of planet I bailed on this newest season after like three episodes I was like unless they all die like in the first five seconds for the next episode I don't care what's going to happen ask my adult daughter the other day if she was watching the American horror story New York which is the newest one and she said dad that thing's so horrible no I stopped after she is I don't know if I made all the way through the first episode that it's just it's bad it's the worst thing I've ever seen and she loves the horrible she loves cheesy movies it's just bad not they sold the franchise to somebody else that's some other writers what's going on but it just didn't have to be good in a long time"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"If you didn't like season 2 it's probably not for you, that's generally as a high point for the show.

I love it all but sort of accept a certain level of camp. It's always a little bit of a mess."
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"Coven is probably the best season by far! Asylum was pretty good. Apocalypse is like the sequel to Coven. Hotel was ok. NYC was good too!

Didn't watch Double Feature, 1984, or Roanoke"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I lost interest after Freak Show. I just couldn’t get into the singing.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,"I could only make it through the entirety of the first season. After that I would try to watch a whole season,but the plots become more and more bizarre as each season goes into the back half. I guess I was able to follow the entirety of the vampire half season too. Maybe they should do that more often. They set up interesting premises and intriguing characters, but fail to keep attention after a few episodes. I think this is a fairly prevalent opinion of AHS"
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I think I’m the only person on the planet who hated season 2 of this show haha season 1 is still my favorite.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,Ironically the first 2 seasons are considered the good ones. They get way worse the more you watch
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No
Two Sentence Horror Stories,I get to the point of AHS season where I’m tired of Sarah Paulson’s character (usually because of the screams) and root for her to die. Cult season especially 😂
Two Sentence Horror Stories,No.
Two Sentence Horror Stories,The show just sucks so bad. From the start.
Vagabond,Shit I thought this was based on the manga haha
Vagabond,Dear Netflix there are other Korean actors beside Lee Seung-gi.
Vagabond,Thanks for answering that for me.  I was wondering the same.
Vagabond,">Shit I thought this was based on the manga haha

What's the manga about?"
Vagabond,I was about to lose it if it was the Manga. Sigh...
Vagabond,">Dear Netflix there are other Korean actors beside Lee Seung-gi.

What else is he in? They Probs have him on retainer"
Vagabond,whats wrong with his nose? doesnt look natural
Vagabond,It's a manga of real life Japanese philosopher and samurai Miyamoto Mushashi
Vagabond,I’ve only read a little bit of it so far but simply put it’s about a sword fighter fighting samurai. I’d look it up to get a better summary tho haha it’s always on the top of the best manga of all time list though.
Vagabond,Same haha was about to say god damn it finally get an adaptation and it’s a live action Netflix show.....people always say it can’t be adapted but I disagree. People said that about Vinland saga as well and the anime is amazing. Sure it would be really hard to get the feeling that the art does but I think it can be done.
Vagabond,He's in the other Netflix Korean drama called Korean Odyssey.
Vagabond,"Specifically, it's based on the novel Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa."
Vagabond,"So he's in one other drama on Netflix? Anything else? I, for one, am glad to see someone other than Lee Byung Hun starring in a Netflix show getting romantic with girls 30 years younger than him."
Vagabond,RIP Tom Cruise
Vagabond,"I don't really understand what's going on, but I'm enjoying it. "
Vagabond,Have to agree with most people in here in saying that I enjoyed watching it but I have no idea what's going on or what the plot is supposed to be.
Vagabond,I want more.
Vagabond,Well its definitely off to a good start.
Vagabond,That show made no attempt to give you any idea WTF was happening. 
Vagabond,"My family might think I'm crazy after how much I laughed when that guy exploded. I'm not sure what's going on, but I like it so far."
Vagabond,"Halfway through I'm enjoying this show a lot. I love the comic and the show isn't exactly like it, which keeps me guessing. Also it has captured the feel of the comic really well, so I'll definitely keep watching."
Vagabond,"I'm cautiously optimistic for this.  AMC usually has great pilot episodes but has meddled in the past causing things to go awry shortly after.  If it's as good as the buzz is indicating though, we should be in for a treat.  "
Vagabond,I didn't love it and I didn't hate it...I'm still not clear on what the show is about lol 
Vagabond,"I had no idea what was going on, but I enjoyed it."
Vagabond,Ruth Negga is a work of art.
Vagabond,I thought it was entertaining but i had no clue what was going on and i sometimes couldnt understand what anybody was saying. Its only the pilot though. Im into it enough to wanna keep watching. 
Vagabond,"Well, thats one way to weaponize toy soldiers."
Vagabond,"Loved it, especially how Tulip and Cassidy came into town."
Vagabond,This airs after Fear right?
Vagabond,I liked the pilot a lot. I wonder why nobodys talking about the fight scenes/ choreography?? Is was some of the best I've seen on TV ever!
Vagabond,"wow, people are waaay too critical of a show that has only aired one episode. Also, it's obvious a lot of people didn't read the iAMA with Sam Catlin. He said it will definitely not just take place in Annville, (he specifically said at the end of the day the show is a ROAD TRIP) and also that pretty much EVERY important character will be on the show at one point or another.

It would be physically impossible to adapt this show directly from the comics, which is why it's taken this long to adapt it at all. I for one think it's a refreshing break from THE WALKING DEAD which at this point is pretty much a joke. (I mean, i'll still watch it but mainly to see how Negan pans out)"
Vagabond,"For reference, I'd only heard of the comics recently and have not read them. I hadn't heard much about the show as I'm in the UK so I just watched it after the buzz it got.

Not a clue what's going on but I loved it! Seeing Rudy from Misfits (Cassidy) made me so happy, he's brilliant! "
Vagabond,"After watching the first episode I have no idea what is going on. At all. 

However, it was a lot of fun. 

What was up with that kid having a butthole for a mouth?"
Vagabond,I just wish they went the route in the comics in regards to when Jesse gets imbedded with the power and the church he's in blows up and kills everyone. They could've done it but some changes are necessary apparently. 
Vagabond,"There's a lot to like here.  But I think my favorite part is that, while it's not exactly the same as the comic it definitely captures the abject *weirdness* of Ennis' Preacher world.  "
Vagabond,"I see what they're going for and I want it to work. I started reading the comic when I heard about it being adapted to see why people were excited/worried. I love that it has a whimsical feel to the over the top gore. I heard they would stick to Annville for.the beginning of the show to set it up, which makes sense since the comic travels a lot in the beginning and it wouldn't translate as well to TV.  I hope they end up pulling out all the stops for stuff like the Desade party, etc"
Vagabond,Did they just kill the Google guy? 
Vagabond,"As a direct adaptation of one of my favorite comics ever, it's pretty crap.  As an entertaining piece of television that just happens to feature characters that *kind* of remind me of the characters in one of my favorite comics ever, it's just the best."
Vagabond,"Welp, I liked it.

But it's not ... Preacher. Jesse just isn't the oldschool, conservative, but charming James Dean guy. The one that would lament that there aren't real men anymore, that would laugh at the whole Political Correctness today.

Tulip is ... I don't know what they want to do with her. Some sort of McGyver, mercenary, assassin type?

Cassidy was a delight, I gotta say, though I miss his black sunglasses. But I guess that the part with him never showing his eyes would be difficult on TV compared to the Comics.

So in the end: It's not gonna be like the Comics. But I'll probably enjoy it still for what it is.

EDIT: And what I'm really curious about - Arseface's origin. What's the modern equivalent to an angsty teenager wanting to follow Curt Cobain after he shot himself with a shotgun?
"
Vagabond,"Christ,  at this point I was almost expecting Allfather D'Aronique and Jesus DeSade to be living in Annville as well. "
Vagabond,Well that was delightfully insane.
Vagabond,So far so good. It's got a Coen Brothers meets the supernatural vibe that I really dig.
Vagabond,"Very watchable but I thought they tried to get too much into it and became a bit silly towards the end because of it. The main trio were a bit too good at hand-to-hand combat as is the norm these days, in movies at least. "
Vagabond,I don't mind the changes but I hate how Jesse eyes don't turn red when he's using his his power like it does in the comics. It's not like it cost a ton of money to cgi his eyes red.
Vagabond,"Posted this as a reply to comment below, but...

I feel like it was adapted well to the small screen. It definitely feels like AMC, but it introduced the main characters, and left you with questions about the characters which may or may not keep you coming back for more. Either way it definitely laid the groundwork for the story to continue moving along at a very good pace, and I'm excited to see if they can keep it up. 

If they can keep it up every week, I feel like I'll be pleased with the series, but one episode can fuck it all up so I'm still cautiously optimistic. 
"
Vagabond,"I am about halfway through this pilot and I think this thing sucks. I have no problems with anyone who liked it but this was not the right blend for my taste. The over the top fight scenes mixed with comedic relief killed it for me. 

I have a strong feeling it is mostly because of how they (read the media) praised this show before it aired. Some called it ""the next Walking Dead"". I came into it with an expectation and left feeling let down. Oh well, there are many other shows."
Vagabond,"As a fan of the comic, I am sorta disappointed of how different the show is but I'll keep watching and hopefully it gets better."
Vagabond,"I just realized that if I hadnt read the comics multiple times, I would probably not have the slightest clue what is going on"
Vagabond,arseface?
Vagabond,Loved the pilot and the Son of Dave track at the end.
Vagabond,"Based on this episode, I forsee the upcoming episodes are going to be a hell of a lot of fun to watch"
Vagabond,I loved it alot more than the comics
Vagabond,Why are people saying it's confusing? What exactly was confusing about it? Seemed pretty straightforward to me. Wasn't the best pilot ever but it's got me interested. I hope this isn't a show where the comic readers are going to complain about everything non-stop.
Vagabond,[deleted]
Vagabond,"Still not sure how I feel about the show. 

I've only read the first volume of the comics, mostly because the comics were so damn expensive in hardcover. The whole series seems like it can really be summed up by a huge WTF.

Watching the premier it almost seems like they're going for some kind of subversive message about faith... But having spoiled myself on the ending of the comics I'm not entirely sure. "
Vagabond,"Good show.  I really liked it.  I'm gonna have to get used to that accent Cooper is doing for Jesse...but it wasn't bad.


Pretty excited for the next episode!"
Vagabond,Repent for he is cumming
Vagabond,It looks like they won't be following the comics and the show is probably centered in Anneville. I'm a bit disappointed about that.
Vagabond,I am sure people that are not familiar with the source material will be confused but I thought it was a really good adaptation of the comic.
Vagabond,"Gimmicky and ""edgy"", it had good moments. Good fights: loved the bar fight, loved the plane fight. 

Overall, that's probably not my cup of tea, so I am out, but you feel free to enjoy"
Vagabond,"Constantine and Almost Human were my favorite non-premium shows of the last 5 years. This is very close to hitting those levels for me just after the first episod. Totally different concept then anything else I've watched, great characters, and a lot of mystery. Which makes me terrified...but, TURN and Hell on Wheels have had decent runs that are still ongoing, and no one I know watches those (not to say they're bad, just speaking from the possibility of low viewership woes). 

Here's to a healthy run, and a satisfying conclusion far down the road."
Vagabond,I really enjoyed this show I mean at times it was confusing due the constant change of the setting but that was to build up hype for Genesis. Cassidy was a bad ass of course like the comics and Dominic did a damn good job at playing Jesse Custer. The fight scenes were pretty good especially the car scene. Overall I'm pretty hyped on this show.
Vagabond,"well, this way pretty good "
Vagabond,The vampire killers were trying to fly Cassidy into the sunlight on a private jet? They could think of an easier way to kill him? Seems like an unconvincingly extravagant way to go about trying to kill him.
Vagabond,"I really liked this first episode especially as someone who loved the comics.

My only concern was that I hope we don't stay in the town too long 

[Major Spoiler](#s ""In other words I hope the town blows up and kills everyone soon"")"
Vagabond,"So I just finished watching the pilot. It's very weird, which is one of the main reasons why I am hooked on the show.

But I have no idea what is going on and I am glad I am not the only one here. After learning some basic stuff from fans on /r/Preacher, I realized that this show might be designed for binge-watchers in mind who will go find this show on Netflix in the future and click next episode after the pilot. It sucks that first-airing viewers including me will have to wait every week to see what happens next.

For the more positive stuff, the performances from Dominic Cooper, Ruth Negga and Joe Gilgun were absolute amazing, with Negga in mind. I am so in love with Tulip. Her character is just a breeze of fresh air for me for some reason. (And speaking as an MCU and Agents of SHIELD fan, I am so happy to see Raina co-starring with Howard Stark! :D) Also, Cassidy is great. I hear fans are very happy with this version of Cassidy so good job Preacher team!

Vagabond,"It was ok at best . I tried it and I'm going to pass .                     
They changed way to much for me . "
Vagabond,"So far, I'm very interested in it. I don't quite understand it all, and it confused me jumping around so much, but I did enjoy it because it's different. The scenes with that guy blowing up and the dude ripping out his own heart were great."
Vagabond,Meh first episode
Vagabond,"I saw a video a few days ago with Garth Ennis (The comic creator of Preacher) where he says they had to slow down the pace of the comic for the show.  I didn't think much of it until last night, when the show puts its foot on the gas and hardly ever lets off.  How in the name of zeus's butthole is this slow?  I don't think I've ever watched a show with such a breakneck speed out of the gate.  "
Vagabond,"The show was all over the place, definitely confusing. If it's deliberate that's ok, there's definitely a lot to explore and to explain.

In any case, it seems to be a very rich universe."
Vagabond,"I enjoyed the comics, but the casting for tulip isn't right, and the changes to the story are pretty big, jesse's father wasn't a preacher who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps for example, it was a  lot more interesting than that. there seems to be no sign of ""penis head"" or the fat bastard from the grail, or of custer's psychotic granny and her hillbilly henchmen, one of whom had a predilection for sticking his penis into fish, dogs and pretty much anything that moved and a good few things that didn't. And I would have been more surprised if they had included the inbred descendent of jesus in the story than I am that they didn't. its got 92% on RT but I cant see myself getting along with it at all."
Vagabond,"One episode in, best comic book adaptation ever.  I can't think of a close second. "
Vagabond,"Just watched it on Amazon. Forgot all about this show coming but really liked it even though it was bat shit insane. Tulip building a homemade bazooka with 2 little unattended kids was fun. 

I was also really happy to see Joseph Gilgun in this as Cassidy. His scene was my favourite of the episode. Great action scene with a really funny bit with the champagne bottle.

I really thought ""what the fuck"" when I saw Eugene. His mouth looks like an arsehole. So fucked up."
Vagabond,"Sorry to be a pain, does anyone know how this is being shown in the UK? Is it on something like Sky Atlantic, or is nothing announced?"
Vagabond,"i never finished the comics, got about halfway through and stopped(don't remember why)

thought the pilot was okay, had some issues with the dialogue, couldn't understand a good chunk of it

i'm interested enough to keep watching, but i wasn't blown away

but the heaven/hell/angels type stuff has never grabbed me on any tv show, so we'll see how this one does

"
Vagabond,"Hey comic fans, who are the 2 guys who keep showing up after Preachers get killed?  (I liked this show but had never heard of the comic before watching it.)"
Vagabond,"That's Herr Starr who showed up to the church in Africa, I really liked this pilot in relation to the source material, Cassidy is going to be amazing "
Vagabond,"Waited so long for this, and it's so horrifically mis-cast I can't get past the first 20 minutes. 

"
Vagabond,"Dear Fucking Lord Jesus On A Stick!

The beginning was more offensive than I expected!  :D  That was actually a good joke that I didn't expect from this series judging that it is...you know... Preacher.

EDIT: No, seriously. This is Preacher. It is supposed to be crass and unfunny. And this is surprisingly good... W T F?"
Vagabond,"Well it's more violent than the GoT episode tonight.

Edit: Why the downvotes?"
Vagabond,"wasn't into it at all, won't keep watching. Maybe it's good if you've read the comic. Pacing was really bad and it didn't have any hook other than the weird shit. reddit will probably eat it up cause it's edgy."
Vagabond,"I didnt like it, I dont think I have a well articulated well thought out reason yet"
Vagabond,That was a shitty premiere
Vagabond,"I didn't really like it. The pacing felt off and Jesse's character is pretty boring. He spends so much time brooding. The show was also quirky and wacky in a way that I didn't like. It was very ""comic booky"" if that makes sense. "
Vagabond,[deleted]
Vagabond,"This is really bad. Maybe the comic is decent, but this show is not. 

Downvote me without rebuttal. This is terrible by AMC standards now. It will be cancelled. "
Vagabond,"I watched the episode yesterday, where the fuck was tom cruise?"
Vagabond,[deleted]
Vagabond,"Yeah, one of my main issues was the introduced a certain concept in the end. It makes no sense unless you read the comics and I don't like how it was portrayed. 

My other issue was Tulip and Cassidy's introductions but I enjoyed the rest of the show. "
Vagabond,"He's a preacher with a mysterious violent past who just got inhabited by something that gives him the power to make people listen to him.  

Personally I feel like people shouldn't read /u/joe727 's plot synopsis unless you want a lot of future plotlines to be spoiled.  All those things will be revealed in time and none of them are necessary to understand the plot so far."
Vagabond,"Me neither, but knowing it comes from a well-received comic line makes me optimistic that it'll turn out well. "
Vagabond,[deleted]
Vagabond,"That can create suspense and move things forward. 

I thought the pilot was well produced. It felt like a movie in places. "
Vagabond,But did you like it tho
Vagabond,"I think it's a hard line to walk between being faithful to the source material whilst adapting it well to a different medium.

I personally want to see a different Preacher on the screen to the one I read on the page, as long as it is good. A dose of unpredictability is never bad either."
Vagabond,"It's fun to see one of us in the wild.

מה קורה?"
Vagabond,"This show has all the right ingredients. Whatever you may think of Seth Rogen, I trust him from seeing him on the behind the scenes stuff and he's a *huge* fan of the comics. It has good people working on it. I'm a bit skeptical of AMC's decisions and if it will transfer to a television format well because of the source material and Walking Dead's changes making a weaker narrative imo. 

I'm not against changes to source material at all. I don't want it to be a 1:1 adaptation and hope to see something new yet familiar. It's just something you need to have gall to do well and capture it's essence. It's made up of so many genres that it would be easy to lean too much in one direction as well. 

The comic is one of my top 10 comics of all time so I hope it's good. I've been really excited for it. 

"
Vagabond,Not having a new episode for two weeks is a MAJOR error. 
Vagabond,One man's quest to find God
Criminal: Germany,I watched them all and enjoyed all of them differently. The voice dubbing was done very well. I hope we get multiple seasons for each series.
Criminal: Germany,Hope they got good guest actors for this season too. David Tennant and Hayley Atwell were great in the first season.
Criminal: Germany,"The German series was my favorite, they gave a really great performance and relationships between characters were the best. The French one was close to the British. It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts."
Criminal: Germany,Criminal UK had the best team in my opinion. They would make for a great multi-season series. Germany had some of the best acting and France was the most compelling. Spain was just aight...
Criminal: Germany,"Great news, and hopefully the other three are renewed as well."
Criminal: Germany,"Is the first season worth a watch (for any, all of the countries?). Think I watched the first one of UK and that was about it."
Criminal: Germany,"I loved all of the Criminal series.  I can't pick a favorite because they all held my interest.  I have several friends who want to see more of this series.  The second season of Criminal: UK was as good as the first season.  I'm awaiting the second seasons of Criminal: France, Criminal: Spain, and Criminal: Germany.  I wish it was on regularly because it's my favorite Netflix series."
Criminal: Germany,[deleted]
Criminal: Germany,"The first episode in the German series, the one with Peter Kurth, was among my top 3 of all episodes in the four series. The performance was great. I actually started watching 'Babylon Berlin' afterward because I read that Kurth was in the show. 


> It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts.

I'd disappointed as well, but still hope that the lack of news might be related to the pandemic-related shutdown and not because they cancelled them."
Criminal: Germany,I'll never forget a week or two after the UK episode about the people being smuggled in and left in the transport vehicle. The exact same thing happened in the news.
Criminal: Germany,I've enjoyed all of them.  Spain was my least favorite but it was still good.
Criminal: Germany,No comment.
Criminal: Germany,That episode was so intense.  I loved it!
Criminal: Germany,I think Peter Kurth did an excellent job.  That particular series stands out and it is partly because of his acting.
Criminal: Germany,Same. I remember hearing that as well
Criminal: Germany,"I started watching it a few nights ago. Fucking great show, and the sound track is on point.

Similar to The End of the F***ing World if you've seen that."
Criminal: Germany,"Thats real real high praise...well maybe, not sure how many shows you've seen. But I'll watch it, and ill come back with a sternly worded post directed right at you if it isn't spectacular. That's a huge risk man. I can be very very stern."
Criminal: Germany,Its good but you must not watch much if its one of the best shows you've seen.
Criminal: Germany,"Oh man, you were right, golde62! I just binge watched the whole thing today and it was fantastic. Thanks for the great recommendation!

IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE GUYS WHO WROTE DEADPOOL."
Criminal: Germany,"Great show, glad it got picked up after Youtube Red went under, I hope they make a season 2 before the main actors age out"
Criminal: Germany,Completely agree. Dean Winters (mayhem from those insurance commercials) is incredible as Del's dad. The entire cast had amazing chemistry. Where would they go for season 2?
Criminal: Germany,From the future.  Such a great friggin’ show
Criminal: Germany,The show is legit but not for all
Criminal: Germany,Seems like Amazon only picked it up in the US? No way I'm paying for Youtube.
Criminal: Germany,"Just made a post, but searched to see if anyone else felt the same. Hope this show starts getting traction so we see more seasons. This is a show that needs to be saved like the expanse did"
Criminal: Germany,This is without a doubt the greatest tv show to have ever existed.  ive watched a load of shows. there isnt a show that i havent seen or at least watched a full season of to try.  but this is my fave of all time
Criminal: Germany,Death of his father + vigilante??? I thought this was about bruce Wayne 😅
Criminal: Germany,Death of his father + vigilante??? I thought this was about bruce Wayne 😅
Criminal: Germany,It’s almost criminal how little attention it’s having.
Criminal: Germany,I watch a lot of shows
Criminal: Germany,This show is pretty great. I'm bummed there's no season 2 or at least a proper ending to it
Criminal: Germany,Awesome! Glad to hear it. Where’s your review u/Spartyjason? Did you get a chance to watch it?
Criminal: Germany,They were 22 and 21 when it was filmed; not gonna be a problem
Criminal: Germany,Agreed. That’s the plan here. Release it on Amazon to see if there’s enough of an interest in a season 2
Criminal: Germany,"Dean Winters was hilarious, Stephen Kearin, the cold that spent time in a Thai prison is also hilariously strange. So much funny. 

I have no idea. That’s why I posted this though was because I feel it’s awful that it got cancelled. Not too many shows get a chance at redemption but that’s why Wayne was passed to Amazon. For a shot at redemption. I hope enough people watch it now that’s it’s got a wider release because I’d love to see a second season."
Criminal: Germany,Yeah I wouldn’t pay for YouTube either. That’s really a bummer. What region are you?
Criminal: Germany,Does amazon crack down on VPNs like netflix? Might be an option if you really want to check it out.
Criminal: Germany,This was a superb show
Criminal: Germany,People are learning about it now.
Criminal: Germany,There is hope for a season 2 now at least
Criminal: Germany,"I've seen the first episode. And, I have to say, of all the shows in all the world on all the streaming services...this is one of them.  

In all seriousness I do like it so far. I dont think its going to reach the levels of what I consider ""great"" but I'll certainly finish it, and enjoy it I think."
Criminal: Germany,"The ending left it open. Season 2 could start with a few years having passed, given where Wayne ends up at the end of season 1. Wayne's quest in season 2 could be his trip back home to rescue Del."
Criminal: Germany,Germany
Criminal: Germany,Have you finished it?
Criminal: Germany,"I was wondering if they would ever go back to these decades. I haven’t seen the 90’s yet, is it just as good?"
Criminal: Germany,"It'd be awesome if they did, but it's doubtful. I think they are done"
Criminal: Germany,"I would LOVE this! I think an added episode for each decade on cinema (popular genres, new innovations in technology, exhibition trends, major stars of the decade) would be really neat as well. "
Criminal: Germany,Hey found this subreddit just wondering where I can find these series since it’s not on Netflix
Criminal: Germany,People actually watch CNN? I thought it was for airport and gym TVs. Something for you to casually judge whatever ridiculous headline they currently have on and dismiss just as quickly. 
Criminal: Germany,"They're very facile and glib, as you might imagine. They're the journalistic equivalent of a clip show. "
Criminal: Germany,"""The nineties"" was better than ""the 2000's.""  Once you got beyond, say, 2004, the hosts starting to pretend to be nostalgic.  

""Oh, remember Katy Perry?  Wasn't she cra-zay?""

""Arcade Fire was the last 'real' rock band""

""I miss Breaking Bad""

""The Flash Crash was insane, wasn't it?"""
Criminal: Germany,"I don't know. I suspect that if thjey were done, they would say so."
Criminal: Germany,I agree.
Criminal: Germany,"If you're in Canada, it's on CraveTV."
Criminal: Germany,I hate CNN. But I really enjoy these miniseries. Only thing I'll watch on CNN.
Criminal: Germany,"Of course, people actually watch CNN, you imbecile."
Criminal: Germany,"You might enjoy The History of Comedy. They did 2 seasons of it, and it's a lot better than I expected it to be."
Criminal: Germany,An odd question. There is no main protagonist in any of the shows. The person being interrogated changes every episode. The group of cops handling the investigation remain the same for every location (so 3 episodes). Whatever ongoing narrative exists is between those cops but 3 episodes isn't really enough for any sort of character building or any significant plot. The real storytelling of every episode is the events that occur during the interrogation.
Criminal: Germany,Would you say there is a main detective/protagonist in each country series? If so who would they be?
Criminal: Germany,"Nope, I would not classify any character as the protagonist. Every set of cops has a lead detective or someone who plays the boss of the others, but I don't think they are any more important than the other characters. It's possible that some of the actors may have more real life prestige and seniority over the other actors that could effectively put their name first on the title card, but again, no one character is more important than any others.

I'm very curious to know why you want to know this."
Criminal: Germany,I only watched UK and each episode had a different detective leading the interrogation so they all seemed to get equal screen time across the series.

I have a friend that came to me with an idea for an app. When you're a developer, everyone has an app idea and they want you to build it. This particular idea was one of the worst ideas I've ever been pitched. It solved zero problems and would have taken at least $5,000,000 to build. They told me my estimate was ridiculous. Some rich moron gave these guys $100,000 investment to build this thing in two months even though they had zero experience bringing any kind of software product to market.

Last I knew, they ran out of money and got one or two morons to continue working on the project for equity. They're about 2 years past their deadline and this thing will never see the light of day let alone make any money."

Best example is silicon Valley. The tech companies went from meritocracies to this weird thing where they'd push demographic diversity over competency



As a minority and person of colour myself I don't decry disenfranchised  people taking advantage of that system, indeed I do have a friend that got into Google based on both his skill but his minority status did play a part in being boosted an opportunity that may not have come to a white guy with the same skill set as him. BUT and it's a big but, you never know your real worth if you're hired as a pity hire and it can give a inflated self importance.



So that these tech firms saw how silicon Valley showed its mostly whit guys, Asian and Indian guys working at tech companies and somehow instantly concluded that's cos there's systemic racism and sexism is pretty ridiculous.

Criminal: France,Hope they got good guest actors for this season too. David Tennant and Hayley Atwell were great in the first season.
Criminal: France,"The German series was my favorite, they gave a really great performance and relationships between characters were the best. The French one was close to the British. It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts."
Criminal: France,Criminal UK had the best team in my opinion. They would make for a great multi-season series. Germany had some of the best acting and France was the most compelling. Spain was just aight...
Criminal: France,"Great news, and hopefully the other three are renewed as well."
Criminal: France,"Is the first season worth a watch (for any, all of the countries?). Think I watched the first one of UK and that was about it."
Criminal: France,"I loved all of the Criminal series.  I can't pick a favorite because they all held my interest.  I have several friends who want to see more of this series.  The second season of Criminal: UK was as good as the first season.  I'm awaiting the second seasons of Criminal: France, Criminal: Spain, and Criminal: Germany.  I wish it was on regularly because it's my favorite Netflix series."
Criminal: France,[deleted]
Criminal: France,"The first episode in the German series, the one with Peter Kurth, was among my top 3 of all episodes in the four series. The performance was great. I actually started watching 'Babylon Berlin' afterward because I read that Kurth was in the show. 


> It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts.

I'd disappointed as well, but still hope that the lack of news might be related to the pandemic-related shutdown and not because they cancelled them."
Criminal: France,I'll never forget a week or two after the UK episode about the people being smuggled in and left in the transport vehicle. The exact same thing happened in the news.
Criminal: France,I've enjoyed all of them.  Spain was my least favorite but it was still good.
Criminal: France,No comment.
Criminal: France,That episode was so intense.  I loved it!
Criminal: France,I think Peter Kurth did an excellent job.  That particular series stands out and it is partly because of his acting.
Criminal: France,Same. I remember hearing that as well
Criminal: France,I watched them all and enjoyed all of them differently. The voice dubbing was done very well. I hope we get multiple seasons for each series.

Fubo expressed regret over the episode and said in a statement it is focused on “ensuring that the incident is fully contained and that there is no threat of further disruption for any of our customers.”"
Criminal: France,Ha was wondering the same thing
Criminal: France,Back in the cable days if you had a full day outage you called and got exactly that. I sent fubo a message asking for one but I feel like the odds are pretty low in the streaming era. We'll see.
Criminal: France,[deleted]
Criminal: France,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Criminal: France,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Criminal: France,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Criminal: France,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Criminal: France,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Criminal: France,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Criminal: France,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Criminal: France,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Criminal: France,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Criminal: France,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Criminal: France,🙂💕
Criminal: France,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Criminal: France,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Criminal: France,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Criminal: France,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Criminal: France,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Criminal: France,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Criminal: France,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Criminal: France,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Criminal: France,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Criminal: France,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Criminal: France,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Criminal: France,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Criminal: France,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Criminal: France,"Give a try to Pataal Lok, McMafia, The Family Man (all on Prime). Seeing your list, I have a feeling you'll like these."
Criminal: France,"vouch for ZeroZeroZero the way the episodes are structured and shot were just incredible, really blew me away at points"
Criminal: France,"I'd definitely recommend Der Pass (also known as Pagan Peak), despite being the latest foreign spin off of Broen Bron (this time being between Germany and Austria) its an incredibly well made, well written series that plays very cleverly with the source ideas and features a lot of the beautiful scenery of the alps."
Criminal: France,"dude watch paatal lok, simply the best thing to come from indian web space. it's on prime. much much darker than sacred games."
Criminal: France,Babylon Berlin?
Criminal: France,"I honestly haven't watched this one, but Cocaine Coast (2018) could be a another series in your list. It is a Spanish series set in the 80s about how tobacco smugglers in Galicia turned into narcos. It is also based on real events."
Criminal: France,The Chalet is a six-episode French mystery series on Netflix that's wonderfully suspenseful.
Criminal: France,"Exellent list. And while it's not a crime show per se, but rather a spy thriller, I'd like to add [Le Bureau des Légendes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), which is simply the best series French TV has produced in the past 20 years."
Criminal: France,Amazing. Thanks very much. Great suggestions on the thread as well.
Criminal: France,Try Broen / Broen or The Bridge on Hulu
Criminal: France,You should watch Hotel Beau Sejour
Criminal: France,My dad loved The Sniffer. The premise sounds ridiculous but he really enjoyed it.
Criminal: France,"Thanks for the list! Will check out ZeroZeroZero and a few others, once I finish Money Heist."
Criminal: France,ZeroZeroZero is like if Gomorrah and McMafia had a baby.  I think you'll like McMafia very much.
Criminal: France,"In addition to *Spiral (Engrenages)* which you mentioned, I also enjoyed:

* 1) *Varg Veum* - A (mostly) serious Norwegian crime show, but some light humor mixed in with it.

* 2) *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (this is more of a light hearted, ""whodunit"" one, but I really like the humor and the cast, though fair warning, they do keep the sexism of the era in there, so you may find the main character a bit off putting at times, but that's kind of the point too). It is titled as *The Little Murders of Agatha Christie* in English. Almost forgot to mention it, but there are 2 separate shows under that name. I'm talking specifically Series 2, which is the one set in the 50s/60s. There's an earlier one with the same name in the 30s that I didn't get into. 
* 3) *Witnesses (Les Témoins)* - Another good, serious French show."
Criminal: France,"GREAT list!!! 
Gomorrah is a top 3 for me. Can’t get enough of it. 
Completely agree on Suburra, zerozerozero, spiral, sacred games. 

As others said I highly recommend Pataal Lok and Der Pass. Two of the best shows by far I’ve watched this year."
Criminal: France,"If you enjoy dirty cops, you might enjoy the film *Bad Lieutenant* with Harvey Keitel."
Criminal: France,"Thanks for all the recommendations, I feel I might spend a lot of this month sat in front of a TV, well, slightly more than the previous two months."
Criminal: France,"I loved Gomorrah, but I'm having trouble finding seasons 3 and 4 in the US. Does anyone know how/where I can watch it?"
Criminal: France,"You should watch De Dag (The Day), its a 12 part series about a bank robbery. The odd numbers are from the perspective of the cops and the even numbers from the perspective of the robbers 

It's a german series i think, really liked it"
Criminal: France,"McMafia was a really water-cooler show when it came out in the UK. Compelling series with James Norton as a fantastic lead.

Although, there is a lot of Russian and Hebrew dialogue - this is predominantly an English speaking show."
Criminal: France,"This will be my next watch, sounds great."
Criminal: France,I really like the sound of this one.
Criminal: France,"Good film, Keitel is brilliant in it."
Criminal: France,"Yeah, other than torrents or kodi, you might struggle.

Unless its on the new HBO platform?"
Criminal: France,"> McMafia 

Has the been any news on season 2? They renewed it and then nothing."
Criminal: France,"I've tried kodi, but there's always an issue with the subtitles unfortunately"
Criminal: France,"In 2015, Netflix was more like HBO than NBC. They used to take time and only release shows that passed whatever quality checks they had. Now it seems they pretty much buy any  show they can get their hands on, and hope something sticks"
Criminal: France,Where’s “You” ? It’s one of their biggest hits.
Criminal: France,Still can't believe they cancelled Tuca & Bertie & Sense8
Criminal: France,"I remember when I started watching OITNB, the fucking sensation it was, even in my very-conservative country. It had the raunchiest sex scenes that somehow surpassed GOT's, it was nominated for just about every award show in every category. Then the show itself started to fade in season 4 (which is coincidentally the same time Netflix started putting out hundreds of shows). 

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects. 

I'll forever be grateful that it housed Bojack Horseman, Dark, and a few others, but damn, what a fall."
Criminal: France,[deleted]
Criminal: France,"You left out dark, elite, la casa de papel, and other foreign shows that are extremely popular on netflix"
Criminal: France,Grace and Frankie is still the best Netflix original
Criminal: France,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Criminal: France,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."
Criminal: France,"One word: fatigue.

Be it netflix, be it the viewer. Somewhere fatigue is showing up."
Criminal: France,[deleted]
Criminal: France,You was originally a Lifetime show
Criminal: France,What does being a conservative have to do with it?
Criminal: France,"Looking at his lists, his definition can’t be very accurate. Also, if something getting buzz doesn’t really say anything. I’m not sure why you would use that as a factor."
Criminal: France,[deleted]
Criminal: France,yeah wasn't sure what comparison to make for a network that has a lot of shows but some gems in the dust. Was thinking USA or AMC
Criminal: France,"Here in Brazil it means being against things that are feminist, LGBT, etc. We're mistaken as a sex-positive, progressive country because of carnival but we're really not."
Criminal: France,Sabrina started in 2018
Criminal: France,An odd question. There is no main protagonist in any of the shows. The person being interrogated changes every episode. The group of cops handling the investigation remain the same for every location (so 3 episodes). Whatever ongoing narrative exists is between those cops but 3 episodes isn't really enough for any sort of character building or any significant plot. The real storytelling of every episode is the events that occur during the interrogation.
Criminal: France,Would you say there is a main detective/protagonist in each country series? If so who would they be?
Criminal: France,"Nope, I would not classify any character as the protagonist. Every set of cops has a lead detective or someone who plays the boss of the others, but I don't think they are any more important than the other characters. It's possible that some of the actors may have more real life prestige and seniority over the other actors that could effectively put their name first on the title card, but again, no one character is more important than any others.

I'm very curious to know why you want to know this."
Criminal: France,I only watched UK and each episode had a different detective leading the interrogation so they all seemed to get equal screen time across the series.
Criminal: Spain,Hope they got good guest actors for this season too. David Tennant and Hayley Atwell were great in the first season.
Criminal: Spain,"The German series was my favorite, they gave a really great performance and relationships between characters were the best. The French one was close to the British. It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts."

Criminal: Spain,"I saw that there are 'criminal' shows set in the UK, France and Spain. Is that correct?"
Criminal: Spain,"I'll definitely check out the U.K. episode for Tennant, but that may be the extent of it. I can get a little antsy even when shows I like, such as Line of Duty, spend a lot of time in the interrogation room.

But Mind Hunter did it well, so it's possible."
Criminal: Spain,"Every show is a cop show.  So basically Dragnet did it. And CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, Law and Order?  Dragnet remakes."
Criminal: Spain,"I'm so sick of all these crime/drama shows. Do some Scifi, or whatever."
Criminal: Spain,"In case you are confused: 

The show is technically four shows, with some shared creative DNA, which will be listed separately in the Netflix interface: Criminal: United Kingdom, Criminal: France, Criminal: Germany, and Criminal: Spain. George Kay and Jim Field Smith created all the versions, and all were filmed in the same studio in Madrid — on the same sets, in fact, with only the actors and the language to differentiate which country you’re in — but they tell different stories about different characters."
Criminal: Spain,And Germany
Criminal: Spain,There are way too many. Why are viewers so thirsty for these kinds of shows?
Criminal: Spain,Is there an order you’re meant to watch them in?
Criminal: Spain,"If they're all created by the same guy and filmed on the same set, I certainly wouldn't call it four different shows dude."

Although, there is a lot of Russian and Hebrew dialogue - this is predominantly an English speaking show."
Criminal: Spain,"This will be my next watch, sounds great."
Criminal: Spain,I really like the sound of this one.
Criminal: Spain,"Good film, Keitel is brilliant in it."
Criminal: Spain,"Yeah, other than torrents or kodi, you might struggle.

Unless its on the new HBO platform?"
Criminal: Spain,"> McMafia 

Has the been any news on season 2? They renewed it and then nothing."
Criminal: Spain,"I've tried kodi, but there's always an issue with the subtitles unfortunately"
Criminal: Spain,"Yeah, i’m spanish and this is one of the only good shows we have here and it’s so great."
Criminal: Spain,The first half of the season is great. Then it all goes downhill fast. Too much unnecessary soap-opera.
Criminal: Spain,"Watched the show with it's Spanish title, La Casa De Papel. Laughed at the English title when I saw it. Amazing show regardless."
Criminal: Spain,"I just finished the season last night and it is *damn* good. So many twists and turns, and the entire cast is fascinating. And without giving anything away, the last scene of season 1 is beautifully done.

The only thing is that the name “Money Heist” is garbage. House of Paper/House of Money would be so much better names IMO, and would be much closer to the original name.

I can’t wait to see season 2, hopefully it hits Netflix soon..."
Criminal: Spain,THIS is a great show ... highly recommended
Criminal: Spain,"If there's one thing I would NOT call the show, It's Fast Paced. Like, holy hell the second half of the show is so slow. I enjoyed it, but I highly doubt I'll still care enough about it enough to watch the second season when it comes out. 

"
Criminal: Spain,"Finished the first season in 2 days. Already watched 4 episodes of season 2 with awful english subs, no idea why Netflix takes forever to release it. But I take the awful subs because I want to know how it ends and can't wait forever"
Criminal: Spain,My whole fucking country is _obsessed_ with this show. I have yet to watch it but yours is probably the 356th time someone has recommended it to me. I'm caving in. 
Criminal: Spain,am currently watching the last episodes and tears tears.
Criminal: Spain,"> On 25 December 2017, the first part of season 1 premiered internationally on Netflix, though the season was re-edited into 13 episodes instead of the original number of nine episodes. 

Anyone who has seen both versions, what is different ? Which version do you think is better ? [NO SPOILERS PLEASE] "
Criminal: Spain,"Netflix has it dubbed over in English. I’m currently mid-season and it’s AMAZING. Once you get over the dubbing not matching their mouths moving, it’s so easy to binge watch it. 10/10 would recommend!"
Criminal: Spain,"been hearing a lot about this. think i might check this out. maybe... in a month or so.

but apparently Netflix only have the first half and it is cut differently from the original?? "
Criminal: Spain,[removed]
Criminal: Spain,"amazing show.. I love all bank robbery movies and this show tops most of em!
"
Criminal: Spain,[removed]
Criminal: Spain,Money heist Netflix. Thanks for the recommendation OP! 
Criminal: Spain,It was fantastic in general but the ending was a bit disappointing.
Criminal: Spain,That’s why it’s gotten high praise on this sub nonstop
Criminal: Spain,"are they making a second season? 

also are these actors well known in your country? NOne of them have international recognition, but they really do a great job. "
Criminal: Spain,"Actually its not the only one (or at least for me), like please, Vis a Vis or Las chicas del cable, there are some good shows, the problem is that we don't really notice them."
Criminal: Spain,Call Me Francis is also in Spanish and very good. It’s about the pre-papal life of the current pope. Just wanted to throw this your way. 
Criminal: Spain,"Exactly this, they should edit a solid 3 hours out so it comes in at 10 episodes. Could only make the show tenser "
Criminal: Spain,"Watched the first episode, does it get better?"
Criminal: Spain,"> The only thing is that the name “Money Heist” is garbage

haha! yeah, if these same people made a porno it would be called 'sex porn' "
Criminal: Spain,Those are better translations but way too close to House of Cards
Criminal: Spain,"huh? I looked it up right now, and it's called ""La casa de Papel"", ""House of paper""

Is it because I'm in Mexico?"
Criminal: Spain,">House of Money

Looks like Germany for once has a proper translation then (Haus des Geldes). They usually are pretty shit, sometimes even ""translating"" the titles into English just differently worded

"
Criminal: Spain,Season 2 coming out April 6th!
Criminal: Spain,"Hey so I came here after finishing the first episode and I am SHOCKED at the near universally positive reviews. 

[My opinion, spoilers](#s ""I thought they set the show up so well. The first half of the episode was brilliant them preparing for the heist then we are just thrown into complicated relationships with obvious and painful exposition. (like really, the father and son having a heartfelt ""oh you havent handed out a resume, youre not successful. We arent that smart""? 1. Youre going to do this now? during the heist? 2. With no introduction to the characters there is absolutely no meaning or weight to this... its just two random dudes talking. Im not invested in the characters at all. Not even to mention the woman who apparently loses her love and then breaks one of the only rules involved in them receiving a 300M payday in order for a fuck?"")

I LOVE thrillers and heist movies/books but after the first episode I dont even know if I want to continue watching...

PS, sorry for the formatting. I couldnt get the spoiler tag to work without making that brick into one paragraph"
Criminal: Spain,Those subs are decent: http://tvsubs.net/tvshow-2742-2.html
Criminal: Spain,Where are you from?
Criminal: Spain,"The cutting of episodes are different :
Part 1 : 13 episodes Netflix (40-50 minutes) for 9 in Spain (1 hour). The original version is better. "
Criminal: Spain,"That annoys me, tried watching 3% dubbed and just couldn't handle their lips not matching so instead I watched it with English subs and loved it even though it was in Portuguese. "
Criminal: Spain,I watched the whole thing in dubbed English. Easy to get used to and watch...
Criminal: Spain,Yeah they have 2 seasons in one season more less
Criminal: Spain,"In Spain 2 seasons aired. Netflix will have 2 seasons too.
They just split the episodes differently.

In Spain 9+6 and Netflix 13+6 (but same total running time)."
Criminal: Spain,"There is already a second season maybe in netflix usa there’s only one.
The actress that plays Tokio is kind of well known the others not so much."
Criminal: Spain,"I've heard that the second season is coming to Netflix in early April (I think I saw the 6th?). I couldn't find a source, but thats the date floating around."
Criminal: Spain,"In Spain the second and final season has already aired.

Something interesting they did, as the original episodes were 70 minutes long, was to split the 9 episode first season into 13 episodes. "
Criminal: Spain,"Thanks, i’ll check it out."
Criminal: Spain,"I was hooked after the first episode, so it might not be up your alley. "
Criminal: Spain,"Yeah, that’s probably true, but there still has to be a better name than Money Heist, surely."
Criminal: Spain,Yeah. The title stayed the same for spanish-speaking countries.
Criminal: Spain,Maybe? The name on Netflix is “Money Heist” at least in the US.
Criminal: Spain,"Oh, sweet, thanks! I didn’t realize we had a confirmed date!"
Criminal: Spain,"I mean, I don’t know what to tell you. The stuff you mentioned is stuff that sets up some of the character arcs for the season. You’re not going to have the fully formed characters right in the first episode of the show, and the show is going to still introduce its subplots. If you continue with it, you’ll find a unique and interesting take on the heist genre, especially if you like the first half of the episode."
Criminal: Spain,"I'd say Netflix version is better because you get to watch more opening sequences and hear more of the end credit song! Both are very hype-ish.

But it really doesn't matter much since you're likely to binge it anyway!"
Criminal: UK,Absolutely floored by Kit Harington's performance in episode 2. He portrayed 2 very different attitudes at the beginning of the episode and at the end. The man has range! I sincerely hope more people come to see he is far more capable than they realize.
Criminal: UK,"Can't believe there isn't more talk of this. Wonder how popular it is? Great show from just dialogue. Good little backstory going on too.

Watching first one now."
Criminal: UK,I’ve just watched episode 1 and 2. Loved it! Still very impressed at how much drama they can cultivate from just dialogue.
Criminal: UK,Just finished. Really wish there was more than 4. The show is really quite brilliant in a minimalist sort of way. All dialogue and acting.  Episode 2 with Kit Harrington is really good as is the 4th with “Raj Koothrappali”.   It’s too bad they didn’t bring back the other countries too. The German one was the best of the bunch.
Criminal: UK,"Just finished it. What a brilliant, refreshing show. No weak episode, and felt like it had something to say. The acting is incredible.

One scene that stood out to me was the solicitor explaining to Kit Harrington's character the [spoiler](#s ""legal importance of the medical report""), it's so emotional and well done.

I've loved all of the different Season 1 shows as well (which also had Germany, Spain, and France). I'd recommend this show to just about everyone."
Criminal: UK,"If you're going to watch one of the standalone episodes, watch episode 2. The writing is excellent and I love how they show that text ""he just kissed me"" could be read in so many different ways to prove a narrative."
Criminal: UK, Sophie Okonedo deserves some award for her acting. Absolutely incredible
Criminal: UK,"Just finished s2 e2.
That episode has left me shook.
Kit Harrington was amazing, and so was the writing. 
I was constantly back and forth, wondering if he was innocent or not.


I was glad to hear he was, because highlighting false rape allegations is a very important topic that can ruin peoples lives, for both men and women.


His speech about putting the flat back to normal, was heartbreaking, as his whole life was just torn apart, over something he did not do. It highlights the unfair justice in the world and shows how the system can seriousoy fuck you.


Amazing. 10/10."
Criminal: UK,"Loved it.

I had no idea that was the Big Bang Theory actor.

I hope the other countries do theirs soon."
Criminal: UK,Episode 4 is BY FAR the best ep in criminal uk as a whole and on par with Germany
Criminal: UK,"Brilliant episode with Kit Harrington.   
However it is one that lingers in your mind for some time afterwards with feelings of outrage because this is the harsh reality that countless falsely accused men have to deal with and try to overcome.  
It's especially disgusting to see so many closet-accusers denouncing it however. These people are certainly concerned that their actions are finally getting the daylight they have long been lacking..."
Criminal: UK,"Really good actors can do wonders with just dialog.

Technical note: the first season was amazing for image quality and sound design, this second season streaming is highly  compressed to the point of looking out of focus sometimes."
Criminal: UK,I really wished there were 4 more episodes of Criminal: Germany
Criminal: UK,"I thought they were awesome. Casting was great, though Sophie and Sharon were the front runners. Though it took me half way watching the last one to realise that guy was Raj from Big Bang. 
Kit’s episode had a good perspective, shows the dark side of #MeToo."
Criminal: UK,"Episode 2 was amazing. However it highlights an inconvenient truth that no one wants to admit, the toxicity of #metoo movement. Not taking anything away from genuine victims, but there are countless cases where men have been subjected to pre-determined public judgement which has completely destroyed their lives in a way no one can imagine. And the false accuser somehow always get off scot-free without repercussions. Until there is a law that punish these fake assault allegations, nothing is going to change."
Criminal: UK,Kunal nayyar was awesome in last episode. Really good bunch of episodes.
Criminal: UK,Loving it. Can anyone explain the end of episode 3 though!? How come it ended there!!!
Criminal: UK,"*SPOILERS* Kunals episode was so clever, his character was so arrogant about being a good business man, he’s trying to hardball them into taking 4 years off his sentence but in his negotiation he actually ends up incriminating himself further and adding at least another 14 years on top, shows that he must have been like in business in real life, the subtlety of it is beautiful. He has a classic narcissistic personality"
Criminal: UK,I’ll be back lol planning on watching today
Criminal: UK,"Finally watching. What struck me is that in ep 2, the suspect is distraught over what just rumors and assumptions (of being arrested) are going to do to his life. 

Then in ep 3, they are fighting against a suspect using assumptions that are ruining people’s lives."
Criminal: UK,"Spoiler: can anyone explain what the lead detective meant when she said to Tony ""don't you get it? Haven't you had enough clues by now?"""
Criminal: UK,"I absolutely loved watching Criminal UK. It's so different than American crime shows, and you could never do a US version."
Criminal: UK,"I've watched all but the third so far. Liked the first one, although predictable; loved the fourth one, lots of twists and turns.

&#x200B;

However, I hated, deeply hated the second episode. There will be a backlash and there already is: [https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a34036826/criminal-netflix-uk-season-2-kit-harington-rape/](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a34036826/criminal-netflix-uk-season-2-kit-harington-rape/)"
Criminal: UK,The actor for every suspect always puts on a stellar performance
Criminal: UK,"They should just bring back Germany tbh, the other countries were somewhat forgettable or cheesy. The german cast was excellent."
Criminal: UK,That second episode did a fantastic job exposing implicit bias on the part of law enforcement and the disadvantages the system leaves both the accused and accusers with.
Criminal: UK,"And this is how lawyers work, in a nutshell :)"
Criminal: UK,I think I gasped out loud while watching that one.
Criminal: UK,"I also think it was a good choice to make his character not especially likeable. It would be easy to feel badly for a nice guy wrongly accused; far less so for an arrogant, kinda douchey guy. 

He nailed that part."
Criminal: UK,"Agree with you, this episode make me ponder on how life affect when you have been accused to false rape . The world already saw you been arrested in public. This really left me bitter since we can’t undo the consequences that happen after although he isn’t guilty. Somehow I can understand why he is so mad since it’s not his fault but then again police just do their job."
Criminal: UK,"Reminds me of a heartbreaking story of a man arrested for child pornography and talking to children online. They arrested him and seized his computers, he couldn't see his children, lost his job. Eventually they dropped the charges and said nothing else. The man was furious about what they had done to his life and wanted an explanation.  


It turned out that the police had mistyped the IP address when requesting his info from the ISP....by a single digit. They never apologized or explained this to him. For some reason, a man falsely accused of rape is still treated like a criminal even when he turns out to be innocent. This guy still gets weird looks and some friends don't talk to him anymore. They wouldn't give him his old job back either."
Criminal: UK,I was hoping the next episode would be called Sarah.
Criminal: UK,It’s much different acting from Kunal Nayyar in episode 4. I’ve never seen him not being funny. Love this show!
Criminal: UK,"Shit I just watched that episode, and didn't even realise it was him. Something felt familiar about him, but I couldn't quite pinpoint it"
Criminal: UK,"Weird, I would place S2E4 as the weakest of season 2 and the second weakest in the series as a whole after S1E3. 

Otherwise I absolutely loved season 2 and I was glad the show returned to the bar it set with S1E1 and even exceeded it with Kit Harington in S2E2."
Criminal: UK,"I would rather believe someone who ends up being a false accuser than someone who might be a rapist. False accusers will be punished by the law, be patient."
Criminal: UK,"I think through the two seasons it’s hinted that he wants to ask her out, all his discussions with Vanessa, and i think at the end she’s basically asking him out for a drink and he doesn’t get that she likes him too"
Criminal: UK,"In no way does the 2nd episode imply that all women are like Sarah. In fact the female law enforcement officers did not want to believe she lied & falsely accused because it's so statistically unlikely and they found the very idea vile. 

*""I don't want to believe a woman would do this""* after the previous episode literally dealt with a woman who committed murder.

The Fact is False Accusations do happen, yes they are rare but they happen.

The episode had good nuance 

\- just because we think someone is a jerk doesn't mean they are guilty of a crime

\- Just because they are a woman does not automatically mean they are telling the truth, #BelieveAllWomen while well intentioned is dangerous as it is quick to paint things in black & white before actually investigating.

Also the vast majority of television almost never depicts the woman lying about a sexual assault, and rarely are they the perpetrator. Because these things are rare but showing them doesn't somehow perpetuate the stereotypes.

Heck the episode actually showed how the officers were judging Kit's character off of stereotypes with their implicit bias."
Criminal: UK,"The police didn’t have to arrest him in public, esp at his job, but ofc police ego assumes precedence over carefully yielding the best outcomes for all involved. Seems like a no brainer to arrest such suspects quietly at home, but that’s exactly how we know the police will never actually adjust their policies to this🙄🤮"
Criminal: UK,"It's so insane you just can fuck up someone's life on false accusations, and you don't have to do anything to help him get it back. Guessing suing the police won't do anything good"
Criminal: UK,Totally agree with you and that's what I thought.
Criminal: UK,"Totally agree!  I immediately said, ""huh?"" After Sandeep explained how the boy's ball came into his yard, he wacked him, had time to bury both bodies, and no one even checked the yard next door, or where he was last seen playing? Was the kid throwing the ball to himself?  Did his caregiver not notice him missing for many hours?  He was young enough that people would search quickly.

The yard had to look freshly dug in and then the guy had time to pack and skiddadle before anyone got suspicious? No one ever searched yard to yard? No search dogs? Very thin writing there. Sandeep being presented as clever only to tell on himself accidentally got me too. Then straight up confession."
Criminal: UK,"Thing is though False Accusations are SO RARE compared to actual accusations and convicted rapists. So many women will have been sexually mistreated and in the misogynistic society we live in just thought oh, well that's how life is. 

also I know so may people who have been coerced in to sex / sexual acts who will never get any justice. 

Episode just took too much of a ""but what if I'm innocent"" stance, when we barely have any good strides in changing the outlook on coersion and sexual abuse in society and actual punishment."
Criminal: UK,"Nowhere does it say that Sarah is lying. Nowhere does it say that Claire was lying. She might have been victime of sexual misconduct by her boss, they gave her money to shut her up and avoid tarnishing the company reputation, and she went on holiday far away to forget about the ordeal.

When she said that to Sarah, she could have means: ""Let's go on holiday to relax like last time"".

&#x200B;

Furthermore, if the message is ""you thought he did it because he looks like a prick, but not all pricks are rapists"", then it's a very very lame episode. Criminal is a smart show, the message can't be that simple."
Criminal: UK,"Like I said

>the vast majority of television almost never depicts the woman lying about a sexual assault, and rarely are they the perpetrator.

In the very first episode of the show, the man is guilty of rape. Other men in this series are guilty of crimes as well.

But the one time the show doesn't definitively answer ""Who is the guilty party?"" somehow validates sexual violence or perpetuates harmful stereotypes?

So the automatic assumption is that the guy did it? *""He's a man, who's possibly sexist, therefore he must have committed assault.""* 

You do see the fault in this thinking yes? That is going in with an assuming mind set. ""Guilty until proven Innocent"". You assume you know everything there is needed to know and you disliked that it at all contemplate an argument for his innocence.

The fact is that we do not actually know, the cops do not actually know which is why they let him off - because they are going to be watching the both of them to see if a pattern emerges, hence why they did not state that he is innocent. They need more evidence.

Also just because false accusations are rare doesn't mean they don't happen. Showing a **possible** false accusation on a television show does not in any way validate sexual violence or poor treatment of women."
Criminal: UK,"even the article you linked came to the conclusion that Sarah could very well have been lying.

We learn that when Claire did not get a promotion, she accused sexual assault and got money out of it. We learn Sarah tries the same thing at the suggestion from Claire. 

Sarah says she didn't get a promotion and Claire suggests getting a ""pay day"" out of it.

I don't know about you but I would not think of someone who was sexually assaulted to act so cavalier about the whole thing, like a promotion would justify it or a vacation would somehow get rid of the trauma.

The police had an implicit bias, they judged the scenario to be one thing because they were looking at the surface.

An example: Examining the text ""He just kissed me"" - we see both of their perspectives on what she could mean.

Is it ""I'm mad he assumed he could kiss me."" or ""I'm mad he ONLY kissed me."" ?

Sure he lied to Sarah about not loving his girlfriend but that doesn't make mean he attacked Sarah.

But it's this kind of discussion that the episode was supposed to put out there. How do you solve a case when it quite literally comes down to ""He said, She said"" who were both drunk ??

That's the message, there is no easy or simple answer to those scenarios and both people involved will be tarnished for the remainder of their lives, no matter who is really guilty."

I agree with you, this is the kind of discussion the episode was supposed to generate. 

I didn't say Sarah is telling the truth. I guess I'm just irritated at how easily most people agree that Alex is innocent, a girl ruined his life, and cops don't care about the damage. It's much more complex than that. 

Not getting a promotion certainly doesn't justify lying about sexual abuse. But then again, we don't know if Claire was lying or not. 

You ask ""I don't know about you, but going on a vacation wouldn't get rid of the trauma"". Well I'll you about me. I was raped when I was 18, and just after it happened I took a trip to the US (I'm from France) to visit national parks and connect with nature. I will never forget the trauma. But I needed to get far away from what had happened. 

Regarding the text ""He just kissed me"", it could be interpreted different ways. We don't have the complete timeline of the events, so maybe she sent that text while still at the bar. The angry emoji might not be related to the kiss at all, or if she was drunk she might have used the wrong emoji, we all have done that. 

What doesn't make sense is that she says he forced himself on her less than four minutes after arriving (timing of the song); when would she have had the time to send the text to her friend if she was being assaulted? 

If I went on a date with someone I like a lot and want to have sex with (never happened but I'm trying to picture a situation), but then not much happens and he and I go home afterwards. I would have texted my friend: ""He ONLY kissed me."" And I would have used a sad emoji. 

The episode also shows that it's not a he said/she said situation; we have only access to a ""he said"". We have the report, but we don't see her, her demeanor, we can't form a decent opinion."
Criminal: UK,"Genuinely thought the second episode considering it is so rare that actual rapists get convicted decided to go with the shitty South Africa Holiday money grabbing thing? It just made it seem so terrible and whiney for men and just so backwards in strides forward for victims, a big show on Netflix perpetuating the idea that people will accuse of rape to benefit from it when its hardly ever the case. The acting was brilliant though."
Criminal: UK,False accusation happens and I'm glad they put a spotlight on it.
Criminal: UK,"False accusation is so rare, just belittles victims the whole episode personally"
Criminal: UK,"So, what you are saying is that you don't see false rape allegations as a problem? Just say it, you hate men."
Criminal: UK,"It's not that rare we aren't talking about 1 in 100,000 or even 1 in 1000. Studies and reports from many places put it at somewhere between 2-10% that's 1 in 50 up to 1 in 10 even the low end is a fucking scary prospect. There are so many issues when it comes to cases of rape or sexual assault the low conviction rate, apprehension of police to go court, the grey area cases where one person genuinely feels like they were a victim of a crime and the other genuinely believes they had consent. It's a messy area with many problems and one of these is the reality of false allegations and the consequences they have no matter what happens."
Criminal: UK,Yes 💕
Criminal: UK,There you go! Your problem is not with this show but because you have daddy issues.
Criminal: UK,There's a word for that. Sexist. Now fuck off bigot.
Criminal: UK,My problem is that the show decided to make someone seem guilty and even not remorseful for it turn to around and say ha ha MONeY grabbing women !! ~ also the fact that rape culture and misogyny is just such an issue too and just false accusations are such a little issue
Criminal: UK,It is not a 'little issue' tho! Lives are being ruined because of evil women who wants to use rape as a weapon for personal gain.
Criminal: UK,"I’m talking about rarity of it and the fact that rape and misogyny just are major issues in society in general, False accusation is terrible but the show decided to go with the evidence is very hard to get both ways, which was good until they decided the bungalow thing, they left it open ended, there was insufficient evidence the character wasn’t innocent or guilty, if that was the plan why give such a piece of evidence that made women seem evil? It just didn’t make sense, every other piece of evidence explained that there were two sides to a story?"
Criminal: UK,[deleted]
Criminal: UK,"It’s a TV show, I feel like they could have portrayed it better, also the character wasn’t innocent or guilty that’s the point, and yes patriarchy is bad not sure why you’re trying to belittle what I’m saying"
Criminal: UK,[deleted]
Criminal: UK,"I can tell you’re a man just by your attitude and clearly the way you think is part of the problem. If you speak to a lot of women they will tell you (well probably not you because of your attitude) but they will say how common sexual assault / sexual harassment is and it’s ingrained in society, most women just have to put up with it / won’t report a rape because nothing will come of it."
Criminal: UK,[deleted]
Criminal: UK,"Oh my fucking god you just admitted to be a sexual harasser hahahahahahahahhahaha, also just to let you know the world changes, women probably found that uncomfortable, and just speak up about it more now, I’m actually a 24 year old male, and calling out misandry is hilarious considering you’re a sexual harasser x"
Criminal: UK,[deleted]
Criminal: UK,"When I was 13/14 I didn’t go around randomly touching girls :) ! It’s different now, sexual harassment is still very ingrained but it’s getting called out, if that makes u uncomfortable then you clearly need a lot of self reflecting to do, I don’t hate men btw, I just understand that the society we live in was created by white men and they benefit from it and carry on living in the benefits while people suffer 🥴"
Criminal: UK,"Probably the best episode of the series so far, or tied with the David Tennant one; the final 7 or so minutes were phenomenal, gave me chills. The writing was just incredible and Kit Harington did a fantastic job with it."
Criminal: UK,Hmm might check it out just for him
Criminal: UK,I just watched this episode. It was so good!!
Criminal: UK,"Had anybody watched the series from France, Spain, or Germany? How are they?"
Criminal: UK,"It's hilarious because just for the past couple of days, I saw people riding on his acting and I just finished the episode and the last 7 minutes or so had me in goosebumps. Fantastic episode."
Criminal: UK,"Added season 1 to my list when it came out and I still haven’t got to it, oof"
Criminal: UK,"The writing of the episode has been criticized, btw. Look at 
https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a34036826/criminal-netflix-uk-season-2-kit-harington-rape/"
Criminal: UK,His portrayal of Jon Snow landed flat for me.  Jon Snow the character was super important.  The performance was way down the list compared to others.
Criminal: UK,Especially when the next episode was about protecting someone that was falsely accused
Criminal: UK,The one with the dude from Big Bang THeory was really good too imo. My two favorites from this season. David Tennant's episode being the best of the first season.
Criminal: UK,"You can watch his episode first, the 2nd episode of the second season. It's definitely the best episode of the series so you'll get hooked. After that binge the rest it's just 7 episodes anyway in total"
Criminal: UK,You should watch the first episode with David Tennant. Hooked immediately!
Criminal: UK,My thinking too.
Criminal: UK,"All three series are good; especially the German series. 

Guest stars like Peter Kurth & Sara Giraudeau gave outstanding performances."
Criminal: UK,It proves that no matter how respectfully the topic is covered it'll spark some BS controversy. The episode was fantastic and brings up a real issue.
Criminal: UK,I don’t understand the point of this review? So because the outcome of the episode wasn’t what they ( the writer of the article) wanted they deemed it dangerous for the real world? Isn’t the whole point that every story has two sides and the idea of leaving it ambiguous means it’s up to the viewer to interpret the ending? I thought it did what it wanted to do perfectly and wasn’t encouraging any bad behaviour nor losing respect for genuine rape cases in the real world. This is TV.
Criminal: UK,The concept of that article seems to indicate you are only allowed to show one side to a story and thats pretty arrogant and narrow minded gotta be honest
Criminal: UK,Early on for sure. I feel like he really grew as an actor though. The writing just fucking sucked
Criminal: UK,"He did the best with what he was given. Early seasons he was not that strong, but IMO he really grew as an actor during his time on GOT."
Criminal: UK,Is each episode standalone?
Criminal: UK,Episode 4 is also very good.
Criminal: UK,No comment.
Criminal: UK,"yeah, it is tough to separate his improvement from his character being written like shit for the show at the end"
Criminal: UK,"Yes, each episode shares the same cast of detectives and the show itself takes place entirely inside of the interrogation room. There are other versions of the show like Criminal France, and Spain, with the same format.

Havent watched season 2 yet but i did binge season 1 and enjoyed it but it might not be for everyone"
Criminal: UK,"There are very minor plot threads involving the police characters that carry through the season, but the episodes are 99% stand alone."
Criminal: UK,Good episode but think I liked epi 4 with Raj from Big Bang. Quite the departure. Creeper
Criminal: UK,Why do people cast his wooden ass? His delivery has always been so monotone.
Criminal: UK,I really enjoyed how they cast people against type and let us see such different sides to their acting. Apparently Kunal reached out to the showrunner and asked to be on it.
Criminal: UK,Watch 7 days in hell
Criminal: UK,You're not wrong
Criminal: UK,Didn't think it was that funny really.
Criminal: UK,Hope they got good guest actors for this season too. David Tennant and Hayley Atwell were great in the first season.
Criminal: UK,"The German series was my favorite, they gave a really great performance and relationships between characters were the best. The French one was close to the British. It's a pity if they cancelled non-English speaking parts."
Criminal: UK,Criminal UK had the best team in my opinion. They would make for a great multi-season series. Germany had some of the best acting and France was the most compelling. Spain was just aight...

The Hockey Girls,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
The Hockey Girls,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
The Hockey Girls,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
The Hockey Girls,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
The Hockey Girls,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
The Hockey Girls,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
The Hockey Girls,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
The Hockey Girls,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
The Hockey Girls,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
The Hockey Girls,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
The Hockey Girls,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
The Hockey Girls,What business have you with Seamus!?
The Hockey Girls,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
The Hockey Girls,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
The Hockey Girls,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
The Hockey Girls,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
The Hockey Girls,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
The Hockey Girls,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
The Hockey Girls,"“Am I dead? Is this my wake?” 
Love that show"
The Hockey Girls,"This is a fact.

It’s 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It’s wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
The Hockey Girls,"i’ve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it’s easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it’s short and sweet, but i’m still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
The Hockey Girls,"Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during “The Troubles”. Very unique."
The Hockey Girls,"It’s one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle’s mom saying “sorry I’m late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn’t”"
The Hockey Girls,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
The Hockey Girls,Love Sister Michael!!
The Hockey Girls,"I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
The Hockey Girls,truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
The Hockey Girls,I’ve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them “I was right there off screen!” Lol
The Hockey Girls,"I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
The Hockey Girls,"It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
The Hockey Girls,Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
The Hockey Girls,"I’m American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90’s, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it’s just so, so fucking funny. I’ve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
The Hockey Girls,I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
The Hockey Girls,Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
The Hockey Girls,i want more Sister Michael.
The Hockey Girls,"Just started this last, loved the first episode"
The Hockey Girls,Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen…. Brilliant!
The Hockey Girls,Sister George Michael stole the show.
The Hockey Girls,Show is absolutely cracker
The Hockey Girls,"It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
The Hockey Girls,"I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
The Hockey Girls,100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
The Hockey Girls,Orla’s belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I’ve watched.
The Hockey Girls,"The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
The Hockey Girls,"One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
The Hockey Girls,I love their accent
The Hockey Girls,"I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
The Hockey Girls,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
The Hockey Girls,Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland’s contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
The Hockey Girls,"It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
The Hockey Girls,Love it
The Hockey Girls,I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
The Hockey Girls,"ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It’s well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
The Hockey Girls,"I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
The Hockey Girls,What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
The Hockey Girls,I’m a Derry Girl!!!!
The Hockey Girls,"I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
The Hockey Girls,"The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they’re all off celebrating their prom."
The Hockey Girls,That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
The Hockey Girls,100%.  it's fantastic.
The Hockey Girls,Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
The Hockey Girls,"I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
The Hockey Girls,I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
The Hockey Girls,Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they’re in. That’s a rare trick and a treat to watch.
The Hockey Girls,I just started and it's a treat.
The Hockey Girls,You aren’t wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
The Hockey Girls,"Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
The Hockey Girls,i’m here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
The Hockey Girls,"Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
The Hockey Girls,Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it 😂
The Hockey Girls,"I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I’m almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
The Hockey Girls,The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
The Hockey Girls,I am orla
The Hockey Girls,"My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
The Hockey Girls,"Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."
The Hockey Girls,[removed]
The Hockey Girls,"I've said this multiple times and I'm going to say it again because I just do truly mean it - Derry Girls is at the same level as The Office, one of the best shows of all time. Infinitely rewatchable and endlessly funny."
The Hockey Girls,"Watched it through for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I fully agree. It has so much heart and so much character. Would have loved more episodes, but that would have prob ruined the magic."
The Hockey Girls,"I didn't grow up in the 80s/90s Northern Ireland but was born in the 90s and pretty sure I knew a girl who looked nearly identical to Michelle in secondary school. My parents told me stories about growing up during the troubles, Derry girls got it pretty much spot on you just get on with it. The example I love, that my dad told me, is a song written by the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers, ""Bloody Sunday"" (released 3 years before U2 song by a similar name) which you think would be about the tragic event but no... It's about how there's nothing to do in Northern Ireland on Sunday! (No shops etc open on Sunday until I think the early 2000s)"
The Hockey Girls,"Sister Michael is absolutely fantastic, I love her dry responses to everything! 
It really does the nostalgia well. I grew up in the ROI during the 90s and 00s and remember the troubles and the atmosphere even down south was similar to the one up north.

Anyone planning a trip to Derry should go to the free Derry museum to learn about the troubles from a civilian point of view."
The Hockey Girls,"Wife and I loved it. Not sure who my favorite character is, though. Maybe Uncle Collum?"
The Hockey Girls,Jeez am I the only one who that it was... Average? Watched season one and thought it was like a juvenile Irish sex education. Hardly a thigh slapper.
The Hockey Girls,Honestly despise this show. The one girls acting and facial expressions kill me.
The Hockey Girls,"The last season wasn't as good as the previous ones. The series finale special was bad and the post-credits scene with Chelsea Clinton (yeah, that Chelsea Clinton) was down right embarrassing."
The Hockey Girls,"schitts creek - derry girls - ted lasso
imo the trifecta of perfect shows with literally nothing wrong with them, incredible writing, hilarious, not strung out etc"
The Hockey Girls,Season 3 was dog-shit. Felt like a half-hearted 'tie it up and forget about it' move. Season 1 and 2 were awesome though.
The Hockey Girls,Shame about the new season. I thought all the characters nedflandered.
The Hockey Girls,alrighty then
The Hockey Girls,Its great. They really need to make more episodes for a season.
The Hockey Girls,I thought the last season was a bit Shit but the first two were absolutely excellent
The Hockey Girls,[deleted]
The Hockey Girls,"Up to episode 4.  Struggling.

Its not objectionably bad, but basically all the main characters are annoyingly overacted.

I enjoyed then in-betweeners (obvs the most comparable…) and a wide range of other comedic styles but this just isnt doing it for me so far.  The only reason im oressing on is I keep seeing threads like this.

I seear, if I get halfway through aeason 2 and its still just as bad, Im coming for your pickle jars."
The Hockey Girls,"I just watched it.

Extremely generic, not of one of the best bits of television"
The Hockey Girls,L
The Hockey Girls,I was going to try it out but the trailer on Netflix seemed absolutely terrible
The Hockey Girls,"The trouble with saying what's best about Derry Girls? By the time you're done, you've listed everything about the show."
The Hockey Girls,"I laughed hard at the pilot, I didn’t laugh like that with the rest of the episodes but it is a good show to watch"
The Hockey Girls,Is this the girls version of the inbetweeners?
The Hockey Girls,Love the show. Is there a new season coming out?
When the Camellia Blooms,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
When the Camellia Blooms,The visual of Joel’s wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
When the Camellia Blooms,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
When the Camellia Blooms,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
When the Camellia Blooms,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
When the Camellia Blooms,[removed]
When the Camellia Blooms,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
When the Camellia Blooms,So was the implication that they were eating the girl’s father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
When the Camellia Blooms,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
When the Camellia Blooms,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
When the Camellia Blooms,[removed]
When the Camellia Blooms,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
When the Camellia Blooms,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
When the Camellia Blooms,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
When the Camellia Blooms,“I made you eat your parents”
When the Camellia Blooms,the actor for david did a great job
When the Camellia Blooms,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
When the Camellia Blooms,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
When the Camellia Blooms,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
When the Camellia Blooms,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
When the Camellia Blooms,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‘own’ her as his pet at his side. I’d recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
When the Camellia Blooms,"I’m seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
When the Camellia Blooms,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
When the Camellia Blooms,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
When the Camellia Blooms,"""Baby girl"" 🥺 

Gonna go weep brb"
When the Camellia Blooms,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
When the Camellia Blooms,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
When the Camellia Blooms,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
When the Camellia Blooms,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
When the Camellia Blooms,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
When the Camellia Blooms,"Indicative of David’s character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else’s

Edit - 4x’s the cannibalism"
When the Camellia Blooms,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
When the Camellia Blooms,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
When the Camellia Blooms,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
When the Camellia Blooms,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
When the Camellia Blooms,[removed]
When the Camellia Blooms,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
When the Camellia Blooms,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, “baby girl.”"
When the Camellia Blooms,I’d nit pick Joel’s recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn’t so fucking awesome
When the Camellia Blooms,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I’d expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
When the Camellia Blooms,"""I believe  him"""
When the Camellia Blooms,100% that kid’s dad was the ear
When the Camellia Blooms,Oh yeah. That’s that shit I like right there
When the Camellia Blooms,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
When the Camellia Blooms,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
When the Camellia Blooms,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
When the Camellia Blooms,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
When the Camellia Blooms,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
When the Camellia Blooms,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season 😬"
When the Camellia Blooms,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
When the Camellia Blooms,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn’t others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
When the Camellia Blooms,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in “it’s okay baby girl” was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, “In an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.” And damn if Joel and Ellie aren’t stainless steel survivors."
When the Camellia Blooms,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
When the Camellia Blooms,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
When the Camellia Blooms,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I’d just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
When the Camellia Blooms,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
When the Camellia Blooms,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
When the Camellia Blooms,I counted 22 stabs…damn Ellie
When the Camellia Blooms,Great episode overall. I wish they could’ve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
When the Camellia Blooms,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
When the Camellia Blooms,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
When the Camellia Blooms,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn’t still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind 😳
When the Camellia Blooms,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
When the Camellia Blooms,If you’re gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
When the Camellia Blooms,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
When the Camellia Blooms,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
When the Camellia Blooms,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
When the Camellia Blooms,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
When the Camellia Blooms,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
When the Camellia Blooms,"I’m curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
When the Camellia Blooms,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
When the Camellia Blooms,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
When the Camellia Blooms,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
When the Camellia Blooms,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
When the Camellia Blooms,[removed]
When the Camellia Blooms,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
When the Camellia Blooms,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
When the Camellia Blooms,Ellie’s screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
When the Camellia Blooms,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
When the Camellia Blooms,"As someone who’s never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It’s hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I’ve seen in ages, and am loving it."
When the Camellia Blooms,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
When the Camellia Blooms,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
When the Camellia Blooms,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
When the Camellia Blooms,That went by so fast
When the Camellia Blooms,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
When the Camellia Blooms,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
When the Camellia Blooms,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
When the Camellia Blooms,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
When the Camellia Blooms,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
When the Camellia Blooms,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
When the Camellia Blooms,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
When the Camellia Blooms,"“It’s okay baby girl, I got you” I AM NOT OK"
When the Camellia Blooms,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
When the Camellia Blooms,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
When the Camellia Blooms,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
When the Camellia Blooms,Fuck.
When the Camellia Blooms,"Jesus, that was intense"
When the Camellia Blooms,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
When the Camellia Blooms,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
When the Camellia Blooms,"I love that they focus on the more human element of these situations, it’s really a character driven program and you can’t have as much action as the game since it wouldn’t be realistic.

But damn after Joel dropped that “Don’t worry I believe him” line and just murdered the other dude, I’m not going to deny that I’d love to see more of Joel just being a badass out here."
Transformers: Cyberverse,This is a bad idea
Transformers: Cyberverse,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*

Transformers: Cyberverse,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
Transformers: Cyberverse,so what would be a better idea to you?
Transformers: Cyberverse,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
Transformers: Cyberverse,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
Transformers: Cyberverse,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
Transformers: Cyberverse,more scooby doo
Transformers: Cyberverse,[deleted]
Transformers: Cyberverse,was that supposed to be funny?
Transformers: Cyberverse,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
Transformers: Cyberverse,this entire post is a joke no?
Transformers: Cyberverse,[deleted]
Transformers: Cyberverse,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
Transformers: Cyberverse,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."

The Last Kids on Earth,Hail to the king baby.
The Last Kids on Earth,"Sorry, but hearing Bruce Campbell’s voice sans seeing his glorious chin...

The Last Kids on Earth,"The books are actually quite good. Read all 4 of them to my 6 year old in just a few weeks and he loved them. Besides the fun kids-battling-monsters premise, the characters have more depth to them than you might typically find in this genre. I can't wait to see them turn it into a show."
The Last Kids on Earth,It's funny because of global warming

The Last Kids on Earth,Oh good
The Last Kids on Earth,"Having read the first compendium, if I had to guess, I'd say Cecil Stedman, the government agent who acts as Nolan and Mark's handler. Seems like a very Hamill-esque role."
The Last Kids on Earth,"Could have sworn this was coming to Amazon. I've actually read one of the books and it's good if definitely for children. Seems like they are skewing close to the art style of the books (it has heavy comic elements), if they stick close to the writing as well it should be a solid kids cartoon."
The Last Kids on Earth,"I know this is for kids, but shouldn't there be a little bit, more, uh, gravitas?"
The Last Kids on Earth,This is Awesome.
The Last Kids on Earth,9 year olds being your target audience shouldn't be an excuse for hack writing.
The Last Kids on Earth,That's weird thought it was a tv series but it's just one hour long book?  Interesting.
The Last Kids on Earth,Seems misnamed.
The Last Kids on Earth,"Apparently they decided to release the first ""book"" as a 1 hour special, but the next book will be 10 episodes.  

EDIT: That's according to [this website.](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/when-will-season-2-of-the-last-kids-on-earth-be-on-netflix/)"
The Last Kids on Earth,"Wait, really? If so, the people at Netflix are fuckin' idiots. I sat there waiting for the second episode coming out today and my son got all hyped for it. The IMDB page even still thinks it's gonna be several episodes long. I assumed ""Book 1"" is just like they have with other shows where they don't simply call it 'Season 1' and it'll have more parts/chapters to ""Book 1"".

I'm not convinced they won't be releasing more. That hardly seemed like a wrap for a whole season if it was broken down into parts. I mean, they announced all this voice talent and none of them debuted in that 67 minute video."
The Last Kids on Earth,"> Watch them both you will see.

Nice try, Netlix rep. I will watch neither."
The Last Kids on Earth,"I saw the trailers and sat down and watched Daybreak, and to me, they're exactly the same as [The Tribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJxlR0Un4Ik)(1999)."
The Last Kids on Earth,Hahaha smart
The Last Kids on Earth,Ok i wrote that at one thirty in the morning I can see how it looks. Maybe juat watch the first 5 minutes. They have the same narration style and same major plot points. Its like Netflix just kinda gave up on original ideas to the point where they made the same show twice with diffrent ratings.
The Last Kids on Earth,"""Just watch the first five minutes. Just long enough for Netflix to count it as having watched the show"""

The Last Kids on Earth,Colin looked legitimately heartbroken. :(
The Last Kids on Earth,"Her sketch with Bill Hader as her old boyfriend ""Boris"" is probably one of my favorite sketches they've done."
The Last Kids on Earth,Anyone noticed she finally got that damn cigarette lit on Weekend Update?!
The Last Kids on Earth,"Strong:

>Ten and a half years ago I got my dream job. The first actual work day I tried to be very cool and make it look like I knew what I was doing and I was supposed to be there,” she said. “I left that night around 11 after saying goodbye to everyone. I got stuck wandering around the building because none of the elevators went to the first floor and I was trying so hard to avoid having to go back upstairs to ask for help because I’d already said goodbye!!!”

>I’m sorry I’ve been a little quiet about it publicly. I didn’t want the extra pressure on something already so emotional for me, and I’m so grateful I got to have these wonderful past six shows to help me ease into it and get to meet and laugh and probably overly hug Molly, Marcello, Devon, and Michael who I think are not only brilliantly funny but really great humans. I am ready to go, but I’ll always know home is here. I’ve had the time of my life working with the greatest people on earth."
The Last Kids on Earth,"Was shattered she didn’t do a final Judge Piro or drunk girl at party you wish you didn’t start talking to, but it was a lovely send off"
The Last Kids on Earth,Loved the porn star sketches
The Last Kids on Earth,"I love that she got 2 sendoffs in the show, I'm really going to miss her on the show, and seeing  Colin look so sad at the end broke my heart."
The Last Kids on Earth,I can’t wait for the next season of shmigadoon
The Last Kids on Earth,"So bummed to see her go, I’ve got such a crush on Cecily. She’s immensely talented and I love her confidence. I’m sure she’ll land some quality roles outside of SNL."
The Last Kids on Earth,"sucks to see her go - especially with all the other departures, it was like ""well at least they still have Kenan and Cecily""

oops."
The Last Kids on Earth,"My wife and I quote the original Blue River Dog Food sketch daily. 
It’s perfect and she’s perfect in it."
The Last Kids on Earth,"Cecily Strong and Kate McKinnon are two of SNL's greatest performers. Both could do practically any character in any sketch.

SNL had a lot of talent during the 2010s. Eager to keep seeing the new crop of performers, but the last decade is a tough act to follow."
The Last Kids on Earth,wee bit strange with austin butler in the middle of it all after a solid week of knowing her.
The Last Kids on Earth,Move over charity volunteers! You've been replaced by \*checks notes\* Kenan Thompson? Is that right?
The Last Kids on Earth,What show is she talking about?
The Last Kids on Earth,I’m glad to hear the people at SNL are so great . . . I just wish they were funnier
The Last Kids on Earth,"“Then I realized that this show hasn’t been good in ten years. So I bounced, bitches.”"
The Last Kids on Earth,who?
Pawn Stars,“Rebirth” — Just because networks are pumping out cheap reality programming doesn’t mean anyone is watching it.
Pawn Stars,Cheaters feeds on human misery and embarassing people and a lot of people don't like those types of shows.
Pawn Stars,I guess Cheaters never prospered
Pawn Stars,because people take it too personally. they can see themselves in that situation and it scares or creeps them out.
Pawn Stars,"I actually agree that Cheaters is better than the shows you listed but that doesn't matter when it comes to popularity.

Cheaters sensitive subject matter gives it less widespread appeal than these other shows.

Also cheaters(in my experience, correct me if I'm wrong) always aired when many people were at work/school, which limits the potential audience."
Pawn Stars,"There is a genre of reality TV that I call ""trashy""... Maury. Any judge show. And cheaters.
I know some people love the trashy shows.  But they make me cringe SO hard.  I imagine some people feel the same way so the show had a huge disadvantage to start with"
Pawn Stars,"Cheaters was unrelated to these.

It was more in the vein of the generic/fun dating shows, like third wheel and dismissed and whatever that blind date one where they put funny captions on the screen was. The premise was different, but at the time it was released it was in this bucket, not the ""Reality TV"" bucket."
Pawn Stars,"Survivor and American Idol don't really belong in that list. The appeal of them is that they're competitions, with an eventual winner and people being eliminated along the way. They're very different than all the others you named. Cheaters is also pretty different than the others in that it changes cast, the others follow the same group of people. People won't get invested the same way if people are in one episode and then gone."
Pawn Stars,Staged but entertaining.
Pawn Stars,"A lot of it was fake, and it was a misery to watch. Peak cringe.

Pawnstars is fake but it is positive TV.

To Catch a Predator was cringe and people committed suicide. 

The Kardashians are famous because they keep banging famous black guys.."
Pawn Stars,"I mean, that’s like exactly what shows Maury, Jerry Springer and cops do and they were best hits."
Pawn Stars,Well done Sir.
Pawn Stars,Well it did and didnt. Obviously they made money as they are still on the air 20 years later. But you look at how certain reality shows blow up hugely popular and I am blown away Cheaters never got that way in terms of popularity. Its so good. I can't believe a boring biker show like Sons of Anarchy was more popular than Cheaters.
Pawn Stars,"How is it trashy? They are exposing bad people and helping innocent people who got cheated on.  


 A trashy show is like these ones where they celebrate teen moms and glorify it which makes a bunch of dumb high school girls go out and get themselves pregnant and adds to the overpopulation and increases our tax dollars."
Pawn Stars,"Those shows did have some balance, at least for a while. It’s more watchable if some uplifting stuff is mixed in."
Pawn Stars,"Wait...you think it was real?!

> The producers of Cheaters currently reiterate the reality of each episode in a legalistic message at its end, though a Federal Communications Commission representative confirmed to the Houston Press that **""there's no law or regulation against presenting acted-out scenarios as reality on television.""**

Several people who’d been on the show, were tracked down. They said they’d been paid around $400 per episode, by a detective from the agency, to appear on ‘Cheaters.’ Furthermore, they received $50 for referrals of other actors."
Pawn Stars,"From the snippets I've seen it's usually trashy people.    Just like maury or judge Judy.  It's people acting poorly educated or are really poorly educated.  
A person of ""class"" would not want their dirty laundry aired on national television.  THE HOST GOT STABBED FOR PETES SAKE.  This show isn't the creme of the crop"
Pawn Stars,I would imagine the cheaters got paid because in some episodes the cheaters faces and blurred out and named not revealed. In other episodes they have the faces and names revealed. So if the got paid that means they gave consent to use their likeness.
Pawn Stars,Unlocked memory when he got stabbed on a boat.
Pawn Stars,"That sucks, I always enjoyed when he interacted with the customers. Customer: ""I'd like to get X for it""  Old Man: ""No."""
Pawn Stars,He was **only** in his 70s? The guy looks like he was 94
Pawn Stars,"""Get back to work"" - Old Man"
Pawn Stars,*The grim reaper negotiating with The Old Man* “the best I can do is 77” 
Pawn Stars,"That's really sad.

He really had perfect comedic timing on that show.

It's quite the life he lived, in the Navy for 20 years during the Vietnam War/Cold War. After went into business opening a Pawn Shop with his son. And then thanks to that pawn shop becoming a Reality TV Star and huge Celebrity.

Now that's a full life!"
Pawn Stars,[deleted]
Pawn Stars,"He was kind of funny when somebody brought an old antique toy in, he loved old toys. RIP swabby."
Pawn Stars,"""I'd like to live to 100""

God: ""Best I can do is 77."""
Pawn Stars,Did the Coroner bring in a 2nd expert to get their opinion though?
Pawn Stars,"RIP. He always drove a hard bargain.

And as someone who had seen some episodes of their newest season it was pretty obvious something was up, the old man was appearing less and less on the show/not at all"
Pawn Stars,"People love to shit on this show, and in recent seasons the skits have gotten a little too staged, but I don’t think there’s a single show I’ve spent more time watching on rainy weekends"
Pawn Stars,"Seeing as how he passed away, it would be nice if the History Channel ran an all-day a Pawn Stars marath- *oh right*. "
Pawn Stars,May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil's friend who's an expert in old men knows you're dead
Pawn Stars,77? Holy shit. Dude looked terrible for his age.
Pawn Stars,He was pretty much the only guy on the show that was fun to watch.
Pawn Stars,I found it weird he wasn't shown at all in later seasons.
Pawn Stars,"Every time an old celebrity is posted, I feel it necessary to remind people that Sean Connery and William shatner are both 87."
Pawn Stars,"Bummer, his hatred of bullshit was always a super funny addition to the show."
Pawn Stars,"""I don't know much about death or caskets or anything like that. I got a buddy that deals with this stuff all the time. Let me get him down here and see what we can find out."""
Pawn Stars,I’ll miss him just not his wet bottom lip. 
Pawn Stars,Rick’s phlegmy cough makes me think he’ll be joining the old man sooner than later. 
Pawn Stars,77?! I thought he was pushing 90 Jesus. 
Pawn Stars,"Noooo, my dad will be devastated, he loves that show and the Old Man was his favorite one :("
Pawn Stars,"In lieu of flowers, please send Super Bowl rings. "
Pawn Stars,"Old Man was sneakily not that old. He did serve in the Navy for 20 years though, RIP."
Pawn Stars,"I heard Rick negotiated 50&#37; off the funeral service.

Seriously, I love the show.  The Old Man was part of the funniest moments."
Pawn Stars,"He reminded me of my grandpa, tough exterior with a dry sense of humor and you could tell he had a heart of gold. "
Pawn Stars,"This guy had that old school aloofness where you could safely assume he's been a part of some wild shit in his past. RIP,  what a fun way to make millions of dollars. "
Pawn Stars,I'm sure the comments here will be respectfu- nevermind
Pawn Stars,Aw man poor guy. At least he got to live life big.
Pawn Stars,Are they still making new eps of Pawn Stars? 
Pawn Stars,"It'll be $5,000 for funeral services

-Rick "" I'll give ya $36"""
Pawn Stars,"""I want to live forever.""

""Best I can do is 77."""
Pawn Stars,I can’t believe he was only 77.
Pawn Stars,Vinnie Paul and Old Man in less than 5 days.  Fuck this week sucks!  Rip to both of them.  Las Vegas is a sad place today.
Pawn Stars,Good night sweet prince
Pawn Stars,"Id pay my respects, but the best i can do is 1/2 of a respect."
Pawn Stars,Old Man died the same week I find out Olivia (the night shift woman) does amateur lesbian porn? The Lord giveth and The Lord taketh away. 
Pawn Stars,"Can you imagine his son trying to get pricing for funeral arrangements?

""Funeral Arrangement package is $12,000?  I'm sorry, I can only offer $3.50"""
Pawn Stars,Are they gonna get a buddy in to expertly assess the body? 
Pawn Stars,"At his funeral we can all play ""Count the Organized Crime Figures""."
Pawn Stars,RIP you funny bastard. People like you are a dying breed
Pawn Stars,"""I ***worked*** here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss""  :\^\["
Pawn Stars,I always thought he'd been dead for years and they just put strings on him to move an arm occasionally with dubbed audio.
Pawn Stars,I blame Chumly. He had all the motive 
Pawn Stars,I've been to the shop in Vegas. I felt like they should have left some show items or high demand collectibles in the location. The only interesting items I saw there were a collectible car & a portrait of Jim Morrison.
Pawn Stars,The best he could do was 77 years???
Pawn Stars,Holy shit he was only 77? Watched that show from what feels like up to 10yrs ago and he looked like death then. 
Pawn Stars,he looked way older than 77
Pawn Stars,guess he's gonna have to call in an expert on coffins
Pawn Stars,"77? I'll tell you what, best I can do is 40.

OK let me have my guy come in, he has some background in old men. "
Pawn Stars,He’s in the big pawn shop in the sky now 
Pawn Stars,this death hit me the hardest so far this year
Pawn Stars,"He wills....
- Rick the six 5 gallon buckets of pennies. In one of the buckets is a 1943 copper, promise!
- Chum Lee gets the Old Man's share of the business....let hilarity ensue as the reading must be broadcast live"
Pawn Stars,"I would have guessed he was in his 90's
"
Pawn Stars,He was only 77? Not trying to speak ill or whatever but i would have guessed he was in his eighties at least. 
Pawn Stars,Rest in peace
Pawn Stars,"Hold on, I got a buddy who's an expert on dying. Lemme call him first..."
Pawn Stars,77? Best I can do is 54.
Pawn Stars,"ITT: HE WASN'T ACTUALLY FUNNY THAT WAS ALL TV MAGIC TRICKS

thank you internet geniuses now I see the light"
Pawn Stars,Best he could do was 77. Just here to pay my respects. F.
Pawn Stars,"Why isn’t this bigger news?

I’d expect something akin to the global outpouring of grief over the death of Princess Di."
Pawn Stars,Honestly he was the best part of the show IMO. He also had a nice taste in cars
Pawn Stars,I live in vegas. He used to drive like a dick. 
Pawn Stars,"R.I.P. but honestly, I thought he was at least 85.  I'm really surprised."
Pawn Stars,"What you wanna do boss. Pawn it, sell it, donate it. Lmao RIP to the old man I admit haven't seen the show in awhile but he was always one of my favorites. Rest well. "
Pawn Stars,Now they are going to want two to three times more for those old man one ounce silver coins. Will never forget the episode were they say he is hoarding copper pennies and has several 5 gallon buckets full. Except they were all filled with new pennies and the U.S. Mint stopped using copper for pennies in the early 80s because of the cost.
Pawn Stars,"Aweeeee, he was funny "
Pawn Stars,"I’m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss, and in 23 years I’ve learned one thing. You never know what is gonna come through that door."
Pawn Stars,"I wonder if when they went to the funeral parlour, they had to get their 'buddy' in to look at the coffin, then offered to buy it for $20."
Pawn Stars,Press F to pawn respects.
Pawn Stars,So is history going back to showing ya know... actual history now?
Pawn Stars,"""Disgusting human being who made a living by praying on the less fortunate in their most desperate times of need passes away."""
Pawn Stars,The only person on that show I thought was worth being on TV. 
Pawn Stars,This show is so blatantly scripted it's not even funny.  How people can enjoy this man drama is amazing 
Pawn Stars,(F)
Pawn Stars,That show literally ended educational television in America for the next twenty years. The obese son was 26 during the show's filming but he looked 49. I hate those disgusting clowns.
Pawn Stars,F
Pawn Stars,"Can someone share the tale of how he started the pawnshop?

I remember in one episode he said something like there were only limited licenses to start a pawn shop in earlier times and they got one lucky.

Not sure about the second paragraph."
Pawn Stars,Rip old man 
Pawn Stars,I bet he left behind a treasure chest full of silver coins. 
Bakugan: Battle Planet,This is a bad idea
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
Bakugan: Battle Planet,so what would be a better idea to you?
Bakugan: Battle Planet,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,more scooby doo
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,was that supposed to be funny?
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,this entire post is a joke no?
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"And yet the same television puts on a news show about important topics like climate change and feels the need to include some oil industry shill or quack scientist to give an ""opposing"" view."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Bakugan: Battle Planet,This was a great read.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Delta state was the shit!
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,It was on both actually
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Bakugan: Battle Planet,So I guess there’s no Community movie announcement. God damnit. How dare they? God damnit all to hell
Bakugan: Battle Planet,please don’t let the BotP movie be a “comedy”.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The fucking 80s indie comic?! Jesus Christ, what a time to be alive. It feels like every month there's an announcement teenage me would have been astonished by. I'm not very familiar, had a few late run bargain bin issues I flipped through mostly for the art but if this can go into development is there any genre property too small to be given a chance?"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Not Gatchaman? Damn. So there will be that annoying little robot and all the gripping drama will be cut out?
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Jon Ostrander cashing in!
Bakugan: Battle Planet,BOTP has the most amazing theme tune.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I followed a live blog of the whole thing. They came in following a sizzle real of their own stuff, using Community, AD & Marvel footage, announced all of their stuff and never brought up Community. So disappointed."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I repeat: *how dare they*
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Grimjack may get a series?  Grimjack is one of the best comics no one has heard of.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I really enjoyed the first two seasons and then it went off the rails for me.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I enjoyed the show up to its end. Say what you will about the final three seasons, but they were not quite as repetitive as the conflicts that kept repeating themselves in the first four years. The body-swapping and time-jumping reinvigorated the series in my opinion. Season 5 also introduced Diyoza, who was one of the best characters in the entire series, and I found the Blood Reina stuff also fairly interesting. What I personally liked about The 100 was that the show was always willing to get very dark, whether that's characters committing genocide or eating human flesh.

The Bellamy thing in the final season is likely impacted by some behind the scenes stuff with the actor, same way as Lexa had to die when the actress became unavailable. Personally, I also wouldn't say that The 100 was a character-driven show. It was primarily a plot-driven show. That is why characters like Bellamy shifted alliances various times through the series, not because it made sense for the character, but because the plot required it."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The sky people vs grounders conflict kept me invested for the first half of the show. When that conflict resolved my interest started to dip. 

It was almost like the creators thought there had to be 2 warring factions at any given time. Oh grounders and sky people are living under the same roof? Here's some space prisoners. Space prisoners and former characters escaped earth together? Here's some body swappers."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The last episode was crap, but otherwise I enjoyed all seasons."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"We've seen the seasons leading up to prima fyre.  We started the season after that with the prisoners crashing to Earth.

This season feels too much like a reboot.  Like most of the past doesn't matter anymore and they are wholesale introducing new characters.  I've just lost interest."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The 100's greatest sin was how it killed off some of its biggest characters 


Spoilers ahead, I get that Lexa's actor had to be killed off because she got a leading role in Fear the Walking Dead and couldn't do both parts, but the way it happened was not good. The same goes for Bellamy. He died for no reason and it all ended up feeling like a very cheap way to shook the audience


The first season was a bit too much teen drama for my taste, but the show kept me interested throughout all its seasons. The final season didn't go down in history as the ""best final season ever"", but it was good enough. 


The 100 is also some of the darkest and most brutal shows I've seen om American network TV. I don't know how they managed to keep the TV-14 rating on all the episodes. Some of them had some seriously mature content"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,i didn't make it past season2 IIRC. it started strong but i feel that they took a left turn with the concept
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I would say to the end of season 5 was fine even if this season wasn't up to par with the rest. Season 6 was the nail in the coffin for the series with the Sanctuary storyline. The final episodes tried to fix the last couple of seasons but by this time it was to late. Was the final eradication of the valley a Earth apocalypse or just the valley? If it was the valley only why not travel somewhere to the other side of Earth?
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The first season was increasingly good as it went on, season 2 was excellent, and then it completely fell apart in season 3 with horrendous writing full of plotholes and characters not acting according to their established characterization, forcefully writing in scenes purely for shock value regardless of how it hampered the plot or wrote them into a corner, expanding worldbuilding in spots only to fail in filling it out afterwards, leaving it shallow and at times nonsensical. It only got worse from there on out, even after they rebooted and effectively gave themselves something of a clean slate. It somehow managed to even get worse instead of them figuring out how not to repeat past mistakes.

It's not surprising when the behind the scenes stuff leaked that the showrunner's grudges were ruining the writing room's work, with Rothenberg sometimes axing whole scenes last minute, cutting out all the lines for some characters even if that material would have made the scenes worthwhile, etc. (one clear example is Ricky Whittle's character Lincoln, but there have been other characters impacted similarly)"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Eh I loved pretty much the entire series, despite its flaws lol.  I generally felt s6  was better than most of s5. The ending was dogshit, to the point that it was almost comical lol.  Still one of my all time faves tho."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The 100 was my favorite CW show until Season 5. The heart of it was them dealing with the Grounders, once they all became one tribe it was all downhill there.

Season 5 was bad, especially when it came to Octavia. Season 6 was good but it should’ve ended with the Primes going away and them truly getting a fresh start to end the series. Instead we got Season 7 which was a real disaster, that finale was one of the worst I’ve ever seen.

I need to rewatch it soon and I like those later seasons better now."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Every subsequent season of this show miraculously made the previous season look genius by comparison..
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"too long; didn’t read

But I did watch six seasons and it was a complete turd. Truly the worst thing I’ve suffered (and often laughed) through."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Was that the show where they were literally killing people off in the first episodes on the planet, where everyone had lots of things like assault rifles, and where their ""survival"" for even 24 hours was in question because they were so useless and at war with each other from the start and didn't have the brains to properly defend and/or move?

I got pissed off with it very quickly, because it was similar to a story I'd had in my head since I was a kid, and it started off (for a very short time) as really promising and pretty much the same story, and within literally one or two episodes (less than 24 hours of ""real"" time) it just was about blowing each other away and being in a war that was totally avoidable.

I couldn't work out if it was a kid's thing or a teenager thing or an adult's thing.  It was too pathetic for any one category in any given episode."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Up to season five, the show was fine. It declined after season 3, but it was still serviceable. And they could have stopped it there. There was even a nice ending for it.

But then season six happened, and I wanna die. That season (and season 7) were so abysmally terrible that I cannot for the life of me recommend them to my worst enemy."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,This is true for most cw shows
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I didnt like some bits of it but overall was good
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I read a few of the books - which were good.
I watched the first few seasons but stopped. I saw prima fyre and then stopped watching."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I also enjoyed it, but I think it went the same way as other sci-fi shows. Gets better each season, peaks, tries to switch up drastically to keep audience engaged but ultimately fails. In the end, it embraced the wackiness and went off the rails, but it remained good fun."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I actually really enjoyed the entire thing. I can recognize that people will find the final season controversial. But for me it drove home the themes of the show and wrapped up some of the dangling threads from earlier seasons. It's not a perfect show, but it took risks. And I'll take that any day over a show with a writing team that just phones it in."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,The last season still makes no sense to me after a few watches
Bakugan: Battle Planet,The last two seasons were just a crappy Stargate SG-1 ripoff.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Season 4 was the perfect ending but thankfully the later seasons didn’t ruin the earlier ones, like some other shows…"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,[deleted]
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Lasted too long
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"What!? Some pople actually liked The 100?

Whats wrong with you?"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"That’s pretty much exactly where I bailed on the show. It mixed teen drama, post apocalypse, and sci-fi pretty well. You’re absolutely right about it treating the audience like adults."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,More and more I’m just watching the first season of something and then moving onto something else
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I don't like season 5 but season 4 ending was not a proper ending for the show, season 5 ending was the perfect point even if the season itself was lackluster.

Though, even though I don't like the real ending of the show I find it admiring. It is such an anime/manga ending, it was refreshing on that regard. Western shows don't go that crazy with their endings usually."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Never watched it because I was and still am pissed about The 4400
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Five was fine, they should have quit while they were ahead. I’ll defend Book 1 all day and say Book 2 needed to be all about Cadogan and more spaceship visiting those colonies without portals. Spin-off attempt was a mistake, couple critical errors in B2 means it’s never getting watched again, again"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I feel like this can be said for majority of The CW shows they are great or good for about 1-5 seasons and then they should have ended or been canceled.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I’ve been trying to finish it up but it just keeps changing directions.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I enjoyed it to until Season 2 or 3.  I forget which.  It started very CW teen drama show, then improved.  Then I felt became way to teen drama again.

But it was good for a CW show.  Shorter seasons really helped."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,My people
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Huh? Some of the best moments in that show were way after Season 2 and I think the reviews reflect that.

Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8rPw2V_Vg)."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I'm pretty bummed they didn't pick up the prequel
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Its the CW. 

nothing else to add.

I both happy and sad they didnt pick up the B5 pilot."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"God awful????? What are you smoking??? Smallville(although didnt start on cw), Arrow, flash, legends of tomorrow, supergirl, the 100, Nikita, supernatural, originals, TVD, charmed, beauty and the  beast, izombie, black lightning, containment. All great shows!!. 

Ones that were great that sadly cancelled/ended too soon are: frequency, Valor, tomorrow people. 

As for the 100 id more so say it got bad mid season 6+"
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Um you could maybe say that season 7 was a step back but everything up to then was awesome. I am one of the  less heard parts of the extremely toxic fanbase that actually thinks that season 5 would have been a terrible place to end the show. There simply were way too many plot points and un resolved character conflicts (Octavia and Kane/Abby) for the show to end there. Same with season 4, you can't tell me you didn't want to see what happened to those in the bunker. I think ultimately the reason why the very vocal fans scream that the show should have ended after season 5 is because of the tonal shift away from the central themes of 1-5. 6 is still dark but it does feel like a slightly different show with how colorful Sanctum is, but just it's different does not make it bad. The main conflict went from being Clarke and friends against some big bad and ended up as Clarke and friends against each other because of the shifting priorities in season 5. And this bled into seasons 6-7.

Also, the fandom is what creating the shipping. This is not nor was it ever about who gets with whom. This was a survival, sci-fi television show. Frankly the shipping in The 100 fandom drove all of us non-shippers insane. We actually got to discuss interesting topics about life, ethics, and morality before all the shipping took over everything. 

Season 7 was still good. There were just some writing decisions I didn't like. As for Bellamy's death, I honestly couldn't see his story ending any other way. All the death and violence around him really messed him up. He thought he was saving his friends, and he was, and he did. Also I applaud you for mentioning him dying because of Madi, but Madi gave herself up without knowledge of how far Cadogan would go. Clarke shooting him was for the same reason she left him to die in season 5, he chose his priorities over his promise to protect Madi."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I enjoyed the whole show. From start to end. I was actually depressed when it ended, after that many season I was fully invested."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Season 7 episode 4 might have been the best episode tho
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"Same sentiment for me, I watched those first two seasons eagerly week to week and was pleasantly surprised again and again. Season 3 hit and I struggled to keep up but eventually sat down and finished it after it aired but it was a grind. A couple of episodes in to s4 I couldn't watch anymore, just felt like a drastic drop off when compared to the first two."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"I totally agree.  I honestly watched it because it was mostly filmed 20 minutes from me , which I found cool , and the leads were hot.  But it was a good story and interesting , I kind of wish , now , that I stuck with it for a bit longer after hearing some stuff about it."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,After season 2 it became soft core porn.
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I wholeheartedly agree
Bakugan: Battle Planet,"The minute the AI showed up at the end of S2, my expectations tempered for S3. I was subsequently disappointed by s3, held on until s4, and finally gave up. It was apparent it was going to keep hitting the same beats over and over again. Should have stopped after S2, when it peaked."
Bakugan: Battle Planet,I love how the slow time planet got used as a prison. Like the same cabin could serve hundreds of years worth of sentences and never have two groups there !
Bakugan: Battle Planet,Diyoza was a wonderful character and I sincerely hope that actress gets more work. She helped create someone you hated for a season in a half and then became an empathetic individual.
The Rap Game,"Yeah, because it's fucking long."
The Rap Game,"Kinda have to. I could be misremembering, but Part I is around 16 hours long, Part II was more like 35/40 hours, even if a lot of those events are concurrent

Edit: apparently I remember it being longer than it actually is! Still, I think it benefits from being approached as multi season arc, as someone who likes the vast majority of it"
The Rap Game,"I feel like part 2 could be adapted as two shorter seasons of 7-8 episodes, with hopefully a quicker turnaround. It'd suck to have to wait two years between seasons 2 and 3 after the likely 2 year wait (optimistically 18 months) between seasons 1 and 2."
The Rap Game,"I’m curious where the split will be in-between seasons. Unless season 2 is going to be all >!Ellie hunting Abby and end with Abby confronting her at the theater, but I don’t know if they’re going to do the POV switch in the show because it could seriously dissuade show-only members if a season 3 starts and they only see Abby every week for over a month. Paralleling their days in the same episodes seems like a better fit for the medium.!<

Also I’m guessing they’re going to add a lot to the show because even thought Part 2 is twice the length of Part 1, it has a lot of extended combat scenes (moreso than Part 1) that will likely be taken out. I can see them fleshing out >!some of the side characters like Yara, Jesse, and Isaac were who fairly one-note in the game, and give more backstory to the Seraphites since they felt like set dressing for the most part.!<"
The Rap Game,If I don’t see the >!Rat King!< I will stop watching 🐀
The Rap Game,"That was obvious but what I'm curious about will be the timeline. Will they keep it like the game or make it more linear? Either way after season one, I trust them."
The Rap Game,"Third season will be the NG+ playthrough where the story is the same, but all the gun stats are maxed out from the beginning."
The Rap Game,I really hope they keep the crane
The Rap Game,"Hope they keep the rope puzzles, I loved those."
The Rap Game,Part I really needed that extra runtime as well.
The Rap Game,"This sounds like they’ll be able to give it room to breath and maybe it’ll give them a chance to structure the story  in a way that feels a bit tightly focused. I love the story they told with the game, just feel like the way they told it could have been re structured a bit to work a bit better."
The Rap Game,"Makes total sense. If the pacing is about the same as Season One, Season Two could comfortably take us to the natural ""inflection point"" that anyone who's played the game can appreciate.

Part II is a more complex story with a larger cast of major characters. Would definitely feel rushed if compressed into a single season."
The Rap Game,"I don’t like a lot of the choices from part II, I think a few changes here and there and it can be received much better. 

It will probably still be an absolute shitshow online like when the game released."
The Rap Game,Really wish the first season was longer
The Rap Game,"I hope they take their time with it. This season has felt a little too rushed, in my opinion."
The Rap Game,"This season was good but as it went on it felt like they were rushing through the plot and the finale felt just a little hollow as a result, almost like I was watching a catch-up summary for the next season. Doesn't help that every show now has to be 10 episode seasons or less. Looking forward to starting the game and getting the full effect."
The Rap Game,[removed]
The Rap Game,It was a significantly longer game so that makes sense.
The Rap Game,I still think they could have made Part I into two seasons. Maybe not 10 episodes each season but something like 7-8.
The Rap Game,"So I haven’t seen the show yet, but for those who have, is season 1 part 1 only?"
The Rap Game,"All of yall thinking where to cut in the video game, but im guessing they could go the hobbit route and randomly introduce a love triangle between side characters. 

Oh lord"
The Rap Game,"Absolutely hated Part 2 for personal reasons, but if they decide to adapt so that >!Season 2 is Abby’s background and story, maybe leave out the part that intersects with Joel and Ellie first so that new fans don’t know who she is and they get to bond with her character and then either end Season 2 with their initial confrontation or start S3 that way and have the entire season focus on their conflict!< I would give it a shot.

Main reason why I didn’t like Part 2 was >!The way they wrote Joel’s ending!< and >!the game’s ending!< being absolutely disappointing for me. But I hope they make it work somehow."
The Rap Game,The drop off of viewers is going to be interesting after a certain event.
The Rap Game,"everyone working ""spoilers not spoilers"" into their comments, suck, for those of us who didn't play the game, and are just trying to enjoy the story presented by the show"
The Rap Game,"Huge spoiler take

>!show dies when joel dies!<"
The Rap Game,This last episode felt rushed with 9 episode season for sure
The Rap Game,Why don't they just make a couple seasons that explore what happened between the games?
The Rap Game,This show started off amazing. I got bored as the season went on. I’ll watch season 2 but I’m not excited about it.
The Rap Game,"I personally didn’t really think Part 2 was that good, but I can definitely see it being handled a lot better in a television series format, especially considering Part 2 will be stretched longer to make everything feel more developed and complex."
The Rap Game,"a 3 season show feels about right, I'd like it to have a definitive end there and not just say ""hey, success, lets keep it going!"""
The Rap Game,"I hope the actress that plays Ellie will be able to pull off the older character. I'm assuming so, but still makes me nervous"
The Rap Game,"I thought they flew through David’s storyline. I’m loving this so much that I don’t mind if they stretch it out, I know they won’t ruin it and I trust that they will stick to source material and not exhaust the series"
The Rap Game,"Should have done the same for part 1. One of the most poorly paced shows I've ever watched. I'm glad they stayed pretty true to the game but damn, they could have done so much more."
The Rap Game,"I think they are between a rock and a hard place with the next season. If they follow the games' story there will be a ton of people that hate it, if they dont it will be admitting that the direction they went with the game's story was essentially a mistake. Will be interesting to see how they navigate it."
The Rap Game,[removed]
The Rap Game,I imagine you’d have to just for pacing purposes when translating it to live action formats. The fairly early game twist would be jarring if they just hit that off the beginning episode of season 2. Not to mention there is plenty of in between game happenings that could be made into great character development moments to make the events of the 2nd game more impactful in tv format
The Rap Game,they could have adapted season one into multiple seasons. they rushed through the plot points I thought.
The Rap Game,Money
The Rap Game,"Probably should do their own spinoff, too, explore the whole world, get as wild as they wanna."
The Rap Game,"Could have done that with s1 too, felt rushed ino"
The Rap Game,"I think they will probably pseudo-alternate between TLOU and HOTD every year, like they did with GOT and Westworld years prior. 

They now have seasons 2 & 3 mapped out. HOTD S2 is coming out in 2024, so they might do TLOU S2 (first half of Part II) in 2025, and do HOTD S3 in the same year (2025) or 2026 and do TLOU S3 (second half of Part II) in 2026 (since it would be a two-parter story, I don’t see this coming out in 2027). 

Maybe a break after 2026, and they might have revealed or even released TLOU Part III by then. So possibly TLOU S4 in 2028."
The Rap Game,"First game needed at least 3 or 4 more episodes. Or 2 seasons. With Joel almost dying as the finale/cliffhanger.

Glad they will be making game 2 at least 2 seasons."
The Rap Game,"Pitch Meeting:  
 *So, you got a tv show for me?  Yes sir I do. You know how you like money sir.  Ohhh yeah, is that what the script is about?  Well it can be sir. I was thinking we take a single story and make it last 3  or 4 seasons.  Oh very cool, sounds like the fans will love waiting 4 years to watch it.  I think so sir*"
The Rap Game,"I haven’t played 2 because it seems like a despair burger (I get notoriously dark with stuff like that)

Is it worth it though? Im seeing people saying it’s an experience not worth missing. May have to change my mind…"
The Rap Game,"Without spoiling the games, is season 1 the entirety of part 1? Like part 1 and season 1 ended at the same spot?"
The Rap Game,"This is great news. People already felt this first game felt rushed, and the second is twice as long."
The Rap Game,"So I gotta say... the show was a pale comparison to the game. Performances were flat (Check out side by side comparisons if you don't believe me) It felt really small in scope and severely rushed.  Felt like a local theater troupe rendition of a Hollywood play. 

If I had never seen the original, I would have probably loved it, because I didn't know all the stuff they cut out and how stellar the performances were. Yes, I know episode 3 was a nice story, but it wasn't worth cutting out an entire section of the game where you really come to understand Ellie and Joel as characters. BUT, I think most issues I had with the season was a budget problem. They couldn't afford to tell a grand adventure. So, with the big success, maybe they can do the story justice.   IMO, the first game should ideally be covered in two seasons instead of one.  Splitting up the second game will improve pacing a lot."
The Rap Game,Shit… that scares me! If you played the games you know why
The Rap Game,Of course Neil wants his proper baby to span into 2 seasons while the S01 finale was 46 minutes
The Rap Game,Tbh wonder how pedro/joel being done durty is gonna go with tv audiences. Ppl definitely hated it and i personally hate the entire plot of the second part.
The Rap Game,"For once I wish they'd deviate from the source material. Unfortunately, I found the plot of part II to be lackluster and not that interesting."
The Rap Game,loved the second game but i hope the show improves some narrative issues that part 2 have.
The Rap Game,I know I'm alone on this but I wish they'd come up with new stories that take place in between the games. I want more world building and what not
The Rap Game,Milk that cow dry baby. After that we will have 3 spin offs and prequal
The Rap Game,"I think that makes sense.

I think Craig Mazin is perfect with character dramas, and was STILL surprised at how well-developed the characters of TLoU are.

But we all know the biggest challenge is TLoU2 by a *mile*. They all have their work cut out for them trying to get me onboard with that story. Even just trying to connect the two stories meaningfully... because Drunkman failed so spectacularly...

I like The Closer Look's YouTube video arguing how the story works wonders as an adapted TV series that can give the perspectives they need to give the story scope. Much better than a video game that has to frame the game through a couple perspectives at most.

I say this because TLoU tried to pull a grand perspective shift and failed because it disrespected the player and played then for sympathy, constantly trying to twist them into hating the protagonists...

I don't know if it's possible to salvage TLoU2. But I think if anybody can do it, it's Mazin. And I can believe it's going to take 2 seasons to get there. I'm praying they can find two complete stories that fill in the gaps of story in the game. With what I've seen of S1, I'm at least hopeful they got a shot."
The Rap Game,"Naughty Dog needs to get on finishing its story.

I'm getting Game of Thrones flashbacks."
The Rap Game,"God I'm actually low-key dreading them adapting LoU2, if only cos we're gonna get a repeat of all the awful discourse surrounding it, which among other things led to actresses/creators getting death threats, the Last of Us sub devolving into another redpill/gamergate hive and has even infected this very thread when I scrolled towards the bottom comments, only this time it won't just be contained to gaming sites."
The Rap Game,"Last episode sucked though, they cut way too much and it felt rushed."
The Rap Game,"They are going to have to. I think they start losing viewers once they >!kill Joel off, so hopefully he stays alive for most of if not all of season 2!<"
The Rap Game,"Lol they speed run/drag their feet through the beloved first game in one season, but now want to drag out the maligned and controversial second in multiple seasons? 
Yeah ok makes perfect sense 😂"
The Rap Game,Hopefully with better pacing. My expectations are pretty low because season 1 was kind of weird.
The Rap Game,"Yeah, I loved the game but felt it was a couple hours too long: condensing all of that into 9 episodes would be a nightmare."
The Rap Game,"Game 2 seems to be a passion project of Druckmann based on the way he presents the game. I’m not surprised that he’s basically brushing aside the first game to start work on the second. 

I’m curious to see how it will be adapted considering the gameplay in game 2 is what held it up, not the story. Maybe he’ll listen to criticism and change up the way the story was presented, but he’s been pretty bullheaded and doesn’t seem like the kinda guy who think he can do wrong."
The Rap Game,First game should also have been two seasons honestly.
The Rap Game,"I mean hell, I thought the game was over and then it switched perspectives

Then I thought it was over *again*, and it switched perspectives *again*

They’ll definitely go the GOT route and have rotating perspectives or else people will tune out when season 3 doesn’t feature anyone you really know. It would be like if they made season 4 of GOT with *only* the parts about Dorne in the books."
The Rap Game, Shoulda done that for part 1 too
The Rap Game,I LOVED the narrative of TLoU. I couldn't finish TLoU2.
The Rap Game,This'll be a beautiful trainwreck. The discourse will happen again cause they'll double down.
The Rap Game,"Because they know ""you know what"" is going to turn people away and they want to delay it as much as possible"
The Rap Game,They’re adding to the show to keep certain characters on screen for longer.
The Rap Game,"I don't get all the excitement and hub-bub about this show. I'm up to episode 6. I mean, it's good, and I definitely didn't expect Nick Offerman to make me cry, but..... It's just a rehash of The Walking Dead, no?"
The Rap Game,"if the seasons are only 10 episodes, that's unsurprising"
The Rap Game,"honestly this first part should of been two seasons it felt so rushed yet it had entire pointless filter episodes about characters that had 5 minute in the game. 

Would of really liked to see more of the infected as a threat.  They really felt like a non threat. And while the game is almost Post - Post apocalypses where humaning it coming back around and the biggest threat to humans is humans.  They (infecteD)  really felt like almost a complete non threat ."
The Rap Game,"Why not just do a longer season? Remember when shows used to have like 24 episodes a season? I get wanting to cut costs, cut filler, etc., but it really feels like with a lot of the shorter season shows nowadays that you lose so much character development by only having 10 episodes to work with. We just don’t know anything about characters anymore. There is no room for the relationship between character and audience to just take a breath together."
The Rap Game,"It's going to need some reworking. The plot in TLOU2 was pushed along by the characters trying to out stupid each other, it was infuriating. I finished the game hoping that they all die."
The Rap Game,Milk it baby.
The Rap Game,"Just don’t nerf the violence from the second game. Don’t want them softening it up, the second game was amazing"
The Rap Game,"Part 2 is a story that's undermined by and undermines its medium, If done well it will shine and be appreciated much more in the TV show."
The Rap Game,"If they >!kill Joel like they did in the game,!< I will stop watching the show right then and there."
The Rap Game,Redo season 1 as 3 seasons. I feel like the sped through it.
The Rap Game,Last episode was ass
The Rap Game,Gotta milk🥛that intellectual property.
The Rap Game,"I wish they had done this for season 1 instead. It felt so rushed, and I was in no hurry to get to the story of the second game.

The stakes are so low compared to saving humanity from Game 1, and I hated what they made the character of Ellie become, and disagreed with her motivations for most of the story. It had all the sensibilities of a Rambo movie wrapped in a pretentious bubble, and had none of the heart of the original."
The Rap Game,No thanks
The Rap Game,"I hope they change the order of some events. Whilst I think it had the basis for a fantastic game, the pacing and structure left so much to be desired. I just didn't care what happened because of the way it was. They kept trying to force this one thing on you and I didn't care."
The Rap Game,They did this exactly backwards.  They should've made TLOU at least 2 seasons.  The adventures of Joel & Ellie is what people wanted.
The Rap Game,Could have easily done that with season one too
The Rap Game,"This was clearly the plan, all along. Rush to Part II quickly."
The Rap Game,"Hopefully, ""adapt"" means change that story completely"
The Rap Game,"People are thinking that the next seasons are going to be as negatively divisive as the second game was.  I think this may be incorrect.

1. Hopefully they will have learned their lesson from the games and keep everyone in character this time.  This was a preventable problem with the game that could have been solved with better writing.  So with a little luck, they can solve the problem here.
2. We can have a bit more time to build up the new characters.  It's hard to do that in a game where everyone really wants to get back to playing the characters they know.  
3. This format may be much more forgiving to the story they wanted to tell.  One of the problems that turned many people off was being forced to play as someone you felt was the enemy.  That is tricky to pull off.  But we are used to seeing different points of view in shows.  Cersei was a fan favorite despite being, well, Cersei.  

We'll see how they handle it."
The Rap Game,"So wait…. If I watch the last episode of season one tonight, I don’t need the game?"
The Rap Game,"Excellent. The game itself has cliffhangers within cliffhangers, it’s only right the show leaves us wanting more as well. All the stories and character arcs might not feel rushed"
The Rap Game,So they could drag out that crappy storyline? Ugh!
The Rap Game,They should have did that with the first video game
The Rap Game,"The second season is just going to be the rattlers subplot confirmed.

/s"
The Rap Game,"I hope they can make it a little more compelling than the game, just because it is hard to follow game/season 1. Don’t get me wrong I think it’s a good story but it felt dragged out"
The Rap Game,Could honesty be 3 season if they are are short as season 1. 9 episodes with 2 being self contained flashbacks made it fly by.
The Rap Game,"I’m really curious/excited to see how they adapt this game. I’m a huge fan of part 2 but I think by far the worst aspect of it is the pacing and a lot of that was down to how the story was structured, so I wonder if they’re gonna change that for this show."
The Rap Game,Gotta stretch that oooouuuuuttttt mang.
The Rap Game,I’d love to see them have a season that explores Ellie and Joel living in the community. With the season finale being the beginning of TLoU2. Have the end of S2 be the golf club scene.
The Universe,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
The Universe,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
The Universe,I totally thought that the show was over lol
The Universe,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
The Universe,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
The Universe,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
The Universe,Jewel of Wilson’s foul domain
The Universe,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
The Universe,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
The Universe,"Seeing as she’s literally married to He-Man, I’m not surprised."
The Universe,Didn’t fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
The Universe,This show is still on?
The Universe,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
The Universe,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
The Universe,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
The Universe,Super
The Universe,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don’t think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine’s daughter:

https://youtu.be/YJku_F1cXow"
The Universe,She was super girl right?
The Universe,Didn’t they already ruin this franchise?
The Universe,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
The Universe,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
The Universe,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
The Universe,How has this not been cancelled yet?
The Universe,"My take is it just needs to be a “He-Man” show… like the original was… 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it “He-Man.” You can do that, it’s a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans… that’s possible… but it’s not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
The Universe,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
The Universe,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
The Universe,…..and it’s cancelled
The Universe,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
The Universe,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
The Universe,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
The Universe,Why won’t Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she’s involved in.
The Universe,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
The Universe,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
The Universe,Good. She was miscast.
The Universe,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
The Universe,"I don’t think SMG was good in the role, but I also don’t think the show was very good period."
The Universe,Would anyone even care?
The Universe,"Please don’t destroy my childhood, I can’t go through another Footloose situation"
The Universe,I wouldn’t touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
The Universe,This show was utter garbage
The Universe,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
The Universe,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
The Universe,Boooo
The Universe,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
The Universe,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
The Universe,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
The Universe,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
The Universe,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
The Universe,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
The Universe,… and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
The Universe,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
The Universe,Had no idea this was in the works
The Universe,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
The Universe,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
The Universe,"She doesn’t like to work. 

I don’t mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn’t so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn’t want to work on a second one at the same time."
The Universe,They did not say.
The Universe,I’m assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
The Universe,Maybe she watched the first series
The Universe,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
The Universe,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
The Universe,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
The Universe,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
The Universe,AND HE PRAYS!
The Universe,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
The Universe,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
The Universe,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
The Universe,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
The Universe,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
The Universe,I loved it.
The Universe,"No, just noisy Internet people."
The Universe,Yes we did
The Universe,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
The Universe,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
The Universe,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
The Universe,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
The Universe,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
The Universe,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
The Universe,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i’ll give credit where it’s due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
The Universe,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
The Universe,Yup
The Universe,sounds like a continuation
The Universe,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
The Universe,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
The Universe,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
The Universe,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we’re getting more, though."
The Universe,The Tron one hasn’t been renewed yet.
The Universe,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
The Universe,See if it works out for 'em
The Universe,They love losing money
The Universe,Read the show title again...
The Universe,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
The Universe,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
The Universe,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
The Universe,"One could even say they’ve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
The Universe,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they’re married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
The Universe,Who doesn’t?
The Universe,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
The Universe,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
The Universe,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
The Universe,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
Ancient Aliens,"I stopped watching all of the Discovery Network channels in the late 2000’s when the tag lines all switched to be the antithesis of the namesakes

History: Made Every Day
Animal Planet: Surprisingly Human
Discovery: Grab Life by the Globe

I remember when Discovery used to be synonymous with high quality educational content. Even some of the early reality shows were educational and entertaining. Then they kept on adding more, and getting lower in value and quality. A modern tragedy."
Ancient Aliens,Every episode asks rhetorical questions like “Is this toy an alien prototype???” And “Did the Egyptians invent interstellar travel???”… Obvs the answer is NO. But they just leave it open ended to seem cryptic.
Ancient Aliens,"At least its not The Curse of Oak Island, 10 seasons of digging holes on a tiny island and finding nothing."
Ancient Aliens,"The so-called ""History"" Channel is a symptom of a serious and very dangerous phenomena.  Whether we can survive our own gullibility, ignorance and lack of rationality is in grave doubt."
Ancient Aliens,"Stargate is the better ancient aliens. A concept so absurd it belongs in science fiction, and the setting allowed for some amazing story telling."
Ancient Aliens,It would be a much better show if it just focused on unexplainable archeological finds and not attribute them to aliens with 0 evidence.
Ancient Aliens,It would be much more better for humanity to make docs about how good ancient people were at mathematics and how they applied it. Like ancient Egypt maths was huge part of the religion and philosophy in really cool ways with architecture to symbolism in art. You can defo find experts with charm and excitement to make it engaging. But that doesn’t make the ad revenue and would mean hiring a good research dept. There are defo ways to make that type of show exciting and inspire but it requires more effort. So they make the cheapest show.
Ancient Aliens,"People say Ancient Aliens is racist because it's white guys claiming ancient Egyptians were too stupid to build the pyramids without alien help. But those people must not have watched up to the part where they also say aliens are the only way ancient Vikings could have built... boats. Actual brain damage.

That or else they're fraudsters, which founding member Erich von Däniken in his youth was actually convicted of. He wrote one of his books from prison. The more you know."
Ancient Aliens,"It’s very “I couldn’t have come up with that, so obviously no one else could have either.” Some people have a hard time understanding that anyone else in the world might be smarter or more creative than them."
Ancient Aliens,I think it was cool first couple episodes then you realized… wait they just ran out of material so any achievement… aliens. wtf.
Ancient Aliens,"probably too young to remember ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nimoy.

it was popular...(loch ness, big foot, aliens, etc)

Ancient Aliens,"Stargate sg-1 is better at this without presenting itself as ""true"""
Ancient Aliens,"I find stuff like that pretty quaint when contrasted to some or the more toxic paranoias that float around in society these days.

But what does bother me is that the Ancient Aliens videos get like 50 million views on places like YT and the videos debunking them get like 500,000 if they're lucky. 

And those are so much more fascinating. 

The real story is almost always more interesting than the fantasy one because there's so many more reasons why things are the way they are than you can fit in such reductive little ideas.

Like 'out of place artifacts'? The interesting part is discovering why they exist. Antithykera (sp?) mechanism, Voynich manuscript? Those things are fascinating because we're on a quest to learn the real story, not half-ass it and come up with fictional stories."
Ancient Aliens,I absolutely adore the show it's so ridiculous that it becomes fun to watch.
Ancient Aliens,"They don’t 100% believe what they are saying.  They believe if they sell it hard enough they will make money, and they have the ratings and paychecks to back that belief up.

If you don’t support this grift than don’t watch it, but it’s pure fictional entertainment dressed up to sound like honest scientific speculation."
Ancient Aliens,"Wait is that show still fucking making new episodes? 

I remember watching it in 2012 or 13 when it first started and they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for content like 10 episodes in. 

Wtf do they even talk about now?"
Ancient Aliens,Man there's a YouTube video where a dude watches all of them and he essentially creates like the world's history as it happened according to ancient aliens and humans have apparently not been responsible for any of the achievements we've done lmao its an absurd video.
Ancient Aliens,But what if and I know this is crazy the aliens made  you stop watching the show because we were all getting to close to the truth. It turns out the aliens are working with the president like maybe the grays??????????
Ancient Aliens,">Now, you may say ""Oh, don't take it so seriously. These people aren't serious who made it"". Except they are. They 100% believe in what they're saying.

Ehhh...."
Ancient Aliens,The narration by Robert Clotworthy is legendary though. He narrates Oak Island as well.
Ancient Aliens,"Once I caught my father watching this. ""Is this for real?"", he asked me. ""Well, it's called Ancient *Aliens*, so you can figure it out yourself"".

I think that's where I lost my inheritance."
Ancient Aliens,Ancient alien theorists say…
Ancient Aliens,"Some comedian or meme or something summed up ancient aliens as: could brown people do this? Nah, aliens."
Ancient Aliens,so what you're saying is it was written by aliens?
Ancient Aliens,Ancient alien theorists suggest that >!Insert bullshit here.!< Its all I ever hear in this show.
Ancient Aliens,"It night be insult to *intelligent* human beings, but c'mon, those kind of people are very uncommon. The average person is a complete moron. Companies would be stupid not to take their money.

Never forget that that half of my country thinks a trust fund baby that hosts a reality television show (a known, proven sex offender and rapist) is the now the arbiter of all truth. The same people thought a man who literally set a world record for number of lies told in public is trustworthy enough to be leader of the free world. 

Ancient aliens may be dumb, but it's only because dumb people pay for content too.  Don't blame the people who produce this stuff, blame the people who consume it. Blame the people who consistently rally against funding education. This market wouldn't be worth so much money if we inoculated people against this kind of garbage with education."
Ancient Aliens,true but I love it
Ancient Aliens,Ancient alien theorists disagree
Ancient Aliens,"I kinda like it.

It's like a church sermon, but far more entertaining, and with less hate for non-believers."
Ancient Aliens,"The show is based on the book ""Chariot of the gods""

if you want a solid reason to avoid it, the usage of the word ""savage"" as a description of the African people is a decent one.   


Its filled with the authors own interpretations of things, it says that the savages could not possibly have built the pyramids and etc. Its mostly just structured ramblings"
Ancient Aliens,"I used to watching dumb conspiracy shows years ago, back when Alex Jones was yelling at buildings in Houston because it looked like an Owl and thus was where the Illumanti were stations. Ancient Aliens peaked my interest because I remember seeing the Pilot and how incredibly dumb it was. I kept up with the show for a long time due to how they could connect everything to Aliens with any thread. Some of your examples aren't even the dumber ones. Bigfoot and other cryptids? We're suddenly a Prison Planet for dangerous animals/criminals that don't belong on most other worlds. Nazis? They clearly had some kind of super weapon like ""Die Glocke"". Those weird shape stone carvings in India? Clearly some kind of Power Planet and certainly not a certain aspect of Shiva.

However the biggest problem with Ancient Aliens is how much of a fraud the show and the talking heads really are. They use Misleading information at best and downright dishonesty at worst. There's loads of examples on Jason Colavito's Website as well as the Ancient Aliens Debunked Video on Youtube (Though that is written with a heavy Christian/Creationist Bias also, but that's only really a issue in the last quarter of that video), but to list a couple of the biggest from the top of my head:

They claim that Puma Punku cannot be made because the stones used are stones like Granite and others would have been too hard to cut, so they must have used Alien Technology to Laser Cut and then float them in place. However not only are the stones infact Andesite and Diorite (which are much more softer), but there are many unfinished stones on the site that show how they're cut AND the systems used to put in place.

They also claim that the Moai of Easter Island have to be floated by Aliens because they were too heavy. The claim here is that there are no real Trees on Easter Island, so they cannot use Wooden Rollers. Not only do they not take into account that the Moai aren't just the heads, but the fact that Easter Island was probably full of trees at one point and that the Moai are sinking due to Soil Erosion, which can happen if you remove many trees where there used to be. Easter Island infact has some of the worst soil erosion known.

They also keep referencing the work of Zacharia Sitchin also. A man who claimed he translated Ancient Sumerian. If you ever hear about the whole Planet Niberu, let alone the whole 'Atmosphere of Gold' and such like, that never was a thing. He just made it all up. Yet people to this day believe it was part of any Mesopotamian cultures and parrot it. Not only that, but pretty much any information Ancient Aliens says about the Anunnaki is pretty much flat out wrong also. Most Sumerian scholars state the translation for the name 'Anunnaki' means 'The Children of Anu' or something like that. But Ancient Aliens uses the works of Zacharia Sitchin and claim it means 'Those from Heaven they came' or some nonsense like that.

""Now, you may say ""Oh, don't take it so seriously. These people aren't serious who made it"". Except they are. They 100% believe in what they're saying. It's nothing if not misleading about history at the very least.""

Some of them do, some of them don't. Some, like David Childress (One of the 'Big Three' of Ancient Aliens), definitely flip flops going from believing, to calling  Erich von Däniken  a Fraud, to be being one of his fervent believers, generally going with the times and what is more profitable to him at the time. Ancient Aliens has probably been his longest ride and I think he 'joined them' as a 'skeptic' originally until he just went full on Ancient Astronaut theory.

I still watch it occasionally. If I need something in the background while eating or looking after something. However I find that I can be watching an entirely new episode, but they're parroting the same old clips and claims but in different orders because they had to resort to recycling content for newer episodes and seasons."
Ancient Aliens,The History channel is helping dumb down society further.
Ancient Aliens,"They are basically just another type of flat earther, some people have also taken this further and no longer believe in aliens but in Atlantis instead, or rather a global human civilization which existed 10s of thousands of years before any proof of human civilization in archeology but must have existed because there's no way the brown people could have actually invented  civilization on their own, and that the only possible way to explain ancient Egypt is that they secretly had power tools to cut stone."
Ancient Aliens,"I used to like it when Bird Hair Indiana would go to archaeological sites and show neat features up close (funny side note in one of the episodes from the first couple of seasons, he  and his camera man were clearly part of a tour group and just wandered off on their own, It was somewhere in Peru I think) Now its just wonky bullshit, every time that Childress guy talks I just roll my eyes at his nonsense. They clearly ran out of material years ago and are just ridding the wave."
Ancient Aliens,"The first 6 or so episodes of Ancient Aliens that comprise of its first season ( I think, it’s been a while ), are Actualy really good and entertaining if you switch your brain off for it and just enjoy the ride. It makes for a great doc series that investigates the classic ancient aliens stuff without going beyond the realms of ridiculous and asks some interesting questions. 

It’s everything else after that that’s an abomination. If they’d just left it as this interesting little 6 part doc series it may have retained some sort of interest. But It’s the fact they saw the first season do well and decided to make literally 100 more episodes that basically told us every historical event ever was Aliens, that totally ruined it. Yeti? Alien. George Washington? Alien.

Ruined itself by going off the deep end."
Ancient Aliens,"Honestly I think it suffered from its own success. The original episodes were at least a little thought provoking, now they are grasping at straws to make connections and to keep people watching."
Ancient Aliens,I mean how else you explain the Monalisa?
Ancient Aliens,"I'll give you an idea of how serious i take ancient aliens, there's a guy with weird hair from it, he's a cross between a glue sniffer and a Centauri from babylon5, he embodies the idiocy of believing in the things they put out, he is a meme as well now"
Ancient Aliens,Gotta watch it with Action Bronson
Ancient Aliens,It's the fact the they are serious that makes it a 11/10 for me. You do you though.
Ancient Aliens,"The underlying subtext of almost all of the “ancient aliens” theories about the truly ancient world (aztecs, Egyptians, Greeks etc) is “well obviously they couldn’t have done it, they’re brown people” - you rarely see ancient alien theories about Roman roads or aqueducts or other western European achievements - those were just civilised people so of course they could achieve awesome things. But the brown people a bit further south? No chance, must have been aliens"
Ancient Aliens,"Not only is it stupid, it's promotes stupidity by asserting ""alternative facts"" for events and artifacts that have been explained long ago, making anyone who digests this show as having any semblance of knowledge dumber.

If you realize how much effort they put into making almost EVERY narrative a question, it's astounding. 

""Easter Island, was a home base to pre-cambrian aliens?""

""These stones were carved with technology that didn't exist yet?""

It's like they stole a legal playbook from Fox News."
Ancient Aliens,"If you dip your toe into right wing media you'll see a lot of this type of pseudoscience mixed with religion and ancient history.  I used to listen to a lot of Coast to Coast AM which talked about this stuff a lot.  Most of it seems to be based off of Chariots of The Gods by Zacharia Sitchin.  
 
They do seem to believe this stuff.  They have conventions all around the world with the regular cast of characters. A lot of whom show up in Ancient Aliens like Linda Moulton-Howe and George Noory (host of Coast to Coast AM). It's an entire industry fed by books and paid appearances.

EDIT: Have the wrong author for Chariots of the Gods (Erich von Däniken).  Sitchin wrote 12th Planet which is built off of Chariots and is basically a bunch of scifi nonsense about aliens called the Annunaki from Nibiru genetically creating humans to mine gold."
Ancient Aliens,"Could aliens have evolved on another planet, developed space travel earlier than us, and then visited our planet? Possibly.

Could those aliens have influenced our species / culture, either deliberately or inadvertently? Vaguely possible.

Did aliens cause our species’ development because we couldn’t possibly have done it naturally? If that’s the case… who caused the aliens’ development?!

I’m all for scientific questioning and consideration of alternative theories… but blaming everything you don’t understand on “space gods” isn’t the way."
Ancient Aliens,I think Chris Rock had a bit about Ancient Aliens where white people refuse to believe black and brown people were able to build the pyramids so they just say it was Aliens.
Ancient Aliens,I don't watch it for the history and I'm usually very stoned
Ancient Aliens,"Lol it's a great show, in fact ancient astronaut theorists say yes."
Ancient Aliens,"Yeah, I always hated that show too. It assumes that humans are helpless, stupid idiots who can't figure anything out for ourselves."
Ancient Aliens,That show is great for when I want to get mad at the TV. Sorta the same reason people watch Jersey Shore I s’pose.
Ancient Aliens,"It's not just an insult to humans it's specifically nazism. The ancient aliens theory was started by the Nazis. Partly it was to explain all the shit POC did that they refused to believe ""inferior"" non-whites could do. There was also a lot of crap about whites being descended in some way from these aliens who were believed to be very Nordic looking and therefore superior."
Ancient Aliens,"It's worse than the ghost and supernatural hunter shows where they never find any ghosts, but they double down on belief. Or like the end times preppers shows. It's not really entertaining because they aren't joking."
Ancient Aliens,I'm really struck by how commonly the assumption is that folks in not-Europe couldn't possibly have figured out how to do cool things.
Ancient Aliens,It's awesome and funny as fuck if you know it's all nonsense going in.
Ancient Aliens,"There's a YouTuber who's shown that ancient aliens idea is likely very racist due to how it belittles the achievements of many cultures that basically weren't European.   Natives making crop circles?  Aliens

Africans building pyramids that we can't explain?  Aliens?

People being able to tell time?  Aliens. Cause there's no way they could be intelligent."
Ancient Aliens,It's trash and I love it. It would be harmless fun if some people weren't gullible enough to believe it but the last decade or so proves that those people exist in droves.
Ancient Aliens,"Actually the ancient aliens theory is considered racist. Cultures full of nonwhite people using advanced construction methods!?!? *Gasp*

Meanwhile you can go on YouTube and find a video where someone demonstrates the ability to move huge stones using simple machines built using technology available at the time by himself.


The racist aspects are of course mixed in with other facts that are interesting and unknown, which hides the racism"
Ancient Aliens,"I love to watch the show for their overreaching theories. Also I enjoy the glimpses of megalithic structures built by our ancestors. As a MexAm I had always assumed the Aztecs built the Teotihuacan Pyramids, but they actually found them and decided to stay. Also there’s a temple built into the mountain in India. So if you ignore the tag lines and the constant “misunderstood technology”, it’s quite an interesting show. At least it’s not the Kardashians."
Ancient Aliens,"You can say this in a simpler way:

""Ancient Aliens is idiotic"""
Ancient Aliens,I had a boss years ago who watched that shit like it was real.   He truly believed it all and that aliens were here in key positions around the world.   I cant stand stoned libertarians.   Such a kooky bunch with no concept of anything.
Ancient Aliens,"I find it kinda funny, it's absolute bollocks,  but I would love one of them badges"
Ancient Aliens,"I'm not saying aliens created the show, but..."
Ancient Aliens,"I actually like watching for fun sometimes, if I want some junk TV. I don’t believe it at all but it’s just entertaining to see these guys just riff on sci fi shit and all the crazy theories they have. I think of it kinda like reality TV- obviously contrived and silly, but can be fun to watch anyway."
Ancient Aliens,A technology that existed before white people discovered it!?!!?! Must have been aliens.
Ancient Aliens,It’s mindless tv. You may be taking it too seriously.
Ancient Aliens,"I just like how their definition of ""ancient"" keeps expanding up to around WWII. Also, aliens were somehow involved in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral."
Ancient Aliens,"Absolutely agree, it's sciencegion for stupid people.   
They live on ideas with idiocy like; they haven't found bigfoot or the lochness monster so they must be real because if they weren't real they would've not found them by now.   
And    
""They couldn't build the pyramids today""   
Yes they could, easily.   
What they mean is; we couldn't build the pyramids using ancient Egyptian tools.   
But that's like saying: ""the people who build oil tankers today couldn't build Viking war ships, so aliens must have built them."""
Ancient Aliens,I think it's great entertainment meant. Everybody knows the history channel stopped being about history a decade ago. Now they just need more shoes about all though theories. So we can have full discussions about. Archon theory. Sim theory. Molemen theory. Let's just explore all the theories for shits and giggles.
Ancient Aliens,Watch this and see if it changes your moind. https://youtu.be/xKXbTJsnH-s
Ancient Aliens,"I mean, the title alone already tells you it's going to be garbage, why watch it? And I'm one who is open to anything regarding the cosmos"
Ancient Aliens,This show infected my friends mind and sent him on a slippery slope of increasingly ridiculous conspiracy theories. I’m sure he’s not the only one 🤷‍♂️
Ancient Aliens,At this point it’s just a religion for pseudo-atheistic conspiracy theorists
Ancient Aliens,"It's a good background show, you have it on when you're doing something else or like trying to take a nap. I can't imagine actually just sitting and watching it"
Ancient Aliens,"The whole ""how could so many different, unconnected civilizations come up with the idea to make pyramids?"" question is the dumbest thing ever. It's literally the easiest way to make big structures if you don't have modern tools. Wide base, make each level a bit smaller but goes higher. It's that simple."
Ancient Aliens,i think its wonderful for non believers. it follows ancient texts and lore very accurately and very organized.
Ancient Aliens,"Why get so worked up on something that’s so transparently bullshit made up for entertainment? I disagree with your assertion that the creators are hardcore believers & that’s a bad thing. They’re just making a silly pseudo-science doc series on cable, it’s hardly being forced down the public’s throat."
Ancient Aliens,"I mean, duh."
Ancient Aliens,"Ancient Aliens Debunked on YouTube is exponentially more fascinating to me than Ancient Aliens proper, it's a long view but well worth it

Edit: [Here's the video](https://youtu.be/j9w-i5oZqaQ)"
Ancient Aliens,You're angry people believe different stuff than you? It's a great show and the guys are having fun.
Ancient Aliens,[deleted]
Ancient Aliens,That's the reason I hate eternals and want to kill people who say the mandarin is genghis khan in Shang chi.
Ancient Aliens,Is it possible (anything is possible)?  And if so (remember anything is possible)…. This is basically how 99% of Americans analyze information now.  I call it Ancient Aliens logic.
Ancient Aliens,"These day, even human are an insult to human..."
Ancient Aliens,"Crazy hair man is 100% serious when he says he believes ancient aliens are responsible for all of modern civilization. If it weren’t for him, we’d probably all be a lot smarter now."
Ancient Aliens,"Robert Langdon- Stonehenge hoax 

Not aliens just hoax as in archeologists are talking out their butts, and not taking anything else into context to hypothesize what the whole scale of ""henges"" are. Fell down the rabbit whole of doggerland and then the American who also reckon the missing piece of history is about 15000-10000 ago a great civilization did exist, and got wiped out. The British guy has much better explanations for things, gotta get to his doggerland piece though, the three deluges that science supports and Egyptians tried to tell the Greeks about is what the British guy argues were the disasters."
Ancient Aliens,Love this show they show you hypothesis and give you all sides. Some stuff is a reach I agree but other stuff makes sense. There is not the technology even now to build ancient cities pyramids etc. I have learned to question anything the MSM put in place. We have been propagandizes for decades. At least this shows you the other side.
Ancient Aliens,"I absolutely love the show. If you really have such hard feeling for it, you gotta take the stick out your ass. I’ve actually learned more about ancient history by watching this show, even though you can ignore a lot of the alien mumbo jumbo, the show offers interesting questions that everyone should be looking into. Because it’s very clear that mainstream archeology refuses to discuss certain ideas even though new evidence can propose alternate theories."
Ancient Aliens,"Slaves, Jeremy. Hundreds of thousands of slaves built the pyramids."
Ancient Aliens,At the beginning it was pretty interesting but they quickly run of out historical mysteries and started attributing literally everything to aliens. Leonardo Da Vinci dissapeared for 2 days? Must be the extraterrestrials!
Ancient Aliens,[deleted]
Ancient Aliens,When I read the phrase 'ancient aliens' I think about is [Thrintun vs Tnuctipun](https://larryniven.fandom.com/wiki/Thrint).
Ancient Aliens,https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/gtcrh0/imagine_forgetting_that_circles_exist/
Ancient Aliens,"What they are talking about are interesting topics while what they are saying is basically comedy.
It's so funny to hear the narrator say this doesn't have enough evidence but x and y are 100 percent sure it was extraterrestrials that did this.
Then that dude with crazy hair."
Ancient Aliens,My uncle and grandfather believe this garbage
Ancient Aliens,"I am 100% convinced that someone was under the influence of something based on having seen the show, that someone being whoever's idea it was and the something being cocaine."
Ancient Aliens,Think of how the aliens must feel. Having all of our hairbrained ideas pinned on them.
Ancient Aliens,"> Ancient Aliens is not only a bad show, it's also an insult to humans

You don't say..."
Ancient Aliens,"Oh sure, Ancient Aliens SEEMS like it downplays human achievement as a byproduct of entertainment. But ancient astronaut theorists now believe that Ancient Aliens was produced… by aliens. Could this explain why time after time all of human achievement is explained by outside intervention?"
Ancient Aliens,"It’s the best show ever made, you’ve never watched it stoned while laughing your ass off lmfaoo, and if u play music while watching it all the trippy transitions are kinda like a music video lol"
Ancient Aliens,Resident Alien had Giorgio Tsoukalos locked up in a secret government prison. It was hilarious.
Ancient Aliens,"I don't remember exactly which show. But a woman said Abraham Lincoln was guided by extraterrestrials to win the civil war.

And then you have the show Hunting Alaskan Dinosaurs.

Crap like this is cheap to produce and people watch it. 

Which is a shame for television"
The Curse of Oak Island,"I always love the way the Narrator plays Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the ""clues"" they find.  Like, they found an old nail, and nails are used in ship building, and wood is also used in ship building, and wood floats, and ducks also float, so if this nail weighs the same as a duck, then the Knights Templar could have buried the fabled Treasure Vault right here on Oak Island!"
The Curse of Oak Island,A narrator? For oak island? Could it be?
The Curse of Oak Island,"I have an old map showing exactly where the Nazi gold trains are buried on Oak Island. Presently I have a sore foot and I am unable to travel.     
DM me your banking info and it is all yours.    
Proof..I am Canadian and we never lie."
The Curse of Oak Island,"They have about 30 minutes of content. Total. History Channel wants 30 seasons, they have to make it up in the voiceover booth. 

Money Pit is an adjective describing the excavation attempts, not the treasure. Really the whole island has been dug up and razed over the years so finding any artifact anywhere only tells you it was on the island some time before you found it."
The Curse of Oak Island,"My wife and I enjoy watching the show. I'm not going to debate the merits of the show for us; just go ahead and make fun of us now, if you want to. I'm fine with that. 😂   

Both of us have mentioned from time to time that the filming season for these episodes must drive the locals crazy, esp. when large cranes and tractor-trailers move through heading for the causeway. But also the year-round visitors who want to check out the area. One day we'll be two of them: we'd like to come see the area and take one of the official Oak Island Tours. Sorry.  

But I drive my wife nuts making fun of the narrator. During the opening credits, practically every week, when he says ""there is an island in the North Atlantic,"" I jump in and say ""THERE IS?!?!?"" and I piss her off every time. I went a while not doing that, and then last week I did it, and she looked at me like I THOUGHT YOU STOPPED!! I kinda felt bad for betraying her.  

This narrator, though! ""A musket ball? On Oak Island?"" ""An ox shoe? On Oak Island?"" On and on! Marty mentions the swamp, and suddenly the narrator is treating us to the same old tired wording in his explanation of how there is a theory regarding why the swamp is man-made, and how it was done. ""Is it possible?"" ""Could it be?"" ""A connection to the Knights Templar?"" ""More wood? In a new drilling core?"" ""A medieval coin?"" ""It's the start of a new day on Oak Island...""  

By the way, this narrator's name is Robert Clotworthy, and - as someone mentioned elsewhere in this thread - he also can be heard on Ancient Aliens. He's also voiced other stuff, including the AI of a vehicle Nick Fury drove in one of the MCU films, IIRC.  

I wouldn't want them to totally get rid of the guy, or even change how he delivers his wording. But they COULD dial him down about halfway, and I'd be totally fine with that. It's gotten REALLY old!  

Medieval, even."
The Curse of Oak Island,"Im from the area this show is shot in, and I can tell you we are all fucking tired of this shit show."
The Curse of Oak Island,I wasted my life watching this. 😬
The Curse of Oak Island,"Rick: I found a rock, looks to be encased in mud, and dating back to the 1700's. This is the knights templsrs rock. 
Narrator: Could it be, a rock!? Encased in mud? Dated back to the 1700's, believed to have belonged to the knights templar?!"
The Curse of Oak Island,"They lost any credibility with me when they were bitching about having to stop digging where they found the Micmac ceramics. It was clear then that any ""archaeological"" interest they had was lipstick on a pig."
The Curse of Oak Island,treasure? on the island? the?
The Curse of Oak Island,Ancient astronauts theories
The Curse of Oak Island,Did the Vikings bury it there?
The Curse of Oak Island,"> Money Pit is an adjective describing the excavation attempts

Seriously. They are pissing away some serious cheddar."
The Curse of Oak Island,"They spend entirely too much time covering the interminable number of holes drilled into that ant hill and guessing what each scrap of wood is. ""Could it be? A chunk of wood? From a tree? With cut marks? And mud on it? In bore hole KG562970567, the 'Hole on the Edge of Forever'?"" Somebody else mentioned needing to fill the time with *something,* so why not needless, descriptive video service in interrogative form. It's a bit much."

The Curse of Oak Island,The real treasure is the TV deals we made along the way
The Curse of Oak Island,"I can understand that. The only reason I still look in on it is because **I** read that magazine article in the '60s, too, now I just want to see how long they're going to milk this."
The Curse of Oak Island,"Remember Billy Brown and his family who homesteaded in Alaska on a reality tv show ?

The Curse of Oak Island,"And of course every piece of rust is ""top pocket, flipity wobbler,"" and needs to be taken to a specialist, 3 counties away for confirmation that it is True Templar Rust^®."
The Curse of Oak Island,Vikings? Leaving treasure? On oak island?
The Curse of Oak Island,voice of SUV AI ?  same narrator ?  dumb TV ?
The Curse of Oak Island,You mean the only treasure...
The Curse of Oak Island,The real treasure is the contracts to these engineering contractors to dig big useless holes in the ground
The Curse of Oak Island,"I think I knew your father in school.     
He was my senior senior."
The Curse of Oak Island,"Nope, never saw more than a few episodes. My mother watches it religiously, though."
The Curse of Oak Island,"yeah, can't get near anything though"
The Curse of Oak Island,LOLOL!😂 🤣
The Curse of Oak Island,Who wouldn't want those.  Paid to dig holes find nothing no results I always surprised they never brought in Todd Hoffman.
The Curse of Oak Island,Your senior senior?
The Curse of Oak Island,"I only watched a few due to an Alaskan fascination at the time.     
This being Alaska, there were definitely more than a few loçals, probably quite a few, who resented the camera crews, publicity and attention that the Family was bringing to their isolated, secluded lives (maybe even hiding from authorities )...    
Near the the very end of the season one last episode ...      
Gunfire erupts and somebody (somebodies) starts shooting into or near their ""homestead""..I don't think they were aiming at the Browns but the message was loud and clear.     
They had to leave and season two began elsewhere.      
Best to you and yours."
The Curse of Oak Island,"People coming in and spending money is still a good thing though. 

Don't they offer tours?"
The Curse of Oak Island,"Sorry silly joke, referring to jr.,jr.     

I apologize."
The Curse of Oak Island,"I can see how that would get annoying, but sounds like somebody's been living in the woods too long, yeah? Wonder what *they* had to keep hidden?"
The Curse of Oak Island,"Oh, I totally missed your dad joke!"
The Curse of Oak Island,"Agreed.   
I don't like violence at all but I was not surprised by this.     
Many, far from all, of those in Alaska, are there for the isolation, maybe even nefarious deeds.    
Now for your part of the world..I assume you may be east coast Canada.    
It's the one part of our great land I have not visited. I hope to get there someday for an extended vacstion someday and soak it in.        
Best to you and yours."
The Curse of Oak Island,"East coast, but not Canada, eh? Not far from there, but by way of the Adirondack Park. Actually spent a couple weeks in Nova Scotia, a bunch of years ago, but never made it to Oak Island."
The Curse of Oak Island,"My sister told me about this show, said it was the new Ancient Aliens.   Watched a few of the early episodes, thought it was ok, but I had to stop when I realized there are 6 seasons of this show.  If you cant find anything after 3 seasons, you are milking it. "
The Curse of Oak Island,"The secret curse of Oak Island died with him. I bet they will make a show linking his death with The Curse of Oak Island  

MILK THAT SHIT"
The Curse of Oak Island,"Not real. The treasure, I mean."
The Curse of Oak Island,Bet he died during a commercial. 
The Curse of Oak Island,"I think there was probably something there at one time...small cache left by pirates.  However, it’s far less than what’s been dreamed and it’s long gone."
The Curse of Oak Island,Prove it.
The Curse of Oak Island,"You think so? Apparently this is an incredibly elaborate hiding place or just a sinkhole. When I was a teen, I was a believe. I have grown more cynical. "
The Curse of Oak Island,Its been like 6 fucking seasons. 
The Curse of Oak Island,"Proving the negative is a neat trick.

I think it's funny all the suckers who watch all these Snipe Hunt show expecting a payoff."
The Curse of Oak Island,"They dug up bones dated hundreds of years ago from a European man and a middle eastern man, 200 feet underground, from long before anyone except the Native Americans should have been anywhere near the island. At this point it's undeniable that SOMETHING historical happened on the island, but I'm basically certain any proper treasure is long gone.

Even so, I'm still super interested in the history of it, so any small discovery makes me happy."
The Curse of Oak Island,"I don't watch for a payoff. I watch because they continue to unearth various really interesting things that have at this point proven that something historical happened on the island. There's no proper treasure anymore and that's fine, but I'd still love to find out what happened."
The Curse of Oak Island,"""Salting the mine"" is most likely what happened."
The Curse of Oak Island,"My mum watches it avidly and ive always said that if they ever actually found anything worthwhile you would likely here about it before the season even aired, so you kinda know in advance whether their gonna find something or not so its sort of pointless really. But at the same time I do get why it might be interesting for some people from the more historical, mystery pov."
The Curse of Oak Island,"It's pretty much a standard Snipe Hunt show, right?  Shows about finding Ghosts, or Bigfoot, or Hitler's secret post-Nazi Germany life or whatever the fuck it is are just there to string people along, because what they are searching for doesn't exist.  

That people watch those shows year in and year out always tickled me to death."
The Curse of Oak Island,Everything to do with Oak Island has been a cock tease since it was first written about almost 300 years ago.
The Curse of Oak Island,"Those 'history' shows on the travel channel are pretty terrible as well.  Every episode ends with ""We may never know what happened here!"" "
The Curse of Oak Island,[deleted]
The Curse of Oak Island,I’ve actually had a case of blue balls more satisfying then the outcome of each season. 
The Curse of Oak Island,"I don’t know why, but I am invested in this show. It’s so boring but I freaking love it"
The Curse of Oak Island,"It reminds me of that show gold rush where they hype it up to the heavens and end up finding 1 molecule of gold. All hype. 

I’m convinced some pirates dug this hole to troll everyone. How would they even be able to dig all these sophisticated tunnels hundreds of feet below the earth with no machinery? Not to mention tunnels collapsing and water coming in to mess up the other tunnels. "
The Curse of Oak Island,"My daughter likes the show. The idea of a real life treasure hunt is pretty fascinating to kids. As an adult, I don’t think they will find anything, but enjoy the historical and scientific aspects. Who knows, they have found a couple of small items and anything is possible I suppose. If you are watching it expecting treasure, probably not the show for you."
The Curse of Oak Island,"Yes, same thing with Coopers Treasure 

Even if they do find something it’s going to take decades to get all the artifacts."
The Curse of Oak Island,Yes. I always wanted to know what is down there ever since I was a kid. They cock tease me.
The Curse of Oak Island,I watched Ancient Aliens and it's like the entire last third of the episode was to hype of The Curse of Oak Island. Cross over event of the century. 
The Curse of Oak Island,I heard through my brother who heard through a mason friend of his.. that at one time there was stuff there but has since been moved ... but again take that with a bucket of salt.. 
The Curse of Oak Island,Im sure this was said befor.. Or atleas i hope it was. But it hinestly looks like oak island was at one point 2 island i pirat or some other bugher with a ship full of loot saild inbetween the previously 2 island scuteld the ship and uesd the 2 islands to burry it making it kne island and a hell of a buried tresur to get to seeing how u could easily get (natural boobie traps) and empty chambers and eell every issue they came across wit almost no efort to make it that dificult ontop of all the evidenc and whatnot that points to them atleast uesing a ship to craft all the mayhem
The Curse of Oak Island,This show is absolute BS. Archeologists and scholars around the world have blatantly gone on record about the ridiculous statements and outright lies the show has propagated. 
The Curse of Oak Island,"No, that would be Stargate Universe"
The Curse of Oak Island,"I don’t know if it’s on that level. That stuff is so obviously bullshit. But there is some evidence for this money pit and over the course of the series they do find evidence to support some theories. 

But it a bit of a goosechase yeah. But there seems to be more of a concrete foundation to it than ‘ZOMG Hitler moved to Argentina and is still alive! Based on a letter Hiter once sent to someone living in Buenos Ares."
The Curse of Oak Island,I agree. But that was two hours.  This is four seasons of a show.  With little to no pay off 
The Curse of Oak Island,I miss that show.
The Curse of Oak Island,"I looked into the Oak Island mystery years back, and most of the early stories are vague enough where it wouldn't be surprising to me at all if there was nothing there."
The Curse of Oak Island,It's simple. If they found anything it would have already been known about or swept under the rug. It's the same with all of those shows. If they find a ghost on ghost hunters it's no longer about a search. Gimmick
The Curse of Oak Island,"I've never seen the show but I really doubt they'll ever find anything. Like a pirate dug a 100 foot shaft straight down, booby trapped the whole thing with secret flood tunnels then stuck a bunch of treasure down there. How's that even work?


I kinda suspect the people there now already know there's nothing there, but they keep up appearances to sustain the show and tour economy. "
The Curse of Oak Island,[deleted]
The Curse of Oak Island,"when I saw the first trailer for the show I immediately Wikipedia'd oak island, wondering if the show would be worth it, and got my answer pretty fast, so that's an option "
The Curse of Oak Island,"I am going to watch it till they go broke...which is going to be soon...probably this season. 

Someone needs to come in and explain how in the heck its even possible to bury something 200 feet down, construct tunnels and do all this deep work without even a modern shovel.  

So a group of guys sailed in on a wooden ship with no roads, had all kinds of secret treasure...they chopped down forests, dug hundreds of feet down, constructed elaborate booby traps..while drinking swamp water and eating berries with no tools. 

Mythbusters or White Rabbit needs to come in and talk to these guys.

"
The Curse of Oak Island,People have dug over 400 feet down on that island and haven't found a thing.  The whole Oak Island obsession is absurd.  
The Curse of Oak Island,That is a very accurate description!  They found wood.. so it must be!! keep digging.. 
The Curse of Oak Island,We will be watching to the end too.  I wonder the same things.  I would love to see Mythbusters take this one on.  In their last episode they found wood.. very deep down and immediately decided to stop.  WTF.  Don't stop now.. my thoughts. Wondering how many seasons they can drag this into and how much they are spending on this endeavor. Seems very very costly
The Curse of Oak Island,"Well i would say that History Channel probably pays them $50K per episode give or take.  So they have probably been paid $2million or so just for the show.  By the looks of the equipment they have rented and the wages..my guess is that they are probably even..so probably not much spent out of their own pockets.  They have paid a couple of divers, rented some water pumps and paid to drill a few holes. 

I also want to see the Detectorists from BBC and the guys from the NatGeo show Diggers come in and give it a shot before they give up.

"
The Curse of Oak Island,"I’ll admit, the sensationalism gets old.... “could Cleopatra have left part of a buffalo nickel while visiting Oak Island to scope out land for a new pyramid...”

I’m not sure why it’s still on, but I did finding myself catching up on previous episodes. It’s kind of cool to watch these guys treasure hunt.

It just bugs me that if they actually found something it would have been on the news, much earlier than the show airs."
The Curse of Oak Island,"I watched a few episodes, a few years back. I found it to be pretty dull, and I remember thinking, how did this make it into a television series?"
The Curse of Oak Island,"My father in law does, because he's obsessed with conspiracy/mystery stuff. I don't get it, it's boring as hell and there's zero payoff."
The Curse of Oak Island,"It's the History channel. Pretty much everything they air for the past few years is sensationalized reality shows. I've seen a few episodes. I haven't watched it in a few years though. I am surprised it's still on the air.  
       
It's interesting if only because it's at least tangentially related to history (unlike Ax Men, Counting Cars, Ice Road Truckers, Swamp People, etc) and not American Pickers or Pawn Stars. American Pickers and Pawn Stars are probably better for actual history (and overall better shows) but they're on all the time so it gets tiring watching yet another episode.   
       
The interesting part is more of the journey than the destination. Obviously they aren't going to find anything or it would have made headlines long before the episode hit the air. Some of the fringe theories they go over are entertaining, even if completely implausible and/or ridiculous. Some of the excavation/surveying techniques are interesting, even if they are complete hogwash."
The Curse of Oak Island,"I don't, but my father loves the show can't get enough of it. I can't figure it out. "
The Curse of Oak Island,"Yeah, exactly. I remember seeing promos back when I had cable. They made it seem like a mind blowing discovery had been made. I remember thinking if it was half as good as they claimed, I would have seen it in the news. "

The Curse of Oak Island,"I never realized this. I always have subtitles turned on in any case. Do I NEED need them? Nah. But it helps me keep from missing anything if someone has an accent, or if other on-screen (or off-screen) sounds distract from the dialog."
The Curse of Oak Island,"At this point, my wife and I have turned it into a drinking game. We drink every time they drill a hole and find wood or when metal detection expert Gary Drayton (btw you must never refer to him as anything else but metal detection expert Gary Drayton) finds an old rusty piece of iron."
The Curse of Oak Island,Is this show still on? I think I gave up after season 2 or 3. When the payoff was finding a spoon or something similar I got tired. I’d pick it back up if they’ve made substantial progress
The Curse of Oak Island,"I cannot believe this show is still on television.

Way back in like February 2017, my wife and I went to NYC for some things. While we were there, we attended Colbert, whose three guests were Shailene Woodley (boring AF), Laverne Cox (magnificent), and then...these guys. Now, they were in the third guest slot and obviously aren't supposed to be super media savvy guys, but they were just absolutely god-awful, completely sucking the (cold) air out of the room. Colbert was gracious as hell but had to draw individual words out of them.

Anyway, how do you milk six years of this kind of faux treasure hunting cryptid-adjacent nonsense and still get funding for it?"
The Curse of Oak Island,"This was asked on one or two of the OI Facebook groups.
It because people actually want to know what Carmen Legge says, but nobody cares what Gary’s blathering on about ."
The Curse of Oak Island,"Have they found anything yet? Like real treasure?

I stopped watching, half of every episode became some sort of clip show where they use the same narrated pieces to reexplain the money pit, flood tunnels  or templar history."
The Curse of Oak Island,This is the way
The Curse of Oak Island,A wooden plank and an iron piece from 1580 buried 120 feet deep in the money pit... it's always the and thing. An old thingy from the 1800 found in oak island.
The Curse of Oak Island,You guys must get snookered
The Curse of Oak Island,"They find a nail, get really excited, call it an ""artifact"" and then speculate how it got there.

Could this nail have been holding together a crate that was filled with Templar treasure?"
The Curse of Oak Island,It’s underwritten by the Nova Scotia tourism board.  That’s why it’s still on.  It’s a paid ad for tourism.
The Curse of Oak Island,Man uses more wacky vocabulary than doctor Seuss. Love him and the show lol
The Curse of Oak Island,This makes complete sense.
The Curse of Oak Island,He’s a real Bobby Dazzler!
The Curse of Oak Island,The treasure was all the seasons of tv they made along the way.
Intervention,Steven van Zandt’s line delivery in this scene is hilarious even after multiple rewatches.
Intervention,"“You killed little Cosette, I outta suffocate you, you little prick!” lol absurd but also prophetic"
Intervention," ""No one's attacking you.""Two minutes later they're all kicking his ass."
Intervention,"Rewatching the whole series right now

What a classic"
Intervention,Was it bawkin or somethin’?
Intervention,This scene and the scene where Pauly visits the clairvoyant are my top 2 scenes in the entire series. I can't decide which is funnier.
Intervention,Cozette crawled under Chistuhfuh for warmth .
Intervention,One of the absolute best scenes in the greatest show ever! The scene is so absurd and yet realistic to the characters all at the same time!
Intervention,"I loved how the mob somehow had a break and entering pork loin stealing intervention counselor.  As if that gave him credibility?  

That actor deserved a guest star Emmy nomination."
Intervention,"""Guy was an interior decorator""

&#x200B;

""Really? His house looked like shit."""
Intervention,“Your head was in the toilet water. Disgusting.”
Intervention,“Are you the guy who stole all those pork loins from Stew Loanards” always cracks me up.
Intervention,Drea de Matteo ( Adriana) was the fukn best! The outfits alone 💋🤌🏼
Intervention,"When James Gandolfini died, Entertainment Weekly did a list of his ten best Sopranos scenes. They included this scene. Specifically the part where Christopher says Tony is going have a heart attack by the time he’s fifty the way he eats. Gandolfini had just died of a heart attack at 51.

Maybe that scene should have been left off their list."
Intervention,Kind of ironic that they call him a son of a bitch after he calls his mother a whore.
Intervention,"Literally the best and funniest scene. 

“What, was it barking?!” Lmaooooo"
Intervention,"Ade: “you can no longer perform as a man”

Paulie: 👀"
Intervention,"I lost ten years in a bottle. I wish someone had done this for me. All I got from my ex is ""This is your problem. You fix it.""

(I did. Ten years sober next month. She wasn't any part of it, though.)"
Intervention,One of my favourite Sopranos scenes ever. The way it all goes to shit after Chris insults his mother is just brilliant
Intervention,"""If it was anybody else, you'd be getting your intervention through the back of your head."""
Intervention,"""Guys, whoa whoa whoa, we said non-judgemental!""

""Fuck that."""
Intervention,"This is what happens when you have a meeting without gabagool! 

The Sopranos had a lot of heart wrenching moments, but Christopher's entire story line was just tragedy from start to finish.  Poor guy never stood a chance."
Intervention,Fuck you you fucking hua.
Intervention,DISGUSTING
Intervention,"I'm watching the series for the first time. I have about 5 - 6 episodes left to binge.

Absolute one of my favorite series of all time.

Don't know why I didn't watch it before now.

R.I.P. James Gandolfini, Tony Sirico and Frank Vincent."
Intervention,"This and Pine Barrens had me laughing throughout. One of the best moments from this episode is when Furio is crying and tells Tony it's because of his dad dying, Tony tells him to grow up and this stuff happens, then the next scene is Tony crying over his horse dying. It's an amazing series that will have you laughing one episode and being in disgust the next."
Intervention,That went well
Intervention,Best show of all time imo
Intervention,"You’re weak, you’re outta control, and you’ve become an embarrassment to yourself and everyone around you."
Intervention,One of the best tv scenes ever
Intervention,"with that group you knew it was going to end that way, you just didn't know who was going to throw the first punch. The way James is able to switch emotion just with the look on his face you can see the pressure building. What an amazing actor, gone too soon"
Intervention,My favourite scene in the whole series
Intervention,"Ichabod Crane, The Intervention - The Sopranos"
Intervention,“Guys guys please come on!!!” 😂
Intervention,Up there with ‘There’s a bee on your ‘at’
Intervention,"Probably my favorite scene in the show. Just perfect in every way. 

Guy has a heroin problem, gets an intervention from his fiancé and colleagues, calls his mom a whore, and gets his ass beat by everyone. Perfect.

Christopha may have been a crazy lunatic cocksucka, but damn what a well written character. Michael Imperioli is having a second coming after White Lotus s2, and I’m all for that. 

Also Steven Van Zandt apart from being a rude Springsteen’s guitar player, has a phenomenal mob show on Netflix called Lilyhammer. Just started it yesterday. Extremely good!"
Intervention,"Spoilers for the greatest TV show ever made in these comments.  If you haven't finished the show, do not read down here ."
Intervention,Why is this in my news feed
Intervention,I needed that this morning thanks
Intervention,It’s both tragically sad and hilarious. What a brilliant show.
Intervention,Easily one of the best scenes it the entire series.
Intervention,One of my many favorite Sopranos scenes. I revisit this one all the time it's goddamn hysterical.
Intervention,This scene will never get old.
Intervention,Disgusting
Intervention,"Imagine this is the only scene of the sopranos you’ve ever seen. 

It could be a skit called “how Italians handle intervention.”"
Intervention,"What’s scary is Tony’s actor, James Gandolfini, really did die in his fifties of a heart attack."
Intervention,Oh shit i actually watched this for the first time yesterday
Intervention,Hilarious
Intervention,This is one of the funniest scenes in anything I’ve ever seen lol. The good sentiment is there and as soon as they start it’s just such a hilarious shit show.
Intervention,“My muddas wake” LMFAO
Intervention,**Disgusting.**
Intervention,I said my piece.
Intervention,"backstory of Steven Van Zandt's hair:


> I’m not sure exactly why, but I suppose I am obligated to explain the origin of my unusual habiliments. On top of the obvious standard hippie/gypsy/troubadour garb, there was an incident that married thebizarre to the bazaar. One night I was driving a girlfriend home from the Pony, three in the morning, four lanes, when a guy coming the other way crossed over. I switched lanes as quickly as I could, but he drifted right with me. Head-on collision. Not too fast, but I smashed into the windshield, and though I didn’t lose consciousness, I needed a few operations. After that, my hair never really grew in properly."
Intervention,"Definitely my favourite character on that show, I love Sil"
Intervention,I know it’s supposed to be a serious scene but I always laugh at that part. The way he says it.
Intervention,"One of the most amazing things about the Sopranos is how it worked as a dramady for the longest time, and then season 6B/7 comes and completely flips the tone on its head to just straight up dread for the final episodes, where all of these traits we’ve come to love from the characters so much, ultimately leads to their demise or threat of death. Such a fantastic series"
Intervention,">prophetic

Speaking of which, Chrissy's statement about how Tony was gonna have a heart attack by the time he was 50 was eerily prescient."
Intervention,"""She crawled underneath me for warmth."""
Intervention,I know what it's like to lose a pet!
Intervention,Elaborate please
Intervention,"Glad you picked up on that. The sacred, and the propane."
Intervention,"Nah, he just slipped while he was spraying for ants in his socks. Kid always was a dumb fuck."
Intervention,We are too. I’m amazed at how much I had forgotten!
Intervention,"I do a rewatch every 3 years or so, which reminds me that my other half has never seen it so I have the perfect excuse."
Intervention,I am watching it for the first time. Just got to Season 3. I can't stop watching...
Intervention,"Same....I got to the last episode and can't watch it.  So dumb, but it's like I want to savor it like an unopened present even though I saw it 16 years ago"
Intervention,One of those super sneaky hilarious lines that always gets me to bust out laughing.
Intervention,Mine will always be when Chris punches the guy in acting class
Intervention,"My fav scene is this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMw7b4ltJtk  where tony gets emotional when Oh Girl plays on the car radio,"
Intervention,satanic black magic shit!
Intervention,"I don’t think it was about credibility but more so no matter how many years this guy was sober, or if he became an astronaut or Nobel peace prize winner, in their eyes he’d always just be that ass hole that “stole all those pork loins from Stew Leonards that one time”."
Intervention,"A *Jose Canseco* bat?

*Tell me* you didn't pay money for this."
Intervention,That is Casey Jones from the original Ninja Turtles movie
Intervention,This might be the best joke in the entire series though.
Intervention,*Your
Intervention,"“Yeah, but that’s not why I’m here” funniest response he could’ve given"
Intervention,Tennis lessons scenes were good.
Intervention,I swear Christopher died the day he had Adriana killed
Intervention,"Didn't he die literally while eating a plate of spaghetti?

Edit: leaving it because I should know better than to believe Internet rumours.

He did have a 2,700 calorie meal and a shit ton of alcohol hours prior though."
Intervention,That was the line that stuck out to me. Ooof. RIP Mr. Gandolfini.
Intervention,"congrats on the ten years, big dawg"
Intervention,"First time watching and you’ve got 5-6 episodes left? You lucky but unlucky bastard. Obviously lucky because it’s your 1st time watching it. Unlucky because the moment you finish it, is the moment you tether your future to countless re-watches, as well as your number 1 go to for background noise as a comfort mechanism. I was so anxious about finishing the series the 1st time I watched it on DVD, I got halfway through season 6 and just started it over. Lol."
Intervention,"Just curious because it’s be so long since the show ended but do you know how it ends?  If not, hang on!

I’d give anything to watch the show again for the first time."
Intervention,I think the moratorium on spoilers is null and void for a show that finished 17 years ago...
Intervention,"**WHEN I CAME INTO THE THREAD DERE YOU WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COMMENTS**

**YOUR COMMENT WAS IN THE NEGATIVE THIRTIES**

**DISGUSTING**"
Intervention,You would think he could just get implants or whatever
Intervention,"Such an awesome character, but I have to say my favorite is Tony. James Gandolfini was the right person to play him."
Intervention,"Haha there's no way this was written as a serious scene, it's at least 60% comedy"
Intervention,Serious scene? It's one of the funniest scenes in the whole show.
Intervention,But Tony never had a heart at...oh.  Oh shit. 🤔
Intervention,Did you finish the show?
Intervention,James Gandolfini (tony soprano) died of a heart attack at the age of 51
Intervention,didn't he almost drown in three inches of water?
Intervention,I just finished watching it for the very first time a couple weeks ago. By todays standards the show is a straight up comedy with some excellent dramatic moments. I thought heading into it it would be straight drama but was totally caught off guard how funny it is.
Intervention,How?! I watched this over lockdown and the series took nearly 7 months to finish!
Intervention,"Completely understand 

I just started season 3 and already know I’m going to have to do the same when I get to that point"
Intervention,**A**!!!
Intervention,That’s right before he whoops dudes ass for fucking his ex right?
Intervention,Stew Leonard’s
Intervention,They immediately demonstrated the phone call game in that one convo. So great.
Surviving R. Kelly,[deleted]
Surviving R. Kelly,"Bring it on, people need that perspective. Watchmen gave us a taste but something tells me there's still a lot we don't know."
Surviving R. Kelly,Dave Chapelle said that this new series from Dream Hampton is gonna be too hot for TV
Surviving R. Kelly,"I really hope they cover some of the other horrific race massacres of this time as well. It’s important for people to know that this hate wasn’t isolated. This history, as heinous as it is, provides so much insight into the racial disparity we see today."
Surviving R. Kelly,"How accurate will it be? I learned about the Tulsa ""Race Riots"" in the 80 in Dallas schools. BUT It was taught to me that the black people started rioting over some stupid issue that I cannot recall. Fast forward 40 years, *I'm watching* The Watchmen, and I see it being the complete opposite story, so I went to the internet and found out some horrible shit guys. Let me just start by saying, it wasn't a Race Riot. It was a fucking massacre. Literal massacre. Children gunned down, women gunned down in their backs while they ran, businesses burnt, people beat in the street. . . . all because the Blacks that lived there started ""*elevating their station*"". We got some fucked up shit in our American history where were only getting half truths of in school. And dont stop at the Tulsa ""Race"" riots, this happened more than a few times in our past."
Surviving R. Kelly,"Good.    


I love Watchmen for inserting a real event into an alternate history show just make it a double whammy when you figure it out :)

I remember hearing the ""send me your unwashed masses..."" as a kid and thinking how nice to have a new home for immigrants.  

It also means send me your clowns so we can exploit them for cheap labor...the religious crazies weren't escaping persecution so much as finding somewhere they could persecute others without repercussions.  

At some point you need to put money into schools and hospitals for everyone or the people you leave behind -  the poor, different races, you name it - hurting them just pokes big holes in society and it won't work when you need it to.  

It is interesting see the countries going under - US and UK with big gaps between the rich and poor and populist leaders are obvious but Switzerland and Singapore with their large poor communities let them down, too. Sweden is an interesting exception they were set up well but listened to the wrong scientists and didn't adjust when it failed.  

Hurting people with systems comes back at you.  Time to learn."
Surviving R. Kelly,"I bring up Tulsa whenever some racist asshat starts talking about ""well they've been freed for over 100 years and haven't done anything"". Impossible to do anything when your a small minority and your other countrymen will literally burn down your neighbourhoods if you do too well."
Surviving R. Kelly,"Excited about the documentary, but not anyone associated with the R.Kelly documentary.  I found that documentary to be a bore.  It never attempting to get any deeper than surface area in the world of Kelly and all the years he put in, with many people covering up for him, and many kids being hurt."
Surviving R. Kelly,Interesting fact: The 99th anniversary of the riot was yesterday.
Surviving R. Kelly,She's too hot for TV.
Surviving R. Kelly,[deleted]
Surviving R. Kelly,"Can’t wait for this, such a tragic point in history, it needs to be shown to the public. It needs to be brought up more. I wasn’t aware of it until Watchmen. More people need to know the history of hate in America. The TRUE history."
Surviving R. Kelly,Love this. Let’s remind America of the history it’s tried so hard to rewrite.
Surviving R. Kelly,75% of the U.S. probably never heard of Black Wall Street.
Surviving R. Kelly,"Ah fuck yes,that's a very important event in black US history that has been totally swept under the rug. Good get it made,yes that is great news. Everyone is going to be piiiisssed"
Surviving R. Kelly,You guys think these black can riot just wait and see what the good old boys did!
Surviving R. Kelly,Tulsa riots were bad just nobody cares about Oklahoma if it happened in New York it would be known more commonly also it was done in the 20’s when the KKK had peak membership and even was the major party in multiple northern and southern states in the 20’s that why people like the 1920’s a lot.
Surviving R. Kelly,"btw, is R.Kelly finally in jail now?"
Surviving R. Kelly,Def watching
Surviving R. Kelly,How can i watch this?
Surviving R. Kelly,"For anyone who wants to learn more on their own, I highly suggest looking into the story of [Otis Clark.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Clark) He was one of the survivors, and [gave an interview on his experiences](https://m.voicesofoklahoma.com/interview/clark-otis/) before passing away. 

When I taught US History in Tulsa I would play his interview for my students (who lived in North Tulsa), would pause it, and pull up maps of the area he described so they could see how it was the same streets and how it looked today. It was probably one of the best classroom exercises we had all year."
Surviving R. Kelly,"It’s crazy how this was introduced to the majority of Americans through a superhero tv show. Honestly, it makes sense."
Surviving R. Kelly,Stuff You Should Know has a great podcast on this subject.
Surviving R. Kelly,[deleted]
Surviving R. Kelly,Hopefully it accurately portrays how it all started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre#Riot
Surviving R. Kelly,"To bad surving R Kelly was terribly put together, the story was there but the editing/music/flow felt like a high schooler made it"
Surviving R. Kelly,[deleted]
Surviving R. Kelly,Please don’t mess it up
Surviving R. Kelly,"Series? That seems like a lot I've read 3 books over the subject and while I think it could be stretched that far I can't imagine it being worth a while series. I'm interested still though, because you know I didn't read the books for no reason."
Surviving R. Kelly,"For a great book on this subject I highly suggest the book Riot and Remembrance by James S. Hirsch. It goes in depth both on the moment to moment history of the riot, why the riot happened, and how the riot became so unknown."
Surviving R. Kelly,In bed down the street from greenwood 🤧
Surviving R. Kelly,"The Podcast “American History Tellers” did a multi-part  series on the Massacre not too long ago that’s very informative...  great podcast all around, but prior to that  it was a historical event I had never even heard of."
Surviving R. Kelly,"I just heard of this for the first time yesterday. I was educated in west Texas, at a good private school through 6th grade then in decent public schools where I took honors history from a damn good teacher. My mom, a Californian, knew and remembered things I haven’t even seen here in comments or in the video that was linked. Why is our education system so...incomplete"
Surviving R. Kelly,It's weird that I can watch serial killer stuff eg. 'Mindhunter' and gory WWII docs but can't sit through the MJ or RK or Epstein docs... zero interest in this.
Surviving R. Kelly,"Must be strange finding out things like that about your own country. Makes you wonder about what else they don’t teach you .

That name also fucked everything up that I was trying to read, too.

So many capitals..."
Surviving R. Kelly,When I first saw I honestly thought they were trying to establish that the Watchmen universe diverged much earlier than what Alan Moore established. Yeah only to learn that same night that that was fucking real. It's nightmarish and to learn that it's not even well known to the people who live there and in the States in general just fuck.
Surviving R. Kelly,I'm so glad this story is being told.

Surviving R. Kelly,"At some point time , you need to understand what systematic racism. The reason you never heard about this is because the us was created on oppression, murder and tomfoolery. You can’t be surprised
And confused why you haven’t heard about one of many massacres carried out by the us. You should be expecting more lies and hidden truths. Don’t be surprised anymore. This is US . Uncovering history should open your eyes."
Surviving R. Kelly,"What works as blaxploitation might not work as a documentary.

Surviving R. Kelly,It’s about time!
Surviving R. Kelly,"I don’t know if it’s the age of the average redditor (too young to have had this in school or too old to remember learning this) or if a massive amount of people didn’t go/didn’t pay attention in school, or people are getting some satisfaction about joining in and just trying to be apart of the crowd saying this is new to them (or the countless people saying some random not history teacher went off the curriculum and let you fail _____ to learn about it) , but i cannot believe this amount of American people didn’t know about black Wall Street. It’s talked about so much in race debates and (from my school atleast) literally taught every year in history class. Maybe I am naive and perceive people to be more intelligent then they are but I can’t believe it. I really cannot."

Surviving R. Kelly,"I'm shocked I didn't learn about Tulsa in school back in the 00s. Not only that, they barely go over Japanese internment, Native American massacres, the Aids outbreak, or any of the race riots. Kind of shows how the American Education System truly sucks."

Surviving R. Kelly,"Please spread this as far as you can! I grew up and was educated in Tulsa. The only reason my history class knew about it is because an older documentary shown to us by a coach with a big heart. I am completely disturbed how many other Tulsans did not come across this in their education. 

Research it on your own AND watch the documentary and the upcoming docuseries. Trust me there is so much more to it than they can cover or I can here. You're better off using ""Tulsa Race Riots"" as your search term but please continue calling it the Tulsa Race Massacre because that's what it is.

Surviving R. Kelly,I randomly heard about it two years ago where someone on twitter posted its wiki and said something along the likes of “worst American massacre and you’ve never heard of it” and it was true. I literally had 0 knowledge of it. It’s insane this is part of American history and we don’t teach it when talking about the kkk In US history
Surviving R. Kelly,"When the scene was over, I thought “Well that’s just sloppy writing. There’s no way a massacre THAT MAJOR in the Watchmen world wouldn’t have already been mentioned in the events of the comics.”

Then I found out it was fucking real."
Surviving R. Kelly,"> The US could use a documentary on the Tulsa Race Massacre and some history lessons around Black Wall Street.

I had never heard of the Tulsa Race Massacre until a few years ago, and I'm an Oklahoman! 

I look forward to seeing this documentary."
Surviving R. Kelly,"I have lived in Oklahoma my entire life (30 years) and only found out about the Tulsa Race Massacre eight years ago. It wasn’t taught in public schools, even the the mandatory Oklahoma History class just happened to gloss over it."
Surviving R. Kelly,Stuff You Should Know podcast did a very good episode on it.
Surviving R. Kelly,A lot of people don’t know about Seneca Village either. That was a primarily black village that was destroyed to make Central Park [link](https://timeline.com/amp/p/6356723113fa)

Surviving R. Kelly,"First I heard of it was a podcast called Stuff You Should Know, they mentioned Watchmen too."
Surviving R. Kelly,Also race “riots” of 1919 in Chicago and as many other places.  As well as many other massacres that have occurred too numerous to list.

Surviving R. Kelly,I’m pretty sure there are documentaries on it and I can’t speak for other schools but it was taught in my history class grades 8-12th during black history month. I’d actually be surprised if it isn’t taught throughout the US and the people in this comment section just don’t recall it being taught. Wouldn’t be the first time.
Surviving R. Kelly,The riots were started from a rape allegation because people were #believewomen they believed the woman and arrested the black guy
Surviving R. Kelly,Blacks have burnt down enough cities since then to call it even I think

Surviving R. Kelly,"But, what did Ja Rule say?"
Surviving R. Kelly,I came here looking for this comment.
Surviving R. Kelly,Ahahahaha
Surviving R. Kelly,"The Wilmington Massacre in particular deserves far more focus.

A literal successful coup on American soil, with white supremacists overthrowing a democratically elected Fusionist government, killing hundreds in the process, before spinning it as 'a race riot caused by blacks'."
Surviving R. Kelly,"100%. People all over crying about how this ""violence isn't the answer"" and ""this doesn't honor the death of one man"", when it's more about centuries of being slaughtered, marginalized, imprisoned, and ignored."
Surviving R. Kelly,What race massacres happened during the time of these riots?
Surviving R. Kelly,I’d love it if they delved into the wildly disproportionate rate at which black Americans kill white Americans.  There 1/5 as many black Americans yet they commit 2 times as many interracial murders.  People need to realize how absurd it is that the black community demands we proclaim black lives matter while they slaughter us.
Surviving R. Kelly,"[I first learned about the Black Wall st from a TYT vid 5 or so years ago](https://youtu.be/NdT8edPYQ7E). Despite the kudos for talking about it,  even they mischaracterize it as a riot"
Surviving R. Kelly,">Impossible to do anything when your a small minority and your other countrymen will literally burn down your neighbourhoods if you do too well.

This is the kind of socially acceptable racism in the cultural landscape of the US, which I find really disturbing. Let's not kid ourselves, you're referring directly about white people, when you're talking about ""other countrymen"", especially in this context. You're making this incredibly racist statement that white people will simply murder black people today, if they do too well, which is reckless and utterly false.

You're making a direct comparison between the small minority of people that committed this Tulsa Massacre, and then white people today. Why? They share the same skin color. The people who committed the Tulsa Massacre were significant outliers, even in 1921, which is why the Tulsa Massacre has been called ""the single worst incident of racial violence in American history."" If you looked at interracial crime statistics, then it's quite clear that white americans aren't uniquely violent or murderous.

However, your perspective has become a surprisingly common racial perspective in US culture recently, which is why I'm worried about what kind of opinionated messaging that the creators of this documentary will use the platform of the Tulsa Massacre for."
Surviving R. Kelly,"The funniest thing about that documentary is that Dave Chappelle was asked to be on it and declined because he didn't know R. Kelly at all, then the producers/director told media that he declined because Chappelle thought it was ""too hot for TV"". Personally I think they were just looking for more things to feature because everything they were able to cover was already revealed in the past. The only thing that changed was that his music became even less acceptable to play in public"
Surviving R. Kelly,massacre*
Surviving R. Kelly,"I understand where you are coming from. It does seem opportunistic. 

I would still be interested in learning more about the event from a non-explosive source. I think a lot of people would."
Surviving R. Kelly,What did you think of Watchmen in relation to Tulsa? Not talking about the massacre but the show did take place there and I am always interested in how locals perceive a story that takes place where they live.
Surviving R. Kelly,So what exactly do you want? Do you want them to not make a documentary? Do you want them to give proceeds to the black community in Tulsa?
Surviving R. Kelly,"When I read articles on this incident 3 years ago, it wasn't biased like today but I immediately thought burning black wall street down would make a great Hollywood material. And after a couple of years now you are able to see more and more revisionist history on this. No one would care about what happened in reality. It's just some writers/producers finding out wow we can use that piece."
Surviving R. Kelly,PBS did a very good doc on GREENWOOD that you should look up. Sadly I’m in Canada and can’t link it online as my IP won’t allow me access. I watched it last year when it was on TV (we get PBS up here and actually help finance the stations in Detroit and Buffalo).
Marianne,"I saw an explanation somewhere of why they don't. No idea if it's true, but it makes reasonable sense to me.

Basically the writers have lots of great ideas for upcoming seasons and great ideas don't grow on trees so they want to re-use those ideas in other  shows in the future. By revealing the planned story those ideas becomes unusable in other projects. They would be giving them away for nothing."
Marianne,My name is Earl just ended on a goddamn cliffhanger. I will never know who Earl Jr's dad is and that pisses me off!
Marianne,"If they know. But a lot of shows would be like ""Well if we had 3 more months in the writer's room I could tell you."""
Marianne,Pushin Daisies
Marianne,Definitely. After Netflix canceled The Midnight Club Mike Flanagan made a detailed post about how season 2 would have played out. More showrunners should do that.
Marianne,Never give good ideas away for free
Marianne,"All the writers: ""Then a giant meteor hit and everyone died."""
Marianne,They kinda did that for Last Man on Earth
Marianne,"Archive 81 was based on a podcast, and while Netflix made some significant story changes, there are two additional seasons to the podcast if you want to explore further.

That being said: seasons 2 and 3 get pretty weird."
Marianne,Santa Clarita diet. ended a season on a massive cliffhanger and it didn't get renewed
Marianne,"Back in the days, some network TV writers used to do that once their shows get cancelled by the networks. Sometime they gave quick outline of the aborted season, other time they go into more details.

Marianne,the society writers need to do this purely so I can know who that girls baby daddy is
Marianne,"trying to make that bread, can't be giving away recipes"
Marianne,Mike Flanagan did this for Midnight Club. It was great. Answered all my questions and then some. He truly is a showrunner for the people.
Marianne,Maybe they should write stories that don't take multiple seasons to tell. Have no problem with short series as long as they are resolved.
Marianne,Not a great idea imo. First seasons of shows can be quite experimental and the writers might not know how the show is going to end. I think HIMYM was one of the rare ones where the writers had an idea of how they wanted to end the story and altered it as the seasons progressed but kept their ultimate ending intact (which backfired as a result).
Marianne,"The network wants the show to be on air for as long as possible, therefore sometimes not even the writer can know how the show will end, Especially when it comes to shows where one ""mystery"" is stacked on top of another with every season."
Marianne,"That only works for shows where there was a planned outline of a plot to begin with.  A lot of times there's a lot of smoke and mirrors where they act *as if* it's just the audience that's in the dark about the answer to big questions being raised early in the story.  Often, in reality the writers have no clue yet either and will make up an answer in a later episode when the need arises.  I call it the ""Lost problem"", as in what made Lost a terrible show that I bailed on pretty early.  Why I don't like it is that the audience is tricked into thinking that intelligent piecing together of clues will make the story fit and it's ""their fault"" if they get surprised by not seeing ""how it all fits together"".  The truth is it never did all fit together.  The explanation for the clues was invented after the ""clues"" were dropped."
Marianne,Spoiler alert: television is made up as they go.  They are laying down the tracks right in front of the train.
Marianne,"Theyd have to know for sure, their original plan may no longer work after making the show for a little, and they would need to not want to incorporate those plans into future works."
Marianne,This was done for The Lost World. The script was made available online.
Marianne,"Some of them do that.

My favorite example that did release their next season plans was The Unit."
Marianne,">I loved the Netflix shows Archive 81

Couldn't you just listen to the podcast in this instance?"
Marianne,"Depending on the original deal/contract, the writers may not actually own the IP, so may not legally be allowed to."
Marianne,"The show runner of Carnivale put out a blog or something outlining the seasons that never got made. 

A real shame it got canceled."
Marianne,"That’s certainly one reason

I’m sure there’s also legal stuff and contracts involved that may prevent it"
Marianne,">great ideas don't grow on trees so they want to re-use those ideas in other shows in the future.

Anyone that's run a tabletop RPG knows this. You don't meet up after the end of a campaign to spill the beans on 'what ifs', you store those away to use later."
Marianne,That actually makes perfect sense. They could use the same premise but swap out characters or retrofit it for something else
Marianne,"Same goes for video games.

Zelda Wind Waker had a bunch of stuff that either got cut or couldn’t make the game due to time constraints so they just recycled the ideas in later games"
Marianne,"Greg Garcia did an AMA and shared the show ending:

> We never really got the chance to fully figure it out but the talk in the writers room was that Earl Jr’s Dad was going to be someone famous. Like Dave Chappelle or Lil John. Someone that came to town on tour and Joy slept with. But when we got canceled we never got the chance to figure it out. I was worried about doing a cliffhanger but I asked NBC if it was safe to do one at the end of the season and they told me it was. I guess it wasn’t.
> 
> I had always had an ending to Earl and I’m sorry I didn’t get the chance to see it happen. You’ve got a show about a guy with a list so not seeing him finish it is a bummer. But the truth is, he wasn’t ever going to finish the list. The basic idea of the ending was that while he was stuck on a really hard list item he was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it. Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it. They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl. He asks them where they got the idea of making a list and they tell him that someone came to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else. Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with list and that he’s finally put more good into the world than bad. So at that point he was going to tear up his list and go live his life. Walk into the sunset a free man. With good karma.


Also for anyone that likes My Name is Earl, check out Sprung. It's available to watch for free on Freevee. It's also made by Greg Garcia and has a similar vibe to Earl."
Marianne,"Heres a snippet from the creator.

""Garcia later revealed the planned ending for the series would have found Earl stuck and frustrated with a difficult item on his list - only to encounter someone he'd made amends with previously. They were inspired to make their own list after meeting Earl, who realizes he has done some good in the world. Earl then tears up his list, content that his karma has been restored."""
Marianne,My younger brother binged that entire series on Disney+ and has asked me when the next season is coming out. The same with *Final Space* on Netflix. I haven’t the heart to tell him.
Marianne,"Agreed. It’s also kind of like “Coach who was fired in week 4 tells all about how the season was supposed to end in a Super Bowl victory.” Even writers of cancelled shows must know that their plot ideas, even the ones 100% fleshed-out, can’t all come to pass for any number of reasons they can’t necessarily control."
Marianne,"And they've teased us for 14 years now with ""oh we're making a comic to continue it"" or ""oh we're making a stage play/musical to continue it"" and it never happens."
Marianne,"Damn, this thread has now taught me The Midnight Club and Archive 81 were both canceled. 

.........I should leave this thread. Lol."
Marianne,"> The Midnight ~~Club~~ **Mass**

Fixed :)

But now I think that someone should write a version of The Breakfast Club with vampires. ;)

Edit: oh well, from the comment below *there is* a show called Midnight Club from the same author of Midnight Mass. He really likes midnights, huh?"
Marianne,Not the ending I expected for Friends
Marianne,"MAN WHAT , DO TELL OR SEND LINK"
Marianne,Momma?  <End of Series>  Fuck you Netflix.
Marianne,This is the one that hurts me the most but also I blame the creators more than Netflix. They ended every season on a cliffhanger this was bound to happen.
Marianne,"Oof, disappointing to hear. That's been on my ""may be worth checking out"" list for a while, but pretty much entirely due to Olyphant. Both the premise and Berrymore have kept me from starting. It ending on cliffhanger may be enough for me to finally abandon it."
Marianne,could you link that??
Marianne,"I think writers frequently don't know what the ending is.  they may have a general idea, but not a fleshed out story."
Marianne,"> I’m sure there’s also legal stuff and contracts involved that may prevent it

Quite. Usually the production company/studio/whatever will retain the rights to the setting and story. Meaning even if the creator wanted to continue telling the story through, say, a novel or other format, they couldn't legally do so without the permission of the production company, even though it was their story to begin with."
Marianne,Thank you for this! This give me some closure the Earl would have ended up happy with life and who he had become.
Marianne,"Also Raising Hope by Greg Garcia, another amazing show.

They even have a mini My Name is Earl reunion in it."
Marianne,Thank you for this! This give me some closure the Earl would have ended up happy with life and who he had become.
Marianne,Final Space was a tough one because they've literally wiped it from everything. It did peak in season 1.
Marianne,"If they end up making a broadway musical I will go into the city and see it, doesn't matter the cost"
Marianne,"Actually Midnight Mass, and Midnight Club, are two different shows. Mass was always a single season, Club was meant to have a season 2"
Marianne,"No, it was *The Midnight Club* — Flanagan had two different Netflix series with ‘Midnight’ in the title — *Midnight Mass*, a vampire miniseries (never meant to have a second season) based on [the fictional book the main character of his film *Hush* was writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cDBiqNIJVw) — and *The Midnight Club*, a series adapting the novels of Christopher Pike (the author, not the *Star Trek* character)."
Marianne,Thought it was a mash up of Midnight Diner & Fight Club
Marianne,"Young justice said he has no plans for an ending, just writing as he gets seasons.
If it isn't renewed,  it will eventually end on a cliffhsnger."
Marianne,"it's very funny and the gore/practical effects are really fun! but there's a lot of Berrymore flavor to it, if you don't like her vibe you'll probably not enjoy the show. Olyphant is a delightful kind but often intimidated husband in the show, I've heard that he is more known for his roles where he's an action man, take charge kinda thing, in SCD he's much more your average guy grasping to adapt to this wild situation he has very little control over. imo it was a great show, making the ending even more upsetting"
Marianne,"https://collider.com/midnight-club-season-2-plot-mike-flanagan-comments/

Here you go!"
Marianne,"Seems to vary among different TV shows, tbh. 

It does seem like a recognition of Lost's issues has led more showrunners to plot out their entire story in advance, at least for those kinds of shows with a lot of mystery elements involved in them."
Marianne,"Haha, I knew only about Mass!"
Marianne,"Like most, I love Olyphant from Justified and Deadwood. Less action man and more world-weary stoic for the most part, but I get what you're saying. It seemed like Barrymore was the focus, good to know that's the case.

Appreciate the info!"
Marianne,"It was fascinating hearing Vince Gilligan talk about Breaking Bad.  It was such a thoughtful cohesive story, but they added and removed tons of stuff (from their original plan) and really built it as they went."
Marianne,"It's hard and may be a fool's errand to have more than a general idea of where the show is going. Babylon 5 famously had a 5 season plan from the start, and while the result was a great show, the saying ""man plans, God laughs"" comes to mind. They had to make *big* changes along the way because:

* A starring alien character played by a female actor was meant to appear as male and be referred to as male for *seasons* and then undergo a gender transformation. But they were unable to settle on makeup and voice altering that would make her performance convincingly male, so they abandoned that idea after entering production. 
* Spoilers for the first two seasons: >!The actor who played the main character suffered from a debilitating mental illness, so they had to create a new main character to begin season 2.!<
* A major side character's actor wanted to leave, so they had to abruptly write her off (it was *really* abrupt) and give the arc planned for her character to another character.
* They were told season four would be their last, so they rushed to get the planned story of both season four and five out in one season's worth of episodes. 
* Then at the last minute, they got a season 5 renewal, so they held off the final episode and pulled some season 5 stories out of their butts and then put the final episode they'd filmed for season 4 at the end of season 5."
Marianne,"Tbh I'd be surprised if things didn't change and evolve naturally over time, even for a show that was planned out entirely from the very beginning. 

What doesn't seem to work well is throwing out mystery boxes without having any kind of plan for what the eventual reveal is supposed to be. 

Tbh, this seems to be more of a concern for shows that heavily feature a central mystery (often of a sci-fi or paranormal nature). Currently running examples I can think of would include Yellowjackets, From, and Servant. That kind of show really needs to keep a handle on its loose threads, mysterious elements, and eventual reveals, or things can fall apart."
Marianne,"Breaking Bad didn’t have a plot outline so much as a plot direction, which is why I think it did so well. They could be as flexible as they needed to be with where the show went and it still felt like it was all part of the same story because they were continuously pushing Walt’s character in the direction that provided the main thrust of the series."
Marianne,"I am sure she will be fine addition.

This show is a mess. Season 1 started great but really fizzled by the end and season 2 was just idiotic."
Marianne,I'M AN ANALYST
Marianne,"Season 2 was fantastic for me bonding with my coworkers. I'd just started a new job, and the topic of the show came up. We ended up staying late just to rip on how bad season 2 was. Great times.."
Marianne,Season 2 felt like American propoganda that didn't realise it was actually anti-American propoganda.
Marianne,Why is this still going?  Season 2 was terrible.  They cancel fucking Tick and Patriot and keep this dogshit?
Marianne,Season 2 was terrible.
Marianne,"I’m surprised this show is still going on. Most of what I generally hear about this show, is that it’s somewhere around ok to mediocre. Rarely do I see any praise for this show, nor do I see much discussion about it online, either. Plus, I’m assuming this show isn’t cheap to produce. I guess some people have to be watching it if it got renewed for a third season."
Marianne,"> Jean-Baptiste will play Elizabeth Wright, the Chief of Station. There is no production start date yet; filming is expected to begin in 2021.

Didn’t filming start 2 months ago?"
Marianne,I love this show.
Marianne,"I adore Marianne Jean-Baptiste but she really needs a better agent, between this and Fatman all her talent is going to waste.

She was astounding in ""In Fabric""."
Marianne,I tried to watch this show. The pilot was the most confusing thing I’d ever seen. I had no clue what was going on. Maybe I’m too uncultured?
Marianne,i felt like nothing actually happened in s2
Marianne,The show continues to have a ton of promise it can’t seem to get right.
Marianne,"I am shocked it's even getting a season 3.  I hope it makes a massive improvement because as you said, season 2 was a steaming pile of trash that made no sense."
Marianne,"> Season 2 was fantastic for me

>We ended up staying late just to rip on how bad season 2 was. Great times..

you had me in the first half not gonna lie.


Though to be honest I tried listening to the first Jack Ryan book and find the entire thing laughable before chapter 10. I like the thriller nature of the jack ryan stories but damn if Jack Ryan isn't a Twilight for military geeks."
Marianne,"season 1 was alright a few silly bits like civilians driving past a active gunfight at a gas station in norway or something. 

season 2 was somehow stupidly crazy in plot yet also pretty damn boring with a nonsensical finale of a unit of american solders storming a foreign nations perirenal compound to save a guy who got caught trying to overthrow the president or something."
Marianne,"Nielsen reported that a lot of high-earning people watched the second season of the show: 

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-jack-ryan-draws-solid-audience-season-2-1259267

That's all Amazon cares about."
Marianne,Completely mediocre. It's not even close to realistic.
Marianne,"So her agent has gotten her a job on what will probably be Mel Gibson's triumphant return to the top of the mounain on one of Amazon's most popular shows.

It seems to me that her Agent is kicking ASS."
Marianne,"Despite being on a streaming site (which gives it greater liberties in story and uncensored language/violence/nudity), it's a show seemingly made as though it were meant to air for CBS audiences."
Marianne,">civilians driving past a active gunfight at a gas station in norway

Why, would you pull over and ask what's going on? Also I think it was the French Alps."
Marianne,Gottta disagree she went from an Oscar nominee to being in crappy American television. She should go back to the uk and do bbc shows which were better anyway
Marianne,">Why, would you pull over and ask what's going on?

The options aren't to just drive by exposing yourself to crossfire or stop and investigate further. Gun's are rather loud, generally a person avoids said gunfire area."
Marianne,Best Three Houses girl. Is this like a prequel or a spinoff?
Marianne,"TV needs more horror shows, so I'll probably watch this."
Marianne,Title made me think this was gonna be a doco about Marianne Williamson.
Marianne,"Really beginning to hate this modern cinematography trend of ultra dark, ultra low-contrast imagery. Feel like I'm struggling to see a fucking thing even with a nice monitor perfectly calibrated.

Look at the sequence of shots at 1:01, 1:03, and 1:09 of the girl in bed and the door. There's barely even anything to see, just the vaguest of shapes in a mess of monochromatic slushy greenish brown. I had to squint and put my face up close to the monitor to make out the blocky artifacts that are supposed to be a door, and that's in ""1080p"" (which looks like trash on Youtube). It's not even ""dark"", it's just gray. Nothing reaches even close to pure white or black in the spectrum.

These type of visuals might look good on a high data bluray disc on a high end 4k TV in a dark room, but that's not how %90 of people are going to be watching crap on Netflix. They just look even shittier when they're watched on a streaming service on an average TV / laptop screen with low brightness that can't render subtly different shades of color and so everything just breaks down into a blocky, smeary mess of artifacts. This is what everyone was complaining about with the Long Night episode of GoT. Impossible to enjoy when you're straining to make out what the christ is even happening.

A lot of classic horror movies were able to be fairly brightly lit, with hard shadows and contrast, and still were able to achieve a creepy mood. These modern movies are just ugly and hard to watch."
Marianne,orb gang orb gang orb gang
Marianne,genuinely creeped out
Marianne,"There's nothing more boring than an entity that controls reality and has no rules to their universe (unlike in Poltergeist, The Shining, and Candyman), just tons and tons of protags/victims seeing something, doing a doubletake, and then there's nothing there. Jumpscarefest."
Marianne,"As an English speaker, I’ve always thought the French language is so romantic and inviting in the way it sounds, so it’s hard for me to take this trailer seriously when I hear the witch saying evil demonic things in French."
Marianne,Seems interesting.
Marianne,"couldnt even see what was happening in that last sequence, and they chose THAT to close out the trailer, yeesh"
Marianne,Sum spooky shit! 😍😍😍😍😍
Marianne,"Is there a way to make Netflix stop showing me non English shows on my front page? I can't count how many times I've been catfished by a trailer that looks good, only to click play and find out it's Spanish, French, Russian, etc."
Marianne,"So it's a story about saying 'so long, Marianne'?"
Marianne,"If you can't do anything original with horror, why even bother.  
This looks terribly mediocre and overdone. I find these attempts at horror laughable at best. Same with the haunted hill house series from last year, so predictable it hurts."
Marianne,[deleted]
Monarca,Why cant netflix just make a scifi or fantasy show starring latinos. It could be set in mexico or columbia or any latino country. Latinos want scifi shows too but apparently netflix thinks we only want to watch narco series or soapy shows.
Monarca,">... the drama about the world of wealthy Mexican elites riddled by corruption.

Is anyone really interested in another telenovela about rich people?"
Monarca,Good.  We need to see more of her since she's the only well-known Mexican woman that isn't unattractive.
Monarca,"3%? Casa de Papel? Those are two really popular series staring latinos. To be honest, those two and Narcos are the only non English series on Netflix I watch."
Monarca,Altered Carbon co-stared a Latina and even featured a bit of Mexican culture into the story. It's not exactly a Latino scifi show but a start I guess.
Monarca,"It's not a telenovela. But yes, I'm open to it. I'm just wondering how tricky it could be telling stories of institutional corruption given how central it seems to be in news and culture in Mexico."
Monarca,it is a Salma Hayek telenovela baby!
Monarca,Casa de papel is set in spain which is european not latin america. And only 3% that isnt enough. They should make more scifi shows starring latino actors since latinos like scifi genre too.
Monarca,"Trust me, it's going to be a telenovela or at the very least an American style soap opera."
Monarca,An evening soap? I could see that. I wouldn't have any problem with it. A big old family drama? Sign me up.
Monarca,"It premeired yesterday. It caught my attention.

It's on my list to check out same as Monarca"
Monarca,"Just to clarify, it’s a Mexican show, not a Spain one"
Monarca,Cathedral of the Sea is one of their brilliant Spanish shows.
Monarca,I've been binge watching it for the past couple of days. I'm on episode 20 and it just keeps getting better.
Monarca,"These kinds of shows give me so much adrenaline!! They are so good and I find all the characters very relatable. Truly an amazing work of art. Though, I think they give a wrong idea about illegal activities."
Monarca,"For some reason I don’t quite  understand, HIgh Seas is one of my favorite shows..."
Monarca,"I’m gonna need you to sell me on a non spoiling clip, takes a lot of hype for me to be into anything that isn’t football rn"
Monarca,"The club, Netflix cheers.

What's the German show about? I don't want to Google it for fear of being on a list"
Monarca,"really? I couldn't pass the first episode. I was just laughing at the story and how bad the acting was, I mean it was terrible. Nothing made me keep watching."
Monarca,"It’s not a great show, it’s more a show to have on as the background while you’re cleaning or having on while being on reddit. Acting can be over the top, typical mexican telenovela type. Im on episode 6, because my PS4 is at my bfs and i have nothing else to watch. It’s not really attention grabbing and generic storyline so far."
Monarca,Just finished it and it was really good! That ending was insane.
Monarca,"The overall plot arch is good, the actors are fantastic, and production value is on point.

However, the storyline is sloppy as hell. In at least one episode scenes were edited in out of order, and otherwise there isn't a lot of coherence scene-to-scene, and there is a supreme lack of character development.

It has potential though."
Monarca,Monarca is amazing
Monarca,"Ah, it is? I was wondering why the accents sounded different. Thank you, I'll edited the post"
Monarca,"This is a Netflix originals show? Never heard of it, usually Netflix of pretty good at promoting Originals"
Monarca,The best i can do i suggest to watch the trailer. I can barely find anything on it and i cant screen record because netflix doesn't let you :(
Monarca,"I had the same thought, lol. To win back his girlfriend who broke up with him after spending a year abroad, he decides to start selling drugs with  his best friend through their app.as their success grows things start to spiral out of control. It's a dramedy, and it's very gen z and social media focused fyi if that's something you might not like.

It's really short, 6 episodes and around 30 minutes each. It's a really good show though.


Here's a trailer: https://youtu.be/3sxg1xXmd0I"
Monarca,"It gets 10 times better, really"
Monarca,Ugh I couldn’t finish it w/o subtitles
Monarca,You don't have the option to turn on subtitles? The trailer popped up with subtitles for me
Monarca,"Not on YouTube, “trailer oficial” is written in Spanish same with the description :("
Monarca,"Ah, the one i saw was on netflix. It's so shitty that netflix cant even release a subtitled trailer on YouTube. What are they even doing??"
Monarca,Losing me from streaming it online but more importantly preventing it from gaining traction
Unbelievable,"I'm in the process of leaving Mormonism. It's pretty believable given the geographic location, the time period, and Mormon culture.

You also have the fact that the parents were both fucking this guy and were accomplices to him abusing their daughter."
Unbelievable,The real story is insane. >!Both parents offered their kid up like a lamb to slaughter… BECAUSE THEY BOTH WERE FUCKING THE KIDNAPPER. Both. Parents. Had sexual relations. With the kidnapper.!<
Unbelievable,Eyy it’s plop
Unbelievable,Something about Jake Lacy's face terrifies the absolute shit out of me.
Unbelievable,He was so loveable in Obvious Child but every other role I've seen him in he's so creepy. Even as Hannah's boyfriend on Girls.
Unbelievable,I remember when the Netflix documentary came out and my coworkers were all talking about it and I straight up didn’t believe them. The story is absolutely insane. So I watched the show and just got more and more angry as it progressed because of how incompetent the parents were.
Unbelievable,Once you learn this happened within the Mormon community it makes a lot more sense.
Unbelievable,"> In Peacock’s A Friend of the Family, Jake Lacy plays Bob “B” Berchtold, a man who befriends a Midwestern Mormon family in the 1970s, only to kidnap their young daughter Jan not just once, but twice. It would be an unbelievable story if it weren’t true: Jan Broberg’s story was previously chronicled in the 2017 documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.


> For Lacy, playing a kidnapper and pedophile was an emotional challenge for the actor, particularly given the ages of his victim: Jan was 12 and 14 when she was kidnapped. Hendrix Yancey, now 11, and Mckenna Grace, 16, play Jan at the different ages, while the real Jan Broberg and her mother, Mary Ann, were often on set as they served as producers on the limited series. 


> “It’s so selfless for them to say, ‘We want this story told so that people understand what grooming and coercion and manipulation look like,’ ” Lacy tells THR about getting the Brobergs’ blessing. “And understand that we didn’t get to 1985 and this stopped. It’s still widely prevalent today, and it most often happens at the hands of someone you know and love and trust. That’s why it’s so incredibly difficult to talk about and to prosecute.”"
Unbelievable,I remember this case. IIRC the kidnapper was sleeping with both  of the kidnapped girl’s parents.
Unbelievable,Didn’t Netflix do a doc about this?
Unbelievable,"Jake lacy is good. He just. Sweet nice guy in High Fidelity, absolute asshole rich dude in White Lotus… really masters the white dude range"
Unbelievable,"Mckenna Grace noted that, as someone who's developed a reputation for playing younger versions of main characters, she now has her own younger version.

She's been very good in the other stuff I've seen her in - how she is in this?"
Unbelievable,That’s Plop
Unbelievable,Funny story: I watched the movie 'Abducted in Plain Sight' on a date.
Unbelievable,Mokuba has entered the chat
Unbelievable,Good to see Plop having some good success out there.
Unbelievable,Jake Lacy……ssswwwwoooooonnn
Unbelievable,"Does anyone know if the phone recordings on the Abducted in Plain Sight doc are real? The one were Jan calls from the boarding school telling her parents she's fine and she loves them while giggling at them nearly in tears freaked me the fuck out. And then the end of the call where the parents are like well ok bye, our daughter who has been kidnapped, call more often, 'Kay? 😬"
Unbelievable,"[Jan Broberg Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Broberg_Felt)

From Wikipedia 
Broberg was kidnapped when she was twelve,[3] and again when she was fourteen, both times by Robert Berchtold,[11][12][13] a friend of the family, who had sexual encounters with both parents.[3][14] On October 30, 2003, she and her mother Mary Ann published a heavily redacted book titled Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story which completely omitted her father's sexual involvement with the perpetrator.[15][16] Broberg's story was the feature of the true crime documentary Abducted in Plain Sight. Filmed and produced over a three-year period, it was released in January 2019.[17] Robert Berchtold died by suicide in 2005.[18][19]"
Unbelievable,it really came down to both of her parents being complete idiots.
Unbelievable,Is that Plop?
Unbelievable,Is that Plop?
Unbelievable,Ok but the use of quotation marks in tis headline confused the fuck out of me at first glance
Unbelievable,Good ole Plop
Unbelievable,"I started watching this show and … I just couldn’t finish because I couldn’t believe this would ever actually happen. I kept waiting for that “Lifetime” moment where the parents go into attack mode and do everything they can to protect their kid, but nope… episode 3, I think it was, this man was still in their house. Smdfh."
Unbelievable,Gross that they’re using this for entertainment - I hope the girl agreed to let them do this.
Unbelievable,He looks like twin brother of Mark Zuckenberg
Unbelievable,The difference between a class system and a cast system is that a class system doesn’t discriminate.
Unbelievable,Isn’t that Plop from The Office?
Unbelievable,I wish they'd gone into the guilt of the Mormon church when it comes to this case.  They knew exactly who he was and what he was doing and allowed it to continue.  I think they're actually more at fault than the parents (who at least have the excuse that they were manipulated over a long period of time).  If you read up into what the church knew and ignored it's shocking.
Unbelievable,"Omg I remember reading comments from former Mormons and they're like, ""I know it all sounds crazy and I can't explain it myself but their story sounds really typical Mormon - all their actions and behaviors are the most Mormon things I've ever heard."" And I'm like.... how many Mormons are sleeping with pedophiles and giving their children away to pedophiles to be sexually assaulted??????"
Unbelievable,Glad to hear your shelf broke. Congratulations on starting your life on the outside.
Unbelievable,"> the parents were both fucking this guy 

God, the trailer for this show creeped me out so, so bad that I knew I was going to give it a hard pass no matter how good it was but now this…? BOTH her parents were sleeping with him? What did that innocent girl do to be born into this evil hellscape of an environment?"
Unbelievable,It’s fucking unbelievable. Her parents were literally some of the dumbest people I’ve ever seen.
Unbelievable,"Wasn’t this a Netflix or HBO doc?

I swear because dude asked the dad for a handjob(the husband knew dude was sleeping with his wife too at the time) or something and went through with doing it because reasons."
Unbelievable,"Wasn't this the story gave the guy a handjob in a car because he ""needed a release""?"
Unbelievable,"I’m confused because Jan is still talking & worked with her mother on this. Wouldn’t you not want to talk or be near the person who partook in your kidnapping?

The site is bugging out on me if it’s in the article"
Unbelievable,"and for further clarification, the parents were fucking the kidnapper independently of each other.  it wasn't a threesome situation, he seduced them both separately, all whilst diddling the kid.  he somehow brainwashed nearly the entire family to fuck him."
Unbelievable,Wow. That’s “Nearly Unbelievable”!
Unbelievable,"The miniseries made it appear as though the sexual relationship between the father and the stalker was a one-time, almost involuntary incident."
Unbelievable,Anyone know if it's part of the show? I know the family are producers so I'm wondering how much they get into it.
Unbelievable,The documentary was INSANE
Unbelievable,Mormons.
Unbelievable,Why was his name plop?
Unbelievable,I’ll never forgive him for taking Erin away from Andy!!
Unbelievable,[deleted]
Unbelievable,I liked him in the office but after seeing him in white lotus I feel like he will make a much better bad guy and now it’s all I can see. Something about him is just sinister lol.
Unbelievable,He looks like he's going to go on to play a lot of bureaucrats and politicians in supporting roles.
Unbelievable,he reminds me of Nicholas Hoult
Unbelievable,He got Tom Cruise eyes.
Unbelievable,He had the perfect look of a borderline personality disorder case.
Unbelievable,Then you should check out Significant Other
Unbelievable,And yet it's not nearly as disturbing as your face.
Unbelievable,He was great in White Lotus partially because of this imo
Unbelievable,"He’s not really creepy in The White Lotus, just an asshole"
Unbelievable,"He was very charming as the love interest in High Fidelity, but I think I’m the only person in the world who watched that. xD"
Unbelievable,He's not creepy on the Office.
Unbelievable,Very surprised Jan is still even talking to her mom given everything.
Unbelievable,crazy that they consider Idaho “midwestern”
Unbelievable,Yes they did - Abducted in Plain Sight.
Unbelievable,Peacock has a doc about it
Unbelievable,"He was great in High Fidelity, but then again, most of the cast was. What a miss on not giving that show another season."
Unbelievable,He’s also really good in the Showtime show ‘I’m Dying Up Here’
Unbelievable,Phenomenal. She brought me to tears many times.
Unbelievable,"Both of the young actors did a fantastic job.  Amazing, both of them."
Unbelievable,"She's the best young actor working atm, in my opinion. Her performance in Gifted was stupidly good, as in a ""you can retire now"" level of good."
Unbelievable,*That's* how I know him!!
Unbelievable,I can't verify if the recordings were real or reenactments.  But we do know the FBI was tapping the phone calls so I'd have to assume the conversation in the documentary is accurate.  Those parerents are so fucked up I absolutely believe they would behave exactly as the recording played out.  Poor girl was completely brainwashed at that point as well...
Unbelievable,Yes
Unbelievable,"she and her mother are producers and were on set and involved in making this show

the whole article is about this. I know, I know"
Unbelievable,Have you heard of the Boy Scouts of America by chance? I knew three boys molested by their scout leader (scout leaders were chosen by Mormon bishops as a calling) and molested in Mormon churches. The BSA scandal was also a Mormon scandal.
Unbelievable,"I’d find it unbelievable until I learned they were Mormons, they will believe anything as long as your saying it’s in the name of god."
Unbelievable,That documentary effed me up man. The sheer stupidity! It was too much
Unbelievable,It was “Abducted in Plain Sight” on Netflix
Unbelievable,There's no way he only gave up a hand job. That's the pg-13 version
Unbelievable,I saw the documentary and her parents were so naive. I wanted to cry when they talked about their realization that they had failed their daughter and what they each had experienced. It was heartbreaking.
Unbelievable,Yes it’s still on Netflix and it’s the craziest most aggravating thing I’ve ever watched.
Unbelievable,"I’m imagining she recognizes that her parent’s naïveté was taken advantage of by a master manipulator. She was failed by more than her parents, also her school, community leaders, the Mormon church especially was awfully complicit."
Unbelievable,"Yes, they definitely cover this!"
Unbelievable,"Yes, they go into that and the mothers affair.  Also a lot more on what Jan was doing when she was kidnapped the second time and the whole alien story.

There's also a documentary on Peacock which assumes you know the story."
Unbelievable,Because he’s always taking huge dumps
Unbelievable,It's a reference to some obscure TV show. I think it was called The Workplace or something like that?
Unbelievable,r/dundermifflin
Unbelievable,I'll never forgive Andy for giving us Andy
Unbelievable,Andy deserved it
Unbelievable,"No, Clark was New Dwight"
Unbelievable,"Absolutely, his character was like anxiety inducing on that show"
Unbelievable,My favorite Jake Lacy role is in How to be Single. “As a kid I dressed up as a stay-at-home-dad for Halloween! This is my dream!” Or something along the lines of that…
Unbelievable,He was so punchable in White Lotus.
Unbelievable,You should check out the movie Significant Other with him and Maika Monroe. He killed it in that
Unbelievable,"I haven’t finished season one, but from the few episodes I’ve seen he absolutely captures that terrifying rich white guy entitlement psychosis. He’s so menacing."
Unbelievable,"I actually thought that in the Office, fuck young Jim.

But I love Dwight Jr."
Unbelievable,"I just finished the first season this evening - he was perfect for that role

Armond was probably my favourite though"
Unbelievable,"It's crazy how quickly in The White Lotus you see him go from ""he's being a bit of a prick about it, but he is in the right here"" to ""oh fuck this guy"". I worked at Toys R Us for five years and have a father who I have seen verbally berate employees both on the phone and in person, including the one time I was allowed to go to Mexico with him. It was a pitch perfect representation of that, how someone so strongly refuses to accept an issue and admit defeat that they dig their heels in even more and convince themselves they are righ. Like I saw grown men make teenage girls cry because they weren't happy with the return policy corporate had said, my job there for the last bit was basically just putting out fires because these losers are a lot less likely to yell at 6'3 man then a 5 foot tall teenage woman. Even so, I had a woman scream at me ""I want my money now!"" because the 2 dollar final sale skipping rope she bought broke lol."
Unbelievable,He’s not?
Unbelievable,If they ever did a Dexter reboot. Just sayin'
Unbelievable,"> just an asshole


""He may be an asshole, but he's *our* asshole!"""
Unbelievable,Pretty creepy when he hit on the teenage daughter and her friend
Unbelievable,You’re not! You and I are the only *people* who watched it!
Unbelievable,"I had to read that part twice. Why would she be on speaking terms with her mother?! Must be more to the story, otherwise… wtf"
Top Boy,So looking forward to watching this weekend. One of my favourite shows
Top Boy,Leaves you guessing who will get blackmailed this season?
Top Boy,Great season
Top Boy,"So from my understanding, Summerhouse is the original version of this show but I just looked on Netflix and it looks like Summerhouse season 1 is gone? Can I watch the revival without watching Summerhouse? Can I just watch season 2 of Summerhouse and understand things? Is there any place I can watch season 1 of Summerhouse?"
Top Boy,Is this new season?
Top Boy,"Been looking for my next show. Looks like I found it. Thank you, y’all!"
Top Boy,So it's a crime drama? OK so I need to get my mind outta the gutter.
Top Boy,You can watch this without watching Summerhouse at all
Top Boy,"I had the same problem not being able to find S1 Summerhouse a couple of weeks back, but it appears to be there now?"
Top Boy,"Yes, technically season 4, but S2 of the Netflix revival. The first 2 seasons are on Netflix as “Top Boy: Summerhouse”"
Top Boy,Yes.  It is as poorly a named series as there has ever been.
Top Boy,Is summerhouse good. I've only seen the Netflix era stuff.
Top Boy,"ok, so is this a new one? is this like recently filmed? I'm asking because it seems Netflix didn't really promote this series well. I think top boy and I think the top boy is good series and I think it's very underrated."
Top Boy,Eh? Top boy is slang for boss/don/godfather etc. Just because you don't understand it it doesn't make it a poor name
Top Boy,Watch Summerhouse you won’t be disappointed
Top Boy,The person said yes. Yes it’s new it came out today like brand new unseen episodes that came out today recently filmed and released today.
Top Boy,It looks like Netflix removed Summerhouse series 1
Top Boy,Great. Thanks for letting me know. I just wanted to make sure. It’s weird Netflix doesn’t promote it healthy on this.
Top Boy,Anyone knows or remember what happen to Attica??? I don’t remember.
Top Boy,"Excellent show. The two original seasons are the best (the ""Summerhouse"" seasons on Netflix). Of the ""new"" seasons, the first one is really good but the second one is pretty shit."
Top Boy,"Love Top Boy. Definitely one of the best British TV shows. Was super happy Netflix renewed the revival for a third and final season. Reminds me of a British version of The Wire but only told from the side of the gangsters. 

Definitely one of Netflix’s best shows."
Top Boy,"Yes it’s fantastic. There was one storyline I didn’t much care for in S2 (about Deshawns girlfriend) but overall it’s really high quality television. Great news about the third and final season too, hopefully it wraps up well."
Top Boy,This is a fantastic show that not enough people know about. I can’t wait for the new season.
Top Boy,Any suggestions for other good British shows like this?
Top Boy,"What gets me is how much as the viewer I like and warmed to Sully. I know he’s a despicable person and done terrible things. He also has struggles that seem forced on him from the life he was born into. I feel that over the course of the three seasons he became more enlightened to empathy and that more and more of his conscience came to the fore. Also that second to last episode where Dushane learns he’s been robbed for everything, he has a psycho on his case from Liverpool threatening Lauryn and his mum dies. At this stage he collapses from stress just like a high level exec dealing with a hundred high profile problems.

Edit - ok just saw the ending. Changed my view of Sully!"
Top Boy,"The other obvious one is BBC show Peaky Blinders. I prefer Top Boy but Peaky Blinders is a pretty good show as well. 

Gangs of London is supposed to be a solid modern day gangster drama with a heavier focus on action than Top Boy but I’ve not had a chance to get to it myself. It is definitely on my watchlist as the buzz for the first season was positive. 

It is Australian rather than British but if you have not checked out Mr Inbetween it is well worth a go. One of my favourite shows of recent years. Great acting and a fantastic mix of emotional drama and dark humour."
Top Boy,Haha yes. Interested to see where the relationship will go next season. I loved that little scene of him feeding the fox!
Top Boy,Great news and this will be final season and if you count previous two seaons there will be total 5 seasons which is enough to end it on a high note. This show is one of the best ongoing shows.
Top Boy,"Considering how the last season ended, this season being the end makes alot of sense. LETS GIT THIS FOOD BRUV"
Top Boy,[kisses teeth]
Top Boy,Why does this have such few upvotes? Do Americans not watch this show?
Top Boy,"This show is so good! I’m scared of Sully but want to give him a hug at the same time. Say nothin bruv.

Also lots of love to whoever put A Silver Mt Zion on the soundtrack."
Top Boy,Nice!
Top Boy,I was pissed off that Netflix started the series with their own seasons of the show and at the end it goes back to the Channel 4 episodes that take place before.
Top Boy,"It is. I'm not fond of superlatives, but that one is genuinely underrated."
Top Boy,"FIRST YOU GET THE FEWWD, THEN YOU MAKE THE Ps INNIT"
Top Boy,It is same for most of nonAmerican shows except very popular ones. Some people here always complain about Netflix but they ignore so many nonAmerican good shows of Netflix.
Top Boy,Soon as I got outa work I binged it asap
Top Boy,Took me 3 episodes before I figured out what the fuck Ps were lmao
Top Boy,"If you want food all you need is peas, simple!"
Top Boy,Literally the first time I’ve ever heard anybody compare Top Boy and The Wire
Top Boy,"Top boy is not at all the British wire. Not at all. Completely different styles, completely different points."
Top Boy,"> Take this line from Cam: “Bruv allow them prices there fam, what you think you’re tough and all a them things there brother, can’t come to them prices with bad man rudeboy.” It’s gorgeous, and whether it represents a real slice of how people actually speak in London or whether the writers are just inventing or taking liberties with the language, it’s irresistible.

Jesus what is the reviewer even talking about here."
Top Boy,I have no issue with top boy but the wire goes beyond just being a tv show.
Top Boy,">The most common comparison you’ll see is to HBO’s iconic crime drama The Wire, and there’s something to that, in the sense that it’s a story of a largely poor, black population and the inner-city drug trade that scars their communities. Unlike The Wire, the cops here are peripheral, and the focus is almost entirely on the people of “Summerhouse,” the fictional estate where most of the action plays out.

Says the article itself, while the linked reference backing that claim says: 

>Comparisons to The Wire's hoppers and slingers remain inevitable, especially now that Bennett has widened his vision to comment on gentrification and the real cost of both friendship and crime. Despite his best efforts and those of his charismatic young cast, Top Boy doesn't yet have either the fully confident tone of the American show or its ability to lay a character bare with one well-chosen phrase."
Top Boy,They shouldn’t be in the same sentence
Top Boy,*sucks teeth*
Top Boy,The Ads are evolving.
Top Boy,Gomorrah
Top Boy,Top boy has top marketing eh
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Aint nothing as smart or as well acted as the Wire.
Top Boy,"Can you not insult The Wire?

Top boy was good but it’s leagues behind The Wire"
Top Boy,"I like the wire as it’s prolly one of the top few most immersive shows I’ve ever watched; and while I liked some of the Top Boy series (older one mainly) it’s not the same, or even similar. I guess similar genre but that’s it.

The wire is A+ and top boy is good but it’s not Oscar worthy like the wire or however they award Emmy Grammys or whatever to tV shows. 

Overall, watch top boy, it’s good, but if ur choosing between the wire or Top boy, take the wire. It’s just a different league."
Top Boy,"I havn't watched any of this, but from the comments it seems 'Top Boy Summerhouse' is the first two seasons and the separate listing 'Top Boy' is the third season"
Top Boy,Hmm I wouldn’t put the two in the same category
Top Boy,Wah gwan!
Top Boy,Whoever called Top Boy it the British Wire clearly hasn’t watched The Wire and no nothing about inner city Britain.
Top Boy,It’s actually much less.
Top Boy,"Never gonna watch this show cause a cunt from my school is/was in it. little ratfaced fucker call Giacomo Mancini.

Calls himself Jackamo Man-cheeney. which pissed me off for some reason."
Top Boy,Can someone who’s seen both (and that loves the wire) give me an honest opinion of whether top boy is worth watching?
Top Boy,"I love Top Boy and I love the Wire.

Trying to compare them isn't fair to either of them. They are different things. I don't even know where you'd start with comparing them without mangling what either or both of them are doing."
Top Boy,I love this show. Wire has its own and Top Boy has its own place. It’s just Top Boy; it’s not the British Wire.
Top Boy,Lol The Wire is leagues above Top Boy. TB is good but The Wire is most likely the greatest TV show *ever*
Top Boy,Definitely worth watching (especially Summerhouse which is the first 2 seasons) but do not go into it expecting it to be on the same level a The Wire.
Top Boy,"Top Boy is the british wire? Come on, it is not a bad show but it is far far far from being the same level as the wire."
Top Boy,Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit-clay davis
Top Boy,"I haven't even seen this show, but nothing is like The Wire."
Top Boy,Top Boy is very good show mate wtf
Top Boy,The Wire is a slow burner that transcends nearly every other TV drama and has you coming back over and over again. Top Boy is a slow burner that put me to sleep that I can remember almost nothing about and gave up half way through the first season. Just because a major focus is black people in the inner city doesn't automatically make it a British version of The Wire.
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Are we also gonna get Vers Boy and Bottom Boy?
Top Boy,"Love this show.  Also loved the Wire.  
Both are classics from 2 different countries. 
RESPECT"
Top Boy,"Shit doesn’t come close to the wire. Jesus fuck. 

Where’s da food mun
Tha food is missin
Go get it then 
We tough

Zzz"
Top Boy,Comparing the two is like comparing a mass shooter to an all out war
Top Boy,Bottom boy is a better title
Top Boy,"Oh wow! Is there a stupid plot where the main character plays series killer? LOL The wire stinks, over use of the black communities problems for white people to say they seen the horrors of the drugs."
Top Boy,"Just because of the disrespect this headline is throwing out, top boy sucks, never seen it never will. British people crime how scary no guns or real threat of anything
“Right m8 you keep this up we’ll have to put you in our cushy prison system where even if you murder someone you can leave just a few short years later”"
Top Boy,Does anyone know when roughly the next season will be released?
Top Boy,I watched first season and it got old on second season.... Not that goood
Top Boy,Summerhouse what!
Top Boy,"As long as people realise that they've got to watch the ""Summerhouse"" series too"
Top Boy,Top Boy is fantastic. Don't go in expecting the Wire in London though cos you'll leave disappointed. It's got it's own style.
Top Boy,Don't get me wrong top boy and summerhouse are both good shows but neither is in the same league as the wire.
Top Boy,Such a classic show. Hopefully there's going to be another season.
Top Boy,Weird how it can be more than the best TC show ever made
Top Boy,"Someone told me to watch Top Boy, stating it was the British Wire and I absolutely hated it. It’s for the over the top violence and shock factor but the character development and storyline was super boring and lacking."
Top Boy,I will give this a watch.  Although I hate when people say it's just like such popular show.  Because usually I'm just comparing the shows and I don't find it very helpful.
Top Boy,"Top Boy is its own thing, a very good show. I really hate comparisons of the sort,  they're just headlines"
Top Boy,Top Boy is watchable. But The Wire is something else…..in a different league of its own.
Top Boy,And now a whole slew of people will watch it. The system works.
Top Boy,I hadn’t heard of Top Boy before this but now I’ll check it out. Shit works.
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Not sure if sarcastic
Top Boy,Top boy is so good. Itinit.
Top Boy,"Me too, it’s not at all the same lol topboy is way better"
Top Boy,"I watched the first 15 minutes. Are there any police in it? The whole point of The Wire is watching both sides of the ""drug war"". A show just about gangsters isn't ""The Wire"" at all."
Top Boy,All I care is if it’s good and worth watching. Would you recommend top boy?
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Except they completely scripted their characters off the wire. Dushane and Sully = Avon and Slim. Jaq = repackaged Snoop. Jamie = Marlo. Summerhouse redevelopment = Wire towers torn down. The only real difference between the shows is the location and lack of police character focus in Top Boy.
"The Mind, Explained","> People noticed in the first episode that Joel and Sarah avoided eating foods with flour in them, like the birthday cake, pancakes and the neighbor’s biscuits. Jakarta also has one of the world’s largest flour mills, which seems to connect the fungus spread with the contaminated flour. Is that theory correct?

>Mazin: I think it’s pretty explicit.

I missed this entirely. 🤦🏾‍♂️"
"The Mind, Explained","The relevant excerpt for those interested:

>“Why are infected people violent? If the point is to spread the fungus, why do they need to be violent?” We landed on that they don’t. They’re violent because we resist, but what if you don’t? What does it look like if you just stand perfectly still and let them do this to you?"
"The Mind, Explained","To my mind she stood perfectly still because she wanted to keep trying the lighter. If she’d fought or resisted, the Infected would’ve attacked her and she couldn’t have tried turning on the lighter. A necessary sacrifice to get the flame going. 

Although she could have just crouched and lit the fire with the spark."
"The Mind, Explained",That moment was soooo gross
"The Mind, Explained","I attributed it at the time of watching to maybe 'infected-recognizing-infected' as this episode really spent time on the 'they're a hive/collective/connected' explanation

Figured if you're late-stage infected or completely infected, the parasite starts altering the brain and connects you to the collective. 

Hence why >!she went from panic to was calm-accepting + slowing down/pausing to not light up the struggling lighter... I like my explanation better than tendril mouth fungi french kissing sexual assault on my eyes!<"
"The Mind, Explained",Pianooooo Frogggggg is da MVP!!!
"The Mind, Explained",The behind the scenes commentary at the end of each episode is gold. Definitely recommend. He talked about the changes he made compared to the video game for episode 2.
"The Mind, Explained","From the article:

\> Where did that >!clicker kiss!< come from?

Nitpick: That was not a >!clicker!<."
"The Mind, Explained",">Were you expecting a such a spores backlash from fans?  
>  
>Druckmann: I think it speaks to the kind of fans that we have, who are so protective and love the world and these characters so much that *anything they see as a deviation, without the full context of what it means, they assume the worst and push back on it.*

Such a great point and mostly why I avoid episode discussions on adaptations."
"The Mind, Explained","I loved this moment - it was some real body horror shit. Like the Alien slowly creeping up on Lambert, or basically any Cronenberg movie you can think of. 

But I also knew the second I saw it happening that it was going to become a whole *thing* online, LOL. 

I feel like this adaptation is 100% improving on the game, and I don't see how it doesn't continue to do so. This episode (directed by one of the game's co-directors) is the most ""gamey"" thing we've seen so far. It was literally setting up and paying off *game mechanics* in the narrative. And it's STILL an improvement on the storytelling, what with the Jakarta opening, the solidification of why the switch to physical growth/vines/tendrils from spores is a great call."

"The Mind, Explained","On a side note, did the game mention anything about the mycelium networks underground connecting the infected? I thought that was pretty cool, didn't remember it from the game"
"The Mind, Explained",Fun on a bun.
"The Mind, Explained","Just in case you guys aren't hanging out in r/Screenwriting... Craig Mazin (CHERNOBYL, IDENTITY THIEF, and SCARY MOVIE) has been doing a podcast on screenwriting for approximately 10 years with John August (CHARILIE'S ANGELS, FRANKENWEENIE, and BIG FISH) called ScriptNotes.

Super informative and entertaining. 

Trivia: Craig Mazin was Ted Cruz's roommate at Princeton and confirmed he was a giant douchebag even back then."
"The Mind, Explained",personally i dont think the kissing scene was disturbing enough. so all the people freaking out might be more squeamish than me. i still liked the attempt at body horror.
"The Mind, Explained",Why didn’t she use a grenade
"The Mind, Explained","Any complaint I see about Last Of Us, just tells me someone hasn’t read Annihilation! (Or seen it!) 

Not that I wanna be turned into a mycelial colony and slowly taken over, but like, Annihilation was so beautiful and breathtaking, while also being kinda scary, and amazing? Like at the end of that book, I definitely felt like becoming one with the mycelial network is the only choice!"
"The Mind, Explained","Im not reading that article , what got people upset? The bombing suggestion?"
"The Mind, Explained",I just wanted to know how they were all bone dry thirty seconds after wading through waist high water
"The Mind, Explained","I have to say it: the ""tense"" lighter moment is stupid. If your lighter won't light that many times, you're out of fluid. It won't just start lighting. However, she just spilled tons of flammable liquid all over the floor and the vapors should be flammable at that point. She can't crouch and use the spark on the floor because the kiss scene was written first, but it would be easy to illustrate the vapors rising from the floor to reach her lighter as she's just striking the flint wheel."
"The Mind, Explained","Really liking the show so far. Only part I hated is when the guy was blocked by two cars and was looking for a way around. Like, just climb over it even if one of them is burning. Similar to video games though."
"The Mind, Explained","I like the idea, but I'm not really a fan of the execution. I feel like the way they shot it sacrificed realism for shock value. 

The way the infection resembles a romantic kiss just feels unrealistic. I'm completely on board with mouth to mouth infection through tendrils... but I don't think that it would realistically look so much like a kiss when it happened. Why would a creature whose only goal is to infect others to move their mouth muscles like that? It's not like puckering would make the tendrils more effective...

I feel like they just wanted this scene. And to get it they twisted the logic to make it work rather than making a scene that fits the logic.

Edit: If you're going to downvote me, please answer my question. Why did the infected need to pucker in order infect her through his tendrils?

Otherwise I'll just assume that you know it was unrealistic shock value but are unable to take criticism of the show."
"The Mind, Explained","Honestly, that was the only moment I have had any issues with the show.  Just felt like gratuitous shock value to me."

"The Mind, Explained",The show is pretty damn good so far but the director is sooooo full of himself and downplays the amount of direct copying he's doing from the already mind blowing source material.
"The Mind, Explained",A weekly release show in 2023? Gross.
"The Mind, Explained",The omission of spores and the change in what happened with Tess told me this was not the show for me.  I prefer the game but I love that the show is doing well and capturing a far larger audience than the game ever could.
"The Mind, Explained",Did this show come out because the Walking Dead finally finished and someone decided we needed another zombie show?
"The Mind, Explained","Of course, they had to find some way to sexualize the woman. Hoping it ends with her and they don't do similar shit to the girl."
"The Mind, Explained",Thought Craig would blame Ted Cruz
"The Mind, Explained","I'm really surprised that the Infected didn't just ignore Tess, knowing that she's infected.  
  
Sure, you don't get the ""Money Shot"" but it would have been way more interesting, story wise."
"The Mind, Explained","Question: baked goods are placed in the oven, why weren't the fungus killed that way? Unless they are implying the fungus is immune to heat.. which is a far reach."
"The Mind, Explained","I liked the added scene, it wasn’t in the game but it immediately felt like a Craig Mazin scene and explained a lot even to us gamers who played both games, he’s done a great job writing this series because he understands what a lot of people don’t when they adapt existing IP and that’s the fact people don’t want you to put your own twist on a thing they already love, they just want you to make it good"
"The Mind, Explained",">the fungus spread with the contaminated flour

Fun but totally coincidentally:

- Joel's surname is *Miller*

- Joel's actor in the game is Troy *Baker*"
"The Mind, Explained","They also mention that the fungus (pre mutation) can't live inside creatures with a body temperature above 94F.  Strange that the fungus would be able to survive the 350F or higher oven temperature required for baking cakes or biscuits.  Pancakes might be easier, though."
"The Mind, Explained","Wait, how did Joel and Sarah know to avoid the foods with flour?

Or are they just saying they happened to avoid the fungus by not eating the foods with flour?"
"The Mind, Explained","This theory doesn't \*totally\* make sense to me though. The neighbor likely had flour sitting in her house for months before making the biscuits and cookies on the day of the outbreak. Episode 2 showed the flour becoming contaminated 2 days before the outbreak, confirming this all happened quickly. So a package of flour went from Jakarata to the neighbor's house in just a few days?

The concept makes sense but the execution and timing doesn't, unless there is something I'm missing."
"The Mind, Explained",lol yeah I think they had a little too high expectations of the audience to know about the industrial plants in Indonesia

"The Mind, Explained","You didn't hang out in /r/TheLastOfUsHBOSeries

"The Mind, Explained","You are my saviour for today-I was envisioning my usual tactic of scrolling down the rabbit hole, but no, there you are :)"
"The Mind, Explained","This is the only thing I don't like about this show -- showrunners are CLEARLY pushing a sleazy keto/low-carb diet agenda! Screw that, CARBS ARE LIFE!!!

/s"
"The Mind, Explained","Exactly.

When the collective is doing is trying to spread the infection. The natural and automatic response (even internally in our own body) to infection is resistance. How is resistance met? With force.

Tess either by choice or coercion putting up minimal resistance gets you this, a less violent response."
"The Mind, Explained","Yeah they said as much on the podcast with the show producers/ writers. They want the ""kiss"" to mimic a darker aspect of love."
"The Mind, Explained","idk, those MF in museum looked quite violent."
"The Mind, Explained",I assumed it was because she had already been infected
"The Mind, Explained","I would have thought that the people they killed would just grow mushrooms and produce spores, which infect living people who kill more people, and that's the life cycle of the cordyceps. 

The issue I have with their explanation is that it makes the fungus have a will of its own. The point isn't to spread the fungus- there is no point at all. Spreading the fungus is a convenient byproduct. The whole thing came to be entirely by accident. But if it can make decisions, or communicate over a network, it starts becoming more magic than science."
"The Mind, Explained",I thought she stood still so she could minimize noise and keep trying the lighter. If she’d fought she couldn’t try the lighter.
"The Mind, Explained","Wow, I really like this idea now that it’s been mentioned."
"The Mind, Explained",It it was diesel a flint  spark will not necessarily light it.   You need an active flame.
"The Mind, Explained",Or with the 20 grenades….
"The Mind, Explained",THANK YOU. That was making me crazy.
"The Mind, Explained",Or pulling the pin on one of the dozen grenades laying around
"The Mind, Explained","She was already infected, her arm wasn't working properly."
"The Mind, Explained","The fumes would be enough to ignite with a spark, actually, but that wouldn't give us a dramatic scene of her frantically trying to light the gas on fire."
"The Mind, Explained","I was hoping ""the moment"" was going to be piano frog."
"The Mind, Explained",Was less gross (not that it wasn't) to me than it was just plain fucking terrifying.
"The Mind, Explained","I haven't watched the show yet but is it similar to the gross stuff from ""the strain"" if you don't mind me asking?"
"The Mind, Explained",It was pretty nasty!
"The Mind, Explained","I've watched plenty of fucked up movies/tv shows with my dad and this is the first time I've seen him turn away in disgust, lmao"
"The Mind, Explained",Definitely stuck in my brain now
"The Mind, Explained",Yeah very gross. I hope that infection method doesnt become a recurring thing in the show
"The Mind, Explained",I figured it was the non-violence. And what's more I figured it was intentional on her part so as not to invite a violent response while she tried to get the lighter working.
"The Mind, Explained","People keep asking for ""show, don't tell"" and the moment it happens, it flies over their head lol."
"The Mind, Explained","That’s my thought while watching, The bite prepares the host, the fungi entering into the body is 100% assimilation."
"The Mind, Explained","I also understood her reaction to be the spores taking over her mind, and the infected not chewing her face off like it does with everyone else."
"The Mind, Explained",I prefer this explanation too so this is what I'm going with from now on.
"The Mind, Explained","I suspect they may not recognize others as one of them until they’re actually connected to the network. That’s the impression I get seeing them have the little tendrils grow into them as they wake up. Like the network is quite physically reliant. It seems like their senses otherwise are pretty shot, unless they grow some new type of nose which is totally plausible

I figured the reason they didn’t immediately notice her was because of all the general noise they were making so it took longer to notice"
"The Mind, Explained",I've seen this explanation but it doesn't hold water to me since it suggests they can visually distinguish infected vs not? For a show going so hard on the sci-fi components of explaining the infection I don't know they'd just usher in such a quasi-magical component to it
"The Mind, Explained",Yeah looked more like a stalker but most likely a runner with the fungus growing out
"The Mind, Explained","I have seen people say it's a Clicker, but it lacks the head growth. Definitely a dirty Stalker or Runner"
"The Mind, Explained","To be fair, both the show sub and  r/lastofus were unsure about these changes weeks ago, but looking at episode discussions, most are supportive of the change because of how they were implemented. They showed love to the overall disgusting nature of the infected, and I think most gamers and viewers feel that watching"
"The Mind, Explained",I think fans of the game are actually super cool with the changes.
"The Mind, Explained","The shot of Joel with the flashlight slowly closing in and him realizing the clicker is right next to him and he has to “drop” the light from his neck, great suspense filming."
"The Mind, Explained","I love Cronenberg stuff. Just told someone I think his movie Crimes of the Future was one of my favorite original movies of this last year. That being said, I don’t think that style meshes will with the overarching ideas of TLOU. It seems like it would be lesser than the sum of its parts. Obviously we’re only two episodes in but that’s my outlook if that were to be true."
"The Mind, Explained","I’m still not entirely sold on the “fungus hive mind” aspect, but overall I’m still very happy with the adaptation so far. But I also go into adaptations expecting differences, so I expect to not fully love everything that happens because that’s just part of media being adapted"
"The Mind, Explained","I agree it mimicked the experience of watching someone play the video game.  But ""the most""?  That's up for debate, considering a large chunk of the previous episode was a first person shooter scene."
"The Mind, Explained","I'm gonna have to hard disagree, it didn't feel body horror to me in the best way like the fly, Alien or Annihilation.

It really felt like something put in to shock and tittilate people. There are so many ways you could accomplished something similar to this without forcing a female character to be kissed and have it framed in such a weird tender way.

I'm honestly really frustrated by this scene because I absolutely loved the episode up to this point, I don't even mind changes from the game. Having Tess die holding off infected rather than Fedra is Apples and Oranges to me. 

I just find the inclusion of weird fetish stuff like this completely unnecessary and and out of sync with the atmosphere they had established up to this point."

The I-Land,"It was so dumb but I just couldn't stop. The ""twist"" at the end (after that injection thing in her neck) was the saddest little damp squib in TV history.

Also why did they get three actresses who look almost alike to play three of the main roles?"
The I-Land,"You are right with everything. 

At least I  learned something for the show. At one point in episode 2 I asked myself ""who is this discount Kate Bosworth?"". Just to find out that Kate Bosworth is her own discount version. After checking her filmography I have to admit I still remembered her from *Superman Returns* and thought she was a bigger actress than she is."

And honestly, it's fascinating.  There's an episode of American Dad where Steve and his friends find a script for the next Fast and Furious movie in the wreckage of a plane crash and they sort of edit out all the intensely gay scenes and try to give it to a Hollywood exec, and I think even that script had more thought put into it than the I-Land.

""I promise you this, I'm coming for you.""

I wonder if there's water. [Fountain water sounds] I guess that answers that question."""
The I-Land,"Much like LOST opens with a plane crash, this one opens with a spectacular train wreck.  Some of the most awkward, stilted dialogue I've ever heard.  I was kind-of baffled that it was *that* bad that I started wondering if it was intentional and actually a part of the larger mystery.  For example, when the one girl goes, 'a bunch of beautiful people eyeing each other up for mating potential?  And me, an intellectual, silently judging.'  Okay, that's awful, like, laugh out loud bad but it's immediately followed up with a character going, 'you talk funny.'  So I wasn't entirely sure if there was some self-awareness being hinted at.  Like, maybe they're all robots?  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.  I do think the first episode is by *far* the worst but it doesn't get much better.  
  
I'm about halfway through now and the central mystery is enough to keep me engaged to finish it (plus Natalie Martinez is drop dead gorgeous and watching her run around an island in tight clothes is enough for me). I have a high tolerance for entertainment but I realize that this show is not good in it's best moments and downright bad in it's worst.     
  
What's even more baffling is how they have this beautiful location and still have such uninspired directing and cinematography.  Half the time it looks like a green screen, which is weird because they're clearly on a beachfront location and they never take advantage of the setting.  Hell, Survivor has better cinematography (though to be fair, Survivor does have some excellent cinematography).  I'm also not sure how they got Kate Bosworth to agree to this but she looks about as miserable and unhappy to be there as her character does.      
  
I'm a big defender of Netflix, they have a ton of fantastic shows and it bugs me when people hold up their duds and act as though all Netflix shows are garbage, which is a sentiment that gets repeated here a lot.  We're only two weeks removed from Dark Crystal and unfortunately for Netflix, with the release of The I-land the pendulum has already swung all the way back to 'Netflix sucks.'  Hopefully Unbelievable can undo some of the damage done by The I-land."
The I-Land,"Great read, very entertaining. I might actually watch the first episodes for shits and giggles. So Netflix might have gotten what it wanted, although probably not the way how it wanted it."
The I-Land,I lost interest the instant I saw Neil LaBute was involved. A misogynist hack with all the subtlety of dog vomit on a Persian rug. It baffles me that anyone hires him after the abomination that was the Wicker Man remake.
The I-Land,"How does Netflix gain this deserved reputation of making absolutely garbage TV shows like this, and then also come out with huge hits like Stranger Things and Mindhunter? The range in quality of writers that Netflix has is nuts."
The I-Land,I watched the first episode and it was torture.
The I-Land,I just looked at the IMDB. There are 7 episodes and 3 writers (including the creator). The creator and one other writer are credited with episodes 1-3. The other writer is credited with episodes 5-7. Apparently no writers were involved with the writing of episode 4. lol
The I-Land,"I accidentally the whole season tonight. It's horrible in some aspects but strangely addictive. Most tv shows these days have an aspect of ""all the characters are annoying people"" and ""idiot plot"" tropes, and I've sort of grown to accept it, it's a cheap trick to keep things exciting, but this show takes it to another level. From start to finish, not a single character ever acts like a reasonable human being. Every single interaction between characters is to some degree weirdly irrationally hostile for no reason. BUT I was hooked, I kept wanting to see what would happen next. And I disagree with some of the criticism, like when folks criticize certain lines of dialogue that were obviously purposefully designed to be terrible and make the character speaking it look weird/bad."
The I-Land,"> ""people wake up on a treacherous island with no memory of who they are or how they got there""

Except for in medias res, the most overused, least compelling storytelling cliche."
The I-Land,Have you seen Another Life? Because it's got competition.
The I-Land,[deleted]
The I-Land,I hope Rifftrax gets ahold of it
The I-Land,"Netflix has really gone to the dogs lately, I find myself gravitating more to Amazon Prime with each new release. 

I haven’t seen anything good on Netflix for a while, Stranger Things is about the only thing that even comes to mind. 

But there’s a lot of dross, I can’t even remember what it’s called now but there was a sci-fi series where they sent a mission to make first contact after an alien artefact landed on earth. So they send a load of teenage dickheads with a drama obsession, on the most important mission in history... Ok then. 

Amazon Prime on the other hand, has churned out The Boys, Carnival Row and I’m currently sitting on my hands waiting for The Expanse season 4, with a bunch of stuff on my watch list that looks great too. 

I just wish Prime’s UI was better and you could have profiles like Netflix, me and my brother often screw up each other’s watch order by not starting a show at the same time."
The I-Land,"My wife noticed it. Hit play. Now mind you, she watches some decent trashy stuff on Netflix and Prime. Nope. The acting is SO bad in this. We made it maybe 15-20 minutes and just moved on to something else. Whatever the premise is, it’s bad."
The I-Land,"Welp.... I appreciate the heads up, won't be wasting time on this one.  Another one that blows ass is Another Life."
The I-Land,Maybe Netflix did this on purpose?
The I-Land,"You really ask yourself, how the fk do they waste money on shit like this but tell subscribers they can't fund other good shows they seem to keep cancelling."
The I-Land,After spending 30 seconds seeing this advertised I have no idea why anyone would even give the show a chance. Hell the name of the show is absolutely ridiculous.
The I-Land,Lol I loved it. It was a wild ride of awfulness. It was like every CW show combined but worse.
The I-Land,"It can't be any worse than Hemlock Grove, it feels like I'm being challenged to watch this show now."
The I-Land,"Despite its flaws, I actually liked the show, because I found the premise and story interesting, and getting to see the back stories to find out what the characters had done made it worth watching as well. I think my biggest problem with the show is that Chase's fighting skills were already unbelievable, considering she could beat up and / or get away from several armed men at a time and even basically jump a full story to the ground and be OK, but it's just something you have to go with when watching shows like this. THEN, when we find out she had been doing all of that as a middle-aged woman! Apparently, 25 years of prison is not so bad on the bones and joints, and one's fighting skills don't degrade, either."
The I-Land,"Bad shows can happen. But this one is far worse than that.
Many good/avarage shows get cancelled on Netflix. But this one is given the green light.

What a waste of money.
I 'm really interested in the proces of this show. How is it possible they get the green light to produce this? Something feels not right here. Netflix golden days are over."
The I-Land,nothing can beat LOST
The I-Land,The woman in the front right is so clearly a rip off of Kate from LOST it’s pathetic.
The I-Land,"Watched 5 minutes, then when back to the last kingdom."
The I-Land,"I literally hadn’t heard of this show until yesterday, when I started seeing multiple articles about how it’s the worst show ever.
Now, word is going to get out about just how bad this is, and people are going to watch it ironically, like “The Room” or “Birdemic”. Netflix will see the numbers, and green light more like this, in the vein of SyFy with their Sharknado movies, and eventually Netflix dies from a glut of straight-to-cable levels of schlock. 

Which means I can afford to drop them and pickup Disney+. 
I like this plan."
The I-Land,"I quite enjoyed it. It is basically reminiscent of 90s sci-fi prison movies such as Fortress including an obviously sadistic prison warden..

It got criminals sweating profusely while trying to kill one another on a beautiful island. The show has some wonderfully cheesy dialogue and a plot crazier than  Taika Waititi  on meth!"
The I-Land,"Honestly the highlight was during the finale when the Warden and the female juror meet outside where Chase is being held, when the guard won't let the warden in.

The juror says ""Thanks Michael"" to the guard, to which the warden replies ""oh we're using the guards first names now?""

The guards name tag said Scott

Just how?"
The I-Land,"Eh, it's really not that bad.  The first episode is jarringly awful in terms of acting but once the actual story kicks in it's a decent enough ride till the end.  I think the first episode is just so bad because the actors had no direction on how to play an amnesiac, but the acting feels a lot better after episode 1.  It's just there's another underlying problem that trumps the bad acting.

It's *incredibly* rushed.  Feels like they had a story that needed 15-20 episodes to do properly and Netflix told em to do it in 7.  Characters turn and act like they've been stuck on the island for weeks, when it's been an episode or two at the most.  There's also some interesting ideas and it's a neat premise at it's core.  

Don't just write it off because of a few articles or reddit posts, or even the first episode."
The I-Land,Worse than Bird Up?
The I-Land,"You can almost guess it's been written by dudebros. It's so cringey. I can't look away though, because it's so dumb I just want to know what dumbassery is gonna come next."
The I-Land,"I watched it. I mean, all of it. The best part of the show was me, beating my own Solitaire record on my phone during the 4th episode. Yeah, I had a headache and I had to have something as a distraction, and Netflix did not stop bugging me with the ad of the show, so I gave up and turned it on. Well... I can't recommend it to people who love trashy shows, because it's not trashy. It's just sooooo boring. It's not stupid enough to laugh, it's not trashy enough to cringe, it's just dull. Seriously, the only good thing about it is the lead character's breast... Sorry. I meant to say, the ocean. The ocean is beautiful. Everything else is bland and makes you feel nothing at all. I tried to sleep with it in the background, but it doesn't work, as sometimes someone starts screaming or crying loudly. But yes, I finished it and deleted it from the history to never get reminded of it ever again, if they decide to keep shooting it."
The I-Land,SAD! Was expecting another good LOST-like show. Turns out this is worst than the 100.
The I-Land,Did she just throw a dig about Serenity in there.. The nerve of her even uttering Serenity in the same article as this pile of garbage
The I-Land,[deleted]
The I-Land,Now I'm curious.
The I-Land,It can't be worse than Flinch.
The I-Land,"Yep - came here to say that.  A survival/deserted island story is awesome, but I didn't even get 10 minutes into and decided I wasn't interested.  I was skeptical about the plot to begin with, since it smacked of ""Lost"" to me."
The I-Land,"Seveb half hour episodes is pretty short, I feel like I almost nees to watch it after reading this."
The I-Land,Looks awful but is it worse that Another Life?
The I-Land,As soon as I read the name I knew it was gonna be shit
The I-Land,It was like every character was having a race to be objectively the worst.
The I-Land,"You've not seen ""Another Life"" then."
The I-Land,"I-Lost it when I saw the preview; it's just Lost on an I-Land!

Netflix has had some real stinkers lately.  I know they wanted to have more shows canceled to get through the bad to get to the better, but this is not tending in the right direction..."
The I-Land,"I’m not reading the reviews coz of spoilers, bit is it as bad as Another Life?"
The I-Land,"For those who have watched, is it a so bad it's good show or just bad? Because I'm a glutton for so bad it's good stuff."
The I-Land,Is this show meant to be a joke and self aware?
The I-Land,Inb4 Netflix starts selling it as a cult satire that's so bad it's good
The I-Land,"I was waiting to watch the trailer to decide whether give it a go or not but there's no need now, thanks for the time saving"
The I-Land,The director has already said there will be no season 2.  Thank God
The I-Land,"I’m not trying to defend Netflix because I dislike nearly all of its Netflix originals but I am curious about the “success rate” of shows on traditional media vs Netflix. “The new fall lineup” of years past ABC, NBC, CBS vs Netflix. I am guessing well over half are failures and are cancelled."
The I-Land,[deleted]
The I-Land,yeah it really sucks
The I-Land,"I was having issues with it from the obvious 'bitch' character inside the first 5 minutes and it only got worse from there the line for me was probably the guy who was attacked by a shark showing up on the beach with some scratches.   The attempted rape was bad but the odd behavior of the people involved still 'fit' with how odd and stupid they'd been behaving from the beginning.  I was sad to see how shit the writing was, I know 4 of the actors from other stuff they've done and they were good if not really good but 'stuck' in this pile of shit."
The I-Land,What is Netflix's problem? Nearly all of their exclusives are fucking awful.
The I-Land,I can’t wait to watch it.
The I-Land,There was some foreign Netflix series about Acid rain or something that was just as bad.
The I-Land,The trailer alone looked really bad.
The I-Land,this actually makes me want to watch it
The I-Land,"In the first episode one of the women says ""this is crazy right"" and another answers ""I have a bad feeling about this"", I was like, why the fuck wouldn't you have a bad feeling about waking up with no memory on a deserted island!

Edit: removed 'the' I typed by mistake."
The I-Land,">In many ways, it’s like that meme of “I made a computer watch these things and this is what it thinks a script is.”  
  
Oof."
The I-Land,Clearly you never watched Another Life.
The I-Land,Made it 20 mins...it’s true garbage
The I-Land,Netflix is scrambling pretty hard clearly. They are spewing out constant shit and cancelling their popular shows...
The I-Land,"I’m on episode 3 and it is just stunningly terrible. Between Neil Labute’s signature misogyny and a cast with no charisma whatsoever, it’s just awful. The characters are staggeringly dumb and none of them are unique enough to tell you anything about them as people. Plus it has the same problem as Another Life - everyone just randomly decides they’re going to behave like a bunch of hyper-aggressive assholes to each other for literally no reason, especially to the one character who might be called level-headed and sane."
The I-Land,This show is fucking awful. I love it. Haha. The shittier the better.
Betty en NY,"Finished the first episode, honestly Crudup and the aesthetic has me hooked, but it’ll take a bit to see if the entire premise plays out for me though there’s an undeniable allure to what basically feels like the pre-fallout Universe."
Betty en NY,"Watched all 3 eps. Really enjoying the look of the world, for some reason hits me on 1990s Batman:The Animated Series, just much much brighter. 

If they'd said at night there was a masked vigilante dressed as a Bat, I'd believe it. If they said Billy Crudup's character becomes the Joker, I'd believe it. He's loving but also psychopathically a super liar

My only issue is the show has so far really no 'oomph' thrill, neither in the comedy or the drama and only time I felt it was when he exited the room and was walking in the hallway with a dark/stone face that eventually morphs into a Joker smile after that big reveal scene end of the first episode. Then we get none of that in the 2 eps after...

I didn't pick up on the moon base itself being a scam, but that does sound like an exciting plot

First 3 eps were not bad but also were not great initial hooks. Looking forward to the next few eps to see what I think"
Betty en NY,Watched the first two episodes and Billy Crudup oozes charm in this show. The retro futuristic world they’ve built for this show is captivating. Can’t wait to watch more.
Betty en NY,"Just finished the first three episodes. Enjoying it so far and absolutely loving the aesthetic. It did make me realize, though, that one thing that sort of bothers me about retro-futurism, even though it's one of my favorite aesthetics, is the arbitrary ignorance of certain ""simple"" technological advances. Like, you have hover cars and rockets and robots and stuff in the 50s...but you still have black and white television. It of course adds to the charm, but if I think about it too much, it makes no sense."
Betty en NY,I usually am up to date with all new shows but somehow this slipped past me. Definitely giving this a watch.
Betty en NY,Join r/HelloTomorrow for episode discussions every Friday!
Betty en NY,"This seems like a fantastic show about the empty hype and hucksterdom that's going on in American (tech) entrepreneurship. From blockchain and crypto to NFT, and metaverse to AGI, there's so much grift going on now without having an actual working and useful product, and I think this show is a great commentary on this situation."
Betty en NY,Watched the first ep and I'm loving it. It's like pre-fallout vibes.
Betty en NY,"First ep was really intriguing. I'm totally digging the aesthetic. The concept seems quite new too. Only potential downside so far is that it's slow and dialogue-heavy, but since the episodes are short I don't see it as a huge issue."
Betty en NY,Consider me hooked for the aesthetic alone.  Crudup and Hank Azaria  always bring it.
Betty en NY,Watched all three. I like the world building but the story isn't quite gripping me yet. I'm willing to give it a shot though. Looking forward to future eps.
Betty en NY,"Just watched The Morning Show and Billy Crudup was insane there, so definitely watching this."
Betty en NY,"I just put Netflix ""on pause"" so I can get Apple+ for this show. More for Ted Lasso and Servant, but this one tipped me over the edge. 

Apple is the only service I can't share and I don't feel.like going sailing right now.

Please be good, please be good."
Betty en NY,Love the setting. Even if the show winds up bad...I know my next ttrpg setting lol
Betty en NY,"There has to be a twist, right? It’s such a beautiful show with a straight plot line that there has to be a twist. I want to drink in the universe, but I’m exhausted by how transparent everyone is. Just everyone is stereotypical to the point of of mockery."
Betty en NY,I’m really loving this show. It’s got a wholesome facade that I imagine will continue to fall about it dramatic fashion. I really hope this show gets renewed.
Betty en NY,"I really like the show and I think most people that don't or can't get into it are missing the point. Its a dramatic comedy and complete satire on corporate sales people. Its quite hilarious actually. The show takes place in an era where there is no internet, but they take rockets to work, have floating cars, and think going to the moon and living there is a real thing that can happen. Its brilliantly funny. 

I couldn't stop laughing when they had one of the customers go into ""customer service"" where the automated line did not help her at all. The commentary on being douped in this marketing takes all economy is amazing! Genuinely love the visuals too!"
Betty en NY,"Crudup is unsurprisingly carrying the show. It’s enjoyable enough, with a great aesthetic, but seems a bit hollow. Only watched one episode though. Wasn’t quite funny enough to be a comedy or deep enough to hit as a drama. Shrinking is pulling that off better. 

I’m sure we’ll learn more as it goes, but is the whole moon thing a complete scam?  How does that even work?  They reject every application but keep an app fee or something?  Sure got the impression everything re living on the moon was complete bs"
Betty en NY,"Billy Crudap was made for this role. 

I love the aesthetic. It's live action Jetsons and I'm here for it. 🫡"
Betty en NY,"Where is the story in this show? All style no substance.
Con man sells time shares that don't exist. Explained in episode 1. Story telling done. Will he get caught? We don't care because he's conning people in a care home and even his son who doesn't know who he is.
Anyone invested enough to watch the inevitable all come crashing down when he inevitably has to leave town or when the son finds out who he is? 
Don't care.
It's like a poor man's Mad Men."
Betty en NY,"S01E01

The aesthetic is, ahem, fantastic! Just can't image how much talent and effort went into this. And Billy Crudup ... well, looks like he was born in a salesman jacket. Not sure about screenwriting yet, have to see some more episodes."
Betty en NY,"I'm a tad disappointed, it's good but it has the potential to be great. Here's hoping that it will realize itself with the rest of the season."
Betty en NY,Nothing like paying Apple so I can watch the lives of used car salesmen!
Betty en NY,"Huh. Yeah this sounds really dumb. I’d like it more if the concept wasn’t a scam, and Billy was basically that Vaultec salesman from the beginning of Fallout 4. Well whatever, one more forgettable streaming series that will be dead in months"
Betty en NY,"most apple shows sound so corny my god. apple just renews a ton of junk and hopes of the best, to get one or two hits out of it.  while netflix cancels everything. its like quality control is missing from both extremes of streaming."
Betty en NY,"> I didn't pick up on the moon base itself being a scam

I'm confused, isn't that made explicit at the end of the first episode? It's all about the scam."
Betty en NY,"It's odd to me how often people on reddit only have comic book stuff as a frame of reference.  This has nothing in common aesthetically with the 1990s Batman cartoon.  That was dark art deco, and this is retrofuturism.  The characters, atmosphere, and themes are also very different.   It's good to read someone branching out but if you're at all interested in visual design there's so much of a larger universe out there besides comic books.  This has more in common with the Jetsons than Batman."
Betty en NY,His charm is one of the only reasons I watched The Morning Show all the way through. He hard carried that boring plot.
Betty en NY,"You probably know already, but just in case, the third episode is available, too."
Betty en NY,Have you seen Almost Famous? He oozes charm in everything
Betty en NY,"Retro-futurism is, as I understand it, is kind of sci-fi but from a fictional perspective of someone from the past, who doesn't know what might be possible in the future and imagines a lot of stuff like culture through the perspective of their present day.

I'd argue it makes sense in the way that if you look at old scifi and media that imagines future technology you might find similar issues. The 3D hologram R2D2 plays to Luke and Obi Wan probably looked amazing to audiences watching Star Wars in the 70s, and we still can't replicate that now, but it's small, blurry, and lacks colour and contrast, and is surely an inferior way to show a message. In the 1940s Dick Tracy imagined people wearing a 2-way radio watch."
Betty en NY,"I think it fits into the trope of the illusion of progress. I mean they have a autonomous car coma someone, his type writer has a cool voice to text feature that is useless after he gets a notification, plus his whole thing is a scam selling them on a brighter tomorrow. The Kid even fakes his way into someone’s house at first before he’s able to have real success."
Betty en NY,hover cars are Teslas in the 50s
Betty en NY,"the tv still being black and white is the only thing that stood out to me, they should’ve just made it technicolor"
Betty en NY,"Who is downvoting you for just saying you're gonna check this out. In a thread about the shows premiere.

People are weird man."
Betty en NY,"Felt like Apple wasn’t pushing it, wasn’t even in their hero tiles on the app"
Betty en NY,"Anything interesting on your watchlist came out/coming out soon? 

Aside from LastofUs, HelloTomorrow, and The Consultant coming out next week, my watchlist has been empty for Jan/Feb/March 2023"
Betty en NY,"“American?” These kinds of scams exist all over the world, Mandel. Hell in India running these scams is an industry unto itself."
Betty en NY,"The salesman at the doors felt so much like Vault Tech salesman, it almost felt like an homage."
Betty en NY,This is exactly what attracted me to the series. I love that 50s retro-futuristic theme and it looks exactly like the pre-nuke world in Fallout.
Betty en NY,"It's bordering on a copyright infringement it's such a strong homage. I love it for that, though. No way they haven't taken inspiration from fallout."
Betty en NY,"*Shrinking* is also really solid. I’m not into interpersonal family-drama shows at all, but the dialogue and people in that show are so damn relatable. I actually care."
Betty en NY,"watch the apple shows the after party, schmigadoon, for all man kind, mythic quest, black bird, shrinking 

A new show coming in a couple weeks called Extrapolations that looks real promising"
Betty en NY,"Make sure to also check For All Mankind, Foundation, Invasion, Shantaram and Severance."
Betty en NY,The best ATV+ show is definitively Severance IMO. Make sure to check that out!
Betty en NY,"Servant is great , just finished season 3."
Betty en NY,"It's definitely a scam, which is why Crudup gave his kid's deposit back.  He was also terrified of the TV/radio ad the woman purchased because it will (and did) bring unwanted attention to the scam."
Betty en NY,"> I’m sure we’ll learn more as it goes, but is the whole moon thing a complete scam? How does that even work? They reject every application but keep an app fee or something? Sure got the impression everything re living on the moon was complete bs

One of the episodes released mentioned that the ship was delayed and they had to offer refunds, so while I assume it is a scam, I couldn't tell you what it is. I suppose it's entirely possible that it's no deeper than Jack's comment about how you can't run away from your problems, but again, I haven't a clue."
Betty en NY,"I'm in the same boat, it is not really funny and the drama is not really exciting. I'm only in it for the retro-futuristic looks but to be honest, after 3 episodes I don't have the idea it has enought story in it to last for 10.

And the scam-thing is interesting but wouldn't we like to see something on the Moon? It seems there's no chance of that."
Betty en NY,"2023: Billy Crudup was made for this role. - Hello Tomorrow

2019: Billy Crudup was made for this role. - The Morning Show

2000: Billy Crudup was made for this role. - Almost Famous

At this point, it can't be just the role. Dude absolutely just oozes infectious charm and focus of the audience in any project he takes"
Betty en NY,So many questions left unanswered. How has the son never seen a picture of his dad? The ex saved all of his clothes and tools.. maybe when he left it predated film in that universe?
Betty en NY,I wish I read your comment before watching 2 episodes of it. I was hoping for something better. Most of the actors are great and the visuals too. The overall story looks very predictable. I'm not in the mood to watch a scam fall apart.
Betty en NY,But nobody's watching. I saw the opening sequence and tried to search for it on Youtube and could not find anything. I find that's reason enough that the show will not renew after one season.
Betty en NY,U haven't even watched it man
Betty en NY,Idk what your smoking. Every Apple TV show I've seen has been great. I'm not even an Apple guy but it's hard to ignore the great shows they have been pushing out.
Betty en NY,"Meanwhile, I watched Severance, and waiting for the new episodes of Ted Lasso I'm boring clicking any shows they suggest to me and I find myself watching all of them to the last published episode. 

And Hello Tomorrow! is one of those. 

A lot of good (or at least easily watchable) original stuff on AppleTV, especially for the prize of Apple One (since I'm already paying for Apple Music)"
Betty en NY,you’re right they do kinda sound corny like Physical or Acapulco but damnit are they great shows when you actually watch them.
Betty en NY,"It is a scam, which is why he was trying to keep it small scale.

I'm actually hoping that he gets so much money from it blowing up that he actually is able to fund it to some degree, because they said the Hollywood folk and Uber rich do have houses on the moon."
Betty en NY,"Haha, I'm confused as well & I hope I didn't miss a big reveal. From what I saw, I figured it was a scam on just the promotional selling aspects during that first episode... All the things he highlighted about his fam living on the moon, fake. That the influencers being videoed 'live', fake.

Then we see the company's staff annoyed when they were told moon launches have been delayed to quarterly periods. So quicker launches existed before the delay? So the moon base exists? And we saw rocket launches to the moon"
Betty en NY,This screams fallout (pc game) but before the bombs fell
Betty en NY,"I enjoyed season 1, but season 2 was rough. Kinda hope season 3 goes full tilt-crazy with the Covid pandemic coverage story line. Like totally batshit, what the hell is going on, crazy. Just absurdity. But I know they won’t and I’ll slog through it for Billy."
Betty en NY,"We moved on to another Apple TV show (Shrinking, which is hilarious and well done) as a wind-down before bed, but excited to see the 3rd episode tonight."
Betty en NY,">In the 1940s Dick Tracy imagined people wearing a 2-way radio watch.

and in modern days,people wear a much more advanced watch with 4G and even 5G.

yeah, the retrofuturism sometimes goes weird in imagining things too advanced, not advanced enough, or a mix of it."
Betty en NY,Maybe they were effected by his user name.
Betty en NY,"Shrinking on Apple TV is a solid watch that you didn’t mention. Going to give Animal Control on Hulu/Fox a try tonight. Picard Paramount Plus is back today for a third and final season which I’m mostly watching for nostalgia.  
  
Will Trent Hulu/ABC is ok. However, Poker Face Peacock is a better “detective” show. 
 
Harley Quinn HBO Max dropped a hilarious 45 minute Valentines special. South Park is back with two episodes so far this season.
  
That’s what’s I can think of off the top of my head. If you view this sub in desktop mode or old.reddit.com/r/television there is a nice side bar that keeps track of the new shows and has links to the trailer. 
 
I also Google What to stream this weekend every Friday to see what getting written about this week."
Betty en NY,"March looks to be fairly stacked with quality sounding shows.

Daisy Jones and the Six (Prime Video), Extrapolations (Apple), Swarm (Prime Video), Lucky Hank (AMC), The Big Door Prize (Apple) and The Power (Prime Video) all have a lot of promise and pedigree between them (remains to be seen how good any of them are, obviously). I'm looking forward to The Consultant, too.

Returns for Ted Lasso, Succession and Yellowjackets around the corner, as well. All worth a watch.

Shrinking, Poker Face and Extraordinary have been my Jan/Feb favourite debuts."
Betty en NY,Party Down next week.  I'm stoked.
Betty en NY,"White House plumbers? Some British stuff you missed, like Magpie Murders or Detectorists?"
Betty en NY,"Outer Banks S2 - Feb 23 NETFLIX 

True Lies S1 - March 2 CBS

Shadow and Bone S2 - March 16 NETFLIX

The Night Agent S1 - March 23 NETFLIX

Titans S4 P2 - April HBO MAX

and not so soon, The Acolyte August 11 Disney+"
Betty en NY,"Sure, just according to https://youtu.be/0au0G-4vb40 this show (being an American show) is about *American salesmanship.*"
Betty en NY,Retrofuturism existed before fallout lol
Betty en NY,"Put on Shrinking because of your comment and I don't regret it at all. Super relatable and hilarious for the most ""you're going to hell for laughing at that"" reasons. 1 episode in and I love it already thanks for mentioning it!"
Betty en NY,"I've seen For all mankind. Loved it
Schmigadoon is on my list.

Thanks for the other recommendations.

Edit Extrapolations looks great"
Betty en NY,Adding Dickinson to this
Betty en NY,I've seen all of those great shows already. Except Shantraram. Not a fantasy fan. But those are perfect recommendation
Betty en NY,"He’s been my favorite actor for near two decades. He’s been in a few bigger roles, but he really shines in independent movies. For anyone who’d be interested in checking out some of his best work, I’d recommend:

* Jesus’ Son
* Stage Beauty
* Waking the Dead
* Without Limits"
Betty en NY,"After you get a whiff you don’t have to bite into a piece of shit to imagine what it’s going to taste like, man."
Betty en NY,"I would rewatch the ending of the first episode, he visits one of the people convinced they're ""living on the moon"" but it's actually in the same ""home"" as his mum. He then picks up a couple rocks from his turtle tank and gives them to the coworkers as ""moon rocks"". There is definitely presence on the moon, but it's not going to be this sham company."
Betty en NY,"I believe Crudup sent the ""company"" moon launch delay communique as that's what he was recording in his hotel room.  The company doesn't exist, imo."
Betty en NY,At least season 3 has Jon Hamm
Betty en NY,Shrinking is one of my favorites. Just such a good vibe in that show
Betty en NY,Don't sleep on Severance and Slow Horses either!
Betty en NY,"If spanish language shows are of any interest to you, Acapulco is a great watch. Show is half in English and half in Spanish depending on the context the characters are in. Highly recommend (on top of all the others above)"
Betty en NY,Shantaram is about a heroin addict that becomes a doctor. Not quite fantasy...
Betty en NY,"Yeah the promotional guy I was talking about who appeared on video to sell them on the moon base but turned out to be just a dementia patient... the promotional way was the the scam to get the highest registrants but what about the resort/moon base and the people who joined?

Does the moonbase resort actually exist? It seems like the sales group has been established for awhile now and also doing their business for a long time that a 4 month interruption affects things, doesn't that mean the resort/moon resort does exist? All those registrants in the months/years before would either be living or scammed/complaining

Seems kind of hard to fake an entire moon resort for that long, while rockets are actively travelling to the moon, while still able to go around selling door-to-door without a problem..."
Betty en NY,Slow Horses is fantastic !  Plus Eugene Levy and his new show starts next Friday🙆‍♀️
Betty en NY,I'm already obsessed with Severance. Mostly got Apple for Severance
Betty en NY,I would get it for Severance alone!
Betty en NY,Acapulco was a lot of fun. Some good stuff on Apple.
Betty en NY,Agreed. It’s an excellent show.
Betty en NY,"Spanish is fine, but it looks.like a comedy? Not really looking for one of those, but thanks"
Betty en NY,You're absolutely right. I'm thinking of some other big fantasy series. Or maybe even an SF novel. Oops
Betty en NY,One guess I have is that the pure idea of being travelling salesmen is to not leave enough of a paper trail. You'll con one or two people in a given city but not enough for them to come together as a group - of course that's breaking down by the end of Ep 3 but you also saw it in Jack's frustration when it was played as a big ad. He wants to stay low because if it gets too big people will realise.
Betty en NY,"you said you like Ted Lasso, i kinda would say Acapulco has a Ted Lasso vibe to it but half of it in spanish lol"
Betty en NY,It's a good show! I just didn't want you to overlook something you might enjoy. Take care!
Betty en NY,"Good point, I was confused why he was adverse to that ad and now this does explain the gov briefcase contract guy's role increasing throughout the episode... I'm confused but I sorta like it's been 3 episodes and the show is still a mystery"
Betty en NY,"But.. But.. Where's the football?

Just kidding. I keep seeing it mentioned, and comparing it to Ted Lasso? I'll put it on my list."
Betty en NY,"Thanks, Papi"
Betty en NY,i only compare it to Lasso since they’re both lighthearted feel good comedy type of shows
Betty en NY,"De nada, Mijo!"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,The early seasons of TRW were amazing. There was nothing like it. I don't think there will ever be anything like it again. It was lightning in a bottle. Everything is too scripted and overproduced these days.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Now you know why MTV as we knew it died. Reality TV was cheap and effective.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"It's bizarre to consider what a cultural powerhouse that show actually was at the time - that season is largely considered to be the peak of what that show was, and *could* be (it went *really* swiftly downhill a couple seasons later, and became a cynical, gross, and weirdly *conservative* clown show by the time the 2000s hit - at which point it was more or less just a feeder show for The Challenge).

For example: the memoir that put Dave Eggers on the map and started the literary empire he's best known for is largely about trying to get on *this season* (he ends up not making it, and Judd Winick gets the slot). And it wasn't considered a cheap, tawdry ambition to have at all, at the time! It seemed like an opportunity to be part of something meaningful, and that definitely comes across in the memoir - and was further reinforced by how the season actually played out."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"If you're up for some comics, check out [Judd Winick's graphic novel about his time on the show and relationship with Pedro Zamora.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_and_Me)"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I watched it in real time back in the day! Pedro! I just can't...
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Ah yes, the early years when they all had goals and it wasn’t just Fuck Buddy Mountain."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Two wheels good, four wheels bad!"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I think in general due to the fact that it was one of the first such shows, both the cast and the producers were treading a fresh path, and so they didn't have the past few decades of experience to draw on when it comes to both casting and how they ""script"" the show. 

Now they have decades of experience when it comes to what kind of episodes get the best ratings, what kind of people the audience best responds to, how to edit the shows to get the best content, and so on. Those first few Real World seasons were probably as real as this kind of show could get, it's never going to be recaptured unless the people don't actually know they're being filmed."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Are these available somewhere. Hulu only has this San Francisco season and season 30. I got cable during later seasons and remember some of it, but I'd like to see The Real World from the 90s."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Reality killed the video star.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Came here to recommend this. It was my introduction to graphic novels as a medium and it's extremely compelling.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,That’s awesome! I’ll likely be wanting to check this out after I am done with the season. When the guy mentioning being a cartoonist I was curious about what his art looked like.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"As a man who lives for off the beaten path graphic novels, you’re speaking language."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Even after S01 you can see how they make huge changes. No one who is an artist is doing shows on the road, they can't just watch TV like Andre did in S01, alcohol becomes widely available"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Paramount+
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"He wound up being one of DC Comics' big 4 writers in the mid-2000s.

Besides Pedro and Me, you can see his art on display on two ends of the spectrum... his early series The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius, which is about a foul mouthed 10-year-old supergenius, and his current series Hilo, which is all-ages fare.

I haven't read Hilo, but it's quite successful. I have read Barry Ween, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Yeah, IIRC that kid from London who put on the play, I remember reading that he just ended up laying around the house not doing anything the whole time they were there. 

I also think that they hid the romance between Kat? and that singer guy because he had a girlfriend. No way they'd do something like that later on."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Saw this when it originally aired on ITV a few months ago, very well written psychological thriller set in the late 1940's and based on former Bletchley Park code breakers who use their intelligence gathering skills to capture a serial killer."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Me too. Really enjoyed it.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"One of DS9s best episodes. They will almost certainly reference it in the upcoming season of *Picard* as it takes place in both the same year as well as a darker, alternate timeline.  

Edit - As /u/innocenttailor & /u/sonicthebubonic have pointed out the new *Picard* trailer has a clear visual reference to the sanctuary districts. Looks like the events of *Past Tense* are going to play a major role."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Every time I do a rewatch of DS9 and get to this episode we’re a little closer to 2024 and I get increasingly uncomfortable with how accurate this depiction is.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"This episode was scarily prophetic, not just about sanctuary districts/homeless problems. There’s also a media conglomerate guru who runs a channel on the internet. Keep in mind this ep was made before YouTube existed. Also, some guy complains about the “neo-Trotskys” protesting in France. That could be less prophetic and more just a good guess because the French have a long history of protesting at the drop of a hat."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I'm a simple man. I see deep space nine and you get an upvote. Also good episode!
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,We still have time for the US to start doing this!
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I have tried re-watching this show twice but all the episodes are too memorable to do so.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Damn, yeah. We’re basically there."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I posted this in a thread in /r/news about homelessness in Portland yesterday. Most of us are just a hair away from being out on the streets. It’s so easy to look at others as less than human.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,They got it exactly right.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,my favorite documentary
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Shit at least people in the sanctuaries got shitty housing. RL California just dumps its homeless on streets and below overpasses.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"That's a good question, I wish I had an answer."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,A lot can happen in 2 years.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Starting to feel prophetic, sad to say."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I fully expect Sanctuary Districts to either be a thing outright or at least hear a (let's be honest, probably Republican) politician float the idea in the next few years."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Given what san fran is like right now, that story line isn't far off"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Not enough shit on the sidewalks.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I recently saw these episodes.  It's amazing how both the number of homeless people in San Francisco and the way they are consolidating into specific areas is becoming accurate.  There are still two more years to wall them inside a few city blocks like 1940 Warsaw, Poland."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I wonder if this happened in the timeline where Khan Noonien Singh ruled a substantial portion of the world in 1996, or the timeline where everything in 1996 looked exactly the same as our timeline except Bill Gates has been replaced by evil Ed Begley Jr.  Somehow those are both equally valid histories for people in the 24th century."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"The problem is, kurtzman's star trek is pretty depressing, people are assholes, there are still divides somehow, so it seems like humanity never really improved so you can't really pull this type of scene off since they no longer have a ground to stand on."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"In one of the trailers, there's a poster listing rules for sanctuary districts."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Oh I didn't even catch that part, interesting!"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"The only difference between this episode of DS9 and skid row is that in skid row the homeless aren't allowed to steal peoples homes.

And more fent"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Their 4th season two-parter Homefront & Paradise Lost was also very prescient about the aftermath of a 9/11 type incident, even though it aired years before."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Fun Fact: The roads in the residential parts of Paris were built to a width so that people couldn't block them with their doors. Apparently the French people would take doors off of their henges and block the roads until the government would make a change
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"It probably could get worse than this…like the Feds purposefully liquidating the homeless, for example."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I mean arguably we did it. There's a safe sleeping site a block from a Bart entrance outside city hall.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Not quite--modern American cities are careful not to say the quiet part out loud about ghettoizing the homeless. To actually set up specific districts would be to acknowledge the problem.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"No they didn't

SF puts millions and millions of dollars into the homeless problem every year. How is that ""not caring""?

The harsh reality that Redditors don't want to accept is that a lot of homeless people want to live how they want to. Maybe they don't want to sleep on the sidewalk but they don't want to work very much, they wanna keep doing recreational drugs, and because you can't force people into mental institutions or take their medicine, they choose not to.

I don't mean for this to come across as unsympathetic, cause BELIEVE ME, i am. I see how inhuman homeless people are treated and its disgusting. As someone who takes public transit often i have plenty of interactions and friendly conversation with the transits that live on the streets and plenty are just regular people without mental disabilities or whatever.

But you can't force people to take part in society, you just can't. The homeless problem in SF is not for lack of trying by its people, i can guarantee you that. It's a really complicated problem to tackle and if only it were so simple that you could just throw money at it and it would fix itself. 

If only, like in this clip, people could just take their medicine and all of the sudden they would be functioning members of society, but it doesn't work like that. People are more complicated then that"

The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"There already are

Tenderloin, Skid Row, Kensington. 

Areas of cities where laws aren't enforced and the homeless and drug addicted are pushed into. This episode is literally modeled after SF's tenderloin district.

> let's be honest, probably Republican

SF, LA, Philly, Seattle are a supermajority democratic cities. Not just democratic but some of the most progressive left city in America.

edit: I stand corrected, inspired by Santa Monica. Still functionally the same as skid row."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Its interesting you bring up Ed Begley Jr as I think there's a good possibility there's going to be a parallel in that someone stumbled across a Borg Queen (much how he came across a lost time traveler) and used her to militarize a nation. Thus sending us on a path of totalitarianism. But I'm guessing the Bell Riots from this episode will get a mention at the very least.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> Somehow those are both equally valid histories for people in the 24th century.

Trek was never exactly rigid about its backstory."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I assume Khan was operating in Asia, would a new ruler in India really have changed the day to day in America in the 90s?"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Picard was living in a mansion while his friend was living in a shack in the desert and I’m just like “are we sure this is still Star Trek?”
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Kurtzman's Star Trek is sheer fucking hubris. Nothing actually makes any sense, has any depth or is capable of withstanding even the most passing curiosity; forget scrutiny. Characters might share names with people we've met before, but that's absolutely it."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Yeah, im so tired of every show being a dark mystery box and everyone betreys everyone. Its so tiring, I want teams of people of people who work together and never betrey eachother."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Haussmanisation, the old narrow streets were really easy to create defensible positions like barricades in, so they tore down huge sections of Paris and made massive, wide thoroughfares they could use to prevent that and march more soldiers through them at once."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"It’s housing + treatment for mental illness and drug abuse is what is needed. 

The homeless don’t want to live on the street per se. They want to live in a place without the l rules that come with housing that likely require treatment. They need treatment, but we can’t force it. 

Until we can force treatment, I don’t know a way to fix homelessness. Simply living in a house doesn’t fix mental illness or drug abuse."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> The harsh reality that Redditors don't want to accept is that a lot of homeless people want to live how they want to.

In countries where they don't put up barriers to helping people, they're vastly more successful than US cities and states where being homeless is effectively criminalized. In European countries taking a ""housing first"" approach of providing a simple apartment to help people get their lives together, 4 out of 5 returned to a productive life."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Token efforts don't mean that people care. Not when the law still attempts to criminalize homelessness and NIMBY them into their own ghetto areas where they're supposed to not be seen. Not when people still spread the idea that homeless people want to be homeless, or act like not being homeless means buying into some ""system."" Not when they keep pushing dumb requirements like the idea they need to be off of the drugs first before getting help, when getting off of drugs is the hardest part, and generally requires medical intervention to be done safely. 

The clip is right. People have lergely given up on the problem, thinking it is intractable. That's why we get statements like ""they just want to be homeless"" when even you admit they clearly don't want to sleep on the streets. It's just that we deliberately make it harder for them to be helped than just continue as they are."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I think you're hitting something important for sure. If the current system is the one fucked them this hard, why would they want to jump back right into it? Especially homeless people who have been out of the system for years."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Yeah they don't want to work and they want to lay around doing recreational drugs all day... What's so wrong with that?
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,">This episode is literally modeled after SF's tenderloin district.

Why on earth do people feel to need to lie about shit like this? This episode was written about Los Angeles which was under control of Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican who at the time was pushing for creating fenced in areas of the city to essentially imprison the homeless.

>Behr's inspiration for the Sanctuary Districts came from his real-life experience in the 20th century; ""I was down in Santa Monica one day, and there [were] all these homeless people there, and it was a beautiful day, the ocean, sky, sun, and homeless people everywhere. And all these tourists, and people up and about, and they were walking past these homeless people as if they were part of the scenery. It was like some artist had done some interesting rendition of juxtaposition between nature and urban decay right there in front of me. And the fact was that nobody seemed to care, at all. And I said, 'There has to be something about that, where does that go? How far do you take that?' And that evolved into the idea for concentration camps essentially for the homeless."" (Time Travel Files: ""Past Tense"", DS9 Season 3 DVD, Special Features)


>The Los Angeles Times described a proposal by the Mayor that the homeless people of that city could be moved to fenced-in areas so as to contain them, in an effort to ""make downtown Los Angeles friendlier to business."" (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion) Shortly thereafter, Alexander Siddig stated, ""It turned out that 'Past Tense' was the best timing of all because the L.A. city council is actually trying to set up something called 'Sanctuaries' in L.A. for the homeless people right now which are enclosed areas where they wish to put all the homeless people. The anti-sanctuary people saw our show and were astounded to see that someone had done this. It's a happening thing and at the moment sanctuaries are going to be developed in L.A.""

The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,One man conquered one quarter of the world. A super human. Leading a race of super humans.  That’s quite the butterfly effect to have absolutely no impact on Southern California.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> living in a shack in the desert

You mean the glass-walled cabin in the middle of a national park? That would be paradise to a lot of people. She calls it a ""shack"" because that's where her mindset is, that she's bitter at the world and reclusive."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> Star Trek:TNG (Episode: The Neutral Zone).  Picard: A lot has changed in the past three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy.

That scene does not even make sense, they can make anything with replicators and there is no currency so she could create any type of home she wanted or needed to live in without problems, it was a stupid scene, but then I remember that kurtzmans star trek is NOT star trek and refuse to recognize it as so.  The garbage writers they got are painfully trying to shoehorn modern social issues like class/race divides on earth/federation, when all those issues were solved a long time ago in the star trek universe.  I really hate they are releasing bad fanfic garbage under the star trek brand, it is an insult to everything that made star trek."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Kurtzman's interpretation of Star Trek really does shit on the face of Gene Roddenberry and everyone else who envisioned it before his reign. 

Sure there are some things that Gene envisioned that at least for now can't even be conceived but Kurtzman's solution is to substitute the idealistic future with a copy of what we have now. In Kurtzman's version of the future very little has changed from a societal point only the technology and that is just lazy."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I just don't understand how they could let it get so bad
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Housing first can work if done right. Houston has practically eliminated homelessness and should be looked at as a model.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"I've heard of that method before and it's gotten good results.

I think they are trying that here in the Bay Area as we speak, usually with 6 months to a year staying time.

I agree that a lot of homeless programs come with conditions that desensitizes  people from getting help, but at the same time, you can't have people do drugs in shelters and all that. The rules aren't entirely arbitrary but i agree, programs can always do more"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Why is drug treatment even a requirement for getting housing assistance? Plenty of addicts aren’t homeless. Just look at the Midwest, where people OD in their own homes. It’s just that you’re coupling in economic stress here due to gentrification and lack of development.

Edit: and at least if you give them places to live, there’ll be less needles on the sidewalk because they’ll just be doing it inside!"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Shows like Star-Trek will bash your society for it
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Despite being a comedy, Lower Decks is the one that feels the most Star Trek in comparison to Discovery and Picard."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"To refute you, Sanctuary Districts were seen in Picard Season 2’s trailers.  See the sign at the far right: https://i.redd.it/pw2qoqgbzhm71.jpg"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"That's why they so often refer to canon, even less well known canon and established lore. Because they don't care. Yes, certainly. /s

It's possible that people care about something but have different opinions on how to do it."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,[deleted]
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,I was saying that there might be a parallel with Starling finding the ship from the future to someone in *Picard* potentially finding the Borg Queen using it to accelerate tech. Not Starling actually being involved.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,You see I'd have said it's often surprising how little impact major geopolitical events have on the small scale. Why would it impact such a small scale California plot?
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> One man conquered one quarter of the world. A super human. Leading a race of super humans. That’s quite the butterfly effect to have absolutely no impact on Southern California.

I thought the canon was that Khan never ruled overtly.  The average person around the world had no idea who he was while he was ruling.  Khan had a shadow government, and the countries were puppet states.   Same with the other superhumans.  

The Eugenics Wars were fought with the puppet states, the public didn't know there was something bigger behind them.  

Did the Yugoslav Wars affect people in California?  No.  

Same situation in the Star Trek timeline."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Indeed.  Raffi chose to be bitter and resentful.  She tried lashing out of Picard and the man didn’t fall for it.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Wasn't the point that she chose to live like that because she was dealing with the death of her son or something?
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Maybe that home *is* what she wanted?
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,">there is no currency

There is currency. Credits are often mentioned in OG Trek Series. Humanity just doesn't see a need to accumulate it anymore. Any needs they have are met, and anything else they want to get is available as well. This means they can focus on work that they enjoy, like art, math, science, etc. So credits are more of a means of transacting with other races within (and outside) the Federation.

Also, capitalism didn't invent currency. It exists within all forms of government and economy. Currency is the one religion everyone agrees on."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"> That scene does not even make sense, they can make anything with replicators and there is no currency so she could create any type of home she wanted

There is no way she could have replicated a vinyard in france. Post scarcity does not mean no scarcity. Post scarcity just means everyone's basic necessities are taken care of. You need good land for a vinyard and if everyone else already has claimed the good land there is no way to get more. So land is a scarce resource even in a post scarcity world.

In TNG picard kept a box of real caviar, because replicated caviar does not taste as good. How did he get it? Someone had to harvest it from a real ocean, which means there is a limited supply. Which means it had to traded for something real, not replicated - maybe Picard traded some wine from his family's vinyard? Which someone would not have access to unless they had land, which is limited. SO not everyone would have access to valuable things to trade.

> Jean-Luc Picard admitted that their replicator did not do ""justice"" to caviar, so he kept some cases of it for special occasions. (TNG: ""Sins of the Father"") Worf claimed they did not do justice to Klingon Warnog. (TNG: ""Rightful Heir"") Aquiel Uhnari complained the Muskan seed punch she could replicate didn't match the sort her mother made for her. (TNG: ""Aquiel"") Eddington claimed that he could taste the fact his ""curried chicken"" was in reality ""replicated protein molecules"". (DS9: ""Blaze of Glory"") 

Plus, you can't actually make anything you want with replicators. Even if you do have unlimited access to a replicator, the things the replicator can print for you is limited.

> In 2366, Deanna Troi expressed her desire to the computer to have a ""real"" chocolate sundae. The computer wished for her to define ""real in context"", to which Troi explained, ""Real. Not one of your perfectly synthesized, ingeniously enhanced imitations. I would like real chocolate ice cream, real whipped cream..."" before she was interrupted by the computer explained that ""this unit is programmed to provide sources of acceptable nutritional value. Your request does not fall within current guidelines.""

Also, the Federation is shown to use money in TOS, TNG, and DS9.

https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation_credit"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Eh.  Even Picard is a paragon compared to other Federation officers.  Compare that man to both Sisko and Janeway - post-Wolf 359 officers who are more pragmatic and less willing to play by the rules to get what they want.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Eh.  Meyer and Berman both sacked the Roddenberry vision out when the latter was kicked upstairs.

For example, Roddenberry hated Wrath of Khan and the Undiscovered Country for Federation militarism.  As a tongue and cheek move, the latter film was dedicated to Gene after the man passed away."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,What by locking them up or giving them tickets to CA?
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Star Trek will bash us because we are not taking care of such people.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Hell, The Orville feels more ""Trek"" than DIS or PIC"
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,They refer to it just to shit all over it.  Lower Decks is the only NuTrek that seems to venerate the older shows.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"What heavy references to DS9 were there in Picard? It's been awhile since I've seen it but I remember seeing signs for Quark's Bar and Kasidy Yates Interstellar Trading in establishing shots and more tangentially, seeing a Trill and a Bajoran in the same shot. I don't recall any direct mentions of DS9's characters or its major plotlines. It would have been great if they had mentioned the Dominion War causing the Federation to become more withdrawn from galactic politics or how the war affected the main characters but nope."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,Cherry picking a few things to reference is not sticking to canon or established lore. The Picard writers in particular seem to have only watched the movies and not much of the show.
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Exactly. This is the canon. That war a bit like the disinformation war that we have now. It doesn't really affect people that much, or at least they don't care about it enough."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Not the death of her son--although he isn't speaking to her--but because she went a little crazy and paranoid trying to hunt down the conspiracy that caused the Utopia Planitia attack. Craziness and isolation aided, apparently, by a shit-ton of drugs."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"No. What? When it’s introduced she chastises the rich white frenchman, Picard whilst she’s living in poverty. 

It’s not ST."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,"Nah, just bad writing to make it seem she is poor and Picard is rich. If this was old star trek, she would either be living in a nice clean home on earth or other federated worlds, doing something like painting, farming or other positive activity in isolation away from everybody else or if they wanted her to be down on her luck living poor, she would have been on another planet that is not federation controlled to show how far she has fallen."
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,A lore dump worthy of the Daystrom Institute.  Well done!
The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco,">  How did he get it? Someone had to harvest it from a real ocean, which means there is a limited supply.

Pedantic warning: Caviar is harvested from river sturgeon"
The Spy,"MGM+ huh. 

Well, good luck with that."
The Spy,"For those in the UK (or with a VPN), it looks like this is also on ITVX."
The Spy,It’s on Amazon Prime. Doesn’t the whole world have that?
The Spy,"last time I heard someone using ""magisterial"" was one minute ago, it was in this article"
The Spy,this was excellent. Reminded me of a tv version of tinker tailor solder spy vibes
The Spy,It is just Epix with a new name and a cash injection from Amazon.
The Spy,"Like Netflix, the available Amazon Prime catalogue varies by country."
The Spy,Didn’t realize Prime did that too.
The Spy,"Huge fan of le carre and spy who came in from the cold is probably my favorite book by him. 
Andor shows what spying is all about. It’s about using people. Not being bond and shooting 50 people and whipping out gadgets. You use people to get information, to sabotage, and your relationship with your assets and your ability to manipulate them is what it’s all about."
The Spy,"By that same token, the Empire in this series isn't depicted at the level of Darth Vader running rampant across the galaxy. In this show, the dastardly Imperial villains are literally pencil-pushing desk jockeys--delusional, privileged bureaucrats who can't remotely relate to the plight of common people and so could care less about the far reaching consequences their actions have on millions of lives."
The Spy,"that article is awful, but John Le Carrè's The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a great, great book"
The Spy,"It’s time for your Andor article. 

Yes, honey"
The Spy,">As they furtively scrape at the legs of a colossus, they live mean existences. They fear that their methods are beginning to match their enemy’s. They fear that the chance at a boring, normal existence is slipping away and taking happiness with it. 

there hasn't been a show like Andor for a long time, if ever."
The Spy,It’s gotten to the point that comments mentioning the how often this is promoted is more obnoxious than the articles posted.
The Spy,Everybody go watch andor. Now on Disney+
The Spy,"Wake up, new Andor article dropped"
The Spy,I thought I could go an hour without another Andor article/post!  I was wrong!
The Spy,"Bro I usually think it's silly and that people are being paranoid when people call out astroturfing campaigns but holy shit I feel like I am taking crazy pills with the amount of Andor post and articles trying to convince to watch this show.

I'm sure it's a fine show but this is first time I feel like the marketing is being a bit blatant."
The Spy,Ahhhh give it a rest already ffs lol
The Spy,Next week it’s my turn to post an Andor fluff piece
The Spy,Ok come on now! What is with these andor posts? Is disney really so desperate for viewers that it has to pay people to keep posting this crap every damn day!? Just stop it already!
The Spy,Another fucking Andor article
The Spy,Hot take: The show should have centered around Luthen. His character is so much more interesting than Andor. He’s like the Star Wars Nick Fury
The Spy,Is this a fuckin bot sub. It just pushes Andor everyday. Do you think this is working??
The Spy,Cant we just downvote these? Who even posts them?
The Spy,Obligatory not another Andor post comment. Now that I've said it you don't have to.
The Spy,[deleted]
The Spy,"The Americans is the only other show I know that gets this right: they're not super heroes, they're super manipulators."
The Spy,Also a huge fan.
The Spy,The Americans.
The Spy,Andor in these most recent episodes feels closer to George Lucas’ dystopian first movie THX-1138 and I’m loving it.
The Spy,[deleted]
The Spy,The fanboy hyperbole around this show is fucking ridiculous.
The Spy,"Seriously, I would like to have just one Andor thread where the main topic isn't whether there are too many posts about Andor. This is a TV subreddit. People who aren't watching a certain show don't need to comment on every thread about it just to say they feel personally attacked"
The Spy,How dare people like a show that's very well made! Organic Fandom is a all a conspiracy!
The Spy,It’s because the show is amazing. You should watch it…
The Spy,"Thank you my good gentleman. 
 
I will now watch **Andor** on **Disney+**"
The Spy,Everybody watch Andor WHEREVER YOU PREFER OR IS CAPABLE OF DOING SO
The Spy,This comment just tells me you are not watching Andor.
The Spy,Maybe don't click on them then
The Spy,"I mean maybe but if I were more of a poster and less of a commenter I’d be pumping this show up. It’s been by far my favorite Star Wars show of the batch, and one of my current favorite shows generally. I want it to get the love I think it deserves and I kinda think every one of these posters does too, mostly so we get more content like it from the Disney machine.

And I don’t *think* I’m a shill. But how would I know?!"
The Spy,"For me this has been the only consistently good Star Wars media since The Mandalorian, which was three years ago."
The Spy,"What's more likely?

Disney comitting a massive amount of gross violations of FCC regulations by running a secret and undisclosed astroturfing campaign and that every redditor and hobby site is secretly either a fake bot or in cahoots and being paid off to post positively about the show?

Or people talking about Andor because it's a surprisingly great show in an IP that has gotten a whole lot of trash recently?

Reddit imagines that astroturfing to be WAY more common than it is, and vastly overestimate the value of reddit threads to advertisers.

When we're talking ad campaigns designed to draw tens or hundreds of millions of eyes, no one is going to expend any degree of effort to break the law for the grand prize of... some reddit threads with a few dozen comments."
The Spy,I don’t think a lot of it is Marketing.  It’s genuinely THAT good.  People want to talk about it.
The Spy,"It's very good, the buzz is ground floor and it deserves it.  Just a great entertaining ride."
The Spy,"It's mostly not astroturfing, it's just people are collectivists who want to join in when they see something buzzy and therefore have talked themselves into Andor being this good (and imo seeing something that's not really there). The critics are just trying to get views from the Andor trendsters. Disney might have started the snowball but everything after that is people organically overrating it because they saw other people overrating it. Now as a result of this Andor will probably be one of the best reviewed dramas on TV for the rest of its run. Because one day (possibly with Disney starting the snowball), it became buzzy."
The Spy,"It's a really, really good show, and the next episode was the finale. That is always going to cause a lot of talk."
The Spy,"To be honest, there hasn't been an opportunity that I've skipped praising the show. I've did it in one of my company Slack channels even lol."
The Spy,"Criticisms are also not allowed to get any upvotes except the standard ""if you don't like the first few episodes keep at it, it really picks up later!""."
The Spy,Another pointless comment by someone who can just ignore the posts if he's so tired of them.
The Spy,That would ruin it. He has to be held back to be a bit mysterious.
The Spy,Correct
The Spy,25 different threads on the frontpage.
The Spy,If you'd seen Andor you'd understand why we're pushing it
The Spy,"a post about a tv show on /r/television ?

and you're downvoting?

stay classy San Diego."
The Spy,"Acknowledging the Andor spam is lame doesn’t make the spam less lame. 

That’s like how a certain Marvel show was making fun of how bad it was."
The Spy,you’re trash Brock
The Spy,Saw Guerrera didn’t die.
The Spy,"Almost every white character dies as well

Plus Blevin is still alive and well so black ones are still kicking"
The Spy,"One of the consulting producer is Stephen Schiff, who produce The American. He also wrote Andor Season 1 Episode 7: Announcement."
The Spy,"You should watch the bureau of legends. French show and possibly the best spy show ever, and my top 5 shows of all time."
The Spy,"Homeland season 3 might be a mixed bag but that gave out big Le Carre vibes. Dirty banks, superpower behind the shadow making moves, characters slowly discovering the whole plot. Season 6 and 7 as well."
The Spy,"good call!, you're right!

one of the writers on The Americans is now involved with Andor."
The Spy,"*Chernobyl* is another.

*Andor* is a Cold War story transposed to an entirely fictional setting, and that makes it interesting in its own right."
The Spy,"the styling of the prison was all THX-1138, with all the white.

it's just the best show out there rn imo, i will be bummed when it ends tomorrow, i have loved these weekly threads, we all watched Andor grow together, it was kinda nice."
The Spy,B2MO also really leans into George saying astromechs are the dogs of the Star Wars universe
The Spy,I wonder how George Lucas would feel about andor.
The Spy,"This show is so good, I am blown away every week.  I can’t wait to watch Rogue One again after finishing the 2nd season."
The Spy,"it's from the article, i thought it deserved a mention but yeah i agree, and this is the best paragraph i could find...., the author is, i think, trying to write some high-minded philosophical essay

Colossus, existence, it's a bit much for a tv show i feel, we're not talking True Detective here."
The Spy,best show of 2022.
The Spy,watching andor is literally the best thing that's ever happened to me
The Spy,"Even if Disney IS paying to promote the show, there's like 10 posts on here a day about it. SOME of them MUST be genuine. I've actually seen comments screaming at OPs for being bots and they're just like ""uh, I'm not? I like the show?"""
The Spy,"You can see it in Walking Dead threads where there are just legions of comments about how they stopped watching the show at season 1 when the thread is about Season 10 of TWD or whatever.

Or if there's a GRRM thread it's flooded with posts about finishing the book, it just derails the posts"
The Spy,"It’s all for karma and attention seeking, It happens all the time. People will jump at the chance to point out the obvious and nab that top spot to say the same thing said a million times like it’s an original thought. What’s funny is they are only generating a discussion that’s keeping these posts coming."
The Spy,Yeah! Just let disney market their damn show in peace! /s
The Spy,Where can I watch Andor?
The Spy,You are correct!
The Spy,"Honestly, I totally believe that the constant push for this show is real people. I didn’t believe it could be that good until I checked it out myself last week and saw it was leaps and bounds beyond every other Star Wars show."
The Spy,Why is hard to believe that people in the Reddit demo simply like a well-written sci-fi show?
The Spy,"I get that but I’d say the show is built more around a multiple story arc structure, so if you just watch the first ep it’ll feel a bit open, I believe that’s why they put out the first 3 eps at once since it’s one whole arc, then the Aldahni arc, and the prison"
The Spy,Where else do pointless comments deserve to exist than on pointless posts? You can’t justify the existence of one and not the other.
The Spy,"You can also ignore these ""Another fucking Andor article"" posts, no need to comment."
The Spy,Or not
The Spy,Seen it and only 3 maybe 4 episodes were decent. Not the massive hype everyone is pushing.
The Spy,I’ve seen all of Disney Star Wars and it sucks besides The Mando season 1. I’m not gonna keep rewarding bad behavior. Thus why Disney + is bleeding subs. Fuck em.
The Spy,"It's good, but the amount of posts on this sub is just ridiculous, reminds me of The Expanse (which is also good) posts."
The Spy,"Man it's not a post, it's the 100th post I've seen this week about it. Not even Rings of Power was like this"
The Spy,"I'm much more tolerant of spam when the show being spammed about is actually good.

At least it's not ten daily articles mindlessly bashing/praising *Rings of Power*"
The Spy,I don't get that reference
The Spy,Shh...that wouldn't fit with their narrative
The Spy,"When they first announced andor they said people from The Americans were working on it, i was 100% onboard it from day 1.

I believe the main showrunner left and Gilroy took over very early on, but had already gotten a few people in the writing room."
The Spy,100 percent second this
The Spy,Ends tomorrow?
The Spy,He's still alive so maybe he'll say something at some point.
The Spy,"It's *fine*. Good even, but the discourse around it is outright hysterical."
The Spy,I just don't understand how something they can easily scroll past to see dozens of other topics not about Andor gets them into a tizzy
The Spy,"lol dude, this is reddit, where every widely known fairly successful movie or TV series is an underrated cinematic masterclass in auteur filmmaking, whatever that means."
The Spy,"Aha worry not my friend :) 
 
Right here on [Disney+](https://youtu.be/6YsNRnZRgg8)"
The Spy,"Gotta remember that entertainment news is a vicious cycle. Reddit reacts to media, media reacts to users reacting, and users post these regurgitative articles."
The Spy,"That's why you're seeing so many articles about it, because it's SO good that even regular, non-star wars fans are noticing. How many articles have there been about Succession?"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Under the Banner of Heaven then this... Hulu really doing everything they can to piss off the Mormon's.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Being an ex Mormon myself there is so much substantial proof that Joseph Smith was a con man and faked it all to fuck a lot and make money but Mormons always brush it all off as “trial of our faith”. If you watched UTBOH the most accurate part is Detective Pyre talking to his bishop about the churches very well hidden and sketchy past and the bishop responds “put that on a shelf and focus your faith on the modern prophet” or something. It’s incredible and sad how many modern Mormons just ignore the evidence. I’m stoked Hulu is pushing this agenda.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Interesting TV is interesting TV. Lots of strange and interesting things that come out of mormonism.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,It's so weird to me that there haven't been any liberal offshoots of the mormon church to come out.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Always happy to see people leave crazy, toxic cults"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"PSA:  In cooperation with the mods at r/UnderTheBanner we've created r/MormonNoMore for gathering news and discussion of this 4-part series.  

We've stickied an announcement for *Mormon No More* at r/UnderTheBanner and look forward to the conversations, cheers!

And… for folks interested in doing a deep dive re this project, the subjects of this Hulu docu-series have previously sat down for a Mormon Stories interview:

https://youtu.be/30ZS_dN_6Ck"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,That name wrote itself tho
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Anything anti-Mormon - so hot right now!
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,This is why heretics were persecuted
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,God i love cults.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Why still call it a religion? It’s a cult. It is based on the most nonsensical doctrine aside from Scientology that I have ever seen.

If there ever *was* a god, I’m sure he did not become Quetzalcoatl to bring the story of Christ to the Mayan people."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Because pissing off entire ~~religions~~ cults is hilarious.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"ex mormon myself, parents still very much in the religion. it's hard to stomach this obvious con, i approached the subject of 'improprieties' in the church (more as an organization than a doctrine, so as not to come off too harsh) and she said 'i dont know of any'"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"I have run into some sketchy Mormons and also a good number of very decent people who were Mormons and seemed to have pretty admirable personal values.  On another point, there's a certain nasty, mean-spiritedness to evangelical Protestantism that the Mormons don't seem to have.  So I actually think there are some pretty good things about the LDS church, along with all the bad. Of course, looking at the history of that church, I think it's clear Smith was a con man and he made up the whole religion.  But... I keep thinking of those really decent Mormon folks that I've met.  If a goofy, made-up religion can provide a lot of positive things to people's lives, I'm kind of hesitant to write it off.  

I think at some point the Mormon church is going to have to make a choice between staying true to their religion's strong conservative, patriarchal traditions and liberalizing the Church in order to be a major world religion, and I suspect their global ambitions will prevail."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Have you seen Murder Among the Mormons on Netflix? That was pretty interesting (if a bit overly long.)
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"The second biggest denomination in the LDS movement, [Community of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Christ?wprov=sfti1), is very socially and theologically liberal.  It was founded by Joseph Smith’s son, Joseph Smith III and counted his mother Emma Smith among his flock.  Not pushing or advertising them, just an interesting part of LDS history.

If you watched UTBOH you might remember the scene where Brigham Young has cemented his control over the church after Joseph Smiths death.  A woman comments that he looks and sounds like Joseph Smith (an old story told, probably just to help Young solidify his position as successor) and then Emma takes her young son and they walk away.  Emma and her family stayed back in Illinois eventually founding the Reorganized LDS Church (Community of Christ since 2001) in 1860 under her son while most Mormons joined Brigham and left for Utah in the coming years under the main LDS Church."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,That’s a family torn apart though.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Except for Scientology. They will fuck you up.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,When are we gonna do Jehovah's witnesses?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Who says you have to liberalise a religion in order to become a major religion? Conservative evangelical Christianity and Islam are insidiously promoting their religions everywhere nowadays.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Uneducated guess on my part: I feel like it has to do with the missions that all the guys go on.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"""I'm kind of hesitant to write it off.""
The problem is the harm that the Mormon church has caused is severe enough that it really shouldn't be ignored (speaking about the organization not about the individual members). It might seem to have a net positive from an outsider's perspective but as an exmormon I want to point out that this is not the case. For example, Utah (a heavily Mormon state where the Mormon church headquarters is located) has one of the highest rates of mental illness, antidepressant use, and suicide in the US. Granted, part of this is due to elevation, but at the very least this fact shows that Mormonism is not protective against depression and Mormons in general are not as happy as you think they are (Mormons are essentially taught to fake looking happy even if they are not). Also, the Mormon church has heavily discriminated against the LGBT+ community which has directly led to many suicides amongst Mormons who are lbtq+."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,It was good. Terribly sad story. Did a good job exposing the silliness of mormon foundations. But no one deserved to die. Hoffmann was a bad guy.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Because of the cult, not because of the victims of the cult"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Maybe the church shouldn’t have made these people think they had to pretend to be straight
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Honestly I had forgotten about them lol, but yes true they will fuck you like they own you."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I think Russian legislators are persecuting Jehovah’s witness’s right now.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Yeah like half the country is trying to go back to the past, half the world seems like. It would definitely be jumping the gun for them to start liberalizing in the next 10 years. They might never have to."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,elevation causes mental Illness and depression? Can you provide a source for this earth shattering medical discovery?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Sad thing is, that's not even how the church approaches things anymore.  [They now acknowledge](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/same-sex-attraction?lang=eng) that homosexual people and desires exist.  You're just not allowed to act on them.

When I lived in Utah, I thought that was actually a step in the right direction.  So many religions are still stuck on the idea that homosexuality is a choice and that you can basically shame or torture someone into being straight.  Then I realized it's almost worse.  Here they are, saying gay people exist; it's not a choice... but you can just die alone, destined to never find love all in the name of worshiping a ""compassionate"" Heavenly Father."

Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Lawyered
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Back in the day there was a successful mini series on network television called Shaka Zulu about the rise of the zulu nation. You can find it on Prime.

[https://www.afrikaiswoke.com/shakazulu-tv-series-review/](https://www.afrikaiswoke.com/shakazulu-tv-series-review/)

I think you could do a good mini or series now. It would be more sellable if it had an outsider character though like in Marco Polo.

I think with the rise of Netflix filling its content with foreign series there is an appetite for it."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"What a great idea. We haven't seen this before. New location, new story, gorgeous location. It would be huge. Call a producer!"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"There's a tv show called Africa's Great Civilizatiins that is about exactly that, you can find it on YouTube or Google search videos page...

Also DTTV  channel on youtube has dozens of documentaries on those topics"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"It would be great if Hollywood would focus on different cultures instead of overused European ones. I can't count all the projects related to the Viking era.

But I understand u/TheBaltimoron's concern. The industry is starting projects that they consider marketable. During the current political status, a series about black people enslaving black people wouldn't last long. Social media backlash would be endless."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"If it could be done Mandalorian / Spartacus style on a digital studio backlot with occasional location shoots, I could see it happening. It is a little frustrating to get yet another Vikings show, would love to see something different."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Considering you'd have to show black people owning slaves in both those civilizations, I wouldn't hold my breath."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"First of all, cultures generally produce most of their entertainment aimed at the people in that culture. That's why you don't see Nollywood and Bollywood producing movies with all-white casts.

So while there has always been a 'black' sub-genre within American filmed entertainment, it's never going to have the budgets of 'white' filmed entertainment.

The second problem is the absence of source material. The reason that so much entertainment is based on European material is because that's where the bulk of fiction comes from. Without a great literary tradition, you need to come up with everything from scratch. Moreover, what you do come up with tends to be highly slanted towards modern perspectives because you're not grounded in contemporaneous work."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"There's some guy in Georgia who might be interested. I've heard he does a lot of work with the African-American community, makes movies for that demographic...Tyler Perry is the guy.

You should email him with a pitch letter. What's the worst that can happen?"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,[removed]
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,It'd only be backlash as I'd imagine conservatives or racists would try use that to their own ends. Most people know slavery occurred everywhere. I'm sure a series could easily depict it with no concern from social media hijacking it for their own purposes.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Depends on the story being told. A story about an African civilization doesn’t automatically mean it has to be a story about black people enslaving other black people. After all, not every American movie set in the 60s is about Jim Crow. In medieval West Africa alone there was much more complexity and intrigue within the various civilizations (Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) than who owned who. Especially when considering how slavery was not a major industry or trade until well into the 16th century for that region. 

I feel like this is an overblown concern, it’s one thing if it’s a story about Dahomey (a civilization that relied on slavery). But a story about nobles in Djenne during the age of Mansa Musa wouldn’t need to be centered around slavery. It would just be a feature in the background, which doesn’t seem like enough to cause any (significant) backlash. The reasons such a project is unlikely to be made has less to do with the unsavory aspects of precolonial African civilizations (which were obviously present in all ancient cultures) but the perceived lack of interest."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"All societies had slaves at one point in time. Hell, Rome had several slave characters and went out of their way to illustrate the roles that slaves had within society. It's quite easy for such an African series to do the very same."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"> The reason that so much entertainment is based on European material is because that's where the bulk of fiction comes from.

It's also because the first great film empire (Hollywood) was English. They only looked in English literature or translated works in English to put to film."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,What does this racist ass comment have to do with ops post???
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"They know is not the same as accepting it. This narrative is not marketable currently.

Just look at what Disney did to Wakanda and Black Panther to make the character marketable for the audience. The close gated and extremely nationalist fictional African country led by Marvel Comics' originally most conservative ruler became a seek for refugees and supporting the share of technological advancement."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,[removed]
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"HAHAHAHA, that's a good one."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"I disagree with that. Do you honestly think a HBO or Amazon wouldn't do a big budget African series because they'd worry how the marketing would do with regard to slavery depicting on such a show? Man, seriously people really need to learn their History. 

How did Disney make them do that?"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"This is accurate to the comics though. The first issue of the Priest run in the 90s had T’Challa investigating corruption in a Wakandan charity operating in Harlem while dealing with a rebellion back home because he let in refugees. Decades before that you’d regularly have Wakandans complain about how T’Challa was “too modern” and globally oriented. Black Panther has never been an endorsement of isolationism, always a king trapped between his royal duties and his desire to turn his nation into a beacon for everyone. 

Obviously some writers have leaned heavier into the “Wakanda First” angle but for the most part I don’t think T’Challa or Wakanda really work for your point. The character (like Wonder Woman or Aquaman) has always been about rejecting the arrogance and isolationism of their peoples. It’s really only black supremacists that want the character to be a “F you” to white people or white supremacists justifying their hatred of the character (and what he represents) that think he’s a complete xenophobe who only cares about Wakanda."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I feel such an assertion is right wing propaganda. People want to see good stories with three-dimensional characters. It being based on historical fact just reemphasizes that.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,">Maybe they could make a fantasy version.

Already done: [*Noughts + Crosses*](https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/noughts-and-crosses) on Peacock (it's not behind the paywall).

Based on a YA SF book series. Alternate history 21st century story, where historically Africa colonized Europe."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I take it you don't study history.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,They would do. But not Africans owning Africans.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,[removed]
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I take it you don't study current events.  No one is touching a show about black slave owners.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,That makes no sense. I could imagine Conservatives who might freak out but I highly doubt any Black people or progressives in the US would suddenly protest such a depiction.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"What in the world are you talking about. What evidence is there even for saying this. No studio has ever said “we will not show black slave owners.” There’s no basis for this nonsense and it’s all the more absurd when you realize you’re talking about slavery in antiquity, not chattel slavery. Lots of shows have written the former and there’s been no fuss."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"well why not

You realize it’s not black slave owners in the American South, right? There’s some time between then and the period being (hypothetically) discussed? Do you have a studio on record saying “We don’t want to show African empires in antiquity because there were slaves in those societies.” If you don’t, you don’t have an argument. Just some weird right-wing whinging about something that hasn’t even happened."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,You think? How many black villain can you list?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"THEY'RE NOT SHOWING BLACK SLAVE OWNERS, PERIOD"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"what do you mean? Like in films or in history or you mean currently, what context?"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"on what basis do u say this

you realize slavery in the Axum Empire and plantation slavery in the American South aren't the same, yeah? like nobody is going to get mad about a show that features axumite kings with house slaves. HBO's Rome already did the same premise and there was zero outcry. There's seriously nothing to what you're saying - you're getting mad about something that's never happened and has no indication of ever happening."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Black villains. They are rare for the same reason HBO wouldn't make a series you expect.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Did Rome have black people owning slaves?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Yea the notion that people would blow up on Twitter because an Axumite or Malian emperor is shown with house slaves in the background doesn’t seem realistic. I could see it pissing off some people online (those committed to a noble savage narrative of Africa) but a story about Nubian royals or mercenaries from Great Zimbabwe doesn’t need to focus on slavery in the same way American films set in the 60s don’t always center on Jim Crow. I could see the backlash if slavery in precolonial Africa was the explicit purpose but I don’t think that’s what OP was initially referring to. There was more to life in precolonial Africa than just slavery, depicting that unsavory element in a limited way doesn’t seem like such a huge marketing issue."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I disagree.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,It depicted slavery as it would've realistically been back then. That's the point. No one is going to complain about the same scenes depicting Axum and you haven't even explained why you think anybody would.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,With what? You are unable to collect a list of black villains.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,You're dumb as a rock.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"I asked you which Black villains and from what? Do you mean from history? politics? society? films?

If you don't think there are any, surely you'd think there should be some."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,List from any Hollywood project.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I am totally confused by you. Do you genuinely believe there have been no Black antagonists in film? Are you somehow indicating that Hollywood is too fearful to cast Blacks in a villain role? Why am I wasting time with this?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,There are and they are extremely rare for a reason.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,And the reason being?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"No they aren’t. Right off the bat there’s Kilgore from Black Panther and Idris Elba’s character in that Fast and Furious spinoff. Stringer, Marlow from The Wire. 

Clearly you don’t watch a lot of movies or shows. Hollywood has no problems making black people villains. And I don’t see what that has to do with the original point anyway. It’s completely irrelevant."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Hollywood is racist just as the audience. Black protagonists are marketable, black villains are not. The latter would generate backlash due to 'negative' representation. I can still remember the complaints against The Night Of."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,All 4? Wow. Long list.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Obviously not an exhaustive list. Grow up. The fact that I could go on and on (you seriously never watched Training Day? Or Lord of War? The first Daredevil? The Princess and the Frog?) just proves that you’re wrong, though. There are plenty of black villains and I don’t know why you mistakenly thought there weren’t."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Did I write non existing? I'm pretty sure I've written rare. And you are just proving I am right.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"I'm proving you right by naming multiple movies and shows (Beasts of no Nation, War Witch, Legend of Tarzan, etc) with black villains while you have zero proof backing up anything you're saying? You realize the list goes on forever right?

Sorry buddy, not how it works. Protip: You aren't saving face by doubling down on something this ridiculous. It's better to just admit you were wrong."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,[deleted]
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022

Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,🙂💕
Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey,It’s great but it’s depressing.
My Secret Romance,This is very “I have taken one screenwriting class”
My Secret Romance,"The event where he fails to protect Ellie already happended in KC, when she saved him. He talks about with Tommy."
My Secret Romance,"Everyone is allowed to their own opinion about pop culture. If OP doesn’t like it, that’s totally fine. 

That being said, this critique reads like the failures of the show are because they don’t follow the one formula for success. There are plenty of ways to make a successful, enjoyable show. OP ignores the fact that lots of people really enjoy it, even if it doesn’t follow the typical recipe for success."
My Secret Romance,"I’ll argue against a few points here. 

1. Joels belief is that people are better off away from him (note how he would choose to live alone on a farm if given the choice). He believes he is responsible for the death of his daughter and Tess, and that it is only a matter of when (not if) he will be responsible for Ellie’s death.

2. Joel gets the pair lost on the trail and is responsible for the pair being ambushed by the commune’s riders. Joel freezes with fear and rather than taking action/speaking up, he allows the dog an opportunity to attack/hurt Ellie. (This is an explicit event that Joel speaks about as manifestation of his fear).

3. I propose that the conflict here is not between Ellie and Joel, but between Joel and Tommy. Recall that Joel was always looking out for Tommy, even before the outbreak. Tommy represents the last remnants of his family. The only person he’s yet to fail (besides Ellie). The conflict comes when Tommy refuses to take Ellie. This forces Joel to confront the reality that he is still responsible for Ellie. (Ge immediately sees a girl resembling his daughter, which causes a relapse into fear and causes him to once again question WHEN he will fail Ellie). 

4. This one happens offscreen. Ellie listens in on Joel and Tommy’s conversation. The conversation is crucial to understanding Joel’s feelings and motivations, but it also affects Ellie’s trust in Joel (a concept called to attention earlier this episode). 

5. This is the confrontation between Joel and Ellie. Ellie confronts Joel about his intentions to leave her. He ultimately gets defensive and lashes out. He tells her off and makes it clear he wants nothing to do with her (a lie to himself and to Ellie). The resolution to this comes when Joel reflects in bed. He visualizes his daughter, and the children he saw earlier living peacefully. He knows he doesn’t want to abandon Ellie, but he has to confront his fears. What will he do?

6. Joel chooses to stay with Ellie. He does so in a patently awkward way. A way only Joel could. He just waits by the horses. 

7. Are we here yet? Or was Joel proven correct all along? Is he failing Ellie by getting stabbed? 

So I think structurally, this is the breakdown of the story beats this episode. The confrontation wasn’t the conflict of the episode structurally speaking. It was the further complication which forced a choice. It also was a character moment as well as a relationship moment. The things Joel says are defensive but understandable. And, we see the regret he feels for saying them. 

It’s fine if this isn’t how you read the scenes initially or if you can’t see them this way. But the themes behind the characters’ actions are string. The interpersonal connections are believable. If it doesn’t resonate with you, ok. But I question what motivates you to try to prove that the lack of resonance is a product of objectively failed structure."
My Secret Romance,"I don't want to attack you for what you think about the show, but I think you're missing all the nuance that the writing rides with its character driven story. 
I can't write out my disagreement for each of your points, but I think the writing is doing a great job following the game and making necessary changes to make it work for TV.
The one point you go back to a lot is how Joel doesn't show (or spoken through the writing) that he is facing this question of if he's good enough to protect this girl, but there's more to it. He's scared that he'll lose her the same way he lost his daughter and while he's the most badass person around to protect her, he doesn't think he can handle that loss again and is doing what he can only think to do to not let that happen. His chest pains, heavy breathing, when he thinks he sees his real daughter, then dreams about her and how that loss affected him.
You're entitled to you opinion, but there's is so much more there you're missing if these are the points you're latching onto.
This is an amazing story and sure you could say I'm biased from the game but I hope you look at it a little deeper and find a way to enjoy it!"
My Secret Romance,"You sound like you read one book on rigid screenwriting tips, and think you are a master storyteller."
My Secret Romance,"If you haven’t seen the Joel and Ellie’s relationship evolve over 6 episodes, then you’ve not been paying attention. While he feels his ability to protect her has diminished a bit due to age etc, he says that as he’s unwilling to face the much more real fact that he’s grown to care for this girl, deeply, and she’s filled a Sara size hole and he’s terrified of going through that again, so best to disassociate as quickly as possible instead of risking that pain again."
My Secret Romance,It's 2023 and people still think they will be taken seriously about their pop culture critiques.
My Secret Romance,"I skimmed your post and I think you seem to be confining your thinking to mainstream Hollywood storytelling's arbitrary rules, where there is almost no room for subtlety and everything has to be explicit and easily digestible for a mildly interested, casual audience.

By your criteria, 'The Sopranos' and 'Mad Men' aren't great shows either because you can't pinpoint characters' choices and motivations to a specific scene earlier in the episode/last couple of episodes.

What TV shows do you give a 10/10 to? Not trying to be condescending, but I have an idea what those shows would be like and what networks they would be on."
My Secret Romance,I ain't reading all that
My Secret Romance,"Opinions are a thing. No need to write an amateur essay on it. What you identify personally as bad writing, others may identify as quality character development, it’s that simple. 

However, you seem to be in the minority regarding the show."
My Secret Romance,disagree
My Secret Romance,"I’m only responding to point 1 because that’s all I needed to see that you’re not seeing the big picture of the story apparently. The show does not do a poor job establishing his fear of losing someone because the fear isn’t directly related to Ellie. His fear is that as he gets closer to ellie his fear in losing her like his daughter grows. It would make sense for this fear to grow as he gets closer to tommy because the “Joel, tommy, Sarah” dynamic is when he lost his daughter and failed her. They highlighted it again when the ppl had their guns pointed at ellie and he froze. He also almost lost Ellie literally the episode before last nights. Twice actually. 

And his incompetence is shown in the intro to the whole series when he proved he was unable to protect the ONE person in the world he was truly responsible for."
My Secret Romance,Your entitled to your opinion. I appreciate you actually laying out reasons too. I don’t really agree but you shared your opinions in a reasonable respectful way so good on you.
My Secret Romance,I can’t imagine going through all this effort with a post like this when all you have to do is simply not watch it if it’s not for you.
My Secret Romance,Go outside
My Secret Romance,"damn, all that for such a mediocre and nitpicking take. while it’s not a groundbreaking show, it still hovers around an 8. you keep talking about plot devices like there’s a cinema bible out there somewhere. while the episodes currently out seem to have rushed some parts from the video games, they’re quite adapted excellently to fit the narrative of the series."
My Secret Romance,That was a long-ass post to tell us you don’t actually understand writing and character development.
My Secret Romance,What is this garbage essay? Lmao
My Secret Romance,"I just can’t understand the point of posts like this. Like what posses a person to post something this long that basically amounts to “Even though the show is a hit that everyone is talking about, all of those people are wrong, actually.”?"
My Secret Romance,Hypercriticism is a plague. Its as if people go out of their way to interpret things in the most negative way possible.
My Secret Romance,"Literally every reason you gave is not even close to accurate.   Typical for these types of posts on Reddit.   Your self awareness is shockingly low.   Your entire account is bashing this show.   I think we all know why.   Also, you think climate change can be stopped if everyone goes vegan lol?  Please don’t reproduce"
My Secret Romance,"I’ll never understand people who don’t like something that’s universally praised by critics and viewers, feeling the need to post about how the thing they just don’t like is actually bad and everyone else is wrong for liking it so much. It’s okay to not like something. We don’t need a dissertation about how poor you think it is and how everyone is overrating it."
My Secret Romance,"“Overrated” = “other people like something I don’t like, and I want to feel better about my opinion.”"
My Secret Romance,What a miserable take. Do you burn your toast on purpose just so you can bitch about it to your coworkers?
My Secret Romance,"If you don’t like it why did you take the time to write this? 

I don’t get why you have to call it ‘overrated’ instead of just writing it off as not your thing.

You’re not going to like every popular show. It’s almost like people have different tastes.

But it is so pretentious to write a post slating a piece of entertainment that millions of people are enjoying just because you didn’t like it"
My Secret Romance,"I like it.  A lot. 

The bad writer … is you."
My Secret Romance,Imagine writing all that lmaooo
My Secret Romance,Lol stoped at “Joel has an incorrect belief” dude - you’re just wrong.
My Secret Romance,OP trying to tell the world he is a better writer than Emmy winner Craig Mazin & the guy who co-created the entire TLOU universe in Neil Druckmann. Yeah bro I don’t think so.
My Secret Romance,I feel like in the real world a ton of people do end up making/changing decisions after a night of sleep. At least people who don't feel the need to stick to their opinion because it's the first thought they had.
My Secret Romance,"Never played the game, never watched the show, but this was the perfect length of read for the poop I was taking. Have a good day..."
My Secret Romance,"I think you're just suffering from ""howiwoulddaitus"" you're forming opinions about how you would have done it, and missing a lot of what you say is missing. 

I was actually just talking about this last night. How a lot of plot and character development other shows would stretch over multiple episodes, are written very economically in this show. 

Just a super short example of something you say is missing... Joel believes he's unfit to protect Ellie, and unfit to be her ""father"". 

Despite all the other instances showing him failing in his goals in previous episodes, you're ignoring the PTSD. But just inside this episode he falls asleep on watch. He's pushed by fear into inaction. He is convinced he's the only one who can ""save"" his brother, yet when his brother is out in the world on his own his brother is the one who thrives. He's reminded how he failed his daughter. He gains information about how he failed to notice that the kid was bitten. 

He's old. He knows he's lost a few steps, and he thinks that the only person he knows and trusts and believes is more capable than he is is a better choice for Ellie. A better choice for his ""daughter"". So he thinks that abandoning his daughter to the care of his brother would be the best option. But that's a selfish choice, and Joel's trying to outgrow being selfish. 

Just because you might be a bad parent sometimes, doesn't mean you get to abandon your kids. 

Joel's character growth, and obstacle he's overcoming isn't just his belief that he can't protect her. It's his belief that he's a shit father who failed at saving his daughter and will fail that once again. His growth is that despite those fears... A fear that has caused him to remove himself from humanity for a decade... He now understands that being a father and committing to the future of your children is more important than your fears."
My Secret Romance,"I read first point. Completely off... Perhaps you're just unable to pay attention or something... Joel has trauma from losing his daughter, he's not gonna be logical about his ability to protect Ellie. Dude... it's so fucking basic. I ain't reading the rest considering the first point is completely dogshit and doesn't even take into account the character, but is simply your personal interpretation of it from your POV instead of Joel's... 

And I was hoping for a good critique..."
My Secret Romance,"I don’t understand posts like this.  Is your goal to make people who like the show stop liking it and start thinking like you?

Why not just like…not watch the show and let those who like it enjoy it.

I see these types on posts on every entertainment subreddit I look at.

Makes no sense."
My Secret Romance,"I appreciate you sharing all your views and I personally disagree with a couple points. 

I think they provided multiple examples of Joel’s failures (Ellie killing the guy, the brother sneaking up on them at night, Joel falling asleep on watch). 

I think Joel does not trust many people (and Tommy shows signs of being similar to Joel in that thinking). Joel believes if he tells the community he will risk Ellie being killed on the spot. Tommy trusts Joel, but nobody else in the community has a reason to and it’s a “communist” community where they all have a say. Joel is risking Ellie’s life if he chooses to tell everyone and he HATES putting trust in other people, especially any stranger. 

I also think that Joel decision to take Ellie is a lot of things that are unsaid. Joel at this point truly cares for Eliie and is scared of messing up and losing her like Sarah. He is deeply conflicted and is attempting to send her with Tommy because it’s an easy way out for him to avoid fucking up and killing someone he is starting to (or already does) love. They have been side by side for months now due to the time lapses. I personally think he decides by letting her go he is losing her and he doesn’t want to make her upset or feel unsafe because the fatherly instinct have kicked in whether he likes it or not, and that’s why he goes. 

That’s all my feedback. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions and theory’s."
My Secret Romance,It’s definitely a good show but I can’t disagree that it’s overhyped by a lot
My Secret Romance,"Fair play to your post. But I feel like if there was a huge triggering event in Sunday's episode, someone else would've written a long post about being spoonfed Joel's decision/realization that he wants to continue going with Ellie.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
My Secret Romance,All that for a drop of blood
My Secret Romance,"What is this, college?"
My Secret Romance,"I do agree that there could have been some improvements. Mostly:

Why didn’t Joel and Tommy escort Ellie?
Why did Joel change his mind?
Why did he not even consider staying at the encampment with Ellie for longer than a day?"
My Secret Romance,"What you're suggesting is some The Walking Dead level of hacky writing. Following to the letter the 'how to structure a story' chapter of every 'how to write' book ever is a good way to create the most mediocre, painfully predictable story filled with the most annoying tropes;

and to suggest that the one show that actively avoids doing that in a sea of mediocre, trope-filled stories that is the zombie sub-genre is poorly written because of it is just sad for someone who calls himself a writer."
My Secret Romance,"Don't care about any of that - still enjoying this show more than anything else I've watched in a long time.  I've never played or seen the video game and never paid attention to the hype for this show, so going in I had no bias except assuming that a show or movie based on a video game is going to be mediocre. 

I'm the type of viewer who has trouble staying awake for most 'critically-acclaimed' shows, and I don't even give a chance to commercial-ridden network television or reality TV."
My Secret Romance,"I think the thing you're fundamentally missing is that Joel learning to let people in and trust Ellie specifically are season long arcs and this is the midpoint of the story. Of course this episode seemingly confirms Joel's worst fears, that's what mid story complications do. They bring the main character to their lowest point before they can have their incorrect beliefs changed. 

Now Joel, deeply hurt and likely incapacitated, will be forced to rely Ellie's responsibility as he recovers, responsibility that he's openly doubted for the whole show but which was really underscored at the beginning of this episode. And he's going to learn that of course he can't protect Ellie himself, he needs a partner. With time, he'll realize Ellie is that partner and that the real reason he's struggled to protect her is because he isn't trusting her and is trying to carry both their weight instead of letting her help him too. There's even a direct call back to how bad Joel's trust issues nearly screwed them over in this episode when Joel talks about how Ellie covertly getting a gun when he wouldn't let her have one was the only reason he survived the initial attack in Kansas City.

Sure, there are individual plot beats that could be improved (I agree, Joel changed his mind about going along with Ellie too quickly and easily) but a lot of your big complaints about this episode boil down to getting upset that the main character hasn't completed his character arc in the middle of Act 2."
My Secret Romance,"Why do you think a wall of text justifies using the dumbest most useless word in all of criticism?


All ‘overrated’ mean is other people like something more than you and you are unhappy about it. 

It’s an opinion on other’s opinions."
My Secret Romance,Where did you get the idea that for a story to be good the characters have to undergo some kind of change?
My Secret Romance,"This reads like the way my English teacher wanted me to pick apart books for the sake of picking them apart before I decided is was just better to just try to enjoy for the sake of trying to enjoy them instead.

When you pick something into pure parts and categories like this, you tear asunder any implicit meaning, losing the entire 'gestalt'. The whole being greater than the sum of its parts speaks to something *beyond* just its parts *or* its sum, but rather the simultaneous vision of both the parts and the whole. You've focused too much on the parts, and lost the forest for the trees."
My Secret Romance,"Not reading all of it as your first two problems are already wrong imo. He is justified in his fear of becoming incompetent to fully protect her. He's gotten very lucky so far that they've managed to make it across the US. Ellie saved his ass by shooting that guy because (unknown to him) she had a hidden gun, the dog didn't detect an infection in Ellie when it very well could have, the two people that snuck up on them despite the broken glass were actually good people and didn't immediately kill and rob them etc. He's getting old and his hearing is piss poor, as he himself states.

Your second problem - ""his incompetence isn't well established this episode"" is also wrong, as it wasn't just him over-sleeping, he also froze up when the dog went in to smell Ellie, which could have easily been the end of her.

Sorry, it just seems like you're just not properly paying attention."
My Secret Romance,Your post is bad writing. (I assume)
My Secret Romance,"People are watching it in droves and enjoying it.

You typed all this to fight and no one really cares"
My Secret Romance,"I ain't reading all that, I'm happy for tho, or sorry that happened."
My Secret Romance,I agree. I feel like the show is really light-weight. There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on but I feel like the show’s a bit rushed and we need to live in the world a bit more. The fact they spent an episode involving two other characters makes me feel like they don’t have a lot of meat to the story
My Secret Romance,"It’s Reddit. Youre going to be slammed. 

That being said, the show is fine. Much better shows on HBOMax."
My Secret Romance,"Since you’re such a expert, what successful stories have you written?"
My Secret Romance,Next
My Secret Romance,You’re a pretentious asshole. No one is impressed
My Secret Romance,You don’t like a show that people like? Who cares.
My Secret Romance,Have totally lost interest in this show after anxiously waiting for its premier. Bad writing.
My Secret Romance,"I actually agree with you. I noticed the weaknesses of the show as far back as ep 3. I pointed it out at the time, but I got shot down too. I think the writing is quite weak, and the overall quality will suffer because of it. I'm sure they cut corners with the construction of the show. Like I noticed there are way fewer interactions with the infected and marauding scavengers than one would expect. Maybe it was to save money? Who knows. But yeah, I think the writing is weak. I've also played the game though, and I definitely hold the game to a higher standard.

Don't worry. Opinions like this typically don't do well during the run of a show. Especially if the show is fairly well liked. These days all it takes is likable characters with comfortable political messaging."
My Secret Romance,The fact that you know these posts are annoying af but still posted it anyways is ridiculous.  We don't need multiple posts like this every single week.  Just let the season play out.
My Secret Romance,"So people love the one off gay romance episode with exactly .05% connection to the rest of the show, but when we finally have our leads show some character development it’s boring and overrated..?

Casual fans are really wild"
My Secret Romance,"I enjoy the show, but agree with you that the show is flawed. I have played the game, so any set backs the show has I can kind of fill in the gaps with from the game, but for someone who hasn't I can see some scenes might be a bit odd.I also didn't like how Joel just went to sleep and changed his mind immediately after an emotional conflict. 

More generally though, I like Pedro and Bellas portrayal of Joel and Ellie, but I think the show did a REALLY poor job of establishing their relatioship. This episode they felt a lot closer, but they also then immediately went to big conflict between each other, which I felt was a little too soon. 

They should have had a few more scenes establishing them getting closer throughout the previous episodes, but I guess its hard to do under limited time. In the game you had dozens of hours of interaction and just simple idle chatter between them which helped to establish their relationship so well, but in the show they boil it down to just a few key moments of dialogue and sometimes it can come off a tad cringey or inauthentic just because its so few and far between. 

I am interested to see the season play out though. There is still a lot of an amazing story left and if they can land it then I will be impressed. If not then, at least it was a more than decent video game adaptation. 

&#x200B;

And side note, I don't understand everyone going wild at you for having an opinion on a TV show."
My Secret Romance,"It bothered me that Tommy and Joel didn’t take the trip together. That was the biggest flaw in the episode for me but I’ve never played the game nor do I know the plot of the game, and that may have simply been sticking to the storyline. It could have made for a great storyline though complete with a multitude of tragic results if they did though, IMO. 
I’ve seen game spoilers hint that the TV audience isn’t going to like where Joel’s character arc was headed but killing off the top-billed, main character in 6 episodes was bold, assuming he is dead. Taking the game spoilers at their word though and seeing the next episode highlights points to a larger character development that may make your points moot and that is, with all the hype about Pascal, it’s not about him. Not knowing what is next and simply seeing what’s been presented and how ep 6 played out, the big, very meta plot twist is everything up to now and what’s ahead wasn’t about Joel, it’s about Ellie and her development in the timeline. And that’s a story I can get into because she is one incredible and dynamic character."
My Secret Romance,I would submit to you that posts about how some popular thing isn’t as good as everyone says (but is still good) are a waste of everyone’s time. It’s just not an interesting topic of conversation. Maybe go take a walk or something
My Secret Romance,I like the show and I agree with all of this. Last night’s episode was really just the most egregious example of it. I’m ready to say it is the worst of the series so far. A mixture of filler and rushed plot lines
My Secret Romance,no one cares
My Secret Romance,Is it overrated or just...widely rated?
My Secret Romance,the npc’s here will disagree  with you. but you’re spot on OP
My Secret Romance,"You know, when every comment Is pointing out how horrible of a take this is, and you yourself labelled it as ""one of those posts,"" perhaps you should just not post it."
My Secret Romance,"It’s just a fucking TV show, you’re taking it way too seriously, you need to get some kind of other interest in your life, or a hobby"
My Secret Romance,"I feel like the acting is so forced. Pedro Pascal does alright, but I cannot get over Ellie’s character. I get annoyed in general, but the jokes and the fake laughing makes me cringe. Also, the Game of Thrones syndrome where shit hits the fan and at the very last moment something saves Ellie or Joel… maybe I am just losing interest in TV shows formulaic nature in general."
My Secret Romance,"My opinion is that it’s a perfectly fine show that’s getting a lot of buzz right now because honestly there’s not a lot of current shows that are very good airing week to week. It’s successful in my opinion because they picked a great time to air it (no dragon shows, no Yellowstone, no current big shows)."
My Secret Romance,Its not as good as TWD
My Secret Romance,"Wow. You wrote a lot and worked really hard for me to waive it all away by saying “but I am super engaged in the people, their arc, and their story”. Sometimes that is enough and in this case they are doing it as well or better than any other new show."
My Secret Romance,Not going to read all of this wall of text. If you don't like it then don't watch it. This seems like a lot of effort to explain why you don't like something to tell people that have no power to change it and probably wouldn't even if they could because they like it the way it is.
My Secret Romance,yeah its not really amazing its just okay to me
My Secret Romance,It’s an entirely different show to people who have played the game. We know what’s coming up.
My Secret Romance,I couldn’t read your post cus it’s too long and I downvoted you because these kind of posts are so boring and unimaginative.
My Secret Romance,"Idk why you’re getting all this hate lmao. Agree or disagree it’s nice to see a well thought out argument. I think it’s a good show, your critiques are definitely valid and you raise some good points. Joel changing his mind was very weak from a writing standpoint"
My Secret Romance,"Please, stop with this nonsense. I'm tired of reading these overrated posts every single day. Every single popular show is overrated to someone, no one gives a shit.

What do you want, a medal for being contrarian? Do you think you're going to change the opinion of the entire world and affect the show's reputation? Like, what are we supposed to do? If you think it's overrated then great, watch it with a little less enthusiasm lol. Like, what else?"
My Secret Romance,"It’s following the plot of the video game. Maybe your rules don’t apply since the story was written as game play originally then adapted for TV. Where the game writers have stuck (mostly) to the game’s plot. You’re over thinking anyways. It’s TV, not one of the moon landings."
My Secret Romance,"If you want to be a good writer, I urge you to reconsider your position on so-called writing rules. These are not laws written in stone, but mere observations made by someone who just read a lot. It's good to know them, but to cling to them fanatically is really a bad idea."
My Secret Romance,"Go outside and touch some grass. Self-proclaimed amateur writer critiques show that professionals worked on and knows where they all went wrong. 

You can't make this shit up"
My Secret Romance,Calling things overrated is overrated
My Secret Romance,People-STOP saying overrated or underrated when it is basically your opinion versus someone else's opinion! YOU are not the authority on ratings. Just the authority on your own opinion.
My Secret Romance,"I think you're right.  I don't know about the analysis, but I do think the show is over-rated.  I like it.  It's fine, but not amazing."
My Secret Romance,Lol you didn’t need to write a dissertation. Go outside and get some fresh or something. It is just a tv show.
My Secret Romance,It is an extremely overrated and boring show
My Secret Romance,">Storytelling 101: whenever you write a story, any story, for it to be considered truly good you need events that will impact the characters' lives and cause them to change, growing out of their wrong beliefs and adopting better ones.

I reject the idea that storytelling is fundamentally about characters who have wrong beliefs growing and changing to accept better beliefs, so your analysis of the show is starting from a flawed premise.

Storytelling is fundamentally about the intersection of character goals and the conflict in trying to achieve those goals. That's Storytelling 101.

I actually don't like the show btw. I stopped after the first episode because they diluted the storytelling. It took the videogame 15 minutes to get to Sarah's death, and the show took 30 minutes, because they added unnecessary backstory that sucked all the power out of the events of the story.

They got it backwards. You would expect the videogame to drag the story out, because the immersiveness of gameplay can sustain the interest of the gamer in a way that would be boring to the viewer."
My Secret Romance,"Yeah, these storytelling “rules” are all bullshit. You can use them to make your story more efficient, but following them religiously is dumb. If every movie or show had to comply with these rules to be considered good, that’d mean stuff like the leftovers or everything David Lynch has ever done is bad. And it’s not."
My Secret Romance,"Reminds me of Christopher Moltisanti after he bought ""How to write a movie in 21 days"""
My Secret Romance,What's great is they are trying to breakdown someone's writing who literally has a podcast about screenwriting. Screams contrarian to me.
My Secret Romance,Not to mention how he says he felt powerless when the Jackson guards surrounded them and he thought their dog would tear Ellie apart if it picked up the infection
My Secret Romance,OP keeps acting like the previous episodes don’t exist as background for why the story is where it’s at. Op is accurate in pointing out Joel making a big deal about separating from Ellie then 10 hours later is like “let’s go” however that does not ruin the ep as OP claims
My Secret Romance,"Yeah, I remember. It needed to happen again. But it's fine, if that's convincing enough for you (I don't mean it sarcastically, it's truly fine). That was not the crux of my critique. The crux of my critique was Joel's mind changing on a dime without anything triggering that change."
My Secret Romance,Everyone is allowed their opinion but we can still critique his opinion.
My Secret Romance,This is what I was thinking. This whole post reads like someone who took a course on story writing and then thinks that strict formula is the only way to do things. The fact of the matter is it isn't.
My Secret Romance,"Apparently, you're not supposed to have opinions about this show or risk being called a bigot even if you lay out your points. Instead of responding point for point in agreement or disagreement, they respond with emotionally immature comments. I left the Last of Us subreddit because of the irrational and simple-minded fanbase. I catch the show episodes between Mondays thru Thursday because the LOU isn't must-see tv. 

Good luck with having someone reply to your comment like an adult and without middle school snark. 

I miss the days of The Walking Dead discussions before the series went to shit. This fanbase isn't for me."
My Secret Romance,"Yes, people can still enjoy a show with bad writing."
My Secret Romance,"Thanks for the long, thoughtful response. I don't think the \*main\* conflict is between Joel and Tommy, no. It's pretty clear to me that it's between Joel and Ellie. Just so I don't have to type a giant response, let me focus on your points 5 and 6. Having the resolution of that argument be simply ""Joel reflects in bed and thinks better of it"" is weak writing. You may disagree with me, that's fine. 

I'll even go further: in real life, it's perfectly possible that someone would act the way that Joel did, and many people do, in fact, act that way. But good writing is not simply being ""true to life."" Good writing is about creating tension, increasing the stakes (including emotional stakes) and keeping the audience on the edge until the character is forced upon a situation where he'll have to change to save the day. Joel sleeping through the night and reflecting on his problem is fairly realistic when it comes to how human can change, but it's note exciting or interesting. We want the change to be induced from the outside, forced by external events in a high-stakes situation. You might disagree with me (and many people here do), and that's perfectly fine. But that's the recipe for success for most of the best stories in the world. The reason is that, honestly, it just looks better."
Splash Splash Love,Hope they reveal that ww2 Spielberg show
Splash Splash Love,I wish Apple would throw some money to make a Dark Tower adaptation.
Splash Splash Love,What's Mister Quest?
Splash Splash Love,Oh they're just pitching the shows they already have? I was really thinking they'd be announcing something bigger with the start of that headline.
Splash Splash Love,"Is liket hem to pick up some dark fantasy.

Maybe Apple can do Malazan correctly"
Splash Splash Love,"Mythic Quest and Severance are both really great, yeah, but don’t sleep on The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey."
Splash Splash Love,I'm pissed they haven't marketed the shit out of Severance
Splash Splash Love,Remember with Comic Con was about comicbook related stuff?
Splash Splash Love,"I’ve been pleasantly surprised by quite a few AppleTV originals. In terms of show quality, they’ve been up there with HBO, imo."
Splash Splash Love,"the best things ive seen TV this year?

Severance

the Offer"
Splash Splash Love,"I just got Apple TV for a year through TMobile. Aside from Ted Lasso, which I've seen, anything else I should check out first? I prefer comedies but I can handle some drama too if it's a future classic kind of thing."
Splash Splash Love,[deleted]
Splash Splash Love,[deleted]
Splash Splash Love,Why do all their shows have one word titles
Splash Splash Love,I started watching Suspicion because it started playing after the most recent FAM played. I only stopped watching because I had to leave. I was so intrigued.
Splash Splash Love,"God I hope they get the rights to Raised By Wolves, such a perfectly weird sci-fi for their catalogue"
Splash Splash Love,No Ted Lasso? That’s the real crime.
Splash Splash Love,Masters of the Air; same.
Splash Splash Love,Curious if Cary fukanaga will part of the promotions for it given his recent headlines also they’ll def promote the hell out of Austin butler given his “Elvis” performance acclaim
Splash Splash Love,"Hopefully they get to it before Amazon does, that sounds exactly like something they'd try to snatch up then half ass"
Splash Splash Love,The rights are still with Sony for that one right?
Splash Splash Love,Cutthatcutthatcutthat
Splash Splash Love,"While it's not listed, I still hope Apple TV+ will release first trailer for 'Wool' or at least a teaser."
Splash Splash Love,Heck yes. ATV+ has some killer sci-fi but is missing in the fantasy genre. If they did Malazan I’d flip.
Splash Splash Love,Or maybe some Joe Abercrombie books. The First Law.
Splash Splash Love,"Not really, it’s included sci-fi and fantasy as long as I can remember"
Splash Splash Love,"Severance was something else, cant get that show out of my head and I'm alright with that."
Splash Splash Love,I think Severance is one of the best shows I've watched all year. Slightly slow start but has an amazing final few episodes (finale especially) which will have you shouting at your TV.
Splash Splash Love,Mythic Quest might be right up your alley. Some good comedy plus a few more drama episodes.
Splash Splash Love,"Severance is just mindblowing. It's a masterpeiece.

Comedies

* Central Park and Schmigadoon if you like musicals
* The After party - great comedy/murder mystery
* I am enjoying Loot (going on now)
* Acapulco is straight up happy making, a similar energy as Ted Lasso
* Mythic Quest is silly, but fun
* Trying is a very sweet and funny story about a couple trying to adopt a child
* I really liked Dickinson. It's not completely haha funny, but it's a fairly light hearted and surreal drama, and I'd put it closer to comedy than ""Drama""

Movies

* Coda is god damned amazing
* Come From Away, recording of the stage musical

Dramas

You asked more for comedies, so I won't list everything, but I think For All Mankind is worth calling out. There are other dramas I liked, but I won't go on and on"
Splash Splash Love,"'Invasion' was a complete waste of time. Can't believe that Apple TV gave Simon Kinberg $200 million, which doesn't show on screen at all, and we end up with a terrible boring show. 

As for other Apple TV series, 'Severance' is not just a great Apple TV series, but it is also one of the best new TV series of the year."
Splash Splash Love,"it's been announced for quite awhile now they've been renewed for seasons 3 and 4. they just wrapped season 3 filming.

edit: idk why i got downvoted, but the person i was replying to said they hoped mythic quest had not been cancelled. i just said season 3 filming wrapped and season 4 is also on the way lol but ok i guess"
Splash Splash Love,"Defending Jacob, For All Mankind, Amazing Stories, The Morning Show, Mythic Quest, Ted Lasso, Shining Girls, Now and Then, Mosquito Coast, Prehistoric Planet, Little America, The Essex Serpent, The Shrink Next Door, Slow Horses, Truth Be Told, The After Party, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey."
Splash Splash Love,"Oh boy, I don't even want to say >!how angry you're going to be at the end of the show!<. But go on, find out for yourself."
Splash Splash Love,"tbh Suspicion is the only thing they've had that made me feel like I was actively having my time wasted. Foundation I kinda bounced off of (and I read the books young, I'm a prime candidate for it)."
Splash Splash Love,"I'm not really following the news about this show atm because it was like 6 years when the show was announced.

Don't know who Cary is"
Splash Splash Love,Amazon already filmed a pilot and passed on it.  And from that sounds of it it was going to be absolutely perfect.
Splash Splash Love,"Isn't Sony behind For All Mankind?  If they have a good working relationship with Apple, I can see them producing it for them.  As far as I know they don't have plans to launch their own service, it'd be nice to see them get behind Apple and start producing some other IPs."
Splash Splash Love,What’s Wool?
Splash Splash Love,I still can't believe this is actually happening.  I'm hyped.
Splash Splash Love,"I’ve only read the first book but my uncle dropped off books 2-6 for me, literally 2 weeks before he passed away... I really need to continue reading the series in his memory"
Splash Splash Love,"I need to read this but my library does have it, I will try the used book store after I have worked through some of my backlog"
Splash Splash Love,"Still kinda amazed that they set up so much for the finale to handle, and the actual episode delivered 110%"
Splash Splash Love,I'm still having anxiety about that last episode.
Splash Splash Love,"I binged it after reading for weeks how terrible it was on reddit.  I think maybe because my expectations were in the basement and I knew going in that there wasn't going to be a *full scale* alien invasion shown, I ended up actually enjoying it.   It was kind of like This is Us with an alien invasion mystery backdrop.     
  
Yeah, I have criticisms, I don't understand how, with such a massive budget we didn't get to actually really see any of the big battles but I kinda feel like that's what they were going for.  Not Independence Day or War of the Worlds but more Signs.  An insulated perspective of the invasion through the eyes of the characters living in the world, bits and pieces of information, it never zoomed out to really give us all the details and show us the invasion on a macro level. It's a slow burn and once I got on board with the vibe, I was kinda digging it.  Sure, there is some character writing that could definitely use improvement but by the end of S1 I actually found myself looking forward to a second season."
Splash Splash Love,You know too much
Splash Splash Love,Cary fukanga he directed the new bond movie and a few episodes of masters of the air he’s recently been accused of grooming sexual assault and other stuff even on the set of masters of the air
Splash Splash Love,"Sony, especially their TV studio, has good working relationship with almost every streamer. They make For All Mankind for Apple. They are making The Boys and a few other shows for Amazon. They are also making Goosebumps for Disney+. So it's not much of a stretch for them to work with Apple on this. I just wanted to ask if The Dark Tower is still locked at Sony or no one has the rights now."
Splash Splash Love,"'Wool' is an upcoming Apple TV+ series based on Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic novel, the first in a trilogy. 


[Variety](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/tim-robbins-wool-series-apple-1235043924/): **Tim Robbins Joins ‘Wool’ Series Adaptation at Apple** 

> Tim Robbins has signed onto the series adaptation of Hugh Howey’s “Wool” at Apple, Variety has learned.


> Robbins will star alongside previously announced cast member Rebecca Ferguson. “Wool” is a set in a ruined and toxic future where a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them."
Splash Splash Love,What is that series about? I’ve never heard of it.
Splash Splash Love,Dylan holding both those levers the entire episode with his glasses falling off his face.  So stressful.
Splash Splash Love,"I think it's OK. I also didn't hate it as much as reddit. My wife liked it. In all fairness, both of us like kind of slow stuff sometimes. Maybe from reading long  book series all of the time? Idk."
Splash Splash Love,"I didn't know they did The Boys too.  Interesting.  I actually think what they're doing is smart, playing the field and not trying to launch their own platform right now.  I think at least a few of these services are going to end up merging anyway in the future.   Might as well just focus on content."
Splash Splash Love,"If Im not mistaken they make Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul for AMC, too? And I think Community back in the day for NBC. could be mistaken."
Splash Splash Love,"Sony doesn't have the same revered catalog (save for classic Columbia and TriStar releases) that their competitors do. Launching a streaming service would be suicide for them because of how much of a money sinker it is. Too much risk, with no guaranteed reward."
Splash Splash Love,Yup. All those are produced and distributed internationally by Sony.
Splash Splash Love,"I wonder how many people get it mixed up with Locke and Key, another Netflix show about a young trio (both two boys and a girl) dealing with supernatural mysteries?"
Splash Splash Love,The intro song is a banger! lol
Splash Splash Love,"I enjoyed this show so much, hopefully they make another season."
Splash Splash Love,"Surprised too. Just started watching it. It was on one of the Netflix lists but I can't recall which one. I guess not trending. When I saw it, I did think the title looked pretty boring, though. 

The first episode started a bit cheesy, but during the main characters ""job interview"" scene I got hooked. Surprised it hasn't gotten much attention even online. Haven't heard about it before this week."
Splash Splash Love,"It's a great show. The cast have some great charisma and chemistry. So while the writing's a bit 'plot armory' at times it's still swashbuckling fun! I'm loving it tbf.

It's like a quirky, more fun descendant of Sapphire and Steel"
Splash Splash Love,"It is a great show, Joe Cornish, the writer and director has done promotion on UK tv and radio.  He and stars did a AMA on Reddit a while back.  It just never seemed to get taken up but it is a solid show with some really great bits.  I really hope it gets renewed."
Splash Splash Love,"It was the number one show on Netflix (at least in the UK) the first week, so I guess it reached some people at least."
Splash Splash Love,Its a strange yeah some shows like Wednesday break out while other fall off
Splash Splash Love,Tumblr is going crazy over it! Definitely has a dedicated fan base already. I’ve rewatched twice to try to help it’s #s
Splash Splash Love,"I loved the show. They did a good job of adapting the books, which are even better. They are way more dark/scary than the show. The casting is spot on too- exactly how I imagined the characters when I was reading."
Splash Splash Love,It's a solid adventure show with very little to complain about.  Maybe that's not good enough these days?
Splash Splash Love,"I'm an adult male, and I had a lot of fun watching it.

Looking forward to another season."
Splash Splash Love,Me and my wife really enjoyed this show!
Splash Splash Love,"I really hope it gets a second season because I really enjoyed the first season. It was an interesting spin on a ghost hunting show that I'd love to see more of. Of course, I'm a Joe Cornish fan too, so there is that too..."
Splash Splash Love,I loved this show. I wish there were more episodes.
Splash Splash Love,"Ugh, I LOVED them all! I really hope there’s a season 2!"
Splash Splash Love,"Its like an actually good CW show. Not a super gripping thriller, but it makes folding laundry take a half hour longer. I would absolutely watch more of it."
Splash Splash Love,"Do you guys use Netflix differently than me?  It was the splash page whenever I logged in for like two solid weeks. Plus all the “Lockwood and Co is a breath of fresh air in the CW dominated teen adventure show market” posts we got here.

Anyway I gave up four episodes in.  It was just “kids do ghost stuff as well as possible, adults come in, ruin everything, blame kids for everything being ruined, oh also there’s a bunch of mystery boxes I guess” every episode and I got bored."
Splash Splash Love,"I really liked it.  As a hardcore Ghostbusters fan, I really dug its “alternate take” on the “ghost busting business” premise, and would recommend it to any fellow Ghostbusters fan."
Splash Splash Love,"I've watched way too much YA stuff. Lockwood and Co did a great job of world building, makes sense compared to some of the others, and is okay for tweens. I really enjoyed it over some of the others."
Splash Splash Love,"What has surprised me is that it’s nice adaptation of a fantasy book series, but ‘booktube’ has seemingly ignored it. There’s very few reviews on YouTube. Maybe no one was  sent screeners? I would think that is a failure of promotion by Netflix."
Splash Splash Love,I work at a bookstore and the book sales for it increased
Splash Splash Love,Personally I really liked it..... was a lot of fun.  I hope it gets renewed.
Splash Splash Love,"Yoooo no way, I loved reading this series. I had no idea there was a show. Ahoy mate, lift anchor!"
Splash Splash Love,Great show! Enjoyed it thoroughly!!
Splash Splash Love,"I watched the trailer and it looked like one more show to toss on the pile of uninspired Netflix YA shows that end up canceled after a season, like The Irregulars. I didn't even realize Joe Cornish was involved, and I like his other work, so I might give it a chance after all. If it's better than it looks, I don't think it's a matter of not marketing it so much as mismarketing."
Splash Splash Love,"I loved it! I’ve read the books it’s based on and feel it was a really good adaptation. My husband and I binged it the weekend it came out, and I’ve been disappointed that no one’s talking about it."
Splash Splash Love,"I watched the preview on Netflix and decided not to watch it. The preview made it look like a kids show so I skipped it.

It's got a lot of praise in this sub though, so I'm going to back and try watching it"
Splash Splash Love,I really enjoyed it!
Splash Splash Love,loved the books as a kid so i really enjoyed it but it’s not for everyone
Splash Splash Love,There's too many dang shows to watch. I'm overwhelmed with all the shows on my lists. I'm sure there are great shows I haven't gotten to yet because I just don't have the time.
Splash Splash Love,I watched the show. It was quite enjoyable
Splash Splash Love,"I dunno, it was promoted enough through Netflix that I watched it even though I'd never heard of it. I guess it was ok, if you really love YA. It felt like they had one of those big lists of every YA trope ever and just went down checking off boxes. But I *did* watch the whole season, because I liked the worldbuilding and if you only paid attention to the 5 minutes per episode that wasn't ticking off one of the checklist items, those bits were good."
Splash Splash Love,No one wants to invest in a new Netflix show (especially a teen fantasy show) with the fact that I can bet it will be canceled within the next 6 months.
Splash Splash Love,"watched the first season. seems decent and its an easy watch, could be a good little program but nothing really stands out too me. comes accross as a sherlock style program with the supernatural but no characters really grip you that much and neither do the story lines. i think it deserves a second season but they need to really push some top tier writing for it to be a quality show."
Splash Splash Love,"I thought it was good, fun and well done but was simultaneously not interested in it. If I was a kid it would have been my jam, probably."
Splash Splash Love,"It had engaging premise and world building, incredible start and solid middle but that's all for me. Later parts were a bit too childish and forced. It's always irritating when smart characters devolve into dumb and careless ones just to push narrative. Still rooting for S2 someday because show has a lot of potential and actors were enjoyable to watch."
Splash Splash Love,I hate loving this show because I know it's going to get canceled 😞
Splash Splash Love,"watched it with my tweener daughter and it was surprisingly decent, she loved it. Hope they make season 2."
Splash Splash Love,I started watching it because it was in trending and the RT reviews were good. It was a fun show and I liked how the plot kept moving along instead of drawing out the first mystery. The world building kept unfolding. Would really love a second season but doesn’t seem likely.
Splash Splash Love,Just one of those shows Netflix puts outs out with little to no marketing. Sucks cuz I really enjoyed it
Splash Splash Love,"They promote it all the time on Instagram. I saw it on my Netflix homepage a lot as well personally.

Sometimes a show just doesn't have an impact. Giri/Haji is one of Netflix's best shows, and yet, no one talks about it either."
Splash Splash Love,"Thanks for the post, I didn't know the show exist. Just finished episode 4"
Splash Splash Love,Because it starts out really great and lands with a thud. The last two or three episodes got so darn stupid.
13 Commandments,"Or, maybe it’s utter shite"
13 Commandments,I like A Pup Named Scooby Doo
13 Commandments,"I watched it, it’s pretty bad tbh"
13 Commandments,Calling people racist for disliking a horrible TV show is just as cringe as the meta jokes that were written for Velma. Everything is subjective when it comes to TV/film but there’s a reason it’s sitting at a 2/10.
13 Commandments,"This review is hilarious. OP says ""Comedy is subjective"" multiple times then proceeds to tell people they're ""this or that"" for not finding it funny. Lmao. Wow."
13 Commandments,"I just watched it. They utterly trashed the entire history of the characters. First of all, every single character has been given a total makeover that barely resembles anything that came before it. They did Fred completely dirty and turned him into a narcissistic psychopath a small wang. They made Shaggy not even Shaggy. I can get Velma is gay but DAPHNE? Where the hell did that come from?  I have never watched a show that totally crapped upon all the characters and actually feels like it HATES its target audience.  This wasn't made for Scooby Doo fans. It was made for self insertion and pandering. It's horrible."
13 Commandments,"You put it on the same level as two shows with wildly different scores (8.5 is good/great, 5.8 is mediocre/bad).  Maybe it's just subjective and bad.  I haven't watched it yet because I don't currently have HBO Max, but your 6/10 is the most ringing endorsement I've seen for it.  It's not just racists who don't like it."
13 Commandments,Scooby-doo is not even in this show lmao
13 Commandments,"It's important to remember that two ideas that aren't in conflict with each other can be true at the same time. People can be negatively reviewing Velma sight unseen because they don't like the politics, AND Velma can also be a bad TV show."
13 Commandments,"Or maybe, and hear me out here, people don't like the Scooby-Doo show without Scooby-Doo that turned Fred into a Trump parable and thinks complaining about society is the same thing as jokes"
13 Commandments,Or it’s just bad and a bad idea
13 Commandments,"I got 7 minutes into the first episode and couldn’t take anymore. The show is hot trash. You can’t even make the argument that humour is subjective, because the show just doesn’t even feel like it’s making an attempt at it, it feels like it’s just trying to edgy and controversial for views, and it is getting rightly destroyed for it."
13 Commandments,So basically according to you there's no way for this show to be bad. What a take.
13 Commandments,"This feels like a really long, “if you don’t like this then you’re racist” post. I haven’t watched it and probably won’t because currently watching Be Cool Scooby Doo has really soured me on Velma. Is it fair? No. Is it racist or misogynistic? Nope."
13 Commandments,"I’m tired of people getting mad at bad shows getting bad reviews and blaming it on review bombing. It stinks, get over it."
13 Commandments,"""If you don't like it you're a racist turd""

And that's where your opinion became irrelevant."
13 Commandments,"The only people that have the right to be bothered by review bombing are the creators. If you follow audience scores, that’s on you. They’ve always been terrible and will continue to be. By making this post, you are the one giving the “review bombers” power. I have no stakes in this show whatsoever but this applies to everything, and it also goes for things that are rated highly because of fanboys. User scores can’t be trusted. The average user of any service is an idiot.

EDIT: I turned the first episode on after posting this and what the fuck. The first joke is cockroach sex?"
13 Commandments,"Just addressing your edits in relation to the comments I've been reading in this thread: You are adding your own interpretation and meaning into comments that I just don't think are there. I'm mostly seeing responses that respectfully disagree with your post. 

I'm certainly not seeing many people that are so ""fragile that an animated minority teenager sends them into a frantic rage."" You seem more upset than the comments section."
13 Commandments,The show is absolute garbage they need to be shown that making shows like this is 100% a money losing situation so they stop making them.
13 Commandments,Could it entirely be possible that a scooby doo show that does not include scooby doo would be a terrible idea?
13 Commandments,"It's the show that was already arguing like a drunk in a bar before it even launched right?

I can believe its terrible, its always been SCOOBY and the gang, without the dog the others are just some dudes and dudettes who ride around in a creepy van and trespass."
13 Commandments,"Ugh I’m beyond tired of this “if you don’t like this thing then you’re a questionable person” narrative. It’s lazy, reductive, and reeks of brittle egos that can’t handle that someone doesn’t like a thing they like. 

Secondly, when you’re summarily proven wrong that, no, it’s not just racists or whatever who don’t like the show, you fall back to “this isn’t supposed to be the peak of art, wHy iS eVeRyOnE bEiNG so SeRiOuS?”

Why can’t we just accept that some shows are just bad?"
13 Commandments,"I think shows like this are toxic. They try to promote themselves off outrage culture and thus throw insults out before the show is even made. They use minorities as a gimmick. They purposely create a heated online community in an attempt to get clicks, with no respect for the audience or if they are hurt by it

I fit the minority groups they are trying to appeal to, and I thought it looked bad from the trailer as well as the actual show.

In this case, they wrote, filmed, an animated a response to toxic racist man babies before the show was even announced. Clearly the intention is to stop you from judging the show based off very revealing trailers.

It's not review bombing to dislike a show. Reviewing bombing would be if one person gave it a thousand bad reviews, not if a thousand people dislike it. I find it a poor Imitation of what Harley Quinn does better and the showrunner hasn't been putting effort into her writing in a long time.

Plenty of reasons to dislike this show that uses a corporate brand name to boost an already dated satire. It's fine if you like it, but it's also fine for people to dislike it.

Edit: the ""review bombing"" is literally what they wanted. If you're a fan of the show, be happy it happened. I for one am bored of outrage culture shows"
13 Commandments,"OP, get your schizo meds"
13 Commandments,Reddit posts should have a rule similar to YouTube where they have to disclose whenever they're a paid opinion.
13 Commandments,"What horseshit.  Even the delusional, woke critics hate this absolute garbage.  And they'll shill for any pathetic dogshit that comes out like that ridiculous fanfic rings of power ""show"""
13 Commandments,"Or it could be the show is actual trash, not the fan base? Don’t try to defend this piece of shit."
13 Commandments,"I couldn't even get through the opening scene but it clearly isn't close to Harley Quinn in quality. 

All it had was one stupid meta joke after another and a complete butchering of the Scooby-Doo franchise. 

Legitimately looks like it could be one of the worst shows ever made but I'm not gonna watch enough of it to find out"
13 Commandments,"I'm sure there's some unethical negative reviews but I'm a little curious about your point of humor being subjective and maybe the show isn't for you? 

At face value that's fair, but are people not supposed to write a review if they didn't enjoy the show? That would remove all negative reviews and give a false impression of what the show is. Personally if I'm reading reviews to see if I want to watch something or not I'll read a few positive and a few negative to get both views."
13 Commandments,"Maybe it just sucks. I mean Norville and no Scooby-Doo, sounds like trash"
13 Commandments,I just some how hate how Shaggy became an actual contemporary black sterotype
13 Commandments,"I haven't read a positive review of this yet, and that's from professional reviewers, not the online chatterbox. Many reviewers explicitly state that it tries to be Harley Quinn but is *NOT* on that same level.

Review bombing it sight-unseen isn't cool, but neither is OP's post, with also doesn't seem to have anything to do with the actual show (urr, urr, it's subjective). 

Let's stop bashing AND caping for shows for reasons other than its quality."
13 Commandments,"I tried to watch the show, it was incredibly bad. Stopped at first episode, never gonna touch it again. I don't care about race swap as I'm a brown south asian myself. If the show is bad it gets bad audience review. Look at House of dragon and it's audience review for example."
13 Commandments,"So... your point is that people aren't allowed to dislike something if you can find some arbitrary similarities between it and another show? I mean if people really could just copy some show that did well and be guaranteed it would do exactly as well, don't you think every show that comes out would all just be exactly that?

From the trailer it sounded like it was going to be lazy. Like you're pointing out, it sounds like they picked four or five specific points like ""this particular animation style"" and then just phoned in all the rest.

I don't think that you get to tell people ""you are forced to like this show by a brown person or you're just racist"". I think it's possible for someone to just make a bad show even if that person is subjected to prejudice.

And from your various edits... yeah... I don't respond well to anyone saying ""if you disagree with one of my opinions then you're just racist."" Racism is a real, actual problem in the world, and people like you cheapen it when you think you get to use it to justify how everyone always has to tell you that any random idea you have is genius. You are unhinged and need to calm down and take a step back from the internet, and come back when you're able to listen to people disagreeing with you, without assuming you're perfect and the only reason someone might think other than you do is that they are prejudiced."
13 Commandments,"God bless the paint chip eating morons that *immediately* try to cry racism/bigotry/etc. should some poorly (and unnecessarily) “reimagined” take on an **already established** IP be a steaming pile of dogshit. Certainly it can’t be because production opted to try to check too many demographical “wokeness” boxes! It has to be because the viewers are close-minded idiots that don’t know what they’re talking about!

Edited to add: and to be clear, by no means is this take limited in any way to ‘Velma’— it applies to far too many tv/movie/game releases as of late."
13 Commandments,"Enough of defending  bad ratings for bad shows as “hatred”, “trolls”.

Had enough during She Hulk and now this"
13 Commandments,"I can't stand the argument of ""the characters are FICTIONAL so its ok to change their race, gender, height, sexuality, etc"". Its so disrespectful to the character.

If you want a Scooby Doo type show with an Indian woman lead then that's great I'm 100% on board with that.

You know what though? VELMA isn't indian. We know that because we've seen her in a million other shows and movies.

Instead of race swapping an existing character just create a new character and make them part of the Scooby gang. Problem solved, everyones happy.

Same thing with the Little Mermaid. I'm perfectly ok with a dark skinned/black mermaid. In fact didn't we see that in the original movie? Ariel is a red haired white girl. Just make the new Little Mermaid Its own character. Why is that such a problem?"
13 Commandments,Not gonna lie watched the first episode and it's bad ill try to keep watching but it is no way on the same level as harley quinn (which is a good example of taking something well known and creating something that is both good and original)
13 Commandments,"They completely changed the characters. Shaggy doesn't look like shaggy and where tf is Scoob? This post is just writing off criticism of the show by misidentifying it as racism. Hope the downvotes wake you up, people don't like classic characters being changed and fucked with."
13 Commandments,"Sure sounds like you are the only one butthurt, it's a terrible show."
13 Commandments,"every time a series comes out, and people instead of talking about captivating history or interesting characters, discuss about : racism, sexism, homophony... I know it's not worth watching"
13 Commandments,Why can't you just accept a show people hate getting bad reviews? How much are they paying you?
13 Commandments,"The show is bad, tries way too hard to be hip, cool, and modern. This approach ruins some of the original magic, I mean Scooby-Doo isnt even in the damn show."
13 Commandments,"The IMDB and RT score isn’t a little surprising, it’s expected when the show is absolute ass. Just because it’s receiving horrendous reviews isn’t a reflection of toxic fans, it’s a reflection of poor writing and woke politics being thrown in our faces. I have no issue with female leads and a diverse cast, what I do have an issue with is dreadful writing and treating your viewers like morons. This show is reaping what is deserves and the audience is becoming sick and tired of fictional media playing the political game. We want to be entertained not lectured about how racist and non-inclusive we apparently are. Enough is enough"
13 Commandments,2.6? Talk about review inflation should be a 1/10.
13 Commandments,I highly doubt a contingent of Scooby-Doo fans are review bombing anything. This is just an expected negative reaction to a terriblele show.
13 Commandments,It’s just bad. They should focus more on actual show and make it interesting and funny instead of lame jokes and make this show as inclusive as possible.. ratings are deserved. Don’t waste your time.
13 Commandments,"You can't just say 'these adult cartoons have a high rating so my show is entitled to one as well"""
13 Commandments,"It may objectively not be a TERRIBLE show but when you take a beloved nostalgia property and add more than a heaping of self indulgence and vanity project-ness to it, it's never going to be received well by audiences. Rightly or wrongly, it's seen as Mindy Kaling getting her Velma cosplay on.

I also think we've reached a saturation point when it comes to reboots/remakes/reinventions. People want to see new and original properties made for today, not reinvent or ""hippify"" old properties or characters."
13 Commandments,"I hate race swap regardless of the show, the character and the franchise and I'm a black person. But I've learned to live with that and I don't consider it a deal breaker so I still gave this show a chance. I don't usually laugh with comedies but I still enjoy watching them since they're perfect to kill time. But despite don't usually laugh I've never, never, when I say never I mean not once in my entire life I have been bored with one, this is the first time I had to push myself to watch the entire episode.

Velma and Shaggy being black is just a minor issue when it is compared to the show itself being bad, so I might have a problem with them swapping their race but the truth is that they could have been white, black, Asian or fucking horses and the show would still be a huge pile of garbage."
13 Commandments,"I liked the artistic design and the animation, but the show itself relies way too heavily on gross-out/cringe humor and every character is massively unlikable, even Velma who we're supposed to sympathize with despite her casual cruelty to Norville and flash backs that show here causing her mother's eye to dislodge from its socket. It feels like one of those mid 2000s animated sitcoms like Drawn Together or Brickleberry and I didn't care for those either. It's not the worst incarnation of the series as I had a harder time sitting through Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue and certain episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, but it's not good."
13 Commandments,"Here's my question: 

How do you know when it's ""review bombing"" or when something is just actually very bad and people are just loudly expressing that fact?"
13 Commandments,Is this a joke?
13 Commandments,"So you had 3 points, but for 2 of them you say you can’t comment for differing reasons? So why even post? You contributed nothing and just end up looking like a WB bot. Yeah they’ve rebooted this show too many times, but does doing it again without the titular character actually help? Obviously not, that’s why no one likes this."
13 Commandments,"Idk it just doesn't look very good to me, but I also don't really care."
13 Commandments,"That show backfired just like this post did 🤣🤣 I don't know if OP is being satirical or truthful but God I hope OP is not really that dumb 🤣🤣 the show is literally nothing but racist backlash on a society that is tired of these elitist anti white racist attacks. I mean let's be real you're an idiot if you don't see the Democrats are trying to start a race war by sowing animosity through these attacks knowing that black people will lose..  Democrats have always fought to keep black people in chains from the civil war all the way up until the civil Rights movement. Wake up people, racism in any form is unacceptable, and we are going backwards.. Stop being puppets and attacking each other.. Fight the real enemy causing this woke retardation: Politicians."
13 Commandments,"I watched about 5 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. It's not just bad, it's offensively bad. Judging by the sheer amount of negative responses, also saying it's bad, you've received, the ""review bombing"" seems to accurately reflect how people feel about the show."
13 Commandments,Hey man it’s okay to enjoy shit shows. You like Velma that’s cool but it doesn’t change the fact that it is a complete and total dumpster. I feel insulted you compared it to the Harley Quinn cartoon show but that’s okay too. Opinions are like assholes everyone has one.
13 Commandments,"Wait what? it's absolute checkbox trash. it's GORY it's full of nudity, yet the jokes are written for toddlers. what kind of medication is required to enjoy this I can't imagine. When the synopsis makes fun of Fred for having a tiny pecker and assures you that will be a constant topic of conversation... I assume zero dollars were required to make this show? maybe that's the joke.

And you KNOW the critics bend over backwards to upvote every show they can that is politically where they want it, and only a 50% from critics lol. That is horrendously bad. Next you'll be telling us Blood Origins is a decent show? Misunderstood by the entire population of Earth?"
13 Commandments,False advertising. No dog.
13 Commandments,Because it’s dogshit lmao. It’s a pathetic attempt at being “meta” and falls flat on its face into a sea of cringe.
13 Commandments,I watched the first two episodes and was really looking forward to it. It's FUCKING. TERRIBLE.
13 Commandments,"OP gets told they’re wrong and then attacks commenters lol 

“Am I out of touch? No it’s the children who are wrong!”"
13 Commandments,"It is a really bad show. I watched the entire first episode and no more, even though I spent the next 15 minutes browsing the titles on different streaming services for something to watch. This despite watching all seasons of Never have I Ever which is another of Mindy’s shows and liking it"
13 Commandments,Sometimes a bad show is just a bad show
13 Commandments,I think this show is subjectively awful
13 Commandments,"Dude really? The show itself is overtly racist in horrible ways to most characters. The ""humor"" is actually just repulsive, the show was written with no love for the series it comes from, and it's just really off putting to most people.

Perhaps there are some bad actors review bombing just because of race swaps, but I'd argue anyone trying to excuse this trash fire is also a bad actor unwilling to understand why this show is so awful and off putting *to most people* probably because the characters were race swapped and some how something this terrible is supposed to be a win for poc.

This could of been literally anything else and it would have been received better and supported more by more people."
13 Commandments,"I watched Birdgirl and while it has a bit of cringe to it I thought it was several orders of magnitude funnier than this show. At the very least you can tell there is comedy competency behind the writing in Birdgirl, and any ""wokeness"" is at least self aware. There was an episode where a woman was erasing a guy's memories after sleeping with him and it was acknowledged in the show that that's still immoral AF even if it's a woman doing it. I don't think a ""hyper-woke"" show would have acknowledged that, they would've spun it as a victory against men or something. Velma is just a bad show with bad writing."
13 Commandments,I’m still trying to figure out how the Reddit hive mind thinks it’s ok to race swap white characters but if don’t want them to do that we’re racist. but it’s racist to race swap out non white characters. They should have just created a new ip if they were going to alter all the characters.
13 Commandments,The show is shit and I am allowed this opinion.
13 Commandments,"I don't care about the race of the characters or the switch to a more adult tone. Hell I don't even care that they call Shaggy Norville. Scooby Doo was always one of the worst cartoons on the air so I really couldn't give two shits about ""preserving the canon"" or whatever. 

So when I say I could barely sit through the first episode it's because of precisely one reason: It's the writing. The writing is bad. 

Saying the jokes are hit or miss is incredibly generous. It's a brand new show that feels dated. It has all of Kaling's worst writing habits put front and center with little to no self-awareness. 

If you're going to go meta and/or address social issues you need to avoid coming off as smug and /r/FellowKids material, and the show does both. I mean fuck, it takes a lot of bullshit to make me actively dislike something *I agree with.* But here we are. 

Having seen much of her work and read one of her books, I think it's fair to say that Kaling is best when she has other voices in the room to moderate some of her...less than stellar ideas. 

Tl;Dr: I don't give a shit about anything but the writing, and the writing is bad."
13 Commandments,"You're about correct, it's ridiculous it's at 2.6/10. No person with half a brain cell would give it more that 1 at best lmao. And if you disagree with that you're a brainless turd!"
13 Commandments,Aw shit here we go again
13 Commandments,Why is it so hard for people to believe that the show actually sucks? So what if you like it… Most of us don’t. And it’s not because we’re racist or homophobe the writing was seriously lame. I can tell a lot of work and thought was put into the show and it still sucked it just shows what a lack of creativity and imagination the Showrunners have
13 Commandments,"Its a bad show that no fan of scooby doo would ask for, its fine if you like it but that just means you have bad taste"
13 Commandments,"Sure, just call everyone who dislikes the show racist."
13 Commandments,">currently sitting at a 2.6/10 on IMDB

There are only 270 votes on imdb, if it doesn't bounce back from that then it's not a good show

After more people watch it then it will easily go back to where it deserves, unless very few people watch it"
13 Commandments,"This is person is like the guy that made Bro. Its racist or homophobic to not like something.

its a cartoon show. Why does everything have to broken down to this level. 

You enjoyed it. great! If more people like it will get renewed.

To you the only reason for a low score is because of  ""race swapping"" or ""edgy humor not being funny"" 

how much you want to bet that its the latter. you only give it a 6/10 and you don't find it funny. Do you think you are doing what you claim others are doing but in reverse? Blasting people for not like something you only speak up about because of the same reason."
13 Commandments,I wish they would get my name off of this disaster. I am a serious documentary film maker like the other guy on Bill and Ted's. I am a serious artist that would never touch this. Unless it's for a Scooby Snack. I'll suck \*\*\*\* for a Scooby Snack.
13 Commandments,If the trailer was any indication I’m not surprised in the slightest. It looks absolutely horrible.
13 Commandments,Haven’t seen this yet but Harley Quinn is one of my favorite shows on tv. Are you saying this is on the same level?
13 Commandments,Do you suppose this has anything to do with the low ratings? https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/10ad13e/anon_asks_about_velma/
13 Commandments,"It may not be good television, but the rule 34 continent is going to be fire"
13 Commandments,"I've only seen the trailers & few clips and I don't get the hate. Not that I think it looks good, just so lack luster it doesn't seem worth getting upset over it."
13 Commandments,"The show is racist af, they portray Hispanics in the most stereotypical ways possible yet black and Asian characters are “smart/nerdy” or cool"
13 Commandments,"6/10 for this is too funny, might be funnier than any joke on the show"
13 Commandments,"Damn son, how many edits/updates to your post are you gonna make?  You’re more invested in this show than HBO is at this point"
13 Commandments,Even the deaf and blind would (and do) realize this show sucks. What does that mean for you? This show has near zero redeemable qualities and SCREAMS ‘older millennials making anti woke jokes’ and its so telling because Mindy was a lead on this. Shes peak annoying old millennial with a chip on her shoulder. And im a millennial. This show is embarrassing and terrible.
13 Commandments,I’m watching the first episode right now and it is absurdly ass.
13 Commandments,"It's not review bombing. Captain marvel was review bombing, this is just a horrible, HORRIBLE show.
The race swapping isn't even an issue, it's the introduction of character flaws that were never there to begin with."
13 Commandments,"Changing race isnt an issue, but when you change every single discernible detail about those characters, why are we even relating the two? Brand recognition. Thats why. They wanted to make a show like this first, but had no real faith in the final product, so they attached it to an existing property.

Its all about money and nothing else, hit all the keywords the kids like, cause some controversy for headlines, cash out, bail. 

If they had not called it scooby doo, i dont think people would even given a shit. It would have been on noones radar."
13 Commandments,"I mean, there's no objective reason to have whatever the fuck a Norville is over Shaggy and Scooby, you know, the two most iconic characters from Scooby-Doo.

>Man some of you guys really are triggered by edgy comedy and multi racial casts. I apologise for triggering your impotent rage with a 6/10 rating.

Alright, OP is definitely trolling."
13 Commandments,"The show sucks, end of story."
13 Commandments,"your opinion is trash and so is the show, may god bless your two remainining brain cells."
13 Commandments,"I'd agree if it was a good show, but nah it's just bad. Lazy writing, mean spirited, and unclever. It's not funny. It'll flop and die.

I'm speaking as someone who loves edgy shit. Love Rick and Morty, love Boondocks, South Park love It's Always Sunny. Was excited to see Dennis' actor was attached to this, but it just kinda sucks. I'm busy, and don't have time to watch things that don't bring me joy. But this is just soulless."
13 Commandments,Mindy Kailing has never been funny. Every scene with her from The Office is completely skippable without any loss of jokes per minute.
13 Commandments,"Maybe people are plain sick of the pseudo-religious woke crap and how almost every issue is being turned into some life or death emotional blowout. Also, nice strawman argument/red herring, OP. Perfect example of what I mean. How you've managed to turn disliking or liking a TV show into an issue of morality is beyond me. Maybe lay off the emotions."
13 Commandments,I bet you're that one person in your group friend who everyone secretly hate cause you whine about everything pc. Fucking joke of an OP

The A List,"Although, as someone that just rewatched the movie, and has seen all of the actors recently as well, they aged really well."
The A List,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
The A List,[deleted]
The A List,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
The A List,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
The A List,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
The A List,Times change.
The A List,[deleted]
The A List,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."

The A List,"There is a hilarious jump scare in like the final 10 seconds of the pilot for ""Secrets of a Small Town"". I have no idea if it would have actually aired like that or if it was just put in to get the attention of the executives watching it."
The A List,"I hadn’t heard about this wave of unreleased pilots but I’m curious, particularly about the Brave New World one.  I’ll have to check it out later tonight.

Edit: oh. “. The single-camera project, from Sony Pictures TV, is a workplace comedy that follows a group of unusual characters at Pilgrim Village, a theme park that specializes in recreations…”. .  I thought I was getting into some Aldous Huxley goodness."
The A List,"There's a whole subreddit for stuff like this. It's pretty dead, but they'd love to see this. I think it's /r/ripilots"
The A List,"Gilded Lilys  
(US Version Of Downton Abbey)

It was surprisingly good. After watching I'd have happily binged a few more episodes. 

Great actors, decent story, so maybe the problem was the budget?"
The A List,I watched the IT crowd it was an American version. Some scenes were identical.
The A List,"“Taxman”: Awful awful sitcom based in an IRS office in Iowa. I couldn’t finish it (and it’s only 20 minutes long). Martin Short plays the head of the department. Lead actor tries, but the material is bad. There’s some North Korean character with a bad accent and a bad wig. Yikes! Also, two sidekicks who refuse to answer the phone who are more interesting than the rest of the show. 

Also features Kerry Kinney and Orlando Jones. Actually has an IMDb page if you want to read more. 

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1619883/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_t_1"
The A List,"Holy shit, this is awesome. I remember some of these, like Saint Francis, which is a comedy starring Michael Imperioli and Paget Brewster.

The writing is painfully terrible."
The A List,"To be totally fair a lot of pilots are meant as more like ""give us money so we can make a better show"", so the cheap feeling might've gone away if the show had actually gotten picked up."
The A List,"The first 5 minutes of the 1%, holy shit."
The A List,"No sign of JJ Abrams pilot ""The Catch"". I remember reading about it in Lost/Alias trivia, it's never surfaced."
The A List,"“The Way” is another witchcraft-centered pilot with some pretty big names. Jane Alexander, Peter Strauss, Andrew McCarthy, all slumming it in some corporate intrigue nighttime soap opera where rival corporations are owned by different families of actual witches. Weird concept. Felt very ABC but actually appears to be a Paramount/Sony coproduction? Not sure where the fad came from that every show needed to be about witches."
The A List,"Big Thunder is such a bizarre concept for a TV series. Haunted Mansion is a Disney attraction that’s better suited for a serialized format.

What was up with all the Under Suspicion episodes being included?

Also: did anyone watch Babylon Fields?"
The A List,"“Life On The Hill”: not too bad for a sitcom. Surprised it didn’t get picked up (though hopefully they would have dumped the voiceover).

Wendy Malick plays a Nancy Pelosi like figure on Capitol Hill, and Mark Moses from Desperate Housewives is her foil from across the aisle. Plot is focused mostly on the misadventures of the younger subordinates who try to keep things working in her office. Think Spin City meats HIMYM. Also features Michelle Trachtenberg of Buffy fame. Humor could have been just a touch more cynical. Fun potential for additional humorous caricatures of lobbyists, senators, etc. as the show went on."
The A List,"Oh my fuck lol I just watched the first 5 mintues of ""welcome to the jungle gym"" and its some crazy shit"
The A List,"I was hoping to see [Day One](https://www.cancelledscifi.com/2021/12/18/cancelled-before-it-began-day-one-2010/) on the list, but it looks like that pilot was buried really deep."
The A List,"""Wright vs Wrong"" - Deborah Messing attempting to make a conservative pundit that's funny and, likely, relatable?  I dunno. She comes across like Grace's right-wing sister if I'm being honest. Carrie Fisher (RIP) plays her manager and tries to keep things peppy.

Maybe it's the last few years but the jokes alternate between hollow sounding and just not landing."
The A List,"I watched Drew - it was pretty good.



I also watched ""Untitled Liz Meriwether Project"" - it had potential, but felt a lot like it would've been cancelled after 13 episodes."
The A List,"“Transylvania Rising”: Gets better as it goes along. Feels a bit like “Once Upon A Time” but with monsters like Dracula and the Wolfman. Kind of fun, and has a mystery element woven in. Needed a better show name."
The A List,"I remember watching the Salem Rogers one years ago. Amazon released like 3 different pilots and allowed everyone to vote on which got picked up.

Salem Rogers was my favorite, but didn't make the cut. I thought it was hilarious and have a copy saved."
The A List,"I liked Friend Me, shame what happened to the creator. RIP"
The A List,"“The Coven”: A bad Charmed knock off. Has some good actors in it, including Illyana Douglass. But the show is very CW paint by numbers. Stuff like this makes me think of all the hard working people in Hollywood who get so excited when they land a pilot. You never know if it’s going to be a hit or not."
The A List,"I tried watching Friend Me, but it was so not good. I made it less than halfway through it. It was like the worst ""typical"" sitcom, the humor wasn't funny at all."
The A List,Sarah Shahi staring in 'Drew' now I shall have another show to be angry about it never seeing the light of day.
The A List,Oh no I completely missed this. Does anyone have some of the pilots saved and a list of the pilots that were on there?
The A List,noticed that Nicholas Braun (cousin greg succession) was a lead in one of the shows.
The A List,Are these upcoming and  new tv series?
The A List,The Adam West pilot where he's a tv detective who tries to solve real crime looked good. And there was a pilot where Jack Black had a talking motorcycle voiced by Owen Wilson.
The A List,"“1%”: Motorcycle gang meth cartel. I think it was trying to be “motorcycle gang Sopranos” but it’s just bad. Everyone needs to take a shower and wash their hair. Lots of motorcycles. Lots of idiocy. I can see why HBO passed on this one. Written by the guy who brought us “Deep Impact” and the Miles Teller Godfather mini series. 

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1218981/?ref_=nm_flmg_i_4_prd"
The A List,"Watched some more of these this week:

“Skip Tracer”
A surprisingly dull detective show with Stephen Dorff. Tries to be a modern “Rockford Files” vibe, but needed a lot more work. 

“Who gets the Parents”
This one had potential. Good concept. I’m surprised it wasn’t retooled and picked up. Only misstep was that every set looks like a freaking rich person mansion. Actors playing the parents did fine, but I’m honestly shocked Tim Allen didn’t get inserted into the male lead role. It feels written for his style of humor. Always nice to see Lindsay Price in anything. I feel like she’s never gotten the success she deserves since she was even decent in the US remake of Coupling. 

“Wright vs Wrong”
Not very good sitcom about a conservative pundit. Not surprised it was scrapped. Looks like it was designed as a post-Will-and-Grace vehicle for a very skinny Debra Messing. She actually does a respectable job of breaking out of her previous character and inheriting this one, the concept is just kinda flat and obvious. Also stars Cheryl Hines (of Curb Your Enthusiasm fame) and CARRIE FREAKING FISHER. What the hell is she doing in this? I wouldn’t be surprised if they begged her to be the show’s script doctor after this. She steals every scene as Messing’s agent. What a waste of talent. 

“After Party”
Jay Z tries to reinvent In Living Color and MadTV. Really unfunny and a lot of the skits went on too long and were in poor taste (which would be fine if they had been funny). Couldn’t finish it. Features a young Eric Andre."
The A List,That's so random lmao. You can tell they just upped the volume of the scream for like a second and that was it.
The A List,"Even after reading this, that jump scare still got me a bit."
The A List,I'll be checking this one as well. I grabbed these as soon as I saw they were uploaded. Never know how long they'll be up.
The A List,There is a Brave New World show on Netflix which is an adaptation of the book.
The A List,Sounds like it could be based on a George Saunders short story!
The A List,I could definitely see ABC passing because of the budget. It kind of doesn't make sense since why make the pilot anyway if the budget was ultimately going to be an issue?
The A List,I didn't see IT Crowd on the list. Is it It Takes a Village?
The A List,"Super interesting... David Krumholtz is great in pretty much everything else I've seen him in. And Randall Park (North Korean) really blew up in the years after this. 

...also it was directed by Fred Savage? The kid from The Wonder Years."
The A List,"I adore both of those actors so I had to check it out, this show is a FEVER DREAM. I can't even process what I'm seeing. But I also can't look away..."
The A List,"This is very true. I have a feeling that the leak I watched was not the complete product though, as if it was leaked in post-production without being 100% done to show to executives."
The A List,Losing a Lucy Punch and Kim Dickens show is a real punch in the dick
The A List,"Supernatural romance needs to rotate through different monsters to stay fresh. I’m hoping we get Sexy Frankensteins soon, although maybe we already did in *Penny Dreadful.*"
The A List,"The actual premise of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is that an old west town of gold miners built their town on a cursed Indian burial ground and now the spirits of nature are haunting the village, which drove out the miners from the area and has resulted in an insane haunted mine train that's possessed by ghosts. I know that sounds insane, but it's the actual premise.

I like in Disneyland Paris they tied Thunder Mountain in with Phantom Manor - that many of the ghosts in Phantom Manor are the ghosts of people from the Big Thunder village who died, and part of the backstory involves some big mining tycoon whose business was ruined by the nature spirits destroying the mining town?"
The A List,Did you watch the Big Thunder pilot? The whole thing felt off and unfinished but that could be just the nature of the leak (such as what the potential advertisers saw was probably more refined).
The A List,I think they eventually took the story and turned it into a comic book. Disney had Marvel make a few comics based on rides and other theme park IP like Figment.
The A List,"Oh man, I’ll watch Wendie Malick in anything! 

Taking note to check this one out."
The A List,holy crap I remember that
The A List,Putting Xander Berkeley off to the side while blank face Twink is centrered in the cast photo. It deserves its fate I don't even need to see it.
The A List,They are test shows that were filmed years ago and never picked up.
The A List,"In the US, I think it’s on Peacock."
The A List,"No shit?  I’m surprise I missed that.  Was it well received/ well done?

Edit:  google says not so much, but I’m still going to check it out for myself"
The A List,It's not in this list but [here it is](https://archive.org/details/the-it-crowd-us-pilot)
The A List,Fred Savage directs a lot of It’s Always Sunny episodes
The A List,"Yeah the reviews were not great, so I didn't bother. But shows with this sort of subject matter can still be interesting even if they're not well received."
The A List,"It's watchable. But Joel McHale as Roy is something else, and this not getting picked up was a blessing for Community. Also, Jessica's reads towards the end were word for word the British pilot and she couldn't deliver Nearly the same quality"
The A List,"Eh, it had it's moments. The main interesting thing about that was that Grant Morrison (heady comic book author) was one of the writers. The show didn't end up coming together as well as they'd hoped, but they did have a lot of ideas to bring to the table. I dunno. I'm not sorry I watched it the once."
The A List,"i was tempted to watch it, but now that I know joel mchale is roy I have to watch it immediately! my lord that sounds hiraliously bad."
The A List,Fully agree with you.
The A List,"Surprised it took this long to commit to renewal. 

Now please turn on some more set lights and take the sunglasses filter off the camera."
The A List,"Prequel series? Meh

Taylor Kitsch? Fuck yeah"
The A List,amazon really cornering the market on big ip budget shows and military/cop/spy shows for dads
The A List,"""I got you, brother!"""
The A List,"I had very low expectations going into this show, in part due to the terrible reviews ... but I really enjoyed it.

Happy to see more coming.  Kitsch was really good in it, too."
The A List,Really loved season 1 so I am exited for this.  It can be tough for these action thriller type shows to successfully pull off multiple seasons (see Jack Ryan for details)..... so we will see how it goes.  Hopefully it can have a Strike Back type of run.
The A List,"Makes sense now why Kitsch took the role as second fiddle, because they probably promised him his own show if S1 went well."
The A List,"People may shit on me for saying this but I actually thought this show was good and this show is easily the best acting I’ve seen from Pratt. I didn’t think he would be able to pull off a darker character like this but I was wrong.

These types of shows are Amazon’s bread and butter."
The A List,"I’m all for this, I always thought Kitsch’s character could have used a bit more screen time in the first season."
The A List,"I quite enjoyed the first season, but the story should have ended there, and that prequel sounds even less exciting.

>!So the list is done and he's no longer terminal. What a great premise for a sequel! And the guy that betrayed all his brothers, let's make a new show all about him.!<"
The A List,Taylor Kitsch also know as box office poison. Staying on the small screen is good for him
The A List,r/television will not like this news
The A List,"I haven’t seen it yet.  Heard it was something I’d enjoy.


Maybe I’ll start it soon"
The A List,Thank god. Great news for once. Loved this show. The action scenes were soo clean
The Good Bandit,"Will watch because: Chris O'Dowd

Still hoping for another IT Crowd reunion"
The Good Bandit,If you like O'Dowd give Moone Boy a watch.
The Good Bandit,"This is so exciting!! The pilot was actually filmed in my hometown almost a year ago and I got to be an extra on it. I hope I can see myself in the episode! (It look place at a carnival so I’ll be on the lookout for that scene)

Edit: At the time it was called [Zoltar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8548836/) and was supposed to take place in the same universe as Tom Hanks’ “Big”."
The Good Bandit,Looking forward to it. Apple has been giving me a lot of hits lately
The Good Bandit,OP seems to only post about Apple+ content.
The Good Bandit,"Shrinking has been amazing too, Apple has some hits already"
The Good Bandit,I love that this show doesn’t premiere for 2 weeks but a dislike for the show in the article is that the season ends abruptly.
The Good Bandit,"“A small town is forever changed when a mysterious machine appears, promising to reveal everyone's true potential”

The premise makes me think of the video game Control. An Altered World Event with the “mysterious machine” being an Altered Item or Object of Power."
The Good Bandit,The Good Place was thought-provoking ? I enjoyed it but i might have missed something.
The Good Bandit,To be fair The Good Place wasn't exactly thought provoking.
The Good Bandit,well that’s a low bar
The Good Bandit,Good place was thought provoking?
The Good Bandit,"I see y’all have never seen Xavier Renegade Angel smh. Renegade Angels, arise up!"
The Good Bandit,"glad reviews coming in positive, the trailer wasn't the best but looks like it's worth checking out."
The Good Bandit,Another Apple TV banger? Sign me up
The Good Bandit,Anyone who feels similar better have watched Get Shorty. He was *fantastic* in that.
The Good Bandit,“a fire….. at a sea parks…?”
The Good Bandit,Heard that’s unable to happen due to a fire…..in sea parks?!
The Good Bandit,Have you tried turning it off and on again?
The Good Bandit,Anyone with kids who likes him should watch Puffin Rock on Netflix. It’s delightful.
The Good Bandit,Might be tricky given the show's creator being politically controversial.
The Good Bandit,Another? Did they do one that I missed?
The Good Bandit,Saw on IMDB he’s credited for 1 episode… despite being on the poster and heavily featured in the trailer 🤔🤔they better not be baiting and switching
The Good Bandit,"Oh nice, I was just looking at the cast and thought I didn't know anybody."
The Good Bandit,"Oh man, how good was the IT crowd?

I think the girl with glasses has a new Netflix show 
Cunk on earth 

Anyone seen it?"
The Good Bandit,Agreed I will give anything with him in it a go. Would kill for IT reunion.
The Good Bandit,"Phenomenal show! They were supposed to be making a US version of it, which I didn't see any way to make work."
The Good Bandit,The description there on IMDb doesn't match with the premise described in the article though.
The Good Bandit,Hey I was an extra on it too! I worked on it for a lot of the filming days and I even saw myself in this trailer! Catch me sitting in Chris O’Dowd’s classroom (to Jacob’s right)
The Good Bandit,What are your favorites?
The Good Bandit,Marketing departments don't do subtle anymore...
The Good Bandit,"That's true but his posts include [AppleTV+ becomes a joke on SNL](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/10ub2ix/appletv_becomes_a_joke_on_snl/), [Liaison's first reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/10yskwl/liaisons_first_reviews/) with two links total and both to negative reviews, and [Apple TV+ growth has 'flat-lined' as users say service lacks value](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/11937w9/apple_tv_growth_has_flatlined_as_users_say/). There are a few other negative threads. Most others are just updates, announcements, and discussion threads related to Apple TV+.

So my impression is that he... is really into Apple TV+ and likes discussing it on Reddit?"
The Good Bandit,"During HOTD airing, i always talk about it. I must paid too then. LOL"
The Good Bandit,"Unfortunately I still don't get paid to watch TV and discuss this on Reddit.Yes, I like what Apple has done, but I'm one of the most critical of them (see the TVPlus sub; applefans tend to hate me). But if Tim Cook is around and wants to pay me to spread the word, please call me."
The Good Bandit,Could it be that’s all they have?
The Good Bandit,Ohhh
The Good Bandit,Check out Hello Tomorrow
The Good Bandit,They have been filming season 2 for a while now. It continues exactly where the finale ends. They seem to be very confident in this show’s success.
The Good Bandit,"You mean the show who’s entire premise revolves around the afterlife, theology and philosophy? Think you might be confusing it for a different show?"
The Good Bandit,I thought it explored a lot of philosophical concepts quite well.
The Good Bandit,Found the Jason Mandoza in the thread.
The Good Bandit,Don’t know what you’re talking about. It constantly brought up philosophical questions and moral dilemmas.
The Good Bandit,"> To be fair The Good Place wasn't exactly thought provoking.

name me any other broadcast network sitcom that gave in-depth philosophy lesson"
The Good Bandit,"I disagree, but you do you"
The Good Bandit,Seems this person didn’t have the requisite equipment for thoughts to be provoked…
The Good Bandit,Yes
The Good Bandit,"Yeah, that was weird watching ""Roy"" as a tough guy hitman.  But he *is* an actor, after all."
The Good Bandit,Does it end in a cliffhanger? I know it got cancelled.
The Good Bandit,"“What are you doing?”



“Watching porn”"
The Good Bandit,"Heh, well there is a very real reason why it probably won't happen."
The Good Bandit,Did you see that ludacris display last night?
The Good Bandit,I’m disabled!
The Good Bandit,"It really is. My boys used to watch that when they were little and I recognised the voice, made me sit down and watch with them."
The Good Bandit,"> politically controversial

Or in other words for his case, an utter cunt."
The Good Bandit,"yeeeeeaaaaahhhh... gonna steer clear of that, except to say that I still want an IT Crowd reunion"
The Good Bandit,"Oh no.

I just looked it up. What a gross dude."
The Good Bandit,Would be cool if they could make one without him.
The Good Bandit,"I guess, technically, ""The Internet Is Coming"" is the series finale"
The Good Bandit,Sometimes IMDb only credits people for episodes that have aired.
The Good Bandit,"After Moone Boy and Derry Girls I think the Irish are the only people that can get 90s nostalgia right. Maybe because the Good Friday Agreement is such a definitive point in their history.

The episode where he really wants a Megadrive felt like it was ripped from my memories."
The Good Bandit,"These two are very different shows, in terms of listed creator, plot, and even main character age. The name Deerfield is the only thing linking them as far as I can tell, but Big Door Prize is based on a book so there’s no logical way they shifted an original story into something they would have needed to secure the film rights for in advance, I think the original commenter is just a bit mixed up?"
The Good Bandit,Oh I know. I think when they pitched it to Apple they had to workshop a lot of the concepts scrapped the idea of it taking place in the same universe as Big. But I do specifically remember Chris O Dowd being on set and it taking place in a town called Deerfield much like where Big Door Proze takes place. It is also worth noting just this month they rebuilt the same set complete with the words “Deerfield” written all over it. So my best guess is they are either doing some reshoots or even gearing up for a season 2?
The Good Bandit,"Severance 

Ted lasso

Shrinking

Mythic quest

Physical

Central Park

Calls

The after party

Schmigadoon

Mr. Corman

The shrink next door

Roar"
The Good Bandit,"Slow. Fuckin. Horses. Such a fun, well written spy show with wonderful performances and tight plotting. My second favorite apple show behind severance. I binged both seasons in a week."
The Good Bandit,Severance fucking slaps.
The Good Bandit,For All Mankind
The Good Bandit,Plenty of shills do it for free
The Good Bandit,He tooks his doctors advice too seriously
The Good Bandit,*Shill* + **Marketing Department** there are NO other explanations. ^/s
The Good Bandit,You post in other subs about other stuff though. Op only posts about Apple+ stuff in TV threads. That's weird.
The Good Bandit,It's possible.
The Good Bandit,Haven’t heard favourable reviews for that. Do you recommend it?
The Good Bandit,Nice you like it? The premise seems cool and I like that actor a lot but wasn’t sure if it had the legs to be interesting for a whole season or more
The Good Bandit,"Nah i’m just dumber than you guys, sorry"
The Good Bandit,I guess it’s less thought-provoking if you do not believe in the afterlife and if you believe religions are one of the worst things that happened to mankind.
The Good Bandit,You’re not alone it was absolutely deeper than the surface level masturbation jokes.. and that’s what made it good.
The Good Bandit,The peeps chili was deep.
The Good Bandit,Bortles!!!!!
The Good Bandit,that’s not synonymous with thought provoking necessarily
The Good Bandit,"What in-depth philosophical lesson did you learn from The Good Place? 

Genuine question, I'm glad it meant something to you. I clearly wasn't part of the target audience, so I'm interested to hear your point of view."
The Good Bandit,"A downvote is to be expected, but a personal insult over the content of a TV show is a little gauche. 

I merely found the pseudo ecclesiastical theorising a little on the nose, the conundrums and indeed the consequences equally blunt and the moralising eventually became predictable. 

Sure it started off fun, and the casting was good, but the stretching of a one series concept just weakened the 'thought provoking' from the obvious to the mildly dull. 

But I'm glad you enjoyed it and my thoughts on the show are in no way meant to attempt to diminish that enjoyment or to insult you. After all, that is exactly why so many shows are produced, and that can only be a good thing if we all find something we like."
The Good Bandit,"It does end open-ended and they clearly left it open for more possible seasons, but I remember the conclusion being satisfactory. It wasn't a big cliffhanger or the like, so I doubt it'd spoil your viewing experience. Don't let it stop you!"
The Good Bandit,"For people out of the loop:

Graham Linehan, the shows creator went off the fucking deep end arguing with trans people on twitter as JK Rowling did but without him being a billionaire, which he admits ""consumed my life"" to such a point that he started embracing anti-vax and anti-climate change points of view because the only people still agreeing with him held those views too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Linehan#Anti-transgender_activism

It got so bad that he vowed never to work with Channel 4 ever again, who broadcast his 3 major shows (Black Books, Father Ted and IT Show) because they took down 1 episode of the IT Show due to its trans storyline, and then vowed never to work with the BBC because they had a lesbian couple with a trans person in some kids show.

So he pretty much burned his relationship with 90% of the UK market for his type of work and made sure the other 10% was very unlikely to touch him, leaving him with his twitter rants and trying to influence foreign elections in favour of nutcase anti-trans candidates like he did with the 2022 Australian federal election in which he thought Australians would care who he thought they should vote for."
The Good Bandit,Sports!
The Good Bandit,Leg disabled!
The Good Bandit,"I mean, that's fair. Fun show."
The Good Bandit,And a Travel Man ep
The Good Bandit,Show doesn’t premier until the 29th and many cast members credited with 10 episodes.
The Good Bandit,"It seems like this show [might have used ""Zoltar"" as a codename](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/02/14/apple-tv-transforms-town-for-zoltar-like-comedy-big-door-prize), which could be creating the confusion between this and the supposed show set in the Big universe."
The Good Bandit,You are the only other person than me that watched Calls!  That was a really interesting concept.
The Good Bandit,For All Mankind? Surely you meant to list that one as well?
The Good Bandit,"Honestly, Dickinson is criminally slept on."
The Good Bandit,Bad Sisters is really fun if you haven’t checked it out yet!1
The Good Bandit,What about Trying?
The Good Bandit,No Foundation?
The Good Bandit,Gotta throw Hello Tomorrow in there
The Good Bandit,Acapulco!
The Good Bandit,"Looks like someone still needs to watch Trying, Servant and For All Mankind! Honestly my top three Apple shows I think. You have goodness yet to come."
The Good Bandit,Prehistoric Planet... WeCrashed... The Essex Serpent...
The Good Bandit,"Seriously. Apple TV+ is our most watched streaming service. I canceled HBOMax. Soon will be Netflix I think, my shows are dwindling on Netflix. 

Did you watch Foundation? It’s fun. Not as good as the books, but it was just season one, I’m hopeful season two will be even better, even though I enjoyed the first season quite a bit."
Styling Hollywood,HBO’s The Comeback and Starz’s Party Down has a bit of that. A VEEP style show about an A list celeb would be incredible!
Styling Hollywood,"Episodes with Matt Leblanc was pretty spot on I think. He plays himself, over the top."
Styling Hollywood,"Larry Sanders, The Comeback, there are lots."
Styling Hollywood,Bojack Horseman
Styling Hollywood,Extras
Styling Hollywood,"*Action*, starring Jay Mohr"
Styling Hollywood,Curb Your Enthusiasm is basically that I feel
Styling Hollywood,30 rock hits on this theme (although NYC instead of Hollywood.)
Styling Hollywood,The Comeback! So funny. Lisa Kudrow is a genius.
Styling Hollywood,"Episodes is good. Hollywood Darlings is another, if you want to watch something not entirely about set life."
Styling Hollywood,"There's always Entourage.

First 3 seasons were great!"
Styling Hollywood,"Entourage, The Comeback, Episodes, Project Greenlight (interesting show), to some extent--Curb Your Enthusiasm and Barry.   There is also 30 ROCK and Great News.

The KOMINSKY Method is a really fun show too.

Do shows set in NYC but about ""Hollywood/TV/Movies/Celebrities"" etc work?    If so there is a clever new show called The Other Two on Comedy Central."
Styling Hollywood,Ever see Jay Mohr's *Action?*
Styling Hollywood,"Years ago Comedy Central had limited series called project Greenlight or project Searchlight starring Denis Leary. He got most of the guys from his show The Job as well as a bunch of Comedians and a lot of character actors to be in it. It's about him essentially playing a version of himself trying to make a tv show about Jesus and about all the ways it goes wrong. It was the funniest damn thing I've ever seen I mean it was basically Veep meets BoJack Horseman. It was about four episodes long and it also starred the late great Patrice O'Neal. I've only found green versions of it and some great dark corners of the interwebs. But if you can find it and you have a few hours to kill, it is hilarious."
Styling Hollywood,Was just having this conversation with a friend.
Styling Hollywood,The Comeback. Best show ever.
Styling Hollywood,"Bojack Horseman, Episodes, Curb your enthusiasm."
Styling Hollywood,It would be worthless without multiple real celebrities starring in it as themselves and agreeing to a false narrative.
Styling Hollywood,Try Flack w/Anna Paquin
Styling Hollywood,The Boys kind of does this because the superheroes are pretty much celebrities in that universe.
Styling Hollywood,"Most shows about showbusiness suck. 

Seinfeld is an exception. Fine."
Styling Hollywood,"Episodes is pretty close to that, although the quality is not on the same level as Veep."
Styling Hollywood,"The Comeback is so great, recently watched it for the first time and hope we get a Season 3 in the next few years kind of like how Season 2 was like 10 years after the first. Even thought season 2’s ending was pretty perfect."
Styling Hollywood,I just started watching season 1 of the The Comeback an am enjoying it.   I have also seen Party Down.   Enterouge is a show that is what the person wants.
Styling Hollywood,Larry Sanders was the first thing that came to mind. Curb is kinda like this as well.
Styling Hollywood,"OP said Hollywood, not Hollywoo. ^(Upvoted anyway.)"
Styling Hollywood,I agree some what but compared to VEEP there's a lot less anger. Bojack is shitty but knows he's shitty and cares how shitty he is and wants to get better. PC almost has enough when she's maneuvering Diane's book into a movie or getting Bojack hooked on opiods but in front it's tongue twisters and animal puns where there should be rage and ego.
Styling Hollywood,Op said comedy. Bojack stopped even pretending to try and be a comedy seasons ago.
Styling Hollywood,Right? Only like four episodes aired though.
Styling Hollywood,My Caucasian
Styling Hollywood,[deleted]
Styling Hollywood,It is not as fast paced with the dialogue but Episodes is a great laugh and Matt LeBlanc kills it by skewering himself constantly.  I agree not on the same level but it's not that far behind imo.
Styling Hollywood,"> The Comeback,

whats is the story about??"
Styling Hollywood,It's Hollywoob!
Styling Hollywood,then you're not looking or listening closely enough.  there are a ton of jokes each episode.
Styling Hollywood,Uh it was always a blend of comedy and drama
Styling Hollywood,Dialogues are super funny and witty. Pay attention to anything coming out of Princess Carolyn mouth and you'll laugh.
Styling Hollywood,The entire season aired on  Friday nights and I think they got some buzz and I guess some of the Jewish jokes were a little too on-the-nose and some of the veiled stuff against Harvey Weinstein was also a little too on-the-nose. But oh my gosh that show was ahead of its time. It had veep style and arrested development style humor years before those shows ever came out.
Styling Hollywood,Oh yeeah!
Styling Hollywood,"Lisa Kudrow plays a actress who was the star of a 90’s sitcom, who is trying to have her “comeback.” It’s a mockumentary, with the camera crew following her as she gets a role on this new show. And the camera crew is documenting her comeback for a reality show actually called The Comeback.

Then season 2 is like 10 years later, and kind of deals with how popular reality shows are in 2014 compared to when they first tried in 2005. 

Lisa is amazing and all of the characters are pretty funny within the show."
Styling Hollywood,"^(Yeah, but like: spoiler!)"
Styling Hollywood,thanks
Styling Hollywood,"If Hollywoob is a spoiler, Hollywoo is also a spoiler."
Styling Hollywood,"...not really. ""Woo"" happens in season 1; ""woob"" is from the latest and final batch of episodes."
Styling Hollywood,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
Styling Hollywood,[deleted]
Styling Hollywood,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
Styling Hollywood,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
Styling Hollywood,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
Styling Hollywood,Times change.
Styling Hollywood,[deleted]
Styling Hollywood,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."
Styling Hollywood,I love when I come across Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood in their early days.  Redford was the best Angel of Death Ever (Twilight Zone).
Styling Hollywood,"> I kind of feel that the perspective that The Sopranos invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens

100%. It irks me every time I hear it."
Styling Hollywood,"I'd like to think that after the series finale James and Miles travelled from small town to small town hunting ghosts, conning cons, and buddy-copping their way to success.

Call it ""Bonjour LaFleur""."
Styling Hollywood,"Damn. I would have watched that in a heartbeat. Miles and Sawyer were some of my favorite characters in the show. 

And Leung is so underrated as an actor."
Styling Hollywood,"I'll see you in another life, brothah."
Styling Hollywood,His character’s argument with Hurley about time travel was my favourite part of the whole series.
Styling Hollywood,"I’m honestly a little shocked that they left that franchise alone. No spin-offs, no prequels, no sequels. Just one classic series standing on its own."
Styling Hollywood,"I would have watched the shit out of that. 


Still would"
Styling Hollywood,"It amazes me that even to this day, every LOST thread will have people claiming ""they were dead and in purgatory"" the whole time. Not only do people say this, but they say it with such confidence.

It's not even like it's a matter of whether or not you understand the ending. This idea was directly refuted with a line of dialogue in the finale...in the most important scene! I guess these people just weren't paying attention...to the most important scene of the finale?!?!?!

Seriously, WTF people?"
Styling Hollywood,Always remember him from Rush Hour
Styling Hollywood,This reminds me of the comedy drama about two retired spies/assassins that we almost got starring Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson. Still wish that could've been a thing
Styling Hollywood,"Horseshit, but I would have watched the crap out of that show.

And he's right about the Asian stereotyping.

Unfortunately, he'll have to wait until the boomers start dying for the Calgon horseshit to truly end.

The boys had a pretty good joke about it. 

""Soldier Boy: Where's the Chop Socky Oriental sauce?   
  
Hughie: They don't have that anymore  
  
Soldier Boy: Why the fuck not?   
  
Hughie: Uh, many... many good reasons""

It was just casual and accepted, ""haha, hollywood is racist!""

The Hawaii 5-0 shit was jaw dropping. Treating them like half a person. As if stupid vampire show man and nepotism hire were actually worth more than the two people who carried the show.   


Poor Grace Park had to sell bing like her life depended on it."
Styling Hollywood,Wonder how this show holds up on a rewatch. Blew me away when it aired.
Styling Hollywood,LOST SEQUEL WHEN!? Come on D+ give us what we want!
Styling Hollywood,Why are his characters always pissed off?
Styling Hollywood,###Maybe include Sayid.
Styling Hollywood,That would have been awesome.
Styling Hollywood,Love a good lost moment brotha
Styling Hollywood,I haven't watched this show in 10 years and have a really bad memory. Can someone remind me what connection their 2 characters had?
Styling Hollywood,"It's probably not as impactful now, with so much foreign TV at our fingertips on streaming.  But back in 2004 it was pretty wild to have a main character on an major American TV show who didn't speak any English."
Styling Hollywood,"I am re-watching the Mission Impossible franchise, and when I got to Ghost Protocol, I'd totally forgotten that the film opens up with Josh Holloway as an IMF agent that gets killed. It made me want to see more of that character and of Josh Holloway in good roles.

Also, I really enjoyed Ken Leung in Person of Interest."
Styling Hollywood,"Nobody can replicate true detective 

Not even true detective"
Styling Hollywood,"In the book Under The Dome Stephen King writes about the characters watching a l
LOST spin-off called The Hunted Ones. I wonder if he had an inside scoop on this project before it was canceled."
Styling Hollywood,Would love. That guy was so entertaining in the sopranos
Styling Hollywood,They should have made it even if it wasnt connected to lost
Styling Hollywood,That would have been awesome. Dudes a great actor who deserves more chances.
Styling Hollywood,Just make a true detective season 3 name them sawyer and miles and just never acknowledge it.
Styling Hollywood,Been awhile since I've seen such a toxic comment section.  Do people really feel the need to hurl personal insults and belittle people they don't even know?  Are people really so insecure that someone not liking a TV show they like is an excuse to be so bitter?
Styling Hollywood,"My wife and I are about to finish a rewatch of the series and when that episode of Sawyer and Miles came on I made a crack similar to this article. While a spin off wouldn’t work, I think a show with those two would of been interesting to watch. Ken and Josh have good chemistry and it fit very well in police drama setting.

Along with those two I would of loved to see Terry O’Quinn (Locke) and Michael Emerson (Ben) in another show together. They also had amazing chemistry and seemed to bring the best out of each other on screen."
Styling Hollywood,I would've watched it. Miles had one of the best storylines for being a secondary character.
Styling Hollywood,"His character is probably one of my favorite lowkey LOST characters.  He never really seems to break into the main LOST stars, but he's got such a full character history and it's interesting with his ties to Dharma and the island and the superpower he has.

He's also pretty unique as a character because you usually have characters that are smartasses (like Sawyer) or comic relief (like Hurley) or serious/tragic (like a lot of them), and his character is impossible to pin down as a particular thing.  He's likeable and good but also unlikeable and bad at the same time.  It makes him one of the more realistic characters on the show too (despite talking to the dead)."
Styling Hollywood,I can't imagine Damon Lindelof involved with a series that actually *solves* mysteries
Styling Hollywood,We dodged a bullet there.
Styling Hollywood,"As much as I enjoyed their characters, S6 left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I still refuse to watch anything by Lideloff/Cuse, even though I've had people recommend The Leftovers to me."
Styling Hollywood,Ken Leung has never given off “co-lead” vibes in anything he’s ever done.
Styling Hollywood,"yeah I remember when the idea was first floated, most of us hardcore fans absolutely loved the idea 

...of course by the end of the show, you couldn't pay me to watch a _Lost_ spinoff so... probably worked out for the best, really"
Styling Hollywood,"Any ending would of been better than what they did. 

Edit: dislike all you like but the end of lost was hot garbage. First 4 seasons were good before time traveling nonsense."
Styling Hollywood,Lost was the biggest waste of my life I can think of. Besides alcoholism. Yes I’ve binge watched shows since then. But I used to have to be in front of the TV when lost was on so I wasted many hours just being prepared for it to start. Then when the show went downhill I was too invested in it to stop watching.
Styling Hollywood,The show was boring as f
Styling Hollywood,"Man, because of how badly it ended I guess, I forget how stupid good the cast was on that show."
Styling Hollywood,How did they almost make a spinoff of a show that didn't have a plot?
Styling Hollywood,"Not sure how this would work, especially if it didn’t have the blessing of Damon Lindelof. They didn’t write what happened after the Ajira plane “made it to safety” for a reason. The only events we know after the finale is the Ben/Hurley DVD extra. Infact I don’t even know if they confirm in that if the plane made it back, maybe it crashed and they all died? Hurley and Ben made their way off the island a different way right? 

If Josh/Miles got a show, fans would just be clamouring for Lost easter eggs and disappointed there was no further lore or cameos happening."
Styling Hollywood,"After the horrible ending, it’s best that all things related to the show just fizzled away."
Styling Hollywood,This was a show that went on for way too long to milk as much money as possible.  By the end I was just watching just to see how it ends.  Only to be disappointed that all the fans guessed it back in the first season.  Before Game of Thrones this might of been the most hated ending to a strong start series ever.
Styling Hollywood,Spin-off?  All the characters were dead at the finale reveal.  Do they call it Sixth Sense the Series?
Styling Hollywood,*Straume Sawyer*.
Styling Hollywood,"List was great would of loved to see a spin off!, have to admit ending was a tad confusing in my opinion."
Styling Hollywood,...I don't remember the guy on the bottom left. :|
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Man, the show was really a perfect thread-the-needle of paying expert homage to the original, while offering something fresh and interesting.

I kinda figured it'd be canceled. It must have been incredibly expensive and the Dark Crystal wasn't some super popular IP in the first place (even if it's one of my all-time favorite films).

Such a shame. Hoping Disney or someone gives us at least a final season to give this one the ending it deserves."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think nobody expected the show to turn out that well. I definitely did not.

I didn't even wanna watch it at first because I could just not imagine that it wouldn't ""shit"" on the movie and decades of good memories for me. But it nailed what it needed to get right, and added on top of that. 

This is the only cancellation ever that actually made me angry. Because I believed that a labour of love like this one; a show based on a popular fantasy that plenty of people love to this day; would be the one project where the studio would say *""maybe we aren't gonna make money with it, but it deserves to be made""*. Especially since it brings good press and quality to Netflix originals.

But of course it doesn't work that way. Shame. I still hope someone else picks it up, even though many core members have moved on by now."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,This show is cancelled?! What the fuck?!
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I'm absolutely devastated it's been cancelled. My favourite show from last year. I've only started collecting the [models made by Weta Workshop.](https://www.wetanz.com/brands/the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance)

I've made a few pre-orders and now I don't know what to do, to quit collecting them or not - I'm crushed there's not gonna be a season 2."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"The entire time I was watching the series I was thinking, “ Damn, this is creatively and visually fantastic and a ground-breaking return to practical effects. “

I also thought, “ How the fuck did this ever get greenlit to be made and I bet there won’t be a season 2. “"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I binged the entire series with my kids. There is nothing better to me than Jim Henson's stories. I want more contemporary Jim Henson content related to the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, the Storyteller, etc. More puppets please! :)"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It was great tv show but it should have been 1 series and done. 10ish hours was more than enough time to tell the story of what lead up to the film.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I liked it and was eagerly awaiting more. 
I guess I should have watched ot on repeat to up the numbers. 

By far the best 4th wall puppet joke I've ever experienced. I laughed till it hurt. Then rewound and watched that part again."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"My family watched it because they remember the original film from their childhoods, and likewise I remember them showing me when I was a child.

&#x200B;

I couldn't get past the first episode last year, but just a week ago I binged the entire thing in one day.

&#x200B;

I absolutely loved the show and I'm gutted it won't be coming back any time soon."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Tbh I saw so much about it and then it came out and radio silence..I haven't heard anything good or bad about it.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I adored it. I said at the time, I don't think I've enjoyed any piece of on-screen fantasy media this much since Lord of the Rings. And that was someone with zero attachment to the original; I hadn't even seen it before the series. Absolutely enchanting piece of television."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"This show wasn’t meant strictly for kids. I’m in my late 20s having never saw the original movie, and I have seen this show twice now. I can’t forgive Netflix from taking that wonder and joy from me. This story and and it’s creators deserved so much better!"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Sad that it's been cancelled since it was originally netflix that chased the Jim Henson company to make a show for them. They were originally after the labyrinth but Henson said no.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Don’t be sad that this was cancelled, be happy that it even happened and was as amazing as it was."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Such an awesome story told in a unique and compelling way. Reinvigorated my love for all of the characters and their journeys. 

Too bad there won’t be a second one )-: really wanted to see what else they could come up with."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Am I the only one that preferred this over GOT in terms of a serial fantasy show?
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think the series will ape the film that spawned it and live on as a cult favourite.

Rather fitting I'd say."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"It's absolutely a modern fantasy classic, instantly improving on and even, to some extent, redeeming the original movie.

But that said, I'm glad it's ending where it is. I really can't muster the enthusiasm to watch another season of the progress of an inevitable genocide."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,SKEKSISSSS
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Can’t say I’m surprised it was cancelled. I expected it after seeing just the sheer production value and effort that went into it. But it was so surprisingly good that I wish Netflix had more faith in it.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Yup yup yup. I grew up with the original and I had my doubts about this because it holds such a special place in my heart but my god. Age of Resistance absolutely destroyed me. It was so good and I like it more than the original movie, and that's saying a massive amount."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I expected it to suck.

But it was amazing  I was so excited for thr sequel."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I gave it a couple episodes. Couldn't finish it. I enjoyed the movie tho
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I’m a huge fan of the original film and I thought the series was brilliant. Unfortunately, I feel like this was cancelled because a lot of people could not get behind watching puppets. While I was watching it I remember telling several people about it and how awesome it is, but as soon as I would tell them it was puppets, I’d immediately notice all interest completely evaporate."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I really wanted to like this show but couldn’t even get through the first season.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"it was ok, but not as great as everyone is making it out to be. I understand why netflix cancelled it."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Did it?
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,That is a load of huey
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Modern classic???  Pump the brakes ffs.  Give it a little time folks.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Going to be an unpopular opinion but I don't agree with OP.  The original movie was very good and I have fond memories of it.  But I found the Netflix series a tad boring and drawn out.  The whole story could have easily been told in a movie format instead of a series, which would have probably done better.  The characters, while well voiced, were also a bit plain.  Over all it was just to drawn out, and is the most common complaint I hear about the show.

As a movie, I think it would have done much better, and maybe even gotten a sequel.  As a tv series... it was just to long and drawn out.  Not surprised it was canceled."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Maybe if someone watched it
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"This show was incredible!!!! My girlfriend and were in absolute awe of how well it was made. For anyone thats seen it, make sure to check out the behind the scenes documentary as well!"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Netflix is trusting algorithms for the short tail of things. I thought Reed Hasting once said,  “Short term optimization about being efficient is the death of long term success & innovation” https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328109


I guess they’ll just end up being known as making unfinished TV products."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It’s a damn shame. The show was something truly special. I feel like in decades to come this show will get recognition it deserves.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I need to re-watch. Especially with the election impending like  DOOM-DOOM-DOOM
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Why exactly?
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Of course it’s cancelled.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I was surprised by how well-produced this was.
Definitely one of the better decisions at Netflix."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Yeah it’s cancelation is enough to get me to drop netflicks. There are other options and there bad habit of dropping good stuff is tiresome.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"This is the first cancellation that makes me doubt my Netflix subscription. 

It just seems so counter productive from them as I really don’t see the point in watching any new shows just in case they’re cancelled on the 1st/2nd season. I can’t be the only person who thinks this way so now they’re losing viewers on their new shows and IPs just because we’re all waiting to see if it’s going to be cancelled or not. 

I understand there’s a business behind this but this whole tactic or throw shit at the wall, see what sticks is really tiring from a consumer perspective. Lots of choice and all, but ultimately a lot of unsatisfying ends."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Netflix really sucks sometimes
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I can't belive we're getting no more Hup :(
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Everybody is furious at netflix for cancelling it instead of at audiences for not watching it.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"This really is a shame. Netflix is willing to throw money at really awful movies but unwilling to prop up a really great show because of costs?

I've noticed I'm watching less and less Netflix and more Amazon Prime."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I really admired the imagination and blood and sweat that must have gone into making it, but man I really found it a struggle to get through at times. I think it would have been better as a shorter series, like 6 episodes instead of 10, or even 8. It just felt like it ran in circles story-wise a whole lot."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I liked it from an artistic perspective, but I didn’t particularly enjoy watching it"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think the show gets an exaggerated reputation because of the incredible skill and unique look of the production. To be a classic though, it would need a great and timeless story, an area where it falls quite short."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I love fantasy shit and I was utterly bored to tears by the third episode. I felt no connection to the puppet characters and didn't care what happened to them. Seemed as empty as the.movie to me.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It really doesn't. Just because it's Reddit's darling doesn't mean it's that good lol
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Unpopular opinion: I loved Dark Crystal as a kid (saw it when it came out in 80's), but I couldn't get through AoR's first episode. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it didn't pull me in. And I really tried to like it. I'm not surprised it was cancelled if an OG Dark Crystal guy couldn't like it."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,But it didn't because it wasn't.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Not enough shape of kindness
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Agreeed!
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I just did not enjoy this as much as I would have hoped.  Not as good as origianl
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,was really good. just watched it again over the last week.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think this show had an uphill battle from the start, because in spite of the artistry and craft necessary to tell the story, the medium of puppetry is hard for people to take seriously, you place it in the high fantasy genre and the audience shrinks by quite a bit. 

Another complication is that it’s a prequel, where we as the audience know the ultimate outcome for the characters if we’ve seen the original film, so at the very least it can feel as though the stakes are lowered and at the very worst the show can come across as inessential (I think the world building they did was fantastic but the question of whether it’s worth watching struck me initially). 

I tried to get into it but I need to give it a proper viewing. 

My biggest quibble is something specific to the Jim Henson puppet method of acting, there’s a really specific little head wobble that muppets do when they get frustrated (Kermit the frog does it a lot) that they decided to have a lot of the Gelfling characters do in the show that I don’t think lends itself to a drama. 

They talked a lot about how much more emotive the new puppets were and how much more capable of expression they would be as a result of the technological changes made in the pre-release marketing footage but that one move really irked me because while it makes sense for muppets to do as a gag, if people actually shake with rage or exasperation it reads very differently than a puppeteer sort of jiggling their hand. 

I’m guessing it’s considered an indispensable part of the puppeteers tool box or their wasn’t really a good alternative that they could work up for that sort of physical display of emotion though."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"TBH I think the problem was that I totally thought that this was a movie, and so I wasn't watching it because I assumed I could circle back to it."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Def first one I'm sad was cancelled
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I only saw a clip, but I didn’t like how the action scene was shot. 

Lens flair, or something?
Kinda takes you out of “you’re actually there” immersion if you can see a lens flair (or whatever it was).

That might be too picky, but I think those sorts of details need to be paid attention to. 
I did hear it was really good anyway, and might give it a chance sometime later if I remember, but not for a while."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I wanted to like it, but I couldn't take anything seriously.  I'd already seen the original and it's hard to root for someone you know is going to lose."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Creepy cabbage patch kids puppets.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I loved Dark Crystal growing up...have not even finished this show.  Didn’t really work for me.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Well, it has been handled as a piece of steaming burning shit by Netflix, as usual when a series has the potential but people just want action, sex and stupid-ass plots.  


I remember recommending Dark Crystal: AoR to a friend last year and as soon as I mentioned the puppetry he gave me a funny look accompanied by a ""That's nuts man, I'm not watching a puppet show"". Well, be my guest.  


I can't help but notice every time I get my hopes up for a show it goes down the sink as fast as it came, normally due to producer's greediness and audience's  douchebagery."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,The puppets made me feel nauseous.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I had people rave to me about it, but seeing as the original gave me nightmares as a child, I couldn’t bring myself to watch"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Couldn’t watch, the puppets scare me."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Is it supposed to look like that?
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,HUP!
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"That movie game me nightmares, and the plot is of the move is non existent"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Maybe next they’ll ask someone to make a new Labyrinth or Legend or something...
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Too bad it was fucking creepy
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think it's hard to sell a series which has a built-in unhappy ending.

Because it's a prequel to the film, we know where it's going to end up. Downer endings are tricky to pull off in fantasy especially, I think.  It's the same reason I skipped the third Hobbit movie."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,She looks like a Yoda
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I couldn't get past the first 10min

Ik that's not enough to form an opinion but I just wasn't feeling it"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I hadn’t even heard of The Dark Crystal before I watched this show and I fell deeply in love with the imagery, storyline, voice acting, craftsmanship, lore, and most of all, the “realness” of watching physical puppets that I haven’t experienced like this before. I was really looking forward to the next season and I’m so sad that it’s been canceled.

This show had so much artistry and finesse, and clearly had a lot of passionate and talented people pour their lives into it. Meanwhile Netflix continues to produce shows like Too Hot to Handle where the premise of the show is literally “let’s see if these people can resist having sex with each other.” What kind of trash is that?"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think the show would have stood out better if they had gone out of their way to hire legitimate talent to do the score.  They went to such great lengths for everything else.  _Why_ fail when it came to the score?

I was so disappointed, I had to look up what else was in the composer's body of work.  Sure enough, the composers' entire history was just generic scores for generic TV shows.  Absolutely zero mystery why everything about _Age of Resistance's_ score was forgettable, with the single, lone exception of the moment in the first episode when they plugged the theme from the original movie.  Compared to everything else we hear in the series, that instant was positively incongruous."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I’m still hailing it.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I'm beside myself that they cancelled this. It was one of the best things that happened in 2020. Hell, among the *only good things* that happened in 2020."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Oh no it was canceled?!?! 

It was one of the best pieces of television I’ve seen in recent years."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,I know this will be the unpopular opinion. But I didn't really like Age of Resistance. I much preferred the original movie. I wasn't planning on watching the second season.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"So stupid of Netflix to cancel it after all the hard work and money spending was done. The costumes are already there, the sets are already there, it won a fucking Emmy, and you cancel it. I'm sure they had to make way for more seasons of 13 Reasons Why"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Personally think this is something that could really find an audience on Disney+. Would love for them to pick it up.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It didn't.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Could not get into it, but I wasn't a fan of the original movie.  I usually love Henson stuff, but I couldn't be bothered to even finish the series. 
It felt like a lot of unnecessary things tacked on to an existing story that was kind of ok to begin with."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It was fucking horrible but visually stimulating.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Maybe it was just me but I found it incredibly boring and kind of shallow too. It was beautiful, but that can only carry you so far"
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,this show sucked and nobody’s got the balls to say it
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It was boring.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"The only thing I didn't like was how convoluted it was in comparison to the original film. It's still a great show but the original movie will always be dear to me, even if my kids are still too scared to watch it."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I feel like this is just a product of misplaced Nostalgia, the original Dark Crystal wasn't very good, it was a shadow of Labyrinth. And the reboot was a desperate cash grab at best."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I don’t want to be a poop or a troll. As someone who saw the original in the theatre as a kid, I thought the new series was rubbish. I barely finished."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,No it really doesnt
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,It wasn’t good enough to be a “classic” but I did like it and am upset there apparently won’t be season 2.
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Give me a break, it was mediocre."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"It ""deserved."" Yuck. Terribly written. Got what it ""deserved."""
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"It really is such bullshit it was cancelled. It was amazing and most people I know who watched it, watched it multiple times. It's a travesty."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Honestly, I couldn't watch this show when they completely changed the point of the movie. The point was that the good and the bad were a split being, not that the bad had invaded a good planet. I was so disappointed."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"I think it was. Pretty much everyone I know who saw it loved it, even non fantasy fans enjoyed it. Netflix just didn’t think long term with it, which is frustrating. I understand that it was an expensive show, but Netflix could’ve worked with it to tell the story. 

Or they should’ve marketed it as a miniseries from the get go. 

Netflix keeps canceling everything I love."
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,Sick and tired fo these streaming services cancelling all these shows
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,"Loved the movie, and anything Henson ever, ever did.  This series was waaaay to cutesy, lacked the vision Henson would have brought to it.  I tried many times to watch it. The edges were simply not  sharp enough."
Rust Valley Restorers,This show had a weird vibe. Like you say literally *everything* goes wrong. Which is odd considering how much is clearly scripted? Failure when building stuff must be some kind of escapism I don't understand... except I liked it anyway lol
Rust Valley Restorers,"I watched but was annoyed the entire time. 

The owner is a hoarder with, I think he said, over 400  abandoned and rusty vehicles and shells of vehicles waiting for restoration. Yet he pretty much hates selling any of them. He recently started the business and said it takes around $1200 a day to keep it running, but he tries to sell his cars for way more money than people are willing to pay.

The finished cars are nice, but it's a struggle getting there. Every episode is a repeat of his adult son and his mechanic telling the camera that they're going to go broke if he doesn't start selling something.

At the end of the year [spoiler](#s ""he admitted defeat and put all the cars and business up for sale. He was asking $1.25M and the last we saw, had turned down $950K and an offer to let him keep his five favorite cars."")"
Rust Valley Restorers,"I love watching the cars go from old to new, but man do I HATE Avery. His voice.. and that laugh.. it made it so hard to keep watching, which I eventually ended halfway through the season."
Rust Valley Restorers,I don't really see the reason to comment on his race and appearance.
Rust Valley Restorers,"I absolutely LOVED this show! Mike and Avery are both great fun to watch. Yeah, Mike is shit with money and Avery's laugh could curdle milk but their chemistry and the problem solving they have to go through to complete restorations is great TV. I really hope there is a 2nd season and that it is much longer. 

The biggest problem with this first season is that they crammed about 24 episodes of restoration work into 8 shows. It would be great if they expand the series to include more of the work as it progresses. I know everyone wants to see a finished car every episode but it just feels too rushed and seeing more of the under-the-hood action would really improve that I think."
Rust Valley Restorers,I enjoyed it. Avery looks like porn star Ron Jeremy.
Rust Valley Restorers,"Why do I have to deal with their personalities?  Can't I just watch them restore a car with no color commentary?  I couldn't deal with dreadlock dude's personality for the whole TRAILER, let alone a season of television."
Rust Valley Restorers,It’s amazing how many of you think anything about this show is real.
Rust Valley Restorers,"Oh hey, u/wookiewin, you got quoted in this article: [https://www.distractify.com/p/will-there-be-a-season-2-rust-valley-restorers](https://www.distractify.com/p/will-there-be-a-season-2-rust-valley-restorers)"
Rust Valley Restorers,I was really hoping for more technical detail in the show. Lots of drama worked into the show which I don't like. I still watch it anyways.
Rust Valley Restorers,"WE

NEED

MORE

AVERYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
Rust Valley Restorers,"The show is pure reality TV trash, but I loved it. Sometimes you just want to watch something that makes you enthusiastic for old cars, and the show did scratch that itch. The ""personalities"" and the ""plot points"" that they script into the thing are extremely irritating, like the time they decide to drive a tow truck through a deep flooded road just to stall it out and miraculously *not* die, but I mean, that's TV. It's clearly TV.

I do love real car restoration stuff, and this scratch the itch. I recommend taking a look at some of the YouTube channels that do this stuff for real, like [Junkyard Digs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS87-wYrvmexsLkBj0jhrnQ/featured) and [Dylan McCool](https://www.youtube.com/user/hotroddart). They actually have some episodes where they run into guys like this Rust Valley guy: they own scrapyards full of cars, the young guys go in, get an engine to turn over, and ask if he'll sell them the car to restore it, and he basically tells them to go pound sand. So I found that part of the show to be the most realistic. Definitely reminded me of my Gruncle Bub who also was a horder/mechanic. He could fix anything, but most of what he had he never did. Filled up four different barns and then when he passed away we had to recycle most of it to the scrap yard for the raw metal."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Duuuude I love that friggin show! Haha 

I mean it’s def junk food entertainment but grabbing some dinner and listening to heavy Canadian accents argue and seeing a decent flip is the highlight of my weeknight.

Avery is my dude."
Rust Valley Restorers,"This is a great show on Netflix! It has many of the modern tropes you would expect out of a history channel show. This makes it appealing to me, as I do watch these types of shows when nothing else is better to do. I do enjoy them.

This show has a cartain, lets appeal to the biggest audience tupe feel to it. That is just fine to me, and many others that may see this.

But sometimes this show takes a bit of campiness, and makes it gold! Even though it can be a little predictable, it is still a great show, hope there are more seasons."
Rust Valley Restorers,This show is such a joke. Everything is overdramatic by a mile.
Rust Valley Restorers,"I watched the whole series and wouldn't mind a second season if they get a little more polished in the presentation.

The editing and continuity  is absolutely atrocious. One of the first episodes has them fixing up a Continental convertible and giving it back to the owner, but at different moments throughout the series you see it still in pieces in the rear of the building. .

The guy who finishes the blue Chevelle for them in return for a Blue Nova/Acadian which also continues to pop up throughout the rest of the series.

Or how about the square bodied Chevy short bed truck missing the box they are going to fix up? Drive it out of the junk yard and never heard from again, but it shows up in the back ground again and again.

The guy is a hoarder for sure, and it's entertaining to watch but it's a train wreck. I would never let them work on my cars."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Love this show, never been into car restoration shows.. but this reminds me of the weekends spent with my cousins working on old Aussie muscle cars. It feels alot more realistic"
Rust Valley Restorers,[deleted]
Rust Valley Restorers,"For all of Mike's ""flaws"" he is such a kind person. Show makes me feel good when I watch it."
Rust Valley Restorers,"These guys remind me of plenty of people I've known growing up in Canada hanging around with my Dad, low-key geniuses at their trade but always running into issues along the way due to a lack of finesse. The way they talk and act reminds me of the people I've met and worked with that for me, I'd say about 90% real . They have the know how but not that finesse lol. I think that's why I find myself hooked on it."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I was hoping by about halfway or 3/4 he was gonna start learning to run the business better. But it never happened. Then he had to tell all his employees he was broke and didn’t have jobs anymore.

If they make a season 2 I’ll watch it but I hope he gets his act together and sells some nice cars."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Couldn't even finish the first episode, because every dialogue from each cast rotates between how deep they are in debt, how much they need to earn money on the car, and how Mike is such a hoarder that he doesn't really want to sell his cars. Compared to Count's Kustoms where it was only addressed like once or twice in some episodes.

It got really annoying for me that I just skip every time someone talks and just watch them work on the cars."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Yeah hearing 30 times an episode how broke they are, and how they need to make money etc. gets old really fast."
Rust Valley Restorers,"The show should be called ""Sentimental Car Hoarder"""
Rust Valley Restorers,"Avery is like the worst person I've ever seen. He literally fucks up everything and owns up to none of it. Im not even a gear head, but watching him drive through a flood, back into a 1940s dodge *in front of the client* and now basically ruining the car they built for the demolition... I'm so irrationally angry at his stupidity. I can't even begin to imagine why he hasnt been ""fired"". The buisness is unorganized and Mike hired his friends and wonders why hes in debt. Canadians are too nice. I'd have lost my shit if he didnt put oil in the car and ruined it."
Rust Valley Restorers,It’s because it’s a white dude with dreads
Rust Valley Restorers,"Why the hell are kids these days so sensitive? It’s extremely descriptive. He is a white dude. With dreads. Because that’s his lifestyle choice. Think of any white dude with dreads you’ve ever seen. 99% are hippies. That’s legit this dude. Quit your internet whining and actually contribute something to society other than your crybaby attitude. Review the damn show or keep your over sensitivities to yourself. 

P.S. This might have hurt your feelings. I am not sorry. Grow up and deal with actual issues."
Rust Valley Restorers,">Car Masters: Rust to Riches

When I first heard Avery laugh I thought it was over the top. But now I'm actually fond of how he gives each laugh 110%. It has made me like him a lot."
Rust Valley Restorers,"The show is definitely not for you then. There are plenty of other shows that focus more on the car restoration side of things, just stick with those."
Rust Valley Restorers,"If I’ve learned anything about reality TV, it’s that it doesn’t matter what they do for a living as long as they’re absolute trash human beings. That’s where the ratings are"
Rust Valley Restorers,Well you'd be surprised.
Rust Valley Restorers,"""People adopting a certain hairstyle are racist.""

&#x200B;

\- someone retarded"
Rust Valley Restorers,"How racist it is to wear your hair a certain way. This is peak retard, advanced retardation."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I know something about the cars they're ""restoring"" and enjoy this show. It is obvious a lot of it is scripted but I take it for what it is. And no, having dreadlocks as a white guy isn't racist."
Rust Valley Restorers,You're an absolute sped.
Rust Valley Restorers,It's reality TV.  The business is fine. There will be a season 2.
Rust Valley Restorers,That was all kayfabe man. He got paid for the show after all.
Rust Valley Restorers,I was hoping to learn something about cars.  But they literally just finished all three projects without explaining anything they did.  Like huh? how did they install hydraulics in that one car? how did they completely restore the frame on this car? how did they chop the sheet metal up? how did they get the engine to run after it burst into flames?  how do the different tires make the cars look different?  It was all just them complaining about Mike not selling anything.
Rust Valley Restorers,How is that any different than a black chick with a straight perm? 🤔
Rust Valley Restorers,Dreads have been around for 1000s of years worn by many different races they don't have a black only culture and plus the popularity of dreads was around the 60/70 with counter war culture and the pro black rights movement. None has claim to a hair style even the mongols wore them.
Rust Valley Restorers,?Bruh i was defending the dude it dreads how about you chill.
Rust Valley Restorers,Can you suggest any restoration shows on Netflix?
Rust Valley Restorers,"They're not trash on this show at all though, more endearingly bumbling. The main guy has a compulsive habit when it comes to car collection, which gets a bit painful to watch at points, and his sidekick is incredibly clumsy at times. But they both seem like really goodhearted people."
Rust Valley Restorers,From my googling he was really trying to sell everything due to money problems.
Rust Valley Restorers,Exactly my thought. It's just drama to create a cliffhanger and demand for season 2.
Rust Valley Restorers,"It’s all actually for sale (or was).  Looks like it actually went under (or was going to). Not sure if this is from after filming, or if the show staved off disaster, or what though.

http://www.roadkill.com/we-visit-the-400-car-property-for-sale-in-canada-its-wonderland/"
Rust Valley Restorers,"Too much drama, Car Masters: Rust to Riches is better IMO. Even the hot mechanic/model they show her doing something to the cars. They should have named it Rust Valley Hoarders or something."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Car master: rust to ritches 

Plus you get to look at Constance Nunes!"
Rust Valley Restorers,"Hit motto us literally all about good karma and if someone needs a hand you help em. And good things will happen to you. These guys are wild and filthy. But they seem like good people and their constant laughter throughout the whole season is refreshing.

Sure people wanna see more car stuff. But it's also nice just watching their day to day stuff. I'm loving it. Hope they do a second season"
Rust Valley Restorers,"Hey thanks!  I am getting more into cars.  I'll watch that instead.  Is the new Hyperdrive any good?  I wasn't feeling it, but I might keep watching later."
Rust Valley Restorers,Dude is my neighbor. Funny seeing his ass on TV!
Rust Valley Restorers,"Haven't seen that yet, don't like the trailer after seeing it looks too much hyped up. Excuse the pun"
Rust Valley Restorers,yeah think you're right.  seemed pretty cringy when i watched it.  by the way im halfway into this car masters show.  and i'm really into it.  the girl explained the Ford 302 engine.  and i love their business model.  the strategy to make a lot of money from flipping and chaining project cars to get to the big money maker.  awesome idea.
Rust Valley Restorers,The car restoration shows are strangely addictive. White haired dreadlock dude was annoying as shit in season 2 of rust brothers.
Rust Valley Restorers,"I'm going to start season 2 tonight but ... didn't they go bankrupt last season? The place was for sale.

The owner is quite annoying with zero business sense, but it's an easy watch and I like seeing the transformations."
Rust Valley Restorers,I binged rust  valley restorers and car masters rust to riches  both are good show when you are into cars.
Rust Valley Restorers,Anyone know where I can watch the rest of season 2?
Rust Valley Restorers,"There were 12 episodes filmed and broadcast in Canada, so I've no idea what happened with Netflix. Presumably Netflix will eventually add them, but I've no idea."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Just watching the ""idiots on the farm"" episode in S2, not enough work on sexy muscle cars and too much weaning of lambs and shooting shit"
Rust Valley Restorers,"It says on their website they're just shut due to Coronavirus, nothing about bankruptcy."
Rust Valley Restorers,now on netflix
Rust Valley Restorers,"aa that makes a bit more sense, because it stopped so sudden after episode 6. So hope they will add more:)"
Rust Valley Restorers,"Season 2 has been on Netflix in the UK for the last week, I personally love it. Complete chaos but strangely addictive."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Rust Valley Restorers,Interesting to see containment show up.
Rust Valley Restorers,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Rust Valley Restorers,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Rust Valley Restorers,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Rust Valley Restorers,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Rust Valley Restorers,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Rust Valley Restorers,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Rust Valley Restorers,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Rust Valley Restorers,How about movies??
Rust Valley Restorers,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Rust Valley Restorers,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Rust Valley Restorers,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Rust Valley Restorers,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Rust Valley Restorers,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Rust Valley Restorers,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Rust Valley Restorers,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Rust Valley Restorers,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Rust Valley Restorers,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Rust Valley Restorers,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Rust Valley Restorers,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Rust Valley Restorers,[deleted]
Rust Valley Restorers,Pandemic boost
Rust Valley Restorers,He write it at the end of his post.
Rust Valley Restorers,Last 100 days
Rust Valley Restorers,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Rust Valley Restorers,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Rust Valley Restorers,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Rust Valley Restorers,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Love Alarm,"Not just Shaffer but the whole Worlds Most Dangerous Band. The Roots are at the Grammys.

Two days ago marked the 41st anniversary of Late Night and the band's debut. Also the band's first full appearance on NBC in around 30 years, though Shaffer has appeared on SNL and Fallon over the years.

Honestly a good enough reason for me to watch lol"
Love Alarm,"always loved Paul, his laugh was something else"
Love Alarm,Yay for Paul! (Now if Dave was able to sub for a night and finally host the Tonight show...)
Love Alarm,"""My cock tastes like Paul Shaffer's ass.""

-Evil Dave Letterman (RIP)"
Love Alarm,Jeez insufferable host and insufferable band leader. Need one more to perfect the trifecta.
Love Alarm,there's a Family Guy clip of his laugh as a fire alarm
Love Alarm,You are young... Dave subbed for Johnny a multitude of times.  I doubt he has an interest.
Love Alarm,"Cool to learn that! Alas yeah, I grew up with Dave on CBS (followed by watching Conan on NBC)! But Johnny’s show was before my time"
Love Alarm,"I think he was primarily guest hosting between his ill fated morning show ending in 1980 and his late night show starting in 1982. despite the morning show getting canned after 4 months, it got enough critical praise that NBC paid him $1m to keep him at the company until they could get him something else"
Love Alarm,"As a big fan of the first Pacific Rim, and someone let down by Uprising, I'm impressed with the show so far. It's got great human elements, the fights are slower and more impactful like the first movie, and any excuse for more Pacific Rim is fine by me.

If you're not turned off by CGI anime, it's definitely worth checking out. It doesn't even require knowledge from the movies, although it probably helps with lore."
Love Alarm,You’re telling me teenagers playing the “Trololololo” song as they fly into battle wasnt the right direction to take this franchise?
Love Alarm,"Surprised they never made a sequel for Pacific Rim, it had all sorts of potential."
Love Alarm,"I'm 4 in, digging it. 

Already seems to be doing two things I wanted from a potential GDT sequel - Kaiju / Jaegar mecha-hybrids, and what might be genetic experimentation with kaiju DNA. Still TBD if that is what is actually happening."
Love Alarm,"didnt expect the B+ grade, guess I'll check it out if its only 7eps"
Love Alarm,2 episodes in and I’m hooked. They should start on season 2 immediately.
Love Alarm,I can’t wait to watch this!
Love Alarm,this anime might be good but i absolute cannot stand cgi anime
Love Alarm,"I wasn't impressed. Poorly developed plot mechanics (""we're your parents! But now we have to go away for.... reasons!""), telling not showing (""I stole all this stuff!""; ""Great! you know what would have been an awesome, location-establishing montage of the village that we will now never see!?!""), and HEAVY asset re-use (there are literally 3 fights with the same monster-model in the first 10 minutes). All the usual Netflix production quality.

I'm sure some will be able to put up with it but there are better ways to kill time. B+ super super generous."
Love Alarm,"every property is bleaker , not surprised"
Love Alarm,is it muv luv bleak? cause that shit was bleak AF
Love Alarm,The voice acting is atrocious. It sounds like everyone chugged a bottle of NyQuil then started recording
Love Alarm,"Bleaker, yes. Better? Not necessarily. Not to mention CGI anime is bad."
Love Alarm,"\>watching cartoons as an adult

lol"
Love Alarm,"I was sceptical up to the 5th episode. Don't know if that's just my imagination, but I got the impression that by that point there was a huge leap in quality. Shots got better, lighting and even textured seemed much prettier all of a sudden. In the last episode at times it looked mostly hand drawn. Story also picked up momentum and managed to take some unexpected plot twists."
Love Alarm,"I was really disappointed with the length, though. It feels less like a full season and more like the first third of one. Hopefully they saved enough time by cutting out every other frame on dialogue scenes that they'll have a season 2 this year."
Love Alarm,"Im honestly not a huge anime (and especially not CGI anime ) fan and ended  up liking it a ton

Although maybe its because I'm a huge Pacific Rim fan and was waiting for even a somewhat decent follow up movie/series for a while now Lol"
Love Alarm,Wait...did they actually do that in the sequel?
Love Alarm,That’s my alarm in the morning!
Love Alarm,"Yes, yes. That's what we tell ourselves."
Love Alarm,You'd think they'd make an avatar the last air bender movie while they're at it
Love Alarm,"Well, in another universe some studio did make a sequel. Just, not in ours."
Love Alarm,theres a lot of shitty ones but beastars and land of the lustrous were great
Love Alarm,"Why do so many cartoons use this style of animation now? Do most people genuinely like it or is it just really cheap to use? Because every time I see it used, it never fails to look terrible."
Love Alarm,CGI anime would be fine if so many didn’t have such low FPS with character movement.
Love Alarm,">Poorly developed plot mechanics (""we're your parents! But now we have to go away for.... reasons!"")

Were you just not paying attention? ""We have to go get help and you can't come because there's monsters out there"" is not exactly the most complicated plot point, and the show pretty much spells it out."
Love Alarm,Standard anime rules  apply. You wait till 4th or 5th before judging a series
Love Alarm,"Could be, netflix has a tendency of splitting season orders into two ""seasons""."
Love Alarm,The first season of Castlevania was that way too.  Then the second and third seasons went to longer formats.
Love Alarm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNXf9K9_Tsc&ab_channel=TheMoviebear
Love Alarm,Yes they did :(
Love Alarm,There's not enough time in a film for that amount of story. What they really should do is a live action series remake.
Love Alarm,At least Avatar started on-screen. When is Percy Jackson going to get an adaptation?
Love Alarm,"Beastars was so good, it changed my opinion on cg anime."
Love Alarm,"Dorohedoro did hybrid, but mostly 3d and it was fantastic"
Love Alarm,Both of those were Studio Orange who are easily the best in the business at 3d cgi anime.
Love Alarm,"It's mostly one studios who does a lot of work for Netflix. If you see CGI anime on Netflix there is a good chance it is from Polygon Pictures. I think it's there ""art style""."
Love Alarm,Dirt cheap to produce.
Love Alarm,"Quick, easy, simple to change and modify.

Plus even a lot traditionally animated stuff use CG for certain elements, so sometimes it's easier to just do the whole thing.

Not everyone's cup of tea I know but you'll probably just have to get used to it. It's only going to get more ubiquitous."
Love Alarm,"i dont know man

anime isnt a cartoon"
Love Alarm,"Yeah and it definitely felt somewhat believable to me. They wanted to bring help as they knew that they couldnt protect all those kids with a nearly broken Jaeger from the increasing Kaiju population 

Also seems as long as you dont make much noise and stay mostly out of sight in a rural place you can live free of Kaiju for a while. So it makes sense they'd leave them in a place like that for a couple weeks (which was their original plan)"
Love Alarm,"we're gonna disagree on this. You like the show, that's fine. Not gonna tell you what to like and dislike. What I mean by the above is it felt to me like the cheapest possible way to invoke the 'missing parents' trope without having to animate any additional scenes.

Only wrote in because I really, really wanted to like it. I liked the movies. I have zero problems with CGI anime. I thought Castlevania was loads of fun. Looked budget, but didn't take itself too seriously. This... nah. Got better things to do. Glad it works for you though."
Love Alarm,I'm still waiting for Netflix's Ultraman Season 2
Love Alarm,"The worst part is that 'Trololo' was a long-dead meme even when the first film came out, let alone when Uprising decided to engage in meme archeology over five years later."
Love Alarm,[removed]
Love Alarm,"wow this is just as stupid as that ""your momma"" joke in that terrible star wars movie."
Love Alarm,"Or better yet - give the animators their own Avatar Studio with bags of money, and just slowly back away"
Love Alarm,That’s what Dorohedoro did for me.
Love Alarm,"yup, I read the tech was so good it was used in spiderverse"
Love Alarm,"Sure it is, it's all cartoons. Anime is just Japanese cartoons. 

It's like how all manga are comics."
Love Alarm,It most definitely is.
Love Alarm,"Haha right!? I saw that scene and went ""Was...was this filmed back in 2008 or something?"""
Love Alarm,Trololo isn't really a dead meme as much as it is vintage.
Love Alarm,The Asylum presents: *Atlantic Edge*.
Love Alarm,"The movie really isn't that bad. The story is terrible, but the action is still loads of fun.

Watched it twice in theatres at the time and had a good time."
Love Alarm,"That pulled me out of the movie so fast. I still enjoyed some elements of TLJ, but tonally it was all over the place lol"
Love Alarm,Just wait until [this is canon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4n0F9R90F0)
Love Alarm,"Or oh you got a boyfriend?? Like this dude was kidnapped and part of a fascist death cult and immediately becomes high school horny guy

So damn cheesy"
Love Alarm,Loved the tone of that so much!
Love Alarm,Its more west vs east. Manga is east influence and comics are west influence. Instead of homogenized everything
Love Alarm,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Rim_(film)
Love Alarm,"Its really not.

When you hear comics you are most likely thinking of things like super hero comics or western produced more independent stuff. While when you hear manga or Manhwa your thinking of eastern produced stuff with its format and stylistic differences.

They are all the same medium which is comics or sequential art if you want to get all fancy pants about it.

Manga is just Japanese produced comics its a distinct subset of the medium as a whole but its still part of the medium."
Love Alarm,Probably better than the actual sequel
Love Alarm,You just called comics west and manga east to call them the same is doing both a disservice.
Love Alarm,"No I said you are thinking of them like that. I was not using a general you I was specifically talking about you. 

You are perhaps not understanding where I'm coming from. Let's try this a different way. you have pacific rose apples and you have granny smith apples. They both have quite different textures and flavour profiles one is sweet the other is tart one is crisp the other is soft. They couldn't be more different but they are both fundamentally apples. 

It's the same with comics the different varieties are not the same as each other but they are all fundamentally the same thing."
Love Alarm,"Cable subscription channels and streaming services are not bound by the same rules as broadcast TV.

Edit: also, HBO have made a market of creating shows that push the boundaries of censorship."
Love Alarm,People complain about this while the most horrific violence and gore is “prestige tv”.
Love Alarm,Oz is definitely way worse than this and it aired 20 years ago.
Love Alarm,"> How different is their criteria on ratings in tv compared to movies? Does cable tv have a less strict rating system?

In the US, movie ratings are given out by the MPA (formerly the MPAA), which is known for being overly conservative in some ways. TV ratings, on the other hand, have no central board, and when it comes to cable, no general criteria whatsoever. Cable networks can produce whatever they want and rate it whatever they want; all they have to be mindful of is how viewers (and advertisers if applicable) might react."
Love Alarm,"Lol no way would it be NC-17 as a movie.

Also, I mean it's been a couple months since I watched it but I'm trying to remember nudity in the show. There's the first episode where the jock dudes dad has sex with Jules, but I don't remember lower male nudity. Sydney sweeneys bf is naked a couple of times. Three main female characters have been topless and I don't remember other nudity besides that. I don't see how it's more nudity than other HBO shows, especially season 1 when they're trying to hook you into the show"
Love Alarm,"I mean you must not have seen Spartacus, that had way more nudity and lurid secenes in a single season. Shows like Spartacus, The Naked Director, The Girlfriend, Tell Me You Love Me etc. makes Euphoria look like timid in that department to be honest."
Love Alarm,"Omg... It's a story worth telling, but it's rough with or without a trigger warning. I watched the first few episodes in my garage with the door open, and HOLY SHIT... now I know my neighbors will only call 911 on something dumb like my trashcans."
Love Alarm,I agree. Like the story seems interesting but I'm not watching nasty stuff. I think it would've done better if it wasn't so graphic. A lot of people don't like watching sexual scenes. Those who watch are either desensitized to it or they're pervs who watch specifically for that.
Love Alarm,"Exactly.

The only restrictions on TV are the OTA channels, which have federally mandated guidelines because they're free, over the air channels anyone can hypothetically access. That's it. Basic cable channels place restrictions on themselves only for advertising purposes.

And channels like HBO and Showtime are subscription only channels and don't even have advertising, so they can do whatever the hell they want."
Love Alarm,"Yeah its ridiculous. In a world where game of thrones and the walking dead have been among the biggest or the biggest non network shows we really should be past the point of wondering why a naked person on screen is ok...

Especially with hbos next big series being a zombie show that will be packed with violence"
Love Alarm,"Exactly, THAT show was ridiculous in what it showed, it makes Euphoria look tame"
Love Alarm,"you don't remember well. There is a TON of graphic nudity including erect penises, male masturbation and one scene where you see about 30 naked men with their penises out in less than 3 minutes. It's FAR more than any other show I've ever seen, ever."
Love Alarm,"Ep 2. Locker room penises and episode 3, a montage of dick pics."
Love Alarm,At one point they have a young charecter hatefully masterbating at young Jules
Love Alarm,[deleted]
Love Alarm,Violence is more acceptable than nudity. Maybe this will be hard to explain but there should be a level of morality upheld. Producers use nudity and sex scenes as a cheap way of gaining attention.
Love Alarm,Have you actually watched Euphoria?
Love Alarm,Why does nobody complain this much tho when it’s woman? Do y’all get how uncomfortable it is now? Lmao
Love Alarm,"Oh I forgot them talking about dick pics and how to take a good one and honestly don't remember the locker room but I'll take your word for it. But a few dick pics and a standard locker room scene does not make an NC-17 movie. When you're talking 10 hours of show and maybe 5-10 minutes of that has any nudity, I don't see how it rises to NC-17 or makes it worse than any other HBO show."
Love Alarm,"No. I'm being 100% real. I watched Euphoria in my garage, and despite all the painful-to-watch/hear sexual assaults, drug usage, and self-destructive behaviors, my neighbors left me alone. Meanwhile I get letters about having my garage door open."
Love Alarm,I agree. I fr couldn’t even watch they might as well throw those episodes on the hub it’s like gross how much they show
Love Alarm,I think one scene with a penis gets a past but if there are more it might get NC-17. There is a documentary which is This Film is not Rated shows that rating system is stupid.
Love Alarm,Zola had a similar penis montage and it's only rated R.
Love Alarm,"Yeah season 1 was a bit eh and completely different compared to season 2. Season 2 is so good. Some new characters, philosophical themes, dimension traveling, higher stakes, a lot of weird and mind-blowing stuff. I love season 2 10x than 1st season."
Love Alarm,"Lol this is all pretty nitpicky

>so many things. in the cells, where do they go to the toilet?

From what I remember there was a tiny stream running through the cells...there's your bathroom

>bash him over the head with a frying pan. job done.

Where would they get this frying pan? lol"
Love Alarm,"Watch season 2, then update this post and tell us how you feel. lol. 

> I'm just going to read the synopsis of the remaining episodes

No don't do that.... seriously I do strongly recommend season 2. Mind blowing stuff. Doesn't even matter if you liked the 1st season."
Hyperdrive,"lol... ""I've been working 4 jobs to keep the lights on.""

As a $100k+ car and equipment sits in the garage."
Hyperdrive,[deleted]
Hyperdrive,American ninja racer.
Hyperdrive,looks shit. Like something Discovery would proudly put on air.
Hyperdrive,I didn’t know street racers organized themselves into ranks.
Hyperdrive,“Elite”
Hyperdrive,"Can we stop adding the over blown human interest stories to these type things?  I miss the days of American Gladiators were we got less time than an awkward Jeopardy first round contestant interview.  Just say their name, age, place of origin, and maybe occupation or favorite anime and move the fuck on."
Hyperdrive,"They're gonna ""reality show"" it up with this until it's unwatchable, aren't they?"
Hyperdrive,"Needs more smash cuts. Seriously though, that was so disorienting I'm not even sure what I just watched. There were definitely cars though."
Hyperdrive,Got me excited that [Hyperdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdrive_\(TV_series\)) was back.
Hyperdrive,"Just finished watching the whole series and beside the usual annoying reality tv garbage (extra backstory and recaps and over-hyping things that are not terribly impressive by the commentators) it was solidly entertaining.   


Moving forward I think they would do well to cut some of the chaff and go more into car nerd stuff like weights, top speed, and acceleration to add context (and fill time with things that are interesting instead of annoying).  


A nice breath of fresh air was the lack of contrived rivalry or ""beef"". Competitors just seemed like decent folk who are a bit nutty on the track. I appreciate the good sportsmanship.  


Show is definitely ""Car Ninja Warriors"" for sure though. XD"
Hyperdrive,Who the fuck talks like that? It sounds like someone steroided the fuck out of his voice...
Hyperdrive,"This should have come out in 2002, after the 1st Fast and Furious movie"
Hyperdrive,Is that Ken block?
Hyperdrive,"yall complaining about the Reality TV format but its netflix, you can binge and skip to the action. You dont have to watch the fake sobstories"
Hyperdrive,So basically ninja warrior for out of shape people.
Hyperdrive,Go Speed Racer!
Hyperdrive,scripted reality show ? why the fuck is netflix burning their hands on this kind of garbage ?
Hyperdrive,didnt they already make a show like this? I watched on episode where a suped up minivan raced like 3 other cars
Hyperdrive,where is ken block to piss on these guys?
Hyperdrive,Can't wait.
Hyperdrive,"Oh man, this show is so cringe worthy."
Hyperdrive,"I've been 'watching' this as a background show, so not fully paying attention.
Question...who is the black guy and why does he wear sunglasses at night.
Also, the Lambo dude looks like Eugene from the walking dead, when he has his helmet on."
Hyperdrive,You have my curiosity.
Hyperdrive,"Dang, this actually looks pretty good."
Hyperdrive,Why am I low key excited about this show
Hyperdrive,"from executive producer charlize theron? well thankfully they got some real car people involved and not some random actress. this will be mostly a poorly done drama show about the obstacles normal people over came to be on a game show, they might have a few dumb car stunts here and there to fill time."
Hyperdrive,"This show is such garbage! I couldn't even get through a single episode without needing a stiff drink. The cringe is unreal! The drivers are decent, but the commentators are brutally hard to listen to."
Hyperdrive,C-R-I-N-G-E
Hyperdrive,Is this what the hoonigan crew has been doing?
Hyperdrive,I did a double take when I saw the Truck Driver. Thought she was Emma Watson.
Hyperdrive,"If you are a genuine automotive engineering enthusiast, this show is flashy garbage like most ""autosport"" inspired stuff these days.
If you think FastnFurious is realistic, unironically, you might like this.

It's basically some pop American idol BS with some car nonsense thrown in."
Hyperdrive,"What 5 year old thought up these idiotic courses?  The announcers are horrific also, and ruin any legitimacy the show has."
Hyperdrive,"It's bad, scripted bad, courses are so cool, there's nice cars and good looking girls, I love it."
Hyperdrive,[removed]
Hyperdrive,"You cant feed kid with worn high compound tires, trust me I tried."
Hyperdrive,"Mixed with the worst bits of competition shows (over-hyping everything, and shoehorning in ""feel good"" backstories when all you want is the action)"
Hyperdrive,I was about say they're going for the Top Gear demographic.
Hyperdrive,You mean all the bits of Top Gear now then?
Hyperdrive,This is why I gave up on Discovery and just bought MotorTrend OnDemand. Never looked back.
Hyperdrive,">looks shit.

Someone should tell Netflix. They won't stop advertising it to me at the end of every show."
Hyperdrive,"Need for Speed underground bro, gotta level up to unlock the next tier of cars."
Hyperdrive,"yeah why the hell arent they just using professionals like racecar drivers, stunt drivers, etc?   I'd way rather see some of the best in the world competing on a course like this than randoms with overdone reality show backstories. And shows like that always spend way too much time reminding viewers of those narratives      

I dont care how many kids they have at home or how tough their childhood was - i just want to see some of the best drivers compete, or else its just a competition between randoms with varying levels of skill and training.  Nonetheless, i'll probably watch episode 1 at least"
Hyperdrive,"I don't know about you, but when I think of elite drivers, I think ***LUMBERJACK***"
Hyperdrive,This over-produced fake drama is why I can't watch the new Battlebots
Hyperdrive,"Well I'd hope not but.... It's cheaper to ""reality show"" it up as apposed to filming dangerous car chase scenes. So probably be a 80/20% split."
Hyperdrive,"""At this speed he's risking flooding the engine bay"" it was at this moment I had to turn it off. I lasted 12 minutes and couldn't do it."
Hyperdrive,too much reality tv editing techniques.   Those kind of ads dont translate to streaming audiences the same way
Hyperdrive,Kill the humans!
Hyperdrive,"Finished an hour ago, I liked how they all cheered for each other too. They should stop editing to look like comic book panels at times
Especially cause the angles never appeared on the same place twice. Other than that I enjoyed it as the stupid fun it is and have no other problems with it. I doubt there'll be but I hope theres a second season. With even better drivers even it it means theyll all be boring competitive types and not Shredders lol"
Hyperdrive,"I definitely liked how supportive they were of each other even though they were in competition. It reminded me of American Beastmaster that way, minus the repetitive commentary."
Hyperdrive,"Yeah, I have a bad feeling it's going to end up with a bunch of ""here's my sob story"" just like ninja warrior. Would be nice if I'm wrong, but the moment they started listing random professions with the drivers, it did not bode well.

I do not need to know you're a law student to watch you drive a car on an autocross track at night."
Hyperdrive,cause your momma likes it
Hyperdrive,I actually just watched that last night! It was awesome seeing the 1920s frankencar race.
Hyperdrive,helping them produce the show is where he was
Hyperdrive,The black guy isn't anyone special and doesn't get far in the competition. His nickname is Angry panda.
Hyperdrive,That black dude was so annoying. He can’t drive worth a crap and I cringed so hard when he wore a suit for his interview.
Hyperdrive,"Oh boy, do I have news for you..."
Hyperdrive,"I heard the voice, scary"
Hyperdrive,More like Need For Speed: Most Wanted...
Hyperdrive,"> why the hell arent they just using professionals like racecar drivers, stunt drivers, etc? 


cause this format makes it relatable to aspiring car enthusiasts, not actual car enthusiast but the people who want to be part of that world."
Hyperdrive,"not to seem like a plant or anything, but i have a couple of friends on the show and they say that most of the drivers are semipro to pro and the whole street racer thing is all marketing bullshit. also the obsticle course is pretty gnarly and there were a couple significant crashes and mechanical failures especially considering my friends car had to have the chassis straightened and pulled after the show. 

however im really worried that all the cool stuff would be overshadowed by the reality tv nonsense of it all. all the fake beef and whatever. ive only seen a couple bts clips and my friends won't tell me how far they got. so im going to watch the show until they get eliminated for sure, and depending on whether its good or not ill watch the rest"
Hyperdrive,"We didn't see much of it but the course looks stupid too. That big see-saw just looks like a gimmick, and a lot of the rest was hidden by bright neon lights and quick cuts/editing. Also the whole thing reeks of reality tv... no way is it actually going to be dangerous. IDK if I'll even give the first episode a shot."
Hyperdrive,"well, that amateur part was kinda BS, seeing as the two best drift drivers from Brazil (I live there) are participating. Both of them got good places in international championships"
Hyperdrive,Pros need to get paid lol. Netflix aint paying for that
Hyperdrive,Diego higa was 4 times the best drift pilot in brasil
Hyperdrive,Really? That's awful
Hyperdrive,[And their culture!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPsSPc-Q5hc)
Hyperdrive,"I did get the vibe a *few* scenes may have been contrived for effect, but on the whole it felt pretty genuine. I want the Polish lady and the French guy to come back for S2, for sure!"
Hyperdrive,"Seems a lot of shows are going that route. When my wife is watching Food Network competitions, every contestant has some kind of sob story of how they overcame adversity and they really want to win to show the world that they didn't get beat by whatever it was they were going through! I mean, it would be refreshing just to have someone who enjoys competing in something they're good at"
Hyperdrive,"They showed someones house in the trailer, that's in it guaranteed."
Hyperdrive,"makes sense then.  Hopefully it's quality,  Pretty much everything hes turned out has been awesome, hopefully this lives up to the rest."
Hyperdrive,same ownership but has a different feel.  Also no commercials and access to races is nice.
Hyperdrive,"I wondered about the ""street racer"" bit. There was this one douchebaggy kid who was all like ""lolol I'm an underground street racer, see you out there ya cops"". :|

Having seen the show by now (I hope) what did you think?"
Hyperdrive,"thanks for that - it does encourage me to check it out.  I share your worry about the cool driving getting overshadowed by reality show bullshit, but i guess we will have to wait and see!  
  
i love the idea of a massive driving challenge course, so hopefully they keep the focus on that"
Hyperdrive,Do you know if the show runners payed for damage or any other expenses or did you just get something if you win.
Hyperdrive,"Yep. I'm loving seeing them doing so well, but they're basically as professional as you can be as a drift driver in brasil"
Hyperdrive,"I swear to god I wish someone on chopped would answer Ted's asinine fucking question of ""what will you do with 10k?"" with something like first of all, I will pay my taxes so the better question is what will I do with 6k? I will spend it.

That is it. Just simple. I win money. I spend it. End of story. Let's judge my food.

Nope, it is either someone is helping fund their family member's 7 rare forms of cancer treatment or open up their own restaurant. Seriously? Installing a grease trap and industrial fume hood will eat that paltry sum right up. We don't need some personal story about 10k. 100k? Maybe."
Hyperdrive,"Man, I miss Roadkill on YouTube."
Hyperdrive,"i thought it was pretty good, my boy made it to third place (shredder). It is really geared towards more normal ""sorta interested in cars"" audience, which im fine with. they really broke things down so that even grandma can understand drifting to a certain degree. for the most part they kept it cool with the back stories but that street racer bit was kinda whack :/ however their production was top notch and they put together a pretty good show. i can confirm though that they did not pay for any damages other than the windshield and and when tanaguchi jumped the cop car cause that ripped his oilpan off"
Hyperdrive,i actually have no clue
Hyperdrive,same.  but oh well.
Hyperdrive,"fielding was my fave man, was rooting for him from start to finish. he was incredibly entertaining love his reckless and fearless approach, was like watching westbrook on the race track love that dude"
Hyperdrive,"Axel Francois kind of grew on me, and I would love to see him, Karolina, and Brittany all come back for an S2.

That really sucks how cheap the showrunners were about compensating the car drivers though."
Hyperdrive,they're whole schtick was that there no compensation just bragging rights... which is ok i guess because it gives a lot of exposure
Hyperdrive,"Im not really a car guy but ive watched a few episodes due to my brother. I really cant be arsed with the stories and talking crap between runs. I like seeing when they mess up, the asian guy messing up on the leveller? Awesome. Needs to really be more focused on the runs, good and bad. I also think the way its stop start on the track doesnt help."
Hyperdrive,"Honestly, I don't mind the story interstitials. You need to make these drivers into characters, and the personal tidbits do just enough to establish each as a personality worth rooting for/against. They also edit it well, spreading the backstory between each contestant's most pivotal run - rather than frontloading it.

It also may not help that I've spent the past week binging the latest season of American Ninja Warrior, and thus have started to find the cheesy character segments a little bit charming.

What I could do without is the cliffhanger endings. I get the appeal of just slipping into a new episode, but it's just so blatant and robs each episode of closure."
Hyperdrive,"Hyperdrive has the potential of being a great show ! Like mentioned by the OP, they need to change the editing of the show by staying away from the format adopted by American Ninja Warrior or Ultimate Beastmaster (another Netflix show). My older brother is a car guy and something that he hates about the show is how the announcers talks about the awesome sound of the engine but WE (the viewers) don't hear them because of the awful soundtrack and the commentators. 

Also, we want to see the complete run of EVERY contestant. Not a short montage so they can plug a cheesy montage of the story of some drivers. It's not that important. 

Let's not start about the camera angles here... Awful ! It's not Ninja Warrior, you are not filming people jumping around an obstacle course but cars going extremely fast (near 100 mph in the last straight of the track) and making hard maneuvers around a track. Bring in an editing team who knows how to film and cut a car show and you will get an awesome show.

Too bad we can't leave reviews on Netflix anymore to give them feedback on how to make this show better. Again: great concept that can be improved by better editing."
Hyperdrive,"Those commentators, god damn.

According to them every single driver had a ""message"" or ""statement"" that they were sending, but they were always very vague on what exactly that message or statement was."
Hyperdrive,"I enjoyed it. I could listen to a V8's fury all day, but they need prize money. All of these drivers, winner included, are coming out of this with thousands of dollars in needed repairs. If the show led to some fame and fortune then ok but that's yet to be seen"
Hyperdrive,What I don't get is why some got multiple shots to qualify but others got one.
Hyperdrive,"For a moment I thought this about the Nick Frost sci-fi sitcom.., might have to find that again. Will check this out too!"
Hyperdrive,"I just finished watching the qualifier shows.  I'm loving this show so far. The knockout round obstacles look even better.

A couple of the driver stories dragged on too long, but I find they keep them mostly short.  Still tons of driving time per episode."
Hyperdrive,"What kinda pissed me off and lead me to this post was episode 4 when Omar Salaymeh was apparently allowed to use his open door to hit the target and wasn't docked points. He couldn't drift for shit and that's the very strength and ability the show is supposedly focused on. You have some drivers going back to hit targets even after they were already docked time and then this guy who figured if the rules state hit the target with the side of your car then that includes just opening your door to hit them. Wow, amazing drifting buddy! If only you had somebody riding shotgun to help you get those targets on the other side. Another thing is the commentators don't seem to know shit about cars other than what they think they learned from Fast & The Furious. The one guy mentioned how because one car still had the AC compressor installed that it would make that bridge come down much faster. How much did he think it weighs? I think he was imagining a huge house AC or something under the hood. You've got heavy American muscle cars competing but damn, that guy had a heavy AC compressor."
Hyperdrive,"I got a definite similar-to-Beastmaster vibe from the format.

That being said, I liked that the announcers didn't *constantly* repeat a thing a player needed to do for the umpteenth time a contestant went through a particular segment of a race. Also, they changed up the courses more visibly each episode so there was more variety (unlike where all they might do in Beastmaster would be to swap out the bolt things for something else and that would be it)."
Hyperdrive,I watched and liked it very much. I live in turkey.  There are no such shows in my country. İs very funny show.
Hyperdrive,"The challenge is that you want the widest audience possible. Some people actually watch these shows because they emotionally connect to the contestants via the ""packages"". I don't, but to each their own."
Hyperdrive,I'm a little confused with the qualifying situation. If you were in Q1 you  basically get 4 chances to be in the top 3/6. But if you were one of the new racers in Q4 for instance you would only get one shot?... an I being stupid
Hyperdrive,"Oh well, it's an edited piece of crap (See Frechman's helmet changing during a single run) but somehow it got me invested enough. Qualifying was unfair (some people getting 4 shots some getting 1), obstacles were meh (especially leveler) and some were just outright designed to kill the car rather than highlight the driving skill.

Also, yeah, commentators were shitty and it's a shame Netflix didn't reimburse vehicle damage to the contenders."
Hyperdrive,Is no one going to comment on the finale when Corinna Graff got out of her car and then kissed her “family friend” on the lips and didn’t do the same with her husband
Celebs Go Dating,Best of luck to them on finding out where that is before you're past it.
Celebs Go Dating,TIL Luke Grimes didn’t watch season 4 of Yellowstone.
Celebs Go Dating,"Then it should’ve stopped at season 3 then, considering how terribly disappointing season 4 was."
Celebs Go Dating,Fourth season was quite poor. Zero consequences from the third season.
Celebs Go Dating,its because sheridan has to many irons in the fire. Mayor Of Kingstown was fantastic as was 1883. He needs to realize that his main writing partners are great but his b crew isnt at all.
Celebs Go Dating,"...yet here we are... After a 4th season that was 30% stock footage of cowboyin', 30% ""Jimmy goes to Texas, everyone tells him he is fucked and gonna die, then he gets there and everyone is just super nice to him and he realizes Yellowstone was a toxic work environment all along"" and 30% ""we dont know what to do with any of our main characters anymore""

....the missing 10% was occupied by Beth's boobs."
Celebs Go Dating,"I stopped watching a few episodes into season 4. I found that the story was starting to go in circles, similar to how I felt about Suits, Billions, and White Collar. I just stopped caring about the characters. I enjoyed the first three seasons even with the ridiculousness and soap opera feel at times."
Celebs Go Dating,Show is unwatchable now.  And Beth may be the worst television character ever written.
Celebs Go Dating,It Go Past Its Due Date
Celebs Go Dating,Too late.
Celebs Go Dating,Show sucks now. Beths character arc jumped the shark pretty hard last season. Pretty obvious they are trying to stretch out as long as possible regardless of what Luke says
Celebs Go Dating,"This past season was “Treading Water” in every sense of the word. 

Luke’s storyline especially, him and the Blanket Fort Gang that is his family. 

First 5 episodes his wife and kid are literally hiding upstairs under the bed and when the story finally pickups it’s to move him to tents and then ultimately finish exposed to the elements in a circle so he can rehash the foreshadowing he’s had since the Pilot that his family is doomed. 

The constant Bugs and Elmer Fudd of Beth and Jamie was parody levels at this point. How many fucking times did she ambush him in his office “unannounced” to make him grovel and be dunked on worse than the Washington Generals? Yawn. 

Costner is always aces, Rip too, those are constants in the show just like how since S1 Jesse getting too much screen time and inexplicably women fighting over him like he’s a hot prospect.. he only got cool in the end and now he’s gone from the show. 

The villains are ineffective because they are written that way, the actors are all amazing elsewhere and do what they can with what they are given but Sheridan is so AFRAID to let Beth lose or not be Deus Ex unearned. I mean she’s now a fucking hacker that can break government computers that somehow don’t have 2a authentication? Really? 
Don’t even get me started about her taking the pictures and being geo tracked by her phone to the drop point makes her as guilty as Jamie. Ugh. 

Anyways, LOVE the show and will be there for the season premiere."
Celebs Go Dating,Probably good because Kayce sucks in Season 4 🤣
Celebs Go Dating,"It was 2 episodes of plot, 6 episodes of spin off, and 2 episodes of Tyler riding a horse. It was actually awful. Nothing happened. And I'm sick of Beth."
Celebs Go Dating,"I don't think he has writing partners.  I just read that he finally had to relent and start writer's rooms for two of the shows he has coming up (One is the one with Stallone, forgot the other) because like you said, he has too many projects.  It's nothing short of a miracle that he's gotten this far by himself."
Celebs Go Dating,"Not only was the story going in circles, but so were the horses."
Celebs Go Dating,But I’m the only one you can trust Daddy 🙄
Celebs Go Dating,Good read. I will still watch but wish Beth had a proper foil to restrain her.
Celebs Go Dating,Beth is just so...evil. Evil and cruel.
Celebs Go Dating,the way they managed to fuck the first episode was quite spectacular. i know covid got in the way but the idea the family/workers did absolutely nothing for months after a family wide assassination attempt while dutton recovered is surprisingly the most unbelievable thing in the entire show of unbelievable things.
Celebs Go Dating,Gotta show off horse dancing for some god damn reason.
Celebs Go Dating,"I'm glad I'm not the only one. Season 4 felt like a completely different show than what i had watched for 3 seasons. I was expecting some serious action starting this season off, not a 5 minute montage."
Celebs Go Dating,"Her foil should be Jaime but they’ve never put him in a position where he’s beaten her even though, by every metric, he should be her equal in capability. She is wall street savvy whereas he’s government savvy."
Celebs Go Dating,She's a one-note fantasy of what a tool of a man thinks a strong woman is.
Celebs Go Dating,I just skipped the scenes starting in like the second episode.
Celebs Go Dating,Yeah it is like the show's punching bag and they need to move his character somewhere new or bring his story to an end.
Celebs Go Dating,The Garry Shandling show was also ahead of its time
Celebs Go Dating,"“What about the time I chipped my tooth on the bathroom urinal? What the fuck is so comical about that?!”

“It was a back tooth Hank.”"
Celebs Go Dating,Jeffrey Tambor was an amazing character actor for so many decades and Hey Now Hank is his best role. A shame how his career ended but his body of work still stands up.
Celebs Go Dating,"The whole “David Duchovny is not-so-secretly in love with Larry Sanders” plot was so genious, I still almost can’t believe it."
Celebs Go Dating,"His paranoia about young, hip, up and coming John Stewart was hilarious."
Celebs Go Dating,Well said! One of my all-time favourite comedies
Celebs Go Dating,"Best show ever!  


The Office and Arrested Development owe it a huge debt."
Celebs Go Dating,“You See That Sign Flashing There? It Says…Applesauce.”.
Celebs Go Dating,"One of the best comedy shows ever for sure. I'm so glad it's streaming these days because for like 2 decades the only way to watch it, well outside of the US I guess, was late night VHS recordings from ITV2 (crap English channel)"
Celebs Go Dating,"So many memorable lines…  I haven’t seen the show in years, so apologies for the inevitable inaccuracies in the following:  

[From the episode where Hank’s sex tape gets out…]  
Larry: Is it me or is Hank really well hung?  
Artie: Well, don’t forget the camera adds 10 pounds.  

[From the series finale]  
Tom Petty: (whining) Aw, but I wanted to be your Bette Midler!  
[OP: How many people nowadays would get this is a reference to Midler singing on Carson’s last show?]  
[From the same episode]  
Artie: Sorry, the show is running late, we’ll have to bump you to next week. 
Bruno Kirby: Are you crazy? There are no more shows. This is the last show dammit.  
Artie: (Choking up) I know it is son, I know. 

[Larry having to piss badly as his previous attempts at leaving during the show breaks were thwarted]  
Larry: Artie, at the next break, clear the hallway to the bathroom. Warn the staff that it’s going to be out, and it’s going to be spraying. 

[When a show is going particularly badly]  
Larry: Artie, if I had a gun now I’d put it to my head, and stand close to you so that hopefully just the one bullet would take us both out. 

[Edit: fixed line breaks]"
Celebs Go Dating,"The finest. 

'Ask for Nickoli'"
Celebs Go Dating,"‘Did you shit on my car, Hank?’

‘Oh no yeah I heard him say he didn’t want to go for the whole neurotic jew thing…’

Gold."
Celebs Go Dating,Use hey now in a sentence!
Celebs Go Dating,If I had my druthers...there'd be no world hunger.
Celebs Go Dating,***HEY NOW***
Celebs Go Dating,Hey now!  Absolutely amazing show.  Brilliant.  And still hasn’t lost a beat. RIP Garry Shandling
Celebs Go Dating,"My favorite episode is when Larry Sanders dates Sharon Stone. The clash of the two Hollywood egos was amazingly insightful. And the way they finally broke up was hilarious.

EDIT: And here is the episode:

https://youtu.be/feALDIaXqpc"
Celebs Go Dating,"I've just started watching this for the first time.  Fuckin brilliant from the beginning.  

I'm still midway through season 1, but I've read Jeremy Piven leaves the show.  I wish they'd used him more."
Celebs Go Dating,"I love the show, but like with a lot of shows that were ahead of their time, it’s pretty inconsistent imo. There are some really strange episodes and moments that don’t quite work for me. At times, it seems like it almost wants o go for a more realistic approach, but it ends up still feeling like a multi-cam sitcom half the time, in a weird way. It exists sort of between the worlds of what TV comedies have become over the last couple decades (The Office, Curb, Sunny, Arrested Development) and traditional sitcoms. That leaves it feeling a bit dated but still quite good (imo of course), with moments of genius here and there."
Celebs Go Dating,*It's Gary Shandling's show
Celebs Go Dating,Great show with one of the best theme songs ever.
Celebs Go Dating,Another show sorely missing from the streamiverse.
Celebs Go Dating,Fucking hell that shit was funny. The sex tape episode was one of the funniest episodes of tv Ive ever seen.
Celebs Go Dating,Jesus that kills me every time
Celebs Go Dating,"Boy he got cancelled and seems to have stayed cancelled. So many others came back from it, i guess he's retired."
Celebs Go Dating,And Hank buying Elvis Costelllo's car.  The whole episode makes me laugh outloud thinking about it.
Celebs Go Dating,"Don't forget 30 Rock!  Larry Sanders and 30 Rock are two of the very few comedies that I have saved to offline media.  Larry's comedy is potent enough that I expect some random Garry Shandling scene to offend some fringe niche group horribly enough for episodes to be removed, which was what happened with 30 Rock.

Also I feel like some early Conan has been very heavily inspired by bits from this show."
Celebs Go Dating,Where is it streaming in the UK?
Celebs Go Dating,"My personal favorite line delivery is when Roseanne is helping Larry overcome his addiction and she brings his staff to his house for an intervention and Larry asks what everyone’s doing here on a work day. 

And Artie with his usual happy and caring but somehow dismissive tone goes “Hey ya sport it’s Saturday.”"
Celebs Go Dating,One of the best episodes of television maybe ever.
Celebs Go Dating,“Here’s my friend Hank Kingsley………..Hey Now!”
Celebs Go Dating,"And I hate to take this thread there, but Sharon Stone in that episode? My god."
Celebs Go Dating,"Not a lot of new television comedies being developed at the moment, and it would probably be hard to land a part as an old guy at this point, even without his controversies, so it’s hard to say."
Celebs Go Dating,"  


I never thought about the early Conan / Larry similarities before! Conan has always played ""himself"" as a perpetually unpopular and transparently needy talk show host so there's definitely a tonal overlap between his Late Nite persona and TLSS."
Celebs Go Dating,"Don’t know about that, as Conan started around the same time as TLS. It would be awfully strange to draw inspiration from a factionalized talk show from a sitcom that was on the at the same time as your own real talk show. And Gary was parodying cliches from actual talk shows, and the backstage environment. The fictional TLS didn’t really do much that set itself apart from traditional talk shows, and Conan’s show, while a bit edgy and crass compared to other contemporary shows, was still very much a traditional talk show format, so naturally there would be some similarities."
Celebs Go Dating,"♫ They'll never stop the Titans  
Have no fears, we've got stories for years ♫"
Celebs Go Dating,"TTG is basically It’s Always Sunny if they had superpowers. Lots of yelling, lots of black and gray morality. But it is funny."
Celebs Go Dating,"Another tv movie? Cool, last few have been fun."
Celebs Go Dating,Is this show still 80% of Cartoon Network's lineup?
Celebs Go Dating,"The episode about the rental income property was hilarious!  

I know I’m way too old for this show, but it’s one of my fav."
Celebs Go Dating,I don’t care. TTG is funny
Celebs Go Dating,"multiverses, so hot right now."
Celebs Go Dating,"Damn, gonna hit 400 episodes with this season.

Really interested in how they're gonna top their 'Self-Indulgent 200th Episode Spectacular!', featuring the Titans going out through the fourth wall, meeting the cast and crew who make the show, and even try their own hands at creating an episode. Plus, ['Work On an Episode'](https://youtu.be/LgPKkE09O9Y) is an absolute banger. 

I'm really glad how common sentiment on the internet has been moving away from endlessly shitting on this show, when it's actually really good, once they started getting in a groove and figuring out what exactly this show is beyond Teen Titans but sillier.

There are a large number of episodes that I can very easily recommend to anyone who's curious about the true greatness of this show.

To start with, 40%40%20%. That is all."
Celebs Go Dating,What happened to the teaser with the old titans after the movie? Did they ever say anything in the show?
Celebs Go Dating,I’m in my 30s and I watch this with my kid. We both crack up at the same things. Says more about me lol. But it’s so witty. I love this show.
Celebs Go Dating,"I feel like a few years back this show was getting way touch hate from people upset it replaced old TT.
It's freaking funny AF.
The movie had me belly laughing."
Celebs Go Dating,Always good to see the cast of this get another season.
Celebs Go Dating,Work on an episode
Celebs Go Dating,"This show has always felt similar to the Sonic Boom cartoon to me. It’s vastly different from the source material, has a fun ridiculous sense of humour and has a bunch of smart jokes in it. Plus, it uses the characters in fun ways"
Celebs Go Dating,"Wake me up when Beetlejuice gets his inevitable spinoff. WB clearly wants to make him their Deadpool figure, and they've dumped HUGE amounts of money into keeping the Beetlejuice musical alive and keeping Alex Brightman as the face and voice of the character."
Celebs Go Dating,Why are people suddenly shilling this over the OG cartoon?
Celebs Go Dating,Bahahahah suck on that some more OGTT. Shit-ass faux-anime wanna be. TTGO for ever.
Celebs Go Dating,Yawnfest
Celebs Go Dating,Why won’t it die
Celebs Go Dating,"I've always said the same thing, it's very similar to Always Sunny in that the show is more about the characters now, you can put them in any situation and it'll be good just because of who they are. 

I love how you can pretty much boil any TTG episode down to 'Robin lecture-yells at the rest of the Titans over X subject'.

Where X can be anything - investing in rental property, quantum physics, the premiere of a cartoon remake of a beloved action cartoon from their youth (hmm, that sounds kinda familiar...), dungeons and dragons... Literally anything."
Celebs Go Dating,The music ain’t bad either
Celebs Go Dating,"Based on last week alone? No.  It's on for a 2 hour block of six fifteen minute episodes each day. 

Gumball takes up more of the schedule just barely."
Celebs Go Dating,"No, I get it.  My grandkids watch this and I am totally won over by the clever writing and absurdist humor.  Plus, it's mostly good, clean fun.  Kind of a spiritual successor to the old Looney Tunes from back in my day."
Celebs Go Dating,I'm too old for it too but I unironically enjoyed the Oregon Trail episode. In fact it gave me some chuckles. Not a fan but it doesn't deserve the hate it gets.
Celebs Go Dating,"> I don’t care. TTG is funny

I feel like you guys are years after having won this arguement."
Celebs Go Dating,It got funny after they finally found their groove. The first few seasons are a bit mean-spirited imo.
Celebs Go Dating,They had that Teen Titans Go vs Teen Titans movie back in 2019... I wonder if this is just gonna be a sequel to that
Celebs Go Dating,"The biggest reason the show was ever criticized wasn't for the quality of the show itself, but because fans saw it as a replacement for the previous Teen Titans show.  On it's own yeah, it's actually a really funny show at times."
Celebs Go Dating,[deleted]
Celebs Go Dating,"“The Night Begins To Shine” special and “Two Parter” are my personal favorites. TTG manages to be a pretty consistently funny trenchant satire and I’m also glad that the internet has ended being needlessly critical of the show. 

Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath are both very talented and they really stuck the ending when it came to the theatrical film."
Celebs Go Dating,Yeah it was teasing Teen Titans vs Teen Titans Go!
Celebs Go Dating,But it’ll never be as good as TT
Celebs Go Dating,A Beetlejuice cartoon? [That would be crazy.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096543/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
Celebs Go Dating,"Isn't the musical not even that profitable for WB, in comparison to some of their other properties that are musicals?"
Celebs Go Dating,"Why does their have to be a ""better""?  We can love both!"
Celebs Go Dating,Where is anyone saying this is better than the old cartoon?
Celebs Go Dating,"Because it’s loved  by kids  and teens alike is well written is made quickly and well 

And makes  peopel happy 


There there’s your awnser"
Celebs Go Dating,Idk ask SpongeBob
Celebs Go Dating,Wasn't Gumball cancelled years ago?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,that seems like a pretty standard dystopian story move. it's an easy way to fill episodes out and explore the characters before everything went to hell. it's also cheap to shoot in standard before-world so you don't have to use the budget creating and decorating another set with dirt and firefly posters
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,We about to get the tutorial as a TV series
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I liked how Lost gave back stories to characters. Each episode would cut away a few times showing the survivor's life before the crash.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"If I had to guess, the first episode is 30-45 mins of regular life and maybe ends with **that** moment."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Makes sense for an adaptation. Gives it a little more weight and easily leads into the games intro.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,First episode is going to be Joel filing his taxes. Episode 2 is him mailing stuff at the post office.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"How well it will go, totally depends on how much time they're actually spending on ""life before"". I'd imagine most show watchers have been burned out about stupid filler material and spending too much time on ""before the outbreak"" would be just that. People aren't watching the show to see the normal lives."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I recently started Party Down and now that I picture everyone who bitches about sci-fi or fantasy on the internet as Roman from that show it all makes more sense.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"In these kinds of movies I love the part just before the outbreak starts. Where the main characters hear rumours of what's happening, but shit has not hit the fan yet. You start feeling tense as you wait for it. And then BOOM! The outbreak happens and there's chaos. You see how bewildered and uncomprehending they are about what's going on as they try to grapple with the unbelievable situation."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Isn’t life before the outbreak just a crappy family drama?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"So… like normal life?

Why the hell do we want to see that?"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"""HBOs new show will finally set up the story"""
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I just don't want to see another Station Eleven situation where the interesting post apocalypse setting gets sidelined to drag the audience through meaningless identity melodrama at upper class dinner parties from the Before Time. I know it's a cheap and easy way to pad the runtime, but you kill your pacing when you wallow around in flashbacks that don't matter and a setting that isn't relevant anymore. Civilization is gone and 90% of people are dead, nobody cares that your rich parents were mean to your lesbian girlfriend at Christmas before they died and money became irrelevant. 

I would hope that flashback use will be brief and relevant."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I have always wanted to see Joel file his taxes
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Life before the outbreak is our normal ass timeline up until October 2013. Sounds like mundane filler.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,First game can be done in 8 eps. 2nd game can be done in 2 seasons if they want to streech. How many seasons did they say they would make ??
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Watch out reddit, here comes the “they’re running this show before it comes out” crowd."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Didnt the writers/creators/producers just come out the other day and say a few days ago that the show would not deviate from the games?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,That would be funny if it turns out to be a rom-com set in the year before the zombie apocalypse.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Press X to doubt.  I've heard this song and dance before.  I'm talking to you Fear the Walking Dead.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Could they not? We know what life was like before the outbreak. Exactly like it is right now.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Because that’s the exciting part, right?"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I hope it’s not an inundation of past scenes like they did with the Resident Evil joke of a series
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,They are gonna spend an entire episode dedicated to Sarah and make us fall in love with her before...ya know...aren't they?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,That's called filler. It's the hallmark of a cashgrab.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Fair enough but I'm really hoping it's not full of flashbacks all the time.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Sounds like Black Summer
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Bet they'll show a bunch of doubters and anti-xxx groups thinking this ""massive outbreak"" is a hoax, and they all inevitably spread the virus."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Last of Us had possibly the best intro of any game. I'd be interested in seeing some more build-up to the intro sequence and further exploring Joels relationship with his daughter.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Does anyone actually care? Life before the apocalypse is just real life.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"If it’s well done, I enjoy the thrill of a societal breakdown on screen. Means you have to have normal first. Like others have said though, I hope it’s not overdone."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I love watching the setup to fungal zombie plagues just as much as I like watching it unfolding! Yay!!
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,It’s a good move for anyone who has not played the game.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Putting my money on the major premise being people acting like the outbreak is “fake news” up until the point that it consumes the world.  And then some.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,“Last of us Director scrambling to make 8 hour video game a full series”
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I feel like hollywood has bastardized what “backstory” means. I dont need to know where Joel went to school and the childhood fights with his brother through multiple flashbacks over multiple episodes. All I need to know about him is that he was a single dad, he and his daughter had a good relationship, and his brother is close enough that when shit hits the fan they rely on each other. TLOU game set up his character beautifully in 15min, I dont see any reason to extend it. 

They could literally do a shot for shot remake of the video game and it would win multiple awards."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"oh god, they are going to make me rrrrrreally love Sarah this time. I mean, it was emotional enough losing her in the game and that was just a bit at the start!"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,ive always wanted this. yayyyy
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Did walmart Joel work at Walmart or target?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I can’t be the only one that finds one of the favorite part of apocalypse movies/shows is the beginning where no one really knows what’s happening yet and then it’s just chaos. I’m excited to see it expanded. 

Like the baseball game in Quiet Place 2 or Rick’s hospital wake up and the Atlanta bombing in TWD."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,So TWD with humans being the main bad guys and then zombies…wait a second
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Keep telling ya this is gonna suck. I don't want it to, but everything is pointing in the wring direction"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I honestly im only interested in the Life Before the outbreak on the opening scene. After that? it will probably be filler scenes to reduce costs and it honestly... doesnt look interesting to me.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Oh good. Because there's nothing more interesting than watching normal people go about their lives in a normal world.... *That's* the stuff *I* want to see in a zombie survival show...
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,So the least entertaining part?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I'm ok with this. They have to flesh things out somehow. I'd be cool with flash backs. I want to see where Bill got his magazines.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"4 seasons in, there is no outbreak, but they continually end each episode with a sit down at the TV when some ""big news"" is hitting the world.

And next episode, it's just some dumb shit some celebrity did. Then the writers continue on making their own creation with ""Last of Us"" in name only"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"My two cents: I felt that TLOU’s story was so effective because the pre-pande… errr, outbreak life of characters we followed was barely-remembered, save for a few, sharp, painful reminders of loss (like Joel’s “God, I miss coffee.”). Us seeing that in clear recollection might take away from that."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Saving money on FX…yay…I’m sure that won’t hurt the story at all
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,So...filler before the real story?
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,*yawn*
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Why
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,That sounds..........horrible.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Cue protracted, soapy flashbacks to keep the budget down."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I think the casting for Ellie is terrible but what really made me laugh is the director told her specifically *not* to play the video game. You know the shows gonna be flaming dog shit when the director says something as ridiculous as that. Oh don't go view any of the source material your acting for, because ? Some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,“Sigh” no spores now inventing new story before the show has even aired. Strike 1 and 2…
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Awesome... That's always what I said was missing from the game... Normal life before the outbreak.

This is basically ""we have budget for 30 minutes of CG so the other 20 minutes we just want normal shit. Also we want to avoid people watching 55 minutes of two white people walking around so this will allow us to be inclusive and diverse with our casting. Big win all around boys."""
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I hate this
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Druckman going give Joel a backstory to make him into an absolute monster? Probably.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Hope they don't do it like they did with The Passage. :'(
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,It’s going to be the first 22 episodes as life before the outbreak and the last two episodes of the season will be the initial two hours of the outbreak. I’m so excited!!!
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Don’t care.  If it doesn’t build the characters is some new and interesting way it’s just drivel filler to make a season longer.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,If they want to save money and go cheap why not just make the season shorter and save us from the bullshit filler backstory.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,This feels like it's being overhyped everyday. I really hope it's good
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,The First of Us
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Oh great, it’s gonna be like Lost with a shit ton of flashbacks, isn’t it?"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Start the episode with Joel holding Sarah at her birth.

End the episode with you-know-what."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Going to skip that, not watching this show to see everyday life."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Bad idea, show's a lack of confidence in the core idea. I've seen enough post-apocalyptic shows to know that you don't want to spend too much time mired in a story that's outside of the basic genre that draws people to the show. You only have so much time each episode to tell the story you want to tell. How much of that story actually takes place in this genre setting? Are people going to watch a post-apocalypse show that spends half its time in a pre-apocalyptic world? I want to see the story that plays out because of this scifi conceit, not slowly put together a character's backstory through jumbled and selective flashbacks. Let me see those character traits develop through this unique, genre based story. I can see down to earth dramas on many, many other series."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Wtf 
Didn’t they say they were jus strictly adapting the games? There’s like 10 minutes of “before the outbreak” in the whole series"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Awesome :)
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I highly recommend The Hollywood Reporter article that came out this week, lots of news and cool stories.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-hbo-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-interview-1235290103/amp/"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,How boring
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,uh oh
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Probably with flashbacks, or just how the show starts. Maybe like s1 of the walking dead if i had to guess. 

But we’re not here for that. The game was great in no small part because the story was good. Don’t fuck that up."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Aside from character introductions I don't see a need for a pre break out existence. The main character gets a cheap coffee and gas at the local Gulf. His wife calls saying that she has a cough......crap goes south pretty quick. 

Jump to current time. Main character wishes for the old days where he could easily get cheap coffee at the local Gulf.

Basically I get it. Life was normal. We already live that now. I don't need to see it."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Yes, when Hollywood runs out of idea just make it a prequel or sequel. But prequel is becoming more and more prevalent these days."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Sounds boring as hell. Like how they took the halo series and made it women talking to each other about master chiefs feelings
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"For a tv show it's good to build up to certain deaths, it brings more emotion and in the game some things happened too fast.....hint."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I’m not gonna lie, the trailers for this have been very underwhelming for me, and I loved the original game"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,My biggest gripe was jumping forward immediately 20 years. Was hoping for more collapse gameplay.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Flashbacks, there's not a trope I hate more than fucking flashbacks."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"This is gonna be shit!

Slap a remind me on this bad boy after 15th Jan."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I hope it happens at the start of the show instead of flashbacks throughout the show. I fucking hate flashbacks.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez, BORINGGGGGG
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"To me, this is a red flag. The writers desperately wanted to add themselves to the story, so they found a small spot where they can."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,Can't wait to see what contemporary political issues they try to shoehorn into this
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"So I’m gonna have to sit through at least two episodes before we get to the good stuff, great."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"You mean to tell me there will be BACKSTORIES

do tell"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"I wouldn't mind if we got a game before #1 that highlights the 20 year gap, could improve on some side characters that were thrown dead quickly"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,I would’ve preferred the same beginning as the game but without the sudden time jump.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,So Sarah will get a lot more screen time!
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"Eh, I’ll check it out once it’s over.  Most video game adaptations are horrendous, nothing here is telling us that this is going to be good."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,[deleted]
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"You can tell from the comments in all these TLOU threads that there's a subset of gamer bros who are going to hate this show no matter how good it is. If you're getting worked up about minor changes, you are doomed. 

Changes are good to an extent, the show has to have its own identity or else what's the point? This whole ""follow the source material"" extremism is going too far. The Witcher show, for example, isn't struggling because they deviated from source material per say, it's because the changes are poorly written. It doesn't mean changes suck in general.

If the show runners are actually passionate about the source material then they will  honor it but you have to allow them the freedom to express their own take on it or it's just a hollow retelling of the same story and what's the point of that?"
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,If it does a Lost type approach each episode i won't bother watching. I hated that method of story telling.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,So... regular society than? Seems pretty dumb to me.
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,"This is good! The way the original game starts isn't as strong as it could be. It gets dramatic far too quickly, and major emotional scenes between characters are not yet earned. 

I think it's the biggest problem the first game has, the story just needs at least a little more time to establish the characters.

On a replay, the player is already invested in the characters and it is easy to forget this was an issue.

And as a whole, the television series should be giving us portions of the timeline the games could not, else the series be redundant."
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,[deleted]
Apache: The Life of Carlos Tevez,This show sounds more and more like it is going to fucking suck
Diagnosis,She already went through a lot damn it man
Diagnosis,"Applegate:

>”There was the sense of, ‘Well, let’s get her some medicine so she can get better. And there is no better. But it was good for me. I needed to process my loss of my life, my loss of that part of me. So I needed that time.”

>”The powers that be were like, ‘Let’s just stop. We don’t need to finish it. Let’s put a few episodes together.’ I said, ‘No. We’re going to do it, but we’re going to do it on my terms.'”

>Applegate also said that she had put on 40 pounds and “can’t walk without a cane” but hopes people are able to overlook her physical appearance.

>“If people hate it, if people love it, if all they can concentrate on is, ‘Ooh, look at the cripple,’ that’s not up to me. I’m sure that people are going to be, like, ‘I can’t get past it. Fine, don’t get past it, then. But hopefully, people can get past it and just enjoy the ride and say goodbye to these two girls.”

The final season of Dead to Me releases Nov. 17th."
Diagnosis,"Christina Applegate seems like a legit nice lady and she's always fun to see on screen, it really is a bitch that some people get more than their share of shittiness like that."
Diagnosis,This is heartbreaking I feel for her so much. She struggled with breast cancer and now this it's horrible. She is an amazing actress and made this show so great. I hope she will be able to continue to do what she loves. The show is very enjoyable and I am glad she was able to finish it! I commend her that could not have been easy at all.
Diagnosis,"I had no idea about this. Absolutely awful for her, but very selfishly I’m glad we are getting another season of this great show. Jen and Judy’s friendship is one of the most well written and believable on television"
Diagnosis,So sad to hear about the diagnosis. I loved her in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead as a kid.
Diagnosis,"Christina Applegate is an actress who should have had a much better career than she had.  Don’t get me wrong, she’s had a great career but she should be part of Hollywood’s A-list elite rather then on the periphery of it.

I think her career has been subject to some unfortunate timing and creative descissions when they have tried to give her her own vehicle.  But still, even in bad projects she’s been involved with, she is the highlight and shines.

Wish her the best."
Diagnosis,Let's give a quick shout-out to Christina Applegate
Diagnosis,"Some of those quotes are devastating. Dead to Me is an incredible show, probably the most impressive mix of comedy and tragedy that I’ve seen and Christina and Linda are both so good in it. It’s going to be sad seeing it end along with knowing that this is probably the last big project Christina Applegate will be able to do."
Diagnosis,Aw man. Selma Blair and now Christina Applegate?
Diagnosis,"This makes me not feel good :( I hope things get better for her. I know there’s no cure for her condition, but she’s such a wonderful spirit, just sucks."
Diagnosis,"Nobody says FUCK like her. 

She to me (being the same age) has always be gorgeous and funny. 

She is so underrated, she held her own in Anchorman, look at that cast. 

Few celebrities I feel bad for, for her, she has my total sympathy"
Diagnosis,"Let's give a quick Shout out to Christina Applegate for her commitment! *YES*

But seriously bringing people joy and laugh could be a great way to lift up the mood and motivated her to fight for cancer.  Hope she's doing well."
Diagnosis,This is so sad.  I had no idea.  I'm really looking forward to the third season of 'Dead to Me' but I suppose it will be bittersweet.
Diagnosis,[deleted]
Diagnosis,I’ve come to the conclusion that Christina Applegate is a fucking gangsta.
Diagnosis,"Fuck, she's been through a lot already, and now this?"
Diagnosis,This is really depressing news. I have a friend with MS and it’s no joke.
Diagnosis,"This is heartbreaking news! I absolutely love her in everything I’ve seen her in. Definitely an underrated actress, so smart & talented. One of my fav movies is the Sweetest Thing and Cameron Diaz is the big name in that movie but Christina steals the movie for me, the dressing room montage with the pretty woman scene-the best!"
Diagnosis,"currently re-watching Samantha Who? on Hulu & it’s amazing✨ if anyone is wanting some more Christina Applegate in their daily lives, highly recommend!"
Diagnosis,Wishing her nothing but the best.
Diagnosis,After everything she has MS? That is bullshit. I have family with MS and it can be terrible. And she's finishing this fantastic series on top of that? Damn I respect her even more. I hope for the best for her.
Diagnosis,Why did they hide it? Could they have written it in to the character?
Diagnosis,"Wow.  I haven't watched this show, but her commitment to it definitely makes me want to."
Diagnosis,"She’s so ridiculously talented, intelligent, graceful, beautiful… the list goes on, and life doesn’t give a fuck about any of that. The only choice to what life dishes out, is to continue it with dignity and on our terms. She’s a Fucking Queen."
Diagnosis,"Oh man!  She is a cancer survivor and now she has MS.

Hang in there Christina, hopefully they can manage your symptoms enough for you to continue working."
Diagnosis,im glad she is doing this. giving her audience closure. and also ms is a difficult and expensive disease. we know enough about us health care so extra money will be helpful in her condition. not that she would need it.
Diagnosis,Good for her. Do it your way!
Diagnosis,"Glad to see that she’s staying positive, she’s had some tough challenges."
Diagnosis,Does the universe have it out for her? Wtf.
Diagnosis,Let's hear it for Christina Applegate
Diagnosis,The only one I really liked off of Married.  Although I liked the parents better on other shows later on.
Diagnosis,I love Tits mcGee
Diagnosis,"For whatever reason, I feel connected to her, and empathize with her situation. 

Feel like she simultaneously got dealt a great hand and a shit hand. 

Aces and Eights."
Diagnosis,"I would have understood if they didn’t film season 3 but after the cliffhanger from season 2, I’m so glad they did. Christina Applegate is amazing"
Diagnosis,Damn. She is a real one👏
Diagnosis,"A true professional. 

A shining light from her industry."
Diagnosis,Let's give her a quick shoutout
Diagnosis,"Nothing but pure respect for Christina. I'm so eager for S3, I know she's said she probably won't watch and worries over how the fans will perceive the changes her body has gone through due to MS, but I believe the fans will rally and give her nothing but love and support."
Diagnosis,Just dropping in to say that Christina Applegate is one of my favorite people in Hollywood.  I wish her nothing but the best.
Diagnosis,What a bad ass. It sucks to see good people get dealt a shit hand.
Diagnosis,"She has MS? Oh, no!"
Diagnosis,"She is such a gem, I love forward to seeing this cane and all!"
Diagnosis,I’m really sorry to hear about this. Wishing her all the best.
Diagnosis,Had no idea she had MS.  She’s amazing.
Diagnosis,After reading all the great reviews about the show I can’t wait to watch the show. It sounds like she has a real approach to life and that’s so refreshing. Big respect ❤️
Diagnosis,Dead to me first season was fantastic. I need to catch up. Hope her the best 🙏🙏
Diagnosis,"As long as she doesn't turn out to be the third twin of her dead husband, I can accept everything."
Diagnosis,this is the first I've heard of this diagnosis. poor woman that sucks.
Diagnosis,Really happy that they finished the show.
Diagnosis,Hey let's give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate!
Diagnosis,She has been acting my whole life. I hope she finishes well and takes a well deserved rest.
Diagnosis,"I’m glad she can live off residuals and investments enjoy her life before she get too sick. She made it. We talk about her, it’s done. Famous, wealthy  and good at her job. Take a break. I’m nobody."
Diagnosis,MS is pretty hardcore.
Diagnosis,As long as it doesn't have the other girl randomly crying throughout the season. It seemed like overacting.
Diagnosis,"Wait..I thought the show got cancelled?

Edit: why am I getting downvoted? I was deeply disappointed when I heard it was cancelled. I didn’t know they were finishing up one more season"
Diagnosis,I wonder if she had mono when she was younger
Diagnosis,[deleted]
Diagnosis,"Wait, is Christina Applegate alive? Or am I thinking of Brittany Murphey"
Diagnosis,Dead to me. Everyone cries. 10x per episode minimum. Stopped watching that show.
Diagnosis,40 pounds? Try 60 (me) 😁
Diagnosis,"I’m not really ‘celeb crazy’ but I’ve always enjoyed Christina Applegate and followed her career. Really hate hearing this, to be honest. Sucks that bad things happen to good people."
Diagnosis,Man that's a such a shame she was diagnosed with MS. I've been a fan of her work since she was on Married With Children.
Diagnosis,I had no idea she had MS as well.  That’s crazy that her and Selma Blair have it.
Diagnosis,"By all accounts, one of the nicest ones in the industry... nobody deserves what she's dealt with but certainly not her."
Diagnosis,"I have a friend who had MS and went for controversial surgery in Mexico, where they used her own stem cells to replace her bone marrow. I was super dubious  but it actually worked for her. I was happy to be wrong."
Diagnosis,"What had happened to her? I'm sorry I'm a bit outta the loop

Edit: I just saw another comment mention had a fight with breast cancer. Man that sucks"
Diagnosis,No kidding. She seems like one of the good ones. I feel horrible for her.
Diagnosis,How can you not love that woman.
Diagnosis,[deleted]
Diagnosis,[deleted]
Diagnosis,Wow.
Diagnosis,Think this is probably a huge reason why the upcoming Married With Children revival is going to be animated instead
Diagnosis,Ms diagnosis feels like something erasing who you are or were. It doesn't happen gradually either. Flares spike you and it's the inflammation that causes the damage. Took me a year and a half to even feel a tad normal again which was just a small vacation of relief followed by always feeling like being hung over. Even cognitive thought was taxing.....I hate ms
Diagnosis,MS is a terrible and frightening diagnosis.
Diagnosis,"I really didn’t like Dead to Me (mostly because I saw every twist coming a mile away and it just felt goofy), but I LOVED Applegate in it. She’s so good at playing bitchy- I love her appearances on Friends as Rachel’s selfish horrible sister haha."
Diagnosis,"Honestly, she doesn’t seem that nice to me. Just real as fuck and above the bullshit. I respect her a lot - that’s better to me than being nice (which I mostly interpret as fake these days). She actually seems super antisocial in the interviews I’ve heard from her. Love her for entertaining me on TV my whole life."
Diagnosis,"She was secretly the star of Married with Children. Nailed every line, made every motion funny, extreme talent on display."
Diagnosis,"I'm right on top of that, Rose!"
Diagnosis,One of my favorite movies
Diagnosis,"I think part of her career trajectory can, for better or worse, be tied to how well she played Kelly Bundy. Another classic case of being so iconic and great in a role that people were reluctant to see her as anything other than the dumb, slutty girl."
Diagnosis,She really held her own in Anchorman and I don’t believe her role is talked about enough with all the other hilarious performances.
Diagnosis,"I think Kelly Bundy overshadowed the real Christina, and it hurt her- I don't think she was taken seriously for a while after ""Married With Children"" ended.  The fact that she's got some real comedic chops was a revelation to a lot of people (myself included).

Add on to that the loss of her mother to breast cancer, then her battle with it, I think she was out of the game for a while.

It's too bad- she's a very funny, charming and likeable actress."
Diagnosis,She comes from that era where there were television actors and there were movie actors. It was hard to crossover from TV to mainstream film regardless of talent. Consider Bryan Cranston who had to play one of the greatest TV characters of all time before he started getting decent Hollywood roles. Even after playing Hal he was stuck doing some AMC drama playing a school teacher before his momentum built in movies.
Diagnosis,"""It's like, 90 degrees...""  
  
*vomits* ""Lauren, what's going on with you?"""
Diagnosis,"“Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity? Your total disregard for other people’s feelings?!?!?!”

“Uhhh, to name a few!”

I love her as Amy Green in Friends."
Diagnosis,This is what i came for
Diagnosis,Jamie-Lynn Sigler as well :(
Diagnosis,Which is so crazy - they were both in The Sweetest Thing with Cameron Diaz. What are the odds?
Diagnosis,Oh yea. I love how he can seemingly just pop up on a show and play a part within his range with the disease and it's great. I can see her being able to do that as well.
Diagnosis,"I'm out of the loop, prior to MS what had happened?"
Diagnosis,Love The Sweetest Thing! So funny. Doesn’t Selma Blair also have MS?
Diagnosis,That is such an underrated show.
Diagnosis,My guess is she will be doing a lot of sitting or maybe leaning on things
Diagnosis,She's a SAG union member so she has life time healthcare.
Diagnosis,"Doesn't matter she most likely has ppms which is the kind
that has no treatment...money can't buy you a cure if it
does not exist."
Diagnosis,Tits McGee has the night off.
Diagnosis,"She FINALLY, after all these years, had a hit t.v. show that was getting her raves. I'm glad she got to finish it out on her terms."
Diagnosis,It was but they had one more season scheduled.
Diagnosis,yes..mono from ages 10-20 triples risk of ms
Green Frontier,"Per IMDb:

> When a young Bogotá-based detective gets drawn into the jungle to investigate four femicides, she uncovers magic, Nazis and her own true origins."
Green Frontier,Instantly though of Green Inferno just from the screenshot. Sounds similar too. Not watching that video at work though.
Green Frontier," Amazonian jungle could be a great setting for a dark detective/horror story, and I really like the atmosphere in this trailer. I’ll definitely check it out."
Green Frontier,"I can't for next years ""Triple Green Frontier""."
Green Frontier,Frenchie indie horror.
Green Frontier,Off brand Green Inferno xD
Green Frontier,"Looks pretty exploitative. 

""Look at all these savages ripping the heart out of their victims for their dumb religion! I guess I won't feel so bad anymore when their homes are destroyed due to rapid rainforest deforestation."""
Green Frontier,"More 'woke' Netflix BS.

They cater to a tiny fraction of the country, then wonder why they lose subscribers."
Green Frontier,no description?  why would i watch this video?
Green Frontier,I am not 100% convinced that description isn't a test of a neural network for creating plot summaries
Green Frontier,>	femicides
Green Frontier,Sounds equal part stupid and amazing at the same time.
Green Frontier,">she uncovers magic, Nazis and her own true origins.

That's not how I expected that sentence to end."
Green Frontier,It’s like someone wrote that on a napkin in the Netflix canteen and then gave it to their boss as a lark...
Green Frontier,"That's the plot, except the Nazi part, of effectively half of Canadian made television"
Green Frontier,Has to be a joke....
Green Frontier,"I don’t think it will be at all like that. Green Inferno was a shitty b-movie with horrible, retrograde portrayals of indigenous people. This series is showrun by Ciro Guerra who makes thought-provoking anti-colonialist films with fully fleshed out indigenous characters. 

I highly recommend checking out his movie _Embrace of the Serpent_. It’s beautiful."
Green Frontier,"This is Colombian, but okay."
Green Frontier,"Which is off brand Cannibal Holocaust.

Still haven't seen either but they're on my list."
Green Frontier,Not at all. The indigenous people here are the protagonists.
Green Frontier,"I doubt it, the creator of this series Ciro Guerra directed Embrace of the Serpent and Birds of Passage, two anti-colonialist movies about indigenous people"
Green Frontier,That's the kind of attitude that excludes us from enjoying interesting settings for movies/series. There are real actual tribal people in the world with bare feet and basic tools and some of them might even kill people. Why shouldn't they be represented in the media?
Green Frontier,Damn you just convinced me to watch this!!  Thank you bro! Didn't want to watch the trailer since we all know just how bad Netflix is with the spoilers in their trailers so again thank you for the recommendation!
Green Frontier,"By tiny fraction of the country do you mean the entire country Colombia (where this show is produced) plus all the other Spanish-speaking countries in the world? Heck I don’t even speak Spanish and I’m super interested. You realize Netflix is available worldwide, so they make content to cater to all their markets, right? 

Dumbass."
Green Frontier,"I bet the video would describe, or ""tease"", he premise."
Green Frontier,"What's the alternative?, menicides?, men killed by women?"
Green Frontier,no homo
Green Frontier,She originates from magic nazis?
Green Frontier,"Yeah, he is one of the best directors working today."
Green Frontier,"Word, saw Green inferno which was underwhelming, very meh given, not really aged well i guess."
Green Frontier,Good
Green Frontier,"For what it's worth, they're kind of the protagonists of Cannibal Holocaust as well."
Green Frontier,"The thing is he doesn't realise that, he think it'd American whites that watch Netflix only"
Green Frontier,yeah but i'm already listening to music.  why would i stop listening to motorhead to watch a video that no one has tried to sell me on other than hoping i like heavily applied red eyeliner?
Green Frontier,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcide
Green Frontier,"Unfortunately, he doesn’t seem to be directing any of the episodes himself—but his involvement still has me excited."
Green Frontier,Premiere date is August 16.
Green Frontier,":34 ""only a white male is as sadistic""? I hope there is more context behind this other than ""white man bad"" Im sure it might have to do with something like corporate destruction or native views on civilizations coming in to the rain forest causing destruction. Somehow though I think Im wrong and its just more ""white man bad"". Just seems odd the phrasing is so specific, ""only a WHITE MALE""......."
Green Frontier,This looks interesting
Green Frontier,"Sigh, Woke garbage. [Only a white male is as sadistic](https://youtu.be/Bp9yejKb-QY?t=33)"
Green Frontier,[removed]
Green Frontier,How about you stop acting so pathetic and triggered over one line and watch to see for yourself.
Green Frontier,Try harder
Green Frontier,It’s a miniseries. All the episodes have been shot and they’re not releasing a season 2. It can’t get cancelled.
Green Frontier,"just generally not interested in this. I was simply asking a question. You seem to be pathetic, over reacting/triggered and way sensitive here, not I."
Green Frontier,"If you’re dumb enough to think a single line of dialogue in the trailer from one character represents the entire theme of the show, that’s on you."
Green Frontier,"so now you venture on personal attacks? nice. I just re read my comment and not only was it just a question, but also followed myself up with a possible explanation. Now you're just triggering yourself.  At no point did I even say anything about the show or a presumptuous opinion on whether it was good or not. You're just being a hyper sensitive weirdo honestly. At what point did I say it would be the entire theme of the show? Maybe if YOU watched the show, you could have filled in the context instead of going off into a social triggered rage."
Green Frontier,"The point you made about lack of continuity would bother me as a kid watching reruns of old shows like this as a kid. Later on I learned that a lot of TV writing back then was intentionally discouraged from being serialized so that anyone could tune in on any given week and be able to understand what was happening. So we would get “characters of the week” that befriend the main cast but are never to be seen again. Or lessons learned that are promptly forgotten, like you alluded to. Nowadays, most shows are written the opposite way where there will be an entire season long arc and it’s not as accessible to jump right in."
Green Frontier,"> runaway children: 9

I like how over the course of a series they dedicated almost a half of a season to runaway children.  

> attempted monkey murder: 1

Go on..."
Green Frontier,"There's a reason the old TWOP thread on it was titled [Little House on the Prairie: Ma, Pa and that mime that raped Sylvia](https://web.archive.org/web/20140412223947/http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/topic/1870765-little-house-on-the-prairie-pa-ma-and-that-mime-that-raped-sylvia/)

I watched about one episode when I was eight and loved the books, got pissed off that it was nothing like the books, and quit. In retrospect, that one episode was in season 1 WELL before it went off the rails."
Green Frontier,And don't forget the final episode - the village is evicted by a timber baron and the residents proceed to blow up every building in town except the church.
Green Frontier,"Spot on with how that show was. I was so young when it was on TV that your post really awoke some dormant memories in me. I remember most TV shows back then were similar with lack of continuity. It definitely was the thing back then. Shows like Highway to Heaven and C.H.I.P.s could get away with it more easily.

Having a young mind helped me not to care too much about the lack of the continuity though. All I really cared about was hoping that little Laura Ingalls would trip down that hill she skipped down at the end of every show. I was always let down though."
Green Frontier,"I watched a bunch of LHOP as part of the job as well, and to add to/embellish your conclusions:

- A bunch of episodes start off with a character marveling about how abundant the harvest is going to be; followed by a scene where a flood/hailstorm or other disaster wrecks the harvest, causing Pa Wilder to take on some other work in order to feed his family.

- the show seemed to initially find success through the popularity of the kid characters, so at some point, with the original kids getting older, they started to try recapturing that magic  by adding new kid characters to the cast, only for it to not turn out as well as they’d hoped, resulting in the new kid characters sometimes getting written out.  First was Albert, then the Coopers (including a young Jason Bateman); by the end, they positioned Willie Olesen (the younger brother of bully Nellie) as the new young lead, along with a young Shannon Doherty as another character, with a new family, the Carters, with kids moving into the “little house” to infuse the series with more fresh blood.

- Nellie, Laura’s nemesis early in the series, actually has a wholesome and lovely fate when she falls in love with a new character, Percival Dalton, who doesn’t take her guff.  She actually mellows out at the end of her run on the show.  Her “replacement,” adopted sister Nancy (among the “let’s add new kids” characters), turned out to be even more insufferable and never got a redemption arc like Nellie did.

- Also notable was that in that whole run of the series, there were a whopping TWO black people in town:  Hester Sue, who tended to take care of the Ingalls girls, and some black guy who popped up in a couple of episodes as if to remind people that there was another black person in Walnut Grove; presumably he was killed offscreen when a tornado hit, because he was never seen or mentioned again after that.

- the show also exhibited what I now call the “Greenbush Syndrome”:  Because of child labor laws you have to hire twins to play the youngest sibling of a set, only to find out that when the show has gone long enough that the youngest is as old as one of her older siblings at the beginning of the show, and yet neither twin is as talented as the actor who played the older sibling.  See: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

- Even though the characters were decidedly Christian for history’s/novel accuracy’s sake, the morals were usually secular and applicable to anyone regardless of their faith (Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert were Jewish).  That to me is the most wholesome part of LHOP, and why even now it’s leagues ahead of any “family programming.”"
Green Frontier,"Damn, this write up is a rollercoaster. I never knew the show was so hardcore."
Green Frontier,"One of my favorite Edie McClurg moments is from WKRP, where she explains the wholesome tv shows they let the kids watch.

Green Frontier,"I grew up with sisters and have likely seen every episode multiple times as a kid. The things I remember (keep in mind I havent watched a second of it since the mid 90s



-Chales ""Pa"" Ingalls is a saint of a father, and Mr Edwards is also a saint. Pa could play a mean fiddle

-Nelly Olson could be a complete bitch, which made her brother a very relatable character

-I remember there was an episode with a school bully who was always picking on Almonzo. The resolution was the whole school ganged up and kicked his ass, and he was never heard from again

-Laura prayed for her Mother to miscarry and apparently God listened and killed her brother/sister"
Green Frontier,"I think the house/land being $80 was because of the Homestead act, it gave cheap land if you built a house and tended to the land. I remember seeing the paperwork for her dad buying the land in the Smithsonian."
Green Frontier,Child rape??? Who? What?
Green Frontier,"My only memories of the show were 

1. The mom was kinda hot 

2. one of my favorite quotes - but i can't find the episode - Charles is doing odd jobs and Nellie tells the other girls her dad smells like a horse which makes Laura embarrassed and ashamed. Charles finds out and tells her something about ""Any honest work is good work"" and how ""sweat was put in a person for a reason"" and anyone who turns their nose up was wrong."
Green Frontier,How many blindings?
Green Frontier,"Man, we were a Dr. Quinn family but now I want to check this out."
Green Frontier,This is a lot of good work but I can't get over spoiler warning a 30+ year old show.
Green Frontier,"Did you include ""explosion in a quarry"" as a gruesome death bc i'm watching this show rn AND HOLY SHIT"
Green Frontier,"Willie is treated horribly by everyone. He gets bullied by his sister,the older boys,Laura is mean to him. His mother clearly favors Nellie over him.  He gets dumped on during the little women episode and the entire town including the adults and his teacher all laugh at him .

I felt bad for him"
Green Frontier,"One Todd Bridges in a chicken coop, sucking on an egg."
Green Frontier,"I'm 52 & have watched it my whole life including just yesterday. Mainly because I loved Michael Landon. But I never sat there taking notes on, well.....everything. LOL."
Green Frontier,"I read all these books in elementary school, think I saw a newer film version at one point growing up, this show sounds nothing like the books and I’m so perplexed by your list. The worst thing I remember happening is maybe a few dogs dying and the older sister going blind, maybe a few more deaths by natural causes. Child rape? Child suicide attempt? Wtf."
Green Frontier,"I only remember a couple episodes since I was a kid when there were re runs, but everything i remember about it is dark stuff"
Green Frontier,Did the first episode have the old lady and her pet crow? I think I watched LHOP at just the right impressionable age because I still want one (pet crow)
Green Frontier,"As a 4-6 year old watching black and white tv early 90s. Whaaaat? All that bad stuff blew over my head, only episode I remember is killing the dog. That dramatized me like bambi."
Green Frontier,"I've been rewatching the show these last few weeks. Your list is spot-on. Just to add, WOW there are a LOT of fight scenes in this show. Charles especially punches a lot of people to settle disputes. It's always cathartic to watch, but I can't help but think this was probably setting a bad example to kids in the 70s, haaaa....!"
Green Frontier,"""At the end of one episode, Laura narrates that ""Years later, we were so proud to have Doctor Albert Ingalls home again"", making clear that Albert eventually got into medical school and became a doctor. 5 episodes later Albert has leukemia and dies.""    
    
Maybe you can spin it as his body finally returned to Walnut Grove, to be buried."
Green Frontier,"I'm rewatching series 1 for the first time since childhood, and episode 6 where Widow Amy fakes her death had me in tears despite thinking it'd be a funny episode. I'm just mad that there's nowhere to stream it from Ireland, stuck with 480p quality on Dailymotion, but sure it's better than nothing. Something refreshing so far is that they seem to hire Irish actors for Irish roles, you'd want to hurl at the 'Oirish' accents that show up in shows similar to this."
Green Frontier,"> Child neglect is a way of life. it's a miracle any children survived.

That's because American culture of the past twenty years has determined that children should be raised as if they're crippled and incapable of functioning on their own until they've reached the age of 25.

Before that time, I couldn't expect my parents to drive me to my friend's house to socialize; I had to ride my bicycle roughly 2-4 miles into the ""deadly"" neighborhood street traffic in the residential suburbs.  If I let my 7 year old child use public transportation (bus or train) today unaccompanied, I can get reported and examined by the county Child Protected Services department and lose custody of my child.

Parents didn't have grandparents or people they could pay or ask to watch their kids in the 1880's(?).  Hell, my mother was a working professional who couldn't always arrange for a ""baby sitter"".  So yeah, there I was, the occasionally abandoned 7 year old, alone in a house, with only the family black & white TV, which I didn't frequently watch because the over-the-air *reception* was so poor, and there were only 5 channels in existence.

Folks, its ideal to have your toddler monitored and supervised at all hours, but at 7 year olds, they  aren't expected to commit suicide when left unattended, snatched by some outside stranger, burn down the house, wander into traffic, or drink bleach.  In my case, it probably was because I was physically assaulted by my father at the age of 5 when I did something ""wrong"" enough to get me killed, so by 7 years old, I pretty much stayed at home, reading, when I had to be left alone.  I could grasp at that age that it would not be a good idea to do anything my parents warned me against doing.  This parenting method is called ""being raised to be functionally independent"".

Outside of 1st world economies, most kids are raised to be responsible and do labor to help fund the family such that it is not unheard of for 13 year olds in Central and South America to leave home to make a living.  They're only coming to the US because they could get killed trying to make a living in the hellhole of their country of birth."
Green Frontier,i think i remember the child rape ep that shit was very haunting. epecially the shot fo the rapist slowly and slowly getting closer while we could say nothing
Green Frontier,"Oh, yes, a lot of stuff could happen, but the show had to return to the status quo by the end of the episode, so it wouldn't matter if you missed a couple of episodes. You could just dive in again without feeling lost. The reasoning was that it was unrealistic to expect people never to miss episodes (there was no streaming then, obviously), and if people felt lost because of that they would just watch something else. 

That return to the status quo no matter how much stuff happened was what the Simpsons episode The Principal and the Pauper satirized. They lampshaded this trope by having all the characters at the end of he episode explicitly agree never to mention the events of the episode again, and to act like it never happened."
Green Frontier,"Right ? Look at Murder She Wrote. Over 12 years, how many of Jessica Fletcher’s good friends, relatives, nieces or nephews were seen more than once ?"
Green Frontier,"
Isaiah Edwards adopted a young orangutan when he met her owner on the road and the guy had a heart attack and died.

Later when the kids were playing with her, Nellie 2 slapped it and it slapped her back, so Mrs Oleson demanded it be shot.  But that monkey outsmarted her."
Green Frontier,">Go on...

That's just how old shows be"
Green Frontier,"The production company was required by contract to restore the ranch where it was filmed at the series conclusion.  So Michael Landon decided to blow it up and film it.

They didn't blow up the church because he thought it would be disrespectful.

and I swear I read somewhere that Dean Butler (Almanzo Wilder actor) disassembled the church and took it home, but I can't find the reference now so I'll just toss that out as unsubstantiated rumor."
Green Frontier,The Little House also wasn't blown up.
Green Frontier,"I grew up watching stuff like Knight Rider, the A-Team, Family Ties and stuff, and the whole ""this character that's suddenly your best friend and is never mentioned again"" ALWAYS bothered me."
Green Frontier,"Yeah, any episode that started with talk about how great the crop is was guaranteed to end with the crop being destroyed.

No exceptions on that one.

Funny thing about Nellie.  She comes home from NYC for a visit and her and Laura are two old friends, laughing about how they used to fight.  It would have been a touching coda to their story, all old childhood animosity let go, and now they're two adult women with a shared past... But the problem is Laura was a kind and caring child, Nellie was a horrible, mean, spiteful person.  She didn't earn a happy ending.  So the moral is ""you can be a terrible person and still have a happy life"""
Green Frontier,"> arveling about how abundant the harvest is going to be; followed by a scene where a flood/hailstorm or other disaster wrecks the harvest

Maybe this is where I got my ""I can't actually say things are going well because as soon as I do something awful is going to happen"" quirk."
Green Frontier,To a certain degree I agree but overall there seemed to be heavy Christian message which is also a big reason that it's way above any other family program. Example when Charles song comes back to life because of his strong faith in God.
Green Frontier,"Yeah, it was a hell of a surprise to me.  I never realized the show was so dark."
Green Frontier,"hah, that's great...exactly what I'm talking about."
Green Frontier,"> -Chales ""Pa"" Ingalls is a saint of a father, and Mr Edwards is also a saint. Pa could play a mean fiddle

Charles is a character completely without flaws.  it's a bit ridiculous.  He's also automatically awesome at everything he tries to do.  it's a bit egotistical that Michael Landon wrote most of the episodes, and made his own character a saint.  

Isaiah Edwards was a much more relatable character.  he had a Heart as big as a mountain, the guy was just likeable...but he had his flaws.  he wrestled with alcoholism, and after his step son was murdered, his drinking cost him his marriage.  but you still rooted for the guy.  He knew exactly 1 song and sang it constantly (Old Dan Tucker), here's a version recorded by [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO0yV_HcXx4)...because, why not?

> -Nelly Olson could be a complete bitch, which made her brother a very relatable character

After Nelly moved to NYC, mrs Oleson adopted a girl I called ""Nelly 2"" because she was an even bigger bitch than Nelly.
And Willie Oleson was played by Jonathan Gilbert, brother of Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls) and Sarah Gilbert (the Rosanne show).  

Nels Oleson was actually a very decent and likeable person.  I just constantly felt terrible for him because his wife and children were just so awful.  

> -I remember there was an episode with a school bully who was always picking on Almonzo. The resolution was the whole school ganged up and kicked his ass, and he was never heard from again.

Yeah, all the kids surrounded him and were wailing on him until the episode ended.  I assumed he died.

> -Laura prayed for her Mother to miscarry and apparently God listened and killed her brother/sister

that is exactly what happened.  well, not exactly...he lived a few months before he died.  But Laura did kill him with her prayers.  Walnut Grove is not a good place to be a baby."
Green Frontier,"Almanzo? Do you mean Bubba the bully who actually punched Mary & terrorized all the kids. mainly the girls-except Nelly. Then went at Charles, because Bubba's father picked on Charles. Mary stood up to him, but he wouldn't back down. That's when all the girls(inc. Willie) beat him down."
Green Frontier,"that's actually a plot point in the series finale movie.

a wealthy land investor comes to Walnut Grove and informs everyone that the township was actually not ever homestead land, but was actually Dakota indian reservation land that the government took back, and he was the legal owner and now owned the entire town.

So all the townspeople blew up all the buildings with dynamite...I'm sure it made sense at the time."
Green Frontier,"Season 7, episodes 17 & 18  because child rape and attempted rape, plus a rape pregnancy, and a child death was too much to fit into one episode."
Green Frontier,"The actress who played Caroline, Karen Grassle, was legitimately a pretty damned attractive and dignified women.  I really liked her in the role.

In amongst all the horrible stuff, Charles was a pretty decent role model.  He didn't drink, but didn't judge anyone who did.  He didn't see any reason to treat anyone differently, be they black, Indian, Jewish, handicapped, etc.  And he played a mean fiddle"
Green Frontier,"One person went blind, but another blind person regained their sight, so it's a wash.

Actually I just remembered another one of the blind kids had experimental surgery and regained her sight.  So that like a net +1"
Green Frontier,"Watch it, you won't regret it ! I liked Dr Quinn, but I adored LHOP !"
Green Frontier,"yes, that was the very one that started the category."
Green Frontier,"Willie goes along with Nellies shenanigans because she's his sister, but when he's on his own he's a decent enough kid.  I can't think of any time Willie was outright malicious without Nellie pushing it.

in the retooled last season ""Little House: A New Beginning"", Willie was married and a leader in the community.  

He wasn't nearly the little shit Nellie was."
Green Frontier,"He was looking for a buyer to sell himself into slavery.

Is was pretty messed up."
Green Frontier,"The later film version You're talking about might be ""beyond the prairie"" from 1999 starring a young Walton Goggins as almanzo Wilder."
Green Frontier,"Uh, yep, I was in second grade when I learned about the concept of rape from this show, in the two-episode ""Sylvia"" arc. Young girl (Albert's crush/girlfriend) raped by the town blacksmith who wore a very creepy clown/mime mask. Gets pregnant. Albert plans to marry her. They run away together, then she is cornered in a barn AGAIN by the clown-mask-wearing blacksmith, tries to escape him by running up a ladder, falls off the ladder -- and dies.

This show was MESSED up, man."
Green Frontier,"that was Season 4, Episode 1, crazy old lady Kezia Horn with a crow on her head.

Victim Number 8,"As soon as there is anything gay put in anything popular the internet trolls are always teeming to tear it down 

The funny thing is Bill way gay in the game too but the same people pretended that wasn't the case."
Victim Number 8,"I really like/love the show.

I don't think it's the Second Coming of Christ, but i am really liking it.

But come on, this episode is so much more than ""gay love"".

yeah, sure, the relationship it was based on was between gay people, but at its core, this episode showed a romance/love throughout the years.

I mean, i am sure, everybody can relate with that, regardless if it's gay love or not.

Yes, to me, man-on-man SEX makes me a little uncomfortable, but so does seeing people eat shrimp, but that doesn't mean that i don't like those people or think that they don't deserve some recognition (but if they eat chocolate, i'm throwing hands).

This episode showed the good, the bad and the struggles that may come with a long relationship, all of that during the brutality of a post-apocalyptic zombie world.

In the end, what got to them wasn't the zombies or the raiders, it was life itself, we all get old, sick, slow.

They chose to go out in their own terms, instead of being eaten and rippen apart by monsters.

Not only that, but the parallels of Joel and Bill being protectors and fighting, living for the sake of their loved ones.

I mean, if this is ""woke shit"", atleast it's good shit and that is all that matters to me."
Victim Number 8,"The episode was about the inevitability of having to say goodbye to someone you’ve built a life with. That’s why it’s powerful. Being with that one person for the last time. I can’t think of a single more relatable storyline, since almost everyone will go through this at some point in their life. But then I remember……there are fucking dickheads in this world."
Victim Number 8,Wait till they find out about Ellie

unfortunately the world is filled with a lot of ignorance and hate. It’s just ironic that Bill’s character IS these people, which makes it ironic as hell"
Victim Number 8,Episode 3 also explained why treatment and vaccines were not possible. Everyone was already infected after eating pancakes.
Victim Number 8,"I’m convinced that anyone who watched that episode and had only some kind of homophobic knee jerk reaction, rather than being incredibly moved and having their faith in love restored a little, if you can watch that beautiful love story and not feel even a twinge in your heart, then you must be a soulless ghoul, an incomplete person. I’d go as far as to use it as a litmus test for people in my life lmfao. As a straight guy with a lot of straight dude friends, they aren’t always completely politically correct or sensitive to issues surrounding sexuality. Every single one of us who watched agreed it was fucking beautiful and we all shed a tear, even one of my friends who usually complains about ‘woke bs’. It was a fucking beautiful bit of TV. I think everyone wants a love like that in their life, and it’s sad that if some of these hateful people just took the message of ‘open yourself up to good things and let someone love you’, they might not be so hateful. Instead they can’t see past their tunnel vision, it’s insane to me that people can be so close minded."

Literally what that episode was about."
Victim Number 8,If there ever was a time of being able to trust user reviews on anything that is even slightly related to a minority group that time is 100 percent over. Review bombs basically happen on every show or movie with these topics. It’s so lame. It was an amazing episode of television.
Victim Number 8,">	User: kathanorn “So far worst episode that brings nothing to the story but only purpose for that is to please certain agenda. Okay the scenery is beautiful and music is top notch, yet Neil butchered his very own story.” 0/10

Bullshit. This episode 100% contributed to Joel & Ellie's story and even foreshadowed some future part 2 stuff! Also, am not surprised anti wokist are here. Once, this cult put tlou in its sights, it was game over.  Now, these fucks will be the butt zits of the fandom & will forever annoy fans with thier stupidity like they do in Star Wars & marvel. Fucking annoying if you ask me."
Victim Number 8,"There is some room for nuance here.

Personally I enjoyed the love story between Frank and Bill, that part was great.

BUT, the episode also *wasn’t* perfect. It doesn’t deserve a 10/10 either.

If we are being honest, the episode was quite slow. For someone not interested in romance stories (whether straight or gay) it was almost excruciatingly boring.

It felt like a slower episode of the Walking Dead or something, but without even a cliffhanger ending. It was practically like watching an inclusive rom-com, but instead of having any drama, the rom-com starts at the happy ending and continues through the golden years. It was… nice.

But exciting? Not at all.

We also shouldn’t ignore that it was a tremendous tonal shift from the last two episodes. I’ve been a huge fan of the show, but was still slightly off-put by it. Why? Because it was a romance story.

I, like many, don’t watch really enjoy watching romance stories. Nothing wrong with them, but they just aren't super exciting to me. And I certainly didn’t turn on TLOU intending to watch a romance story.  It doesn’t matter whatsoever to me that it was a romance between two men. I support inclusivity on screen. That part was great. I just wouldn’t personally choose to watch a slow love-story about ANYONE.

There are plenty of legitimate reasons to not like the episode. I am not surprised it was controversial, and not just because of homophobia. It was a biiiiig change from the game, basically the first truly significant departure in some ways.

Not all criticism of the show is homophobic in nature. Mine isn't at least.

The show being inclusive is great, but inclusion is not the same as perfection. You can succeed in one area and fail in others. For me, this was a pretty weak episode.

And it had nothing to do with the romance, and everything to do with the slow pacing and near complete lack of action."
Victim Number 8,IMDb user reviews are worthless. Shows and movies get obviously review bombed all the time and they don’t really do anything to prevent that.
Victim Number 8,"Good episode, really enjoyed it. Came on Reddit to see what people thought, and remembered why I stopped coming on Reddit."
Victim Number 8,It doesn’t change the source material at all with Bill being gay
Victim Number 8,"The IMDB allows anyone to post. Anyone can use the internet now. It's only natural that some people posting will be uneducated idiots.

I wouldn't give this episode 10 / 10 either, there are extremes to everything (it was pretty great though)."
Victim Number 8,">""NPC syndrome"" was in full effect with that ending.

What on earth does this even mean? You terminally online people weird me out."
Victim Number 8,"Ellie is an unlikable asshole. She’s my current issue with the show right now. I did *like* episode 3, but it felt wedged in and pointless to the main story of the show. It would be a 10/10 if it were some separate “short film” style thing."
Victim Number 8,"Me in Wheel of Time fandom: see, these people are all always ready with their idiot pitchforks and bad-take torches

(that being said, TLoU ep3 was better than anything in WoT S1)"
Victim Number 8,"Listen, as a guy who played the game, I was pretty concerned what the point of that episode was going to be about 40 minutes in, because if it wouldn’t have gone anywhere it would have absolutely looked like a random gay plot line inserted and drawn out for no reason. BUT, the way they wrapped it up with the note and absolutely nailed the crux of Joel’s arc was absolutely amazing. It was so much more powerful than the game! Top notch television. I am expecting Emmy’s to be handed out for that one."
Victim Number 8,"Its not a 1/10...but its not a 10/10 either. 

It was filler, and stretched out for 65mins. I understand the point of the episode, to show that love still survives, thrives even, despite the hopelessness. The letter solidfying Joel in his future purpose of protecting Ellie...i get the point, i do.

BUT

Lets be honest, it all couldve been acheived in half the time, and the left over time couldve driven the main story forward.

It was filler, well written and well acted, but filler. 

And what the hell?! 80s music at the end of ep1 was wasted foreshadowing too, now that i think about it."
Victim Number 8,"I fall into the camp of not enjoying this episode as much as the other two. 

Oh it’s own, the episode is good. As a fan of the game, though, I felt like we missed some great interactions between Bill and Ellie. I also felt like Bill got out of it a bit too “clean”. 

It bothered me that, in 16 years or so, Bill and Frank were able to build and maintain their little slice of paradise with their biggest problem being one attack from a few raiders that was managed by some automatic traps. This world is brutal and unforgiving. There is no way that these two wouldn’t have drawn more attention from different roaming gangs, or infected. I really had to stretch my suspension of disbelief to go along with it. 

I predicted Bill taking suicide pills as well the moment the idea was mentioned. However, I thought that the ending would be that they didn’t work, and we’d transition to the gruff, disenfranchised, emotionally distant Bill from the game when Joel and Ellie met him. It would have made perfect sense, and been more heartbreaking knowing his history. However, he got to die in his lover’s arms on his own terms, and that was it. I feel like it’s too clean a death for somebody in this universe. 

As a horror geek, I guess I’m also a little sour on the omission of some great horror set pieces that could have gone along with the Bill’s town section. I’m fine with the love story flashback, but I feel like we lost some great content and interactions in place of it.

I think that this episode really should have supplemented the adventure that Joel and Ellie have at this point in the game, not replaced it entirely."
Victim Number 8,"I love this episode and I would give it 9 out of 10 too, but I have to disagree with you on Velma. Velma is not a “mid”, it’s straight out bad, maybe 2 or 3 bad."
Victim Number 8,Yeah but thank goodness they took away the forums to kill the trolls. That worked great.
Victim Number 8,"I mean it generally balances out. While there are a bunch of brainless 1/10 reviews, there’s just as many including myself who’s biased and rates it 10/10 because they/I might look past a few things"
Victim Number 8,Some people truly are incapable of enjoying things cause they're so hateful. Just let them be miserable and enjoy the episode and rest of the show.
Victim Number 8,"I'm sure Velma is getting review bombed, but it's also kinda bad. I didn't make it far in that at all. TLoU episode 3 was amazing though. 

Personally I think user reviews are better when it's binary. Just a choice between like or dislike. Otherwise there are too many disingenuous reviews trying to game the system on either end of the spectrum."
Victim Number 8,"I’m not a fan of shows shoe-horning diversity and inclusion quotas where it breaks the realism of the show and makes the show worse - rings of power- Witcher blood Origin- though both those were awful in far worse ways than that

But episode 3 of last of us was improved by it being 2 gay men, it makes more sense of that relationship building and happening in the first place

If it’s a male survivalist and a women who falls down the hole it gives off a much more creepy vibe of her prostituting herself for the safety of his compound 

But with it being 2 men you don’t feel that creepy dynamic which the relationship is built on

It also helps with the character being perfect for Nick Offerman, who was fantastic"
Victim Number 8,I was bored to tears. Terrible episode you could easily cut from the season on a rewatch and not miss anything. Those 10/10 reviews are biased af.
Victim Number 8,Unsurprising a bunch of incels are making their voices heard on rating websites.
Victim Number 8,"I'm a conservative, but I know good TV when I see it. 

Best Television I've seen in a while."
Victim Number 8,Thankfully? Why? Why can't people dislike an episode of a series? You sound like you have a dog in this fight
Victim Number 8,You guys shouldn’t give a shit. You either like the episode or you don’t
Victim Number 8,Honestly who even pays attention to review scores. They are almost always a load of horse shit. I mean look at how shockingly bad rings of power was and trolls still gave it thousands of 10 votes.
Victim Number 8,"Not sure if a few reviews ranting about gay romance are representative. I would bet that most of the negative pointing comes from game fans that didn't like the end, which is a serious change relatively to the game.

Bill was gay in the game too, though that was only suggested, and most fans that I have seen are pretty aware of that."
Victim Number 8,Bill is gay in the game so why are people so fucking mad?.
Victim Number 8,I get that people like the episode but calling it the best self contained episode done by HBO sort of invites people to argue with you
Victim Number 8,"It’s annoying in the modern world people put any stock whatsoever into these manipulated, completely non representative user scores.

It’s also funny to me that these homophobic last of us “fans” even exist. It’s one of the gayest mainstream entertainment franchises, what are you still doing here?"
Victim Number 8,"I think its' fine that people can give 1 to a show, as much as it's fine they can give it a 10. Everyone can cast his vote and this is the result. The fact that many took the time to write about their irritation is at least the sign they somewhat cared about it. Yes, you can call them homophobic but until it's illegal being so, well, that's how things go. If 20% of population is homophobic and they can vote on their liking of the show, this is an understandable result"
Victim Number 8,"“Wahhhh gay men bad I’m a bigot” ~ 1-star voters

No other reason as that episode was an actual masterpiece."

Victim Number 8,"I loved the episode. It was beautiful. I want to find love like that, and I'm straight."
Victim Number 8,"I didn't particularly enjoy this episode, but the fact they are gay never even entered my mind as a reason.

It didn't feel out of place or forced or anything to me, I actually thought it was a really nice depiction of a gay couple, you'd have to be pretty bigoted to take offence to this."
Victim Number 8,Just finished this episode and it's just fantastic. All the hype is warranted.
Victim Number 8,Best episode of a series that had not a GD thing to do with the series. There should be a new Emmy category.
Victim Number 8,People being angry at The Last of Us TV series for including stuff from the game is hilarious to me.
Victim Number 8,It's the religious homophobes as usual.
Victim Number 8,"Well here I can surely say that those are straight homophobes. 

Episode was fantastic. 

Unlike Velma. Fuck Velma. Thats how you do LGBT in media, you impudent cringemakers."
Victim Number 8,">I want to watch a show about the post-apocalypse where people survive as best they can

This guy didn't play either of these games. If he did, he wouldn't be complaining.

>yet Neil butchered his very own story

Anyone wanna tell this guy that it's the same story?

Female, non-white, gay, any of those in a combination just triggers these guys. Hell, I work with a couple of people with similar views, but I can convince them why a different story is good."
Victim Number 8,"It’s probably the best episode so far, yet the only one(so far)that I probably won’t watch on rewatch. It was a beautiful love story that fleshed out two characters, but didn’t do much for the plot otherwise so I wouldn’t give it a perfect rating in the grand scheme of things. 

But on its own it was a very touching story, and one which I most certainly wasn’t expecting."
Victim Number 8,"""omg all these 0/10 reviews! None of them are valid! The show is perfect! Look at the 15,000 10/10 reviews as proof."" - You talking about a tv series with a 100 million dollar advertising budget while you can buy imdb ratings for like $0.16 a pop."
Victim Number 8,"Oh, so review bombing works both ways huh?  
Nice to see it openly admitted I guess."
Victim Number 8,"It wasn't bad, I just think it was too long of a side story and felt kind of like a filler episode from an anime. That shouldn't happen in a low-episode ""cinematic"" series.

Compared to the first 2 episodes its a 4/10, in a vacuum its probably a 6/10 or 7/10."
Victim Number 8,Hoes mad.
Victim Number 8,"The show gets review-bombed mostly by an international audience. If you have a closer look at the demographics you'll notice that it's rated 8.7 by US viewers and 8.0 by non US viewers.

Does anyone know if it is possible to get a more detailed breakdown of nationalities? I am also surprised that only about 25% of reviews are US based. I didn't know IMDB was that international. The rest of the world is apparently way more homophobic than the US."
Victim Number 8,"I think people who rated it 1/10 are fucking dumb who doesn't understand the story but people who rates 10/10 are also so biased. Well maybe people have different type of ratings but 10/10 is such a rare occasion and people just throw it everywhere. My problem with this episode is that the bill and frank relationship was too fast, bill is an experienced survivor and he trusted frank in 1 day and had sex with him right away. It felt forced so they can have gay sex in a television."
Victim Number 8,These people have clearly not played the game lol.
Victim Number 8,"i think this is one of the most revealing things ive seen in a while. this episode (my only critique being that i feel it was a little too quick to ”begin”, but on one hand they needed to get on with the episode and on another, its interesting to think about how people might change after life as we know it ends. maybe a good dinner isnt all somebody can be starved of) was absolutely fantastic and a truly emotional story, yet still from reactionaries it gets called ”propaganda“ and only exists to further an agenda... propaganda to who exactly? the adult target audience?

the excuse they always used to fall back on when talking about “woke” things like ghostbusters and steven universe and such was that it was bad because it was just trying to be woke and not good, or trying to push agendas on children. theyd always be able to find secondary reasons for hating it (even if the latter point especially is obviously wrong)... but apparently even *this* is too far despite being both for adults, and actually really really good

oh well. better tell my adult housemate they cant watch this. its gay propaganda and will threaten their precious, heterosexual… 30 year old… brain 😩"
Victim Number 8,"People keep ignoring what actually ruined this episode. 

Bill standing out in the open in the middle of the street trying to fight the raiders. 

I mean come on. Bill is the ultimate survivalist. No chance he hasn't planned for this and built an eaglesnest somewhere so he can snipe raiders from *behind cover.*

0/10"
Victim Number 8,Lol. I like the retreat to ‘I’m not a homophobe the episode was really bad because reasons’.
Victim Number 8,"How sad that something so masterfully done can trigger you, because your bigotry blinds you to everything.  I'm so glad I can appreciate every nuance of this, even though is has nothing to do with my lifestyle.  Literally one of the best episodes I have ever seen."
Victim Number 8,People can't hate the episode?
Victim Number 8,People are going to have different opinions from you.  Not everyone is going to like what you like.  I feel the same about people who give Perfect scores to people who give overly negative score.  I stoped caring a while back.
Victim Number 8,"Well the episodes have thousands of 10/10's before it even releases as well, so it kinda balances it out."
Victim Number 8,"So I really enjoy lyes the episode.  But will admit it felt a little jarring.  Im not talking about I have issues with the content.   It just felt like we were in overdrive going 100 at the end of the last episode and we started this episode in first gear. Im not even sure that’s a problem with the show.  I have the same problem with books.  I’ll get so wrapped up in a POV chapter that when the next chapelter begjins and it’s about someone else it’s a letdown.  Sometimes I even stop for a couple of days, but regardless it takes a couple of pages to recapture the excitement."
Victim Number 8,"I think these episodes always get polarizing reviews from self-conscious people on both sides who feel added social pressure to evaluate it with weighting towards whatever ideology they prescribe to. I thought the episode was pretty decent, well made, but kinda hallmarky too. It was hardly perfect imo. Both 9+/10 and 1/10 scores are perplexing to me tbh."
Victim Number 8,[deleted]
Victim Number 8,"I looked at the voting, and currently the average for US users (15k) is 8.8, whereas the average for non-US users is 8.1 (40k). That actually makes me give less of a shit about the lower reviews, I feel like the reactionaries that are complaining about the gay agenda/etc aren't even American to begin with so it doesn't matter as much to me."
Victim Number 8,"That episode did little to further the story for me. It was a wasted episode when we only get 8-12 episodes a season. The used it to character build two ppl
So that you would care when they died. Half way through the episode I knew we weren’t going anywhere this episode. All y’all are gonna be angry when we’re season 4 in and it’s starting to suck and they didn’t do enoguh to wrap the story, they will then hastily wrap it up on one season and game of thrones it for all. 

I do want to see the maga morons melt down when they see gay ppl and then get triggered to look up the game and notice the main character is a lesbian."
Victim Number 8,My biggest issue with the show is that there is a subset that think it's the best thing ever. Its a really great show but the extremism in reception really dilutes the show to be discussed in a meaningful manner
Victim Number 8,"I mean it was very gay, which is very unexpected in a zombie show. Too gay perhaps. 

I had a couple buddies over on Sunday to watch the football games. Afterwards, I offered to watch the show, but we ended up doing something else. I’m glad we did, because that would have been awfully embarrassing. Was there really a need for the extended gay love scenes in my zombie show?"
Victim Number 8,"I think there are legitimate criticisms of that episode that don't touch on homophobia, and make the episode deserving of a low score.

I also think the general theme of romance and yes, showcasing of LGBT in an immensely positive light, make it so people will fail to see its flaws.

I think they cheaped out on this episode. And if the trend continues, I think the whole series will end up with low scores as a result."
Victim Number 8,I loved the episode 10/10 but why give this any attention? Who cares.
Victim Number 8,"Played the game, loving the show so far but this episode. I just didn't see the point of showing all that. Maybe because of the game they always had letters so I don't know. I found it stupid. While everything else is messed up these two people held off hordes and raiders by themselves. Cheesy Happy ending."
Victim Number 8,Who cares? Representation is more important than internet points
Victim Number 8,its another zombie show. I dont get it. Walking Dead has been doing this for years.
Victim Number 8,Lol positive review bombing a show you’re a fan of is as bad a leaving negative reviews.
Victim Number 8,"I mean it’s one of those cases where if you hated you will be vocal, if you loved you will be vocal. The problem is that if you found it just ‘meh” like I did then both sides will hate you. No room for nuance, especially with this show."
Victim Number 8,People are watching Velma? And you’re someone who is upset that Velma is getting bombed because it’s actually mid?? Velma is fucking trash lmao
Victim Number 8,It was a shit episode
Victim Number 8,"Have you ever stopped to think that maybe this episode was ACTUALLY trash? Don't fanboy simp for a television show, you won't get rewarded for it."
Victim Number 8,"scores I agree with are right and good!

scores I disagree with are wrong and bad!"
Victim Number 8,"I agree with the negative reviews, this episode was pure propaganda shoved down our throats. I skipped a lot of it to avoid disturbing scenes.."
Victim Number 8,Waste of time this episode was not in the game the best part is they got a car the rest was gay fked up shiiit 🤮🤮🤢🤢
Victim Number 8,"I liked it. But still:


Me watching The Last Of Us alone:🧟‍♂️

Me watching The Last Of Us when my gf walks in:👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨"
Victim Number 8,"Eh, while the episode was different than what I was expecting from the game, I think it worked in what the show runners are trying to portray. I thought it was a touching story about hope in a bleak world. My wife didn't enjoy the episode though, she wants more infected and action so the slowness of the episode didn't appeal to her. She's not played the game, so doesn't have the back story of how Joel and Ellie's relationship grows and evolves throughout the story, and I'm not going to spoil it for her. I feel like this show is my chance to experience the story all over again like new."
Victim Number 8,"While I understand that Bill thought he wouldn’t be useful without Frank around and wanted to join him, I just think that’s a selfish way to look at it. Think about how many more people he could protect (including Joel and Ellie) even after Frank’s death."
Victim Number 8,"Wow, maybe review bombing actually good shows doesnt work"
Victim Number 8,Thanks for the IMDB link so I could vote
Victim Number 8,"episode 1 and 2 = 8/10

episode 3 = 1/10"
Victim Number 8,"I didn't like it. It was a whole story about 2 dudes I don't care about that didn't move the story along until the letter. It was a long way to go just to slap Joel with the reality of how his one goal now is to protect Ellie.  If it was a flashback of early Ellie or Tess,  or if they had the truck already and THEN the story of where they got it from, I'd be interested. But I didn't care about these one off guys at all. Although I had a feeling of dread the whole time cause I just knew that the one dude was going to get them both killed being so open and welcoming. So I was surprised that he didn't ruin everything lol. That's new."
Victim Number 8,"I agree. I think the rest of the season should only and exclusively be focused on gay relationships. No more Joel and Ellie, no more plot, that's it. I just want to see an hour of two men in love, kissing and holding one another.

We could start each episode with Joel and Ellie coming across a clicker, no more than 5 minutes after the start. Then I want to see a full backstory on that clicker, where he grew up, where he was born, his first boyfriend, coming out to his family and friends, his marriage, his struggles, I want to see it all. Every clicker has a story to tell and I want it.

""But it's The Last of Us! I want to see the story between Joel and Ellie!"" Oh I see, so you don't want to see a gay story? You're just mad that gay people exist?? Well, sorry HOMOPHOBES, gay people exist and you will not stop their stories from being told!! I want 10 seasons of this and nothing else and I hope all you BIGOTS hate it!

Episode 3 was clearly the greatest episode of the whole series, no question about it, probably the best thing on TV or even in any art form ever in human history."
Victim Number 8,"I thought it was a nice episode.  Nick offerman played bill really well.

Frank was cool. Funniest part was the 'infact I spoke to a nice lady on the radio'

Bill: WHAT!!!

I did find pacing severely slow with scenes that thought added little. Like the raider attack had Bill shot but that was it. I guess the ""call Joel showed his change in perception of the group but I didn't get invested into the fight. 

ESPECIALLY since he stood in the middle of the goddamm road!!!! and not from a window. Or at least behind some type of cover. XD

I'd give the episode an 7/10 I lt was a good episode just felt long. Another thing I think i would have liked Nick Offerman narrating the letter. Having the fantastic scene of Joel walking outside knowing Bill meant for tess to he safe was great."
Victim Number 8,"Altering opinion:

Ep3 would have been scored lower then the first 2 eps, even if it was a heterosexual relationship. An hour long love story between a man and a woman in a apocalyptic show, based on a video game, would have been hated just as much. It would have been called boring and unneeded. I don’t feel the homosexual element made that much of a difference in the score. Sure you will have haters; but I think the love story is what upset viewers."
Victim Number 8,"I feel like these people missed the message of the episode, and instead focused on the “gay agenda,” they seem to have made up. I thought it was a beautiful message about family, that served as a message to Joel, just as it did in the games"
Victim Number 8,"I don't think people who haven't played the game are going to get triggered by season two the way many gamers did.  The people that do get triggered are the same people who got triggered last night because the show had the gall to show two gay men in a relationship that wasn't played for comic relief.  And much though they love to be very vocal about everything they hate, they ultimately don't matter and the show will succeed without them.

Season two is going to deliver exactly what your average HBO watcher has come to expect from the network.  Shocking twists and horrific violence."
Better Than Us,Okay I may check out the first two eps.
Better Than Us,Sounds like a good plot! Never heard of it! I'll check it out now! Thanks!
Better Than Us,The dub VA is horrible  to me like it's laughable at how bad it is
Better Than Us,"Woah, thanks for the tip.

 I loved Real Humans. Still annoyed that it didn't get a third season. The design for the humanoids looked incredible."
Better Than Us,Has someone noticed that each episode shows the logo of sperbank like 3 times?
Better Than Us,"I really like it.
Im convinced this show is also trying to imitate a lot of parts from the anime Chobits too honestly, but Im ok with it. (with bots falling in love with their owners and the bot is a secret badass ninja etc)"
Better Than Us,Netflix didn't make this just bought the rights from a Russian tv channel.
Better Than Us,You'd think that they would design a realistic sexbot that could blink its eyes.
Better Than Us,Just created /r/BetterThanUsTV for discussions :)

Better Than Us,"Congratulations, kid. You just figured out how television production and distribution has worked for the last half a fucking century.

Seinfeld was made by Castle Rock Entertainment, not NBC. So fucking what? You still had to tune into NBC every Thursday night if you wanted to watch new episodes."
Better Than Us,Just created /r/BetterThanUsTV for discussions :)
Better Than Us,"The robots do blink in the show, maybe if you weren't so busy touching your lonely self you would have noticed that."
Better Than Us,Show isn't watchable to me
Better Than Us,"basically you've said it three times already, don't spam."
Better Than Us,This show has been an amazing show so far. Kicks in to gear straight away. Thanks for the recommendation.
Better Than Us,My point is Better Than Us aired on the [Russian Channel C1R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_than_Us).  Then Netflix bought the international rights.  Whereas the [Netflix Original Dark was completely paid for by Netflix to air ONLY on Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)).
Better Than Us,Why? What do You mean? Have you watched it in Russian with Subtitles?
Better Than Us,Yes but I replied to different people. Not everyone goes back and reads through the whole thread.
Better Than Us,"Indeed! Binge watched it in just two days! It had its flaws and some characters as well as their storylines kind of annoyed me (e.g the son and the ex-wife, but hey let’s not forget that back in the day people also hated on /r/Homeland’s Dana Brody).

Overall really a great show with a unique atmosphere and outstanding acting performances by the main cast. Especially the actress playing the humanoid robot.

Edit: I’m trying to build the subreddit for the show myself since I didn’t found one anywhere"
Better Than Us,"And? What difference does it fucking make?

Sony Pictures Television bought international rights to Seinfeld. Do you care?"
Better Than Us,Can't stand the voices 🤷‍♂️
Better Than Us,It doesn’t justify self-promotion if this kind - leaving the same comment in every thread is just wrong.
Better Than Us,"Yes, and 16 episodes for the first season. That's  brave storytelling.  I'm halfway through the season and do not know what to expect."
Better Than Us,"Dude why are you so hostile, you both have good points. Calling this guy a kid but you sound like a child"
Better Than Us,"I don't care about Seinfeld.  We're not talking about Seinfeld.  We're talking about Better Than Us.  It is not a Netflix produced or paid for Original.  It's a C1R Russian TV produced production.  Netflix bought the rights to it.  Very different from what Netflix does with their true Original productions like Dark.  They are involved in it from the very beginning.  Better Than Us aired and someone from Netflix noticed it was a good show so they decided to spend money to have the international rights to the show AFTER it had aired.    


That's all I was saying in my original post.  Netflix bought the rights to this show.  They didn't produce or fund the show from the very beginning like a show like Dark that ONLY airs on Netflix around the world.  Dark didn't air on some German TV channel first like Better Than Us in Russia.  Pretty easy to understand kid."
Better Than Us,"You can’t stand the original voices from the Russian actors? Lol ;) 

Or do you not like hearing the Russian language?

If you mind the russian voices, you could try the dubbed version I guess but personally I hate dubbed most of the time"
Better Than Us,Have some mercy. I hate self promotion myself. I only did one thread about the show and mentioned the subreddit a few times. Other new TV show subreddits get even promoted by the television mods themselves
Better Than Us,"True! Although i think netflix's season 1 with 16 episodes was originally in russia two seasons with each eight episodes that aired 2018 and 2019 - but netflix just decided to put it into one season. 

At least that's the official imdb info."
Better Than Us,Did you not read my original comment lol?
Better Than Us,"The guy's not going around plugging his YT channel or something, he just seems like a guy who likes the show and made a common place for people to ask things. I'm glad he did because I just posted my question there instead of wondering what random subreddit I should use. 
PS @redditor2redditor if you can answer my question I just posted there about the song in the 2nd episode I would greatly appreciate any help lol"
Better Than Us,"Oh okay. So each season was 8 episodes? Tbh, I think Netflix made the right call - it is working better as one cohesive story"
Better Than Us,Sorry I just didnt really follow what you were referring to. Confusing
Better Than Us,Thanks for your kind words! Much appreciated! I will check your post over there :)
Better Than Us,Indeed! Yes!
Better Than Us,What happened at the end of episode 8 then? Just trying to figure out what happened for the first season finale in Russia
Better Than Us,"i loved HUMANS (i never watched the original Danish(?) version) and thus far BETTER THAN US is pretty good (i'm on episode 4)! 
this is definitely one of the better acted/more polished tv shows/projects from Russia that i've seen."
Better Than Us,[deleted]
Better Than Us,"I think this had too many episodes, and I couldn't root for any of the characters. They were all unlikeable"
Better Than Us,These rando netflix shows all look the same.
Better Than Us,/r/BetterThanUsTV
Better Than Us,"Any good? Is this Russian? I love Russia, so I'm wondering."
Better Than Us,These international productions rarely get my blood pumping
Better Than Us,Swedish !
Better Than Us,"Yes! Its great and I also loved Humans. Such a great cast (Mia, Niska)"
Better Than Us,"Yes! That is very much the case. Dubbed version especially the English one is terrible and I very much enjoyed getting into the Russian language/atmosphere along subtitles,"
Better Than Us,Except for Arisaaaa :)
Better Than Us,"You’re wrong because this show was not produced by Netflix themselves like they do with ‚Stranger Things‘.

It first aired on and was produced for Russia‘s most popular television channel.

Netflix just bought its international rights (except for Russian & China).

The show is very different to the Swedish series „äkts mäniskor“ aka. „Real Humans“ as well as AMC/Channel4‘s US-Remake /r/HumansTV.

„Better than Us“ does not even have many similarities to these shows but has a unique and intriguing storyline in my opinion. It’s a show with some Delaware but overall it has a unique atmosphere and outstanding acting performances by the main cast, especially the actress playing the humanoid robot."
Better Than Us,Any good?
Better Than Us,"Yes, a russian production that was licensed by Netflix for worldwide release (except Russia and China). ;)

It’s a great show!

From decider.com‘s review:

>Our Take: My knowledge of Russian TV shows is nil, but I have seen my fair share of Netflix originals that dabble in science fiction. So, I can say with certainty that Better Than Us is not another low-budget, you-can-see-the-strings WTF affair that Another Life was last month. The biggest thing this show has going for it is, without a doubt, the production design. The world feels lived in and, most importantly for what’s ultimately a grounded family drama, plausible. The future tech isn’t next-level bonkers, but the actors aren’t also trying to pretend that the basic iPad they’re holding is something cutting edge (Another Life).
>
>And while there are a lot of robot/meaning-of-sentience-driven sci-fi stories you can already stream on Netflix (Ex Machina, Black Mirror, Altered Carbon, even Star Trek: TNG) and while parts of the show feels very Daytime Blade Runner in Russia, Better Than Us stands just apart enough to justify its existence. The sex-bots and one murder-bot add flair and flavor to what is really the most complex thing about the show: Georgy’s relationship with his family."
Better Than Us,Who does get it pumping?
Better Than Us,i agree 10000000000%.  i love foreign/non-English language movies and tv shows and i refuse to watch anything dubbed (unless it's THE only way possible to watch it).  the natural language/NON-dubbed way is the only way to go imo.
Better Than Us,Oh okay then. Might check it out.
Better Than Us,The chicks are hot... thats about it
Better Than Us,"Very! Second half was a bit tougher to get through in my opinion but overall watching it was an amazing and especially unique experience as it was the first Russian television show I’ve seen.

The actress playing the humanoid robot does an incredible job. 

Overall storyline and cgi, makeup effects are all great IMHO. Only a few character and their storylines started to annoy me (similar to how some people were very annoyed by Dana Brody back in S1 of /r/Homeland).

For my taste some of the characters stayed for too long in their line, like they didn’t evolve enough or quickly enough for me as we’ve witnessed it on a show like AMC & Channel4‘s /r/HumansTV - in retrospective I wondered if it’s the Russian mentality that played a part here or if it has been just the writers and showrunners conscious decision."
Better Than Us,"It's not shown in Russia and China?

If so, that's horrible."
Better Than Us,Mindhunters
Better Than Us,How can you agree that much?
Better Than Us,"Yes! The only thing I've ever known to be maybe better than the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKn-Agk-yAI)  version is the german dub for ['Gladiator': 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius..' ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IHg_37lXSY).

Germans are [extremely professional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgvVVa0dglA) and good when it comes to dubbing. It is [entire industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ezCgvYV74) in Germany with prolific Voice/dubbing actors.


[Thanos voice in german.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1se3_d9zt0)"
Better Than Us,"Awesome! ;) and i Hope my response didn’t come across too aggressive or anything („you’re wrong“)

Definitely give the show a try :) I think after the second episode you’re either hooked or not 

/r/BetterThanUsTV"
Better Than Us,"Darren, this show imo is pretty good! if you liked the now canceled 
 British show HUMANS (same exact premise with sentient android/robots) like i did, then you'll probably like BETTER THAN US."
Better Than Us,"What nonsense. The show overall has a great storyline and great acting especially by the humanoid robot playing actress - who yes is very attractive, but shines even more because of her performance."
Better Than Us,"You should really check out The Method. It’s on Netflix, although that might depend on where you live. It was the first Russian series I watched and I enjoyed the experience so much it not only got me interested in watching more Russian tv, but foreign tv in general. 

Fair warning, there are some pretty violent scenes (on par with shows like Hannibal and Dexter), so it’s not for everyone. It follows a lone wolf detective/vigilante with a deteriorating mental state who takes on a protege so he can train her to eventually take his place, and the cases they unconventionally “solve” together. The lead actress is also the same as in Better Than Us, which I’m planning to watch asap!"
Better Than Us,No. Netflix only has the rights for worldwide release with the exception of CH and RUS. In Russia its already licensed by the original network that it was produced for. And in China I assume it either wont be shown or is also already been licensed before the Netflix deal happened.
Better Than Us,Oh it's fine. I was very rude just judging it by the trailer and it's nice you called me out.
Better Than Us,"There's a cultural reason for Russian ladies being ""hot"" - they tend to put a lot more effort into their appearance even for casual trips out than Western ladies."
Better Than Us,"Its so funny..when i research all of the cast from 'Better than us' - most of them are already famous or at least pretty successfull russian television, theater and film actors! :P 

Seems like Kirill Käro who played Georgi is also not an unknown actor."
Better Than Us,"Oh yes, thanks a lot! I saw that title of this series in her Wikipedia.  I might give it a try although I admit I try to stay away from too violent stuff."
Better Than Us,"Sorry, just making sure."
Better Than Us,"Oh, so it is shown in Russia, correct?"
Better Than Us,Bless you! ;)
Better Than Us,No worries :)
Better Than Us,Yes indeed! On russia's most popular television channel that reaches 90% of the population!
Better Than Us,Thanks! :D
Better Than Us,Awesome! Thank you.
Better Than Us,"I actually forced myself, against my better judgement, to watch the whole thing (16 episodes =  2 seasons, I think)

After some meditation about why this show sucked so bad, I think the biggest problem is tha there is absolutely no story structure.  Zero.  There's too many storylines just floating around.

Then there is very little pacing.  Scenes just drop off, they rarely flow from one to the next.  This thing just drags from vague, almost useless plot point to the next vague, almost useless plot point. 

The acting it only good to adequate, the writing is only good to adequate. Mostly.  The glaring exception is Paulina Andreeva, who is the absolute star as Arisa, taking what could have been a standard, wooden, sexyish robot role and injecting real life (ironically) into the character.

On the upside, the production value is vastly superior to most shows, and it's a surprisingly well fleshed out and interesting world.

I was a huge fan of Humans, and thought that this might be as good. It's not, which is deeply disappointing because as real life continues to slowly creep closer and closer to looking like science fiction, I wish shows like this (and Humans) dug deeper into exploring the robot/human relationship. In all it's forms."
Better Than Us,"One thing I’ve noticed about Russian series is that the drama factor often supersedes the writing quality. Not always a bad thing depending on your tastes, but that’s the impression I’ve gotten."
Better Than Us,"I gave it a shot and watched the first episode, didn't bother to watch the rest. 

Nothing was gripping, I didn't like the characters & the story was boring."
Better Than Us,I think the best written and most believable character was the hacker.
Better Than Us,"Yes, pacing. I didn't put two and two together, but that's it."
Better Than Us,"I just wish their characters felt more fleshed out with believable motivations and relationship, so that the drama would be more significant. I do feel like they're putting the narrative above the writing though, so good point."
Better Than Us,I would guess it means that there are smart funny people everywhere. Why does this have to have such a shitty title? 
Better Than Us,"That was funny, now why'd you have to go and give it a ""America sucks Taiwan is better"" title?"
Better Than Us,"I laughed so hard I spit on my monitor when I saw the ""self-pleasuring bear"""
Better Than Us,"TL;DW summed up perfectly in the sentence ""Conan is willing to fight for his self pleasuring bear in court"""
Better Than Us,"1:38 is too long?

Better Than Us,Clickbait: The Reddit Post
Better Than Us,No
Better Than Us," No, season 1 of Game of Thrones is still one of the best."
Better Than Us,Comparing Season 1 to Season 1 i'd say GOT is better. GOT had so many complex dramatic storylines that personally i enjoyed. Last of Us is pretty straightforward slow-burn by comparison
Better Than Us,This is complete revisionist history just because the way GoT ended. TLOU isn’t even in the same tier.
Better Than Us,No. I think the show is just fine.
Better Than Us,"I’m enjoying it, but TLOU is barely top 10 for HBO.

It’s way short of Chernobyl, let alone Game of Thrones."
Better Than Us,"In my opinion I was more riveted to the TV for Last of Us and enjoyed it more. Not to say that GOT is bad, it's not, but I've stalled on season 2 and there's still like 6 more seasons to go. Haven't seen an episode in a while."

I don’t know you!’ Feeling blessed, man, I tell you whot ‘Feel so Good’ is a great song, I don’t care what no-dang-body says …” added Patterson in an appropriate statement."
The Kings Avatar,"I swear the older I get the funnier this show gets. It felt so vanilla when I was a teenager, but now it’s relatable, and brilliantly observant as anything else done by Mike Judge."
The Kings Avatar,"I first read this as "" 'King of the Hill' Revival Ordered by Judge"""
The Kings Avatar,bAAUhhh
The Kings Avatar,"I notice there's no mention of Toby Huss in the returning cast. There's zero chance he's going to voice Kahn this time, I wonder if they're going to kill him off or recast him.

Also wonder if they give Huss another role. Obviously can't be Cotton unless they do flashbacks or he's a ghost lol. Maybe he voices Good Hank?"
The Kings Avatar,"if this somehow revives interest in King of the Hill Youtube Poops, I'll definitely watch it."
The Kings Avatar,Judge killed it with Silicon Valley. I'm expecting this will be great.
The Kings Avatar,"Yay but sad that there’s not gonna be any Luanne, Lucky or even Ladybird."
The Kings Avatar,[where boomhauer came from interview](https://youtu.be/rd_rty0ovgQ)
The Kings Avatar,They saw the numbers. r/kingofthehill are the real heroes for this.
The Kings Avatar,"I'm a MASSIVE fan of this series, so this news could not be more welcomed!  

Interesting that as they're talking about the original cast returning, there's no mention of Kahn.  Toby Huss is incredible in the role, but I wouldn't be shocked with today's climate if they decide to recast Kahn with an Asian voice actor."
The Kings Avatar,"I hope that they give Lucky and Luanne a ""happily ever after"" sorta ending. Please for the love of god just have them mention how they just moved away to a nice big house and are just raising their baby."
The Kings Avatar,"Details:

>Hulu is laying out the welcome Matt for the Hill Family: the streamer is reviving King of the Hill from 20th Television Animation, with co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels set to return, as well as the beloved former cast.

>Judge will reprise his role as Hank Hill, while Kathy Najimy will be back as his wife Peggy, Stephen Root as Bill, Pamela Adlon as Bobby Hill, Johnny Hardwick as Dale and Lauren Tom as Minh. The reboot has been in the works since the 2017 San Francisco Sketchfest, where Judge and Daniels reconnected with the cast and celebrated the 20th anniversary of the old Fox animated show."
The Kings Avatar,"You don't know who I am, but I know where you live!"
The Kings Avatar,It’s over for Rick and Morty
The Kings Avatar,"Dad, can I have permission to say ""hell yeah""?"
The Kings Avatar,"Neat. First Futurama, and now KOTH. Now only if they would renew Hit Monkey."
The Kings Avatar,"""That's my purse, I don't know you!!"""
The Kings Avatar,"""THERE'S A HOLE IN MY POCKET WHERE MY MONEY USED TO GO!"""
The Kings Avatar,Omg yes!   I’ve been binge watching this on Hulu over and over again
The Kings Avatar,"When my dad died KOtH played every night from 11:30-3am. I watched it over and over. 16 years later and I still go to sleep with those banjos playing in the background - it’s my comfort zone

I can’t imagine watching an episode that I don’t know verbatim but I’m here for it"
The Kings Avatar,Hulu's just leaning all the way into the revival game...
The Kings Avatar,No mention of Toby Huss probably answers that uncomfortable question.
The Kings Avatar,"I’m so excited, the new Beavis and Butthead movie and show both slap, he’s still got it"
The Kings Avatar,"Isn't this, like, the second or third time they've announced this in the last few years?"
The Kings Avatar,Imagine Dale who's the most paranoid about the government being the one that uses Facebook and tiktok the most.
The Kings Avatar,"Just have Luanne and Lucky be living somewhere far away or traveling the world on some money from another of Lucky’s scams and send a postcard every now and then. 

There. Casting solved and happy ending for the characters."
The Kings Avatar,"Forget DC, this is the biggest news of the day"
The Kings Avatar,"as someone from around the parts of texas this show is hypothetically taking place, i really hope i can see the modernisms in what i see going on"
The Kings Avatar,His will be done.
The Kings Avatar,This has to be the best news of the day for me!
The Kings Avatar,This news made my day. Really hope the rumored time jump is true. Bobby in his twenties would be something else.
The Kings Avatar,"Oof I don't know how to handle Luanne and Lucky. Saying ""they moved"" is a little tacky but saying they passed is pretty morose for a show like this"
The Kings Avatar,"Darnit Bobby put down that blocks and mow the lawn!

Its roblox Dad."
The Kings Avatar,That’s my purse! I don’t know you!!!!
The Kings Avatar,Who is going to voice Luanne?
The Kings Avatar,"I really the animation will be hand drawn, not all digital. Looks far superior."
The Kings Avatar,""" Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you"""
The Kings Avatar,"Love the show, but just wish they would make new stuff instead of trying to go back to nostalgia. ( goes for movies and tv shows)"
The Kings Avatar,"Mike Judge is great. He always holds on to his vision, he doesn’t approve shitty knock offs or let studios pressure him into watering things down. And his influence on 90s music culture is still very overlooked IMO. There are so many bands I learned of through Beavis and Butthead that I otherwise probably never would have."
The Kings Avatar,[deleted]
The Kings Avatar,The world needs this.
The Kings Avatar,It would be cool if it was Bobby hill as an adult with his own family and hank as a grandfather
The Kings Avatar,Get Roger Clyne on the phone ASAP
The Kings Avatar,So who is going to voice Luanne?
The Kings Avatar,No Luanne and Lucky though. RIP.
The Kings Avatar,When damnit when!?
The Kings Avatar,It's about god dang time
The Kings Avatar,King Of The Hill and Futurama both coming back. I like it
The Kings Avatar,This is great news.
The Kings Avatar,Rip Luanne and Lucky 😞
The Kings Avatar,Wow. The Mike Judge timeline really has reached its Renaissance...
The Kings Avatar,no way... I just started watching it few days ago... love the simplicity of the show and the characters.
The Kings Avatar,"The great news is that Johnny Hardwick has been taking videos shooting cowboy guns and singing about pocket sand as Dale on Youtube for years, so his voice is primed and ready to go."
The Kings Avatar,Are they going to replace the voice of Khan with an Asian actor ?
The Kings Avatar,"As someone who adores this show, had birthday parties revolving around this show, has seen it through over a dozen times…. 


This news is both exciting and worries the shit out of me."
The Kings Avatar,"You know you're tired when you read this as ""New episodes of KOTH ordered by Judge..."""
The Kings Avatar,As reminder King of the Hill was viewed as a slice of life in Japan and there were Subs v Dubs over there when it came to this show
The Kings Avatar,Dang it Bobby
The Kings Avatar,"As messed up as it is, I hope they kill off luanne and lucky. And an old Hank and Peggy find themselves raising Gracie and GH with help from adult Bobby"
The Kings Avatar,Well not the WHOLE original cast.
The Kings Avatar,"Dang ol' Mike Judge man bout time tell you what, watchin reruns for dang ol' three decades man."
The Kings Avatar,"Dammit, Bobby."
The Kings Avatar,"“Hey, man, dang ol' listen, man.”"
The Kings Avatar,"This is one of the best things I've heard this year thus far!! Now this show may not be for everyone but for those who enjoyed it or grew up with it being a presence on their TV this is awesome. Some may say this show is dumb, but this show teaches more values, manners, cultural differences, being thankful, acknowledging a mistake and manning up to own it, respect to others in our lives, and how different people can be. I can't wait for this to aire, just as I'm sure John Redcorn can't wait to fix Nancy's next headache. Lol"
The Kings Avatar,"The first scene has to be Hank walking in on Bobby listening to music on his wireless earbuds, and Hank wants to listen to this [new generation of music](https://youtu.be/6z1neskULsQ)."
The Kings Avatar,Look forward to this. Sucks Murphy and Petty are gone.
The Kings Avatar,"This is kinda like Futurama coming back, I'm hoping for the best. 

KOTH had such a great 13 year run."
The Kings Avatar,Dangit Bobby
The Kings Avatar,Time to be bullish on propane and propane accessories again!!
The Kings Avatar,"Damnit Bobby, you better not be fooling around!"
The Kings Avatar,"Initial reaction: **(Dale Gribble voice)** Wingo! 

Second thought: **(Hank Hill voice)** Don't screw it up, you giblet heads."
The Kings Avatar,It’s about durn time!
The Kings Avatar,I tell you whahat
The Kings Avatar,There is a God
The Kings Avatar,"So, no Luanne or Lucky?"
The Kings Avatar,I am sooooooo happy and excited about this. I can’t wait to get back to Arlen.
The Kings Avatar,Propane powered electric car chargers
The Kings Avatar,"I'm calling it now: Hank killed Dr. Phil, the timing can't be a mistake"
The Kings Avatar,Hell yes!! I've literally started watching rerun clips this past month and enjoying the nostalgia. What great news.
The Kings Avatar,"""Im driving the hell out this truck"" -Bobby Hill-"
The Kings Avatar,"So, Dale is going to be pretty much full blown QAnon now, right?"
The Kings Avatar,"Make it happen! This show is so great, it holds up so well. I recall as a child not getting it or liking it very much, but watching it today. . . It’s so well done.

Edit: except for the episode where Peggy reaches sex-Ed, that was always funny to me. 

“Happiness. . . Haa-piness. . . piness. . . penis. . . PENIS!”"
The Kings Avatar,Time for some spa-Peggy and meatballs!
The Kings Avatar,I’m honestly a little worried with what they’ll do with it. I worry it might become a lot more political than it was in the past.
The Kings Avatar,RIP Luann
The Kings Avatar,Not a single mention of Luanne. Wtf?! RIP Brittany
The Kings Avatar,"I mean - Dale has gone full QAnon - or he is Q. Peggy has been exposed on Twitter as a Karen. Hank’s been canceled. Boomhower is killing it on Tender. Bill has lost all his money due to an Onlyfans addiction. Bobby has been radicalized on YouTube. Connie’s GPA has slipped because she’s decided to be a TikToker. Life was so much simpler in 2010, I’ll tell you what."
The Kings Avatar,"I *loved* King of the Hill, but I don't like this at all. King of the Hill was a show of its time through-and-through, and that time has passed. 

I want to be clear: gatekeeping reboots or sequels is dumb, this is not me saying that anyone excited for this is enjoying themselves wrong, I'm saying that I have serious doubts this particular revival can be done well."
The Kings Avatar,"**Hank:** Get that dang gum phone outta my face Bobby. What in the hell are you doing? 

**Bobby:** I'm just making a TikTok that's what all of the kids are going these days. 

**Hank:** What the world is a TikTok? 

**Bobby:** It's social media. See you can make videos and share them all over the world. I'm trying to go viral! I'm an influencer!

**Hank:** if you don't out that thing outta my face...

**Peggy:** Hank! You need to encourage Bobby! Try to be more into the things he's into. 

**Hank:** I can't understand why anyone would want influenza. That's it! Tomorrow I'm gonna call the doctor and make sure we get all get our flu shots."
The Kings Avatar,Not Brittany Murphy :(
The Kings Avatar,No Tom Petty though. :(
The Kings Avatar,I’d imagine they’d *never* recast Luanne in respect of Brittany. So does this confirm that they’re retiring the character?
Til Death Do Us Part,"Yeah, because it's fucking long."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Kinda have to. I could be misremembering, but Part I is around 16 hours long, Part II was more like 35/40 hours, even if a lot of those events are concurrent

Edit: apparently I remember it being longer than it actually is! Still, I think it benefits from being approached as multi season arc, as someone who likes the vast majority of it"
Til Death Do Us Part,"I feel like part 2 could be adapted as two shorter seasons of 7-8 episodes, with hopefully a quicker turnaround. It'd suck to have to wait two years between seasons 2 and 3 after the likely 2 year wait (optimistically 18 months) between seasons 1 and 2."
Til Death Do Us Part,"I’m curious where the split will be in-between seasons. Unless season 2 is going to be all >!Ellie hunting Abby and end with Abby confronting her at the theater, but I don’t know if they’re going to do the POV switch in the show because it could seriously dissuade show-only members if a season 3 starts and they only see Abby every week for over a month. Paralleling their days in the same episodes seems like a better fit for the medium.!<

Also I’m guessing they’re going to add a lot to the show because even thought Part 2 is twice the length of Part 1, it has a lot of extended combat scenes (moreso than Part 1) that will likely be taken out. I can see them fleshing out >!some of the side characters like Yara, Jesse, and Isaac were who fairly one-note in the game, and give more backstory to the Seraphites since they felt like set dressing for the most part.!<"
Til Death Do Us Part,If I don’t see the >!Rat King!< I will stop watching 🐀
Til Death Do Us Part,"That was obvious but what I'm curious about will be the timeline. Will they keep it like the game or make it more linear? Either way after season one, I trust them."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Third season will be the NG+ playthrough where the story is the same, but all the gun stats are maxed out from the beginning."
Til Death Do Us Part,I really hope they keep the crane
Til Death Do Us Part,"Hope they keep the rope puzzles, I loved those."
Til Death Do Us Part,Part I really needed that extra runtime as well.
Til Death Do Us Part,"This sounds like they’ll be able to give it room to breath and maybe it’ll give them a chance to structure the story  in a way that feels a bit tightly focused. I love the story they told with the game, just feel like the way they told it could have been re structured a bit to work a bit better."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Makes total sense. If the pacing is about the same as Season One, Season Two could comfortably take us to the natural ""inflection point"" that anyone who's played the game can appreciate.

Part II is a more complex story with a larger cast of major characters. Would definitely feel rushed if compressed into a single season."
Til Death Do Us Part,"I don’t like a lot of the choices from part II, I think a few changes here and there and it can be received much better. 

It will probably still be an absolute shitshow online like when the game released."
Til Death Do Us Part,Really wish the first season was longer
Til Death Do Us Part,"I hope they take their time with it. This season has felt a little too rushed, in my opinion."
Til Death Do Us Part,"This season was good but as it went on it felt like they were rushing through the plot and the finale felt just a little hollow as a result, almost like I was watching a catch-up summary for the next season. Doesn't help that every show now has to be 10 episode seasons or less. Looking forward to starting the game and getting the full effect."
Til Death Do Us Part,[removed]
Til Death Do Us Part,It was a significantly longer game so that makes sense.
Til Death Do Us Part,I still think they could have made Part I into two seasons. Maybe not 10 episodes each season but something like 7-8.
Til Death Do Us Part,"So I haven’t seen the show yet, but for those who have, is season 1 part 1 only?"
Til Death Do Us Part,"All of yall thinking where to cut in the video game, but im guessing they could go the hobbit route and randomly introduce a love triangle between side characters. 

Oh lord"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Absolutely hated Part 2 for personal reasons, but if they decide to adapt so that >!Season 2 is Abby’s background and story, maybe leave out the part that intersects with Joel and Ellie first so that new fans don’t know who she is and they get to bond with her character and then either end Season 2 with their initial confrontation or start S3 that way and have the entire season focus on their conflict!< I would give it a shot.

Main reason why I didn’t like Part 2 was >!The way they wrote Joel’s ending!< and >!the game’s ending!< being absolutely disappointing for me. But I hope they make it work somehow."
Til Death Do Us Part,The drop off of viewers is going to be interesting after a certain event.
Til Death Do Us Part,"everyone working ""spoilers not spoilers"" into their comments, suck, for those of us who didn't play the game, and are just trying to enjoy the story presented by the show"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Huge spoiler take

>!show dies when joel dies!<"
Til Death Do Us Part,This last episode felt rushed with 9 episode season for sure
Til Death Do Us Part,Why don't they just make a couple seasons that explore what happened between the games?
Til Death Do Us Part,This show started off amazing. I got bored as the season went on. I’ll watch season 2 but I’m not excited about it.
Til Death Do Us Part,"I personally didn’t really think Part 2 was that good, but I can definitely see it being handled a lot better in a television series format, especially considering Part 2 will be stretched longer to make everything feel more developed and complex."
Til Death Do Us Part,"a 3 season show feels about right, I'd like it to have a definitive end there and not just say ""hey, success, lets keep it going!"""
Til Death Do Us Part,"I hope the actress that plays Ellie will be able to pull off the older character. I'm assuming so, but still makes me nervous"
Til Death Do Us Part,"I thought they flew through David’s storyline. I’m loving this so much that I don’t mind if they stretch it out, I know they won’t ruin it and I trust that they will stick to source material and not exhaust the series"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Should have done the same for part 1. One of the most poorly paced shows I've ever watched. I'm glad they stayed pretty true to the game but damn, they could have done so much more."
Til Death Do Us Part,"I think they are between a rock and a hard place with the next season. If they follow the games' story there will be a ton of people that hate it, if they dont it will be admitting that the direction they went with the game's story was essentially a mistake. Will be interesting to see how they navigate it."
Til Death Do Us Part,[removed]
Til Death Do Us Part,I imagine you’d have to just for pacing purposes when translating it to live action formats. The fairly early game twist would be jarring if they just hit that off the beginning episode of season 2. Not to mention there is plenty of in between game happenings that could be made into great character development moments to make the events of the 2nd game more impactful in tv format
Til Death Do Us Part,they could have adapted season one into multiple seasons. they rushed through the plot points I thought.
Til Death Do Us Part,Money
Til Death Do Us Part,"Probably should do their own spinoff, too, explore the whole world, get as wild as they wanna."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Could have done that with s1 too, felt rushed ino"
Til Death Do Us Part,"I think they will probably pseudo-alternate between TLOU and HOTD every year, like they did with GOT and Westworld years prior. 

They now have seasons 2 & 3 mapped out. HOTD S2 is coming out in 2024, so they might do TLOU S2 (first half of Part II) in 2025, and do HOTD S3 in the same year (2025) or 2026 and do TLOU S3 (second half of Part II) in 2026 (since it would be a two-parter story, I don’t see this coming out in 2027). 

Maybe a break after 2026, and they might have revealed or even released TLOU Part III by then. So possibly TLOU S4 in 2028."
Til Death Do Us Part,"First game needed at least 3 or 4 more episodes. Or 2 seasons. With Joel almost dying as the finale/cliffhanger.

Glad they will be making game 2 at least 2 seasons."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Pitch Meeting:  
 *So, you got a tv show for me?  Yes sir I do. You know how you like money sir.  Ohhh yeah, is that what the script is about?  Well it can be sir. I was thinking we take a single story and make it last 3  or 4 seasons.  Oh very cool, sounds like the fans will love waiting 4 years to watch it.  I think so sir*"
Til Death Do Us Part,"I haven’t played 2 because it seems like a despair burger (I get notoriously dark with stuff like that)

Is it worth it though? Im seeing people saying it’s an experience not worth missing. May have to change my mind…"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Without spoiling the games, is season 1 the entirety of part 1? Like part 1 and season 1 ended at the same spot?"
Til Death Do Us Part,"This is great news. People already felt this first game felt rushed, and the second is twice as long."
Til Death Do Us Part,"So I gotta say... the show was a pale comparison to the game. Performances were flat (Check out side by side comparisons if you don't believe me) It felt really small in scope and severely rushed.  Felt like a local theater troupe rendition of a Hollywood play. 

If I had never seen the original, I would have probably loved it, because I didn't know all the stuff they cut out and how stellar the performances were. Yes, I know episode 3 was a nice story, but it wasn't worth cutting out an entire section of the game where you really come to understand Ellie and Joel as characters. BUT, I think most issues I had with the season was a budget problem. They couldn't afford to tell a grand adventure. So, with the big success, maybe they can do the story justice.   IMO, the first game should ideally be covered in two seasons instead of one.  Splitting up the second game will improve pacing a lot."
Til Death Do Us Part,Shit… that scares me! If you played the games you know why
Til Death Do Us Part,Of course Neil wants his proper baby to span into 2 seasons while the S01 finale was 46 minutes
Til Death Do Us Part,Tbh wonder how pedro/joel being done durty is gonna go with tv audiences. Ppl definitely hated it and i personally hate the entire plot of the second part.
Til Death Do Us Part,"For once I wish they'd deviate from the source material. Unfortunately, I found the plot of part II to be lackluster and not that interesting."
Til Death Do Us Part,loved the second game but i hope the show improves some narrative issues that part 2 have.
Til Death Do Us Part,I know I'm alone on this but I wish they'd come up with new stories that take place in between the games. I want more world building and what not
Til Death Do Us Part,Milk that cow dry baby. After that we will have 3 spin offs and prequal
Til Death Do Us Part,"I think that makes sense.

I think Craig Mazin is perfect with character dramas, and was STILL surprised at how well-developed the characters of TLoU are.

But we all know the biggest challenge is TLoU2 by a *mile*. They all have their work cut out for them trying to get me onboard with that story. Even just trying to connect the two stories meaningfully... because Drunkman failed so spectacularly...

I like The Closer Look's YouTube video arguing how the story works wonders as an adapted TV series that can give the perspectives they need to give the story scope. Much better than a video game that has to frame the game through a couple perspectives at most.

I say this because TLoU tried to pull a grand perspective shift and failed because it disrespected the player and played then for sympathy, constantly trying to twist them into hating the protagonists...

I don't know if it's possible to salvage TLoU2. But I think if anybody can do it, it's Mazin. And I can believe it's going to take 2 seasons to get there. I'm praying they can find two complete stories that fill in the gaps of story in the game. With what I've seen of S1, I'm at least hopeful they got a shot."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Naughty Dog needs to get on finishing its story.

I'm getting Game of Thrones flashbacks."
Til Death Do Us Part,"God I'm actually low-key dreading them adapting LoU2, if only cos we're gonna get a repeat of all the awful discourse surrounding it, which among other things led to actresses/creators getting death threats, the Last of Us sub devolving into another redpill/gamergate hive and has even infected this very thread when I scrolled towards the bottom comments, only this time it won't just be contained to gaming sites."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Last episode sucked though, they cut way too much and it felt rushed."
Til Death Do Us Part,"They are going to have to. I think they start losing viewers once they >!kill Joel off, so hopefully he stays alive for most of if not all of season 2!<"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Lol they speed run/drag their feet through the beloved first game in one season, but now want to drag out the maligned and controversial second in multiple seasons? 
Yeah ok makes perfect sense 😂"
Til Death Do Us Part,Hopefully with better pacing. My expectations are pretty low because season 1 was kind of weird.
Til Death Do Us Part,"Yeah, I loved the game but felt it was a couple hours too long: condensing all of that into 9 episodes would be a nightmare."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Game 2 seems to be a passion project of Druckmann based on the way he presents the game. I’m not surprised that he’s basically brushing aside the first game to start work on the second. 

I’m curious to see how it will be adapted considering the gameplay in game 2 is what held it up, not the story. Maybe he’ll listen to criticism and change up the way the story was presented, but he’s been pretty bullheaded and doesn’t seem like the kinda guy who think he can do wrong."
Til Death Do Us Part,First game should also have been two seasons honestly.
Til Death Do Us Part,"I mean hell, I thought the game was over and then it switched perspectives

Then I thought it was over *again*, and it switched perspectives *again*

They’ll definitely go the GOT route and have rotating perspectives or else people will tune out when season 3 doesn’t feature anyone you really know. It would be like if they made season 4 of GOT with *only* the parts about Dorne in the books."
Til Death Do Us Part, Shoulda done that for part 1 too
Til Death Do Us Part,I LOVED the narrative of TLoU. I couldn't finish TLoU2.
Til Death Do Us Part,This'll be a beautiful trainwreck. The discourse will happen again cause they'll double down.
Til Death Do Us Part,"Because they know ""you know what"" is going to turn people away and they want to delay it as much as possible"
Til Death Do Us Part,They’re adding to the show to keep certain characters on screen for longer.
Til Death Do Us Part,"I don't get all the excitement and hub-bub about this show. I'm up to episode 6. I mean, it's good, and I definitely didn't expect Nick Offerman to make me cry, but..... It's just a rehash of The Walking Dead, no?"
Til Death Do Us Part,"if the seasons are only 10 episodes, that's unsurprising"
Til Death Do Us Part,"honestly this first part should of been two seasons it felt so rushed yet it had entire pointless filter episodes about characters that had 5 minute in the game. 

Would of really liked to see more of the infected as a threat.  They really felt like a non threat. And while the game is almost Post - Post apocalypses where humaning it coming back around and the biggest threat to humans is humans.  They (infecteD)  really felt like almost a complete non threat ."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Why not just do a longer season? Remember when shows used to have like 24 episodes a season? I get wanting to cut costs, cut filler, etc., but it really feels like with a lot of the shorter season shows nowadays that you lose so much character development by only having 10 episodes to work with. We just don’t know anything about characters anymore. There is no room for the relationship between character and audience to just take a breath together."
Til Death Do Us Part,"It's going to need some reworking. The plot in TLOU2 was pushed along by the characters trying to out stupid each other, it was infuriating. I finished the game hoping that they all die."
Til Death Do Us Part,Milk it baby.
Til Death Do Us Part,"Just don’t nerf the violence from the second game. Don’t want them softening it up, the second game was amazing"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Part 2 is a story that's undermined by and undermines its medium, If done well it will shine and be appreciated much more in the TV show."
Til Death Do Us Part,"If they >!kill Joel like they did in the game,!< I will stop watching the show right then and there."
Til Death Do Us Part,Redo season 1 as 3 seasons. I feel like the sped through it.
Til Death Do Us Part,Last episode was ass
Til Death Do Us Part,Gotta milk🥛that intellectual property.
Til Death Do Us Part,"I wish they had done this for season 1 instead. It felt so rushed, and I was in no hurry to get to the story of the second game.

The stakes are so low compared to saving humanity from Game 1, and I hated what they made the character of Ellie become, and disagreed with her motivations for most of the story. It had all the sensibilities of a Rambo movie wrapped in a pretentious bubble, and had none of the heart of the original."
Til Death Do Us Part,No thanks
Til Death Do Us Part,"I hope they change the order of some events. Whilst I think it had the basis for a fantastic game, the pacing and structure left so much to be desired. I just didn't care what happened because of the way it was. They kept trying to force this one thing on you and I didn't care."
Til Death Do Us Part,They did this exactly backwards.  They should've made TLOU at least 2 seasons.  The adventures of Joel & Ellie is what people wanted.
Til Death Do Us Part,Could have easily done that with season one too
Til Death Do Us Part,"This was clearly the plan, all along. Rush to Part II quickly."
Til Death Do Us Part,"Hopefully, ""adapt"" means change that story completely"
Til Death Do Us Part,"People are thinking that the next seasons are going to be as negatively divisive as the second game was.  I think this may be incorrect.

1. Hopefully they will have learned their lesson from the games and keep everyone in character this time.  This was a preventable problem with the game that could have been solved with better writing.  So with a little luck, they can solve the problem here.
2. We can have a bit more time to build up the new characters.  It's hard to do that in a game where everyone really wants to get back to playing the characters they know.  
3. This format may be much more forgiving to the story they wanted to tell.  One of the problems that turned many people off was being forced to play as someone you felt was the enemy.  That is tricky to pull off.  But we are used to seeing different points of view in shows.  Cersei was a fan favorite despite being, well, Cersei.  

We'll see how they handle it."
Til Death Do Us Part,"So wait…. If I watch the last episode of season one tonight, I don’t need the game?"
Til Death Do Us Part,"Excellent. The game itself has cliffhangers within cliffhangers, it’s only right the show leaves us wanting more as well. All the stories and character arcs might not feel rushed"
Til Death Do Us Part,So they could drag out that crappy storyline? Ugh!
Til Death Do Us Part,They should have did that with the first video game
Til Death Do Us Part,"The second season is just going to be the rattlers subplot confirmed.

/s"
Til Death Do Us Part,"I hope they can make it a little more compelling than the game, just because it is hard to follow game/season 1. Don’t get me wrong I think it’s a good story but it felt dragged out"
Til Death Do Us Part,Could honesty be 3 season if they are are short as season 1. 9 episodes with 2 being self contained flashbacks made it fly by.
Til Death Do Us Part,"I’m really curious/excited to see how they adapt this game. I’m a huge fan of part 2 but I think by far the worst aspect of it is the pacing and a lot of that was down to how the story was structured, so I wonder if they’re gonna change that for this show."
Til Death Do Us Part,Gotta stretch that oooouuuuuttttt mang.
Til Death Do Us Part,I’d love to see them have a season that explores Ellie and Joel living in the community. With the season finale being the beginning of TLoU2. Have the end of S2 be the golf club scene.
Cannon Busters,I wish they would’ve done some promotion for this.. the posted the trailer the same day it came out. I had never even heard of it until I saw it on twitter.
Cannon Busters,So... basically Trigun?
Cannon Busters,Netflix did a poor job marketing/promoting the series. Why wait until the day of release to put out the first trailer?
Cannon Busters,Does anyone know the song?
Cannon Busters,Is the show any good?
Cannon Busters,Is this out right now?
Cannon Busters,FINALLY!
Cannon Busters,"I really wish this anime trend of ""crappy cost cutting 3D that we hope you won't notice"" would go away - it's a huge turn off. The rest of it looks interesting enough to give a go though."
Cannon Busters,I got HEAVY trigun vibes in the first 5 minutes of the first episode.
Cannon Busters,"Netflix is *horrible* at promoting most of their stuff. Like Evangelion should have been marketed to Damnation and back, but there was very little lead up after the announcement trailers and topped with a bad translation."
Cannon Busters,So many shows I’d love or even ones I watched the first season of don’t show up for me on the first page. It’s maddening sometimes.
Cannon Busters,"It's the theme song of the show. Showdown by Bradley Denniston and Kevin Beggs, Performed by Marty Grimes and BJRNCK

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGqbO94HnGI"
Cannon Busters,"Pretty enjoyable. Not anything super spectacular but it’s not garbage 3D and it has a cool enough world and the principle characters are fun to watch. Solid ost with bangers for the OP/ED. I’m a big fan of LeSean Thomas’ work and it’s cool to finally see his project come to fruition. It’s a bit like a mix and match of Outlaw Star, Michiko and Hatchin and Trigun.   
   
Solid 7.7/10"
Cannon Busters,Its painfully average considering how derivative it is of better works.
Cannon Busters,It was released today
Cannon Busters,I mean it was pretty hyped from announcement but considering the garbage new dub and the lackluster translations it’s not like it was huge addition aside from finally being streamable on the service.
Cannon Busters,"Thank you very much, 2nd part is so great."
Cannon Busters,I will give it a try just because it does not have that shitty 3d animation.
Cannon Busters,"Ah. I see. Thanks! Googling it said something about March 1st, so I was wondering."
Cannon Busters,It looks like the show was Kickstarted some time ago.  I think March 1st was the day backers got their own copies.
Cannon Busters,"Years and years ago I bought the first issue of the Cannon Busters comic when it first came out, thinking the premise was really cool, and was looking forward to reading the future issues. They never came out, and the project was dead. 

This is the first I have heard of the show, so I am interested to see how it goes."
Cannon Busters,Watching it now its amazing.
Cannon Busters,Anyone know the song in this trailer?
Cannon Busters,eh too much cgi.
Cannon Busters,"Looks cool. I see strong Cowboy Bebop and cyperpunk vibes. On a side note, coming from an long-time anime fan, does anyone feel it's kinda not right to see anime-style animation paired with english original voice acting?"
Cannon Busters,Japanese dub when?
Cannon Busters,Following
Cannon Busters,"The japanese audio is actually listed as the original audio on Netflix. They also have French,German and Spanish audio."
Cannon Busters,Umm. No.
Cannon Busters,"Thanks, glad to know. I will check it out later."
Cannon Busters,"Cool, glad to know."
Cannon Busters,Are the character designs suppose to be like that? They look better in the comics
Cannon Busters,Ugh it's terrible
Cannon Busters,It's not that bad there's worse anime/cartoons on netflix
Cannon Busters,It's one nonstop rip off of Trigun. At least create your own world and characters.  I'm surprised the bounty on the main character wasn't in double dollars lol.
Cannon Busters,"Don’t forget cowboy bebop.

Show is so bad mah braen hrtz"
Cannon Busters,Why would anyone downvote this. This is good news.
Cannon Busters,"Looks awesome always into anime and this American anime looks awesome. 

Anime (from Japan) right now is a bit formulaic and cliche for me and getting tired of it, I've been reading more translated light novels now instead of watching anime or reading manga cause of the current quality is arguably meh."
Cannon Busters,"Also...

Cannon Busters,"It's The Brain, not Brian."
Cannon Busters,Well around that time PBS was writing a spinoff where Buster travels all around the world while living with his Dad. Buster could've simply just have lost touch with Arthur during his travels if the spin off wasn't cancelled. And maybe PBS wrote that scene with the spin off in mind.

Belle and Sebastian,"The BMW people talk about how they still get residuals today. They were just joking about getting another 9¢ check.

They actually just had an episode where they talked about it.  They got different amounts depending on where it aired."
Belle and Sebastian,"All I know is Jaleel White came up with a brand of weed called ""Did I Do That"" and got rich again."
Belle and Sebastian,"Absolutely, and even worse."
Belle and Sebastian,"I don't have any specific knowledge to contribute, but there's a bit of a chicken and egg thing here.  Those shows pay non-stop because they're inexpensive to run. If the contracts were better negotiated, something else would be playing in their place."
Belle and Sebastian,Aren’t these agreements governed by union contracts?  And don’t they have professional agents negotiating on their behalf?
Belle and Sebastian,"Jodi Sweetin was on Steve-O’s podcast and briefly talked about her Full House residuals; it’s enough to pay a bill a month, but nothing else. She also talked about how Netflix pays out on their shows as well. The whole interview is really worth checking out."
Belle and Sebastian,"It's Hollywood accounting.  According to CBS, ""Star Trek"" has yet to make a profit."
Belle and Sebastian,"If you get more on the back end, you get less on the front end."
Belle and Sebastian,"As actors, I think they caught a huge break. If they got screwed, they should talk to their legal guardians. There are industry groups and unions that do nothing but make sure that their members get a fair deal. If they didn't use those, their guardians should be sued."
Belle and Sebastian,It’s the Nickelodeon and Disney kids that don’t get residuals.
Belle and Sebastian,Lol isn’t it called purple urkel?
Belle and Sebastian,"There is much truth to that. That is why I Love Lucy and Andy Griffith and many black and white sitcoms were a staple of tv reruns in the 70, 80's and 90's ,and many sitcoms post 1970 quickly faded after 1st run syndication. The agreement of the 1970 SAG strike excluded pre 1970 shows from residual pay for performers. Ironically we are seeing something similiar play out in real time,where streaming Networks to save money will start cutting recent shows  but back catalog shows will be fine because per the terms of contracts of most contracts signed 15-20 years ago they don't have to give them any residuals for streaming even if a show is popular because streaming did not exist."
Belle and Sebastian,"They're supposed to be, but if the show is owned by (for example) Disney, and they sell it to ABC affiliates for $1.  What percentage of that goes to the actors?  Zilch."
Belle and Sebastian,It’s weird I never really thought about it but I feel like millennials and older have knowledge of these old shows that the younger people haven’t been exposed to.
Belle and Sebastian,"You'd be surprised perhaps, the younger kids are doing this thing where they get really into older media or time periods and make me feel OLD for not being into the stuff my parents were. Things kinda just work their way back in cycles, like clothing trends or hairstyles."
Belle and Sebastian,"Wow, Lily James is unrecognizable. Reminds me of the make-up work in Bombshell. Extremely impressive."
Belle and Sebastian,I genuinely can't see Lily James
Belle and Sebastian,The Sebastien Stan and Lily James brands are so very far removed from Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. I was confused and doubtful about the casting. But they've really gone all out.
Belle and Sebastian,"[I just learned that Seth Rogen, Nick Offerman, and Taylor Schilling are also in this series.](https://deadline.com/2021/04/pam-spenser-granese-mozhan-marno-1234745942/)

>Seth Rogen plays Rand Gauthier, the man who stole the tape; Nick Offerman plays porn impresario Uncle Miltie, who helped him distribute it.

> Taylor Schilling, a fractional series regular, will play [Erica Gauthier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Boyer), Rand’s wife — at least on paper. Erica is a porn star on her own terms, with emotional and intellectual intelligence that Rand cannot quite fathom. Although she’s moved on long ago, she still holds a place in her life for Rand … as long as he behaves."
Belle and Sebastian,Is this the American version of The Crown? Lol
Belle and Sebastian,"That is an insane transformation.

I zoomed in and still thought it was Pamela Anderson."
Belle and Sebastian,"Wait, that's the young lady from Baby Driver?"
Belle and Sebastian,Give the makeup artist an Emmy already
Belle and Sebastian,"Sebastian Stan should have been nominated for I, Tonya."
Belle and Sebastian,They look really spot on for 2 actors I never thought for those roles.
Belle and Sebastian,The tits are prosthetics right? I’m a woman and I’ve never seen a bra that can do that.
Belle and Sebastian,"I read that as ""Sebastian Stan as Tommy Lee *Jones*"", and was real curious. After seeing the picture there was a moment in which I thought there was a side to a young Tommy Lee Jones I'd been unaware of this whole time!"
Belle and Sebastian,But does he hang dong?
Belle and Sebastian,"I seriously doubt I will ever watch this, but it’s kind of shocking how much Lily James looks like Pamela Anderson in these photos. If she can actually do a convincing acting job as her is another issue, but I’m really surprised that she actually looks like her.

Sebastian Stan looks more like he’s dressed as Tommy Lee for Halloween though, like if he turned up at your party you’d have to ask him who he’s supposed to be."
Belle and Sebastian,"What sorcery is this?

I couldn't have less interest in watching this, but I can still appreciate the mind-blowing transformation the production crew has pulled off here. I don't know if it's just because it's a still, but if you hadn't told me that was Lily James, I'd never have known. Top-tier stuff.

Last one to give me this level of nfw experience was Colin Farrell as Penguin in *The Batman* trailer."
Belle and Sebastian,Will Sabastian Stan honk the horn on a boat using his penis?
Belle and Sebastian,They both look incredible. Has there been any word of when this limited series will debut?
Belle and Sebastian,Holy shit they both look *good*
Belle and Sebastian,Something something bisexual awakening.
Belle and Sebastian,Hepatitis: The love story
Belle and Sebastian,I don’t know why but I read Tommy Lee Jones at first and was very confused 🤷
Belle and Sebastian,"As someone who doesn't like biopics at the best of time, is this *really* a story that needs telling?"
Belle and Sebastian,"Tommy Lee , Vince Neil,  Nikki sixx are some of the trashiest shittiest humans ever ...they got away with so much rape (and murder for Neil)"
Belle and Sebastian,'**BONK: The TV Series**'.
Belle and Sebastian,[removed]
Belle and Sebastian,"I really did like **I, Tonya**, but this is one of those projects I will wait a little to check. I’m curious what angle they are taking it, hopefully not too campy!"
Belle and Sebastian,"As long as someone is steering a boat with their dick, I’m in."
Belle and Sebastian,This is just scary what make-up and clothes can do.
Belle and Sebastian,That V line on Sebastian!!  #izoomedin
Belle and Sebastian,Um.....did anyone notice the writer confused her for fucking Emily VanCamp?
Belle and Sebastian,Pamela working Tommy's fat dick was the first porn video I ever saw.
Belle and Sebastian,She looks more like Pamela Anderson than Pamela Anderson did.
Belle and Sebastian,They both look amazing! I genuinely could not recognised Lily at all.
Belle and Sebastian,Fucking and The Weiner Soldier
Belle and Sebastian,Oh shit! Are they gonna do the tape? Cause sebastian is hot
Belle and Sebastian,but why?
Belle and Sebastian,i didn't even look at the title to this post and just assumed it was a doc or something but that's lily james and sebastian stan holy crap.
Belle and Sebastian,what a weird role for Lily James. never pictured her doing something like this.
Belle and Sebastian,When does it come out?
Belle and Sebastian,"Yup I'm gonna need some proof that's Lily James 

This is gonna win the ~~oscar~~ Emmy  for makeup"
Belle and Sebastian,"hot damn I was pre-sold on this based on the behind-the-camera talent but also skeptical sweet ol' Lily James who radiates likeable, sweet girl-next-door could capture Pamela Anderson, it's just 2 photos with some heavy filters on it but holy cow 👏👏👏"
Belle and Sebastian,Is this film going to have the scene where Sebastian Stan honks the boat horn with his hog though?
Belle and Sebastian,Are we gonna see Sebastian Stan steer a boat with his dick?
Belle and Sebastian,Did anyone ask for this?
Belle and Sebastian,Kudos to the makeup department: they look spot on and are unrecognizable as themselves.
Belle and Sebastian,Thats just a picture of Pamela and you cant convince me otherwise
Belle and Sebastian,So is this a reboot of the previous Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson videos?
Belle and Sebastian,Damn I can't see Lily James in this picture lol
Belle and Sebastian,She looks amazing. He looks goofy as hell
Belle and Sebastian,How did they add the big boobs?
Belle and Sebastian,"For a second I thought tommy lee jones was going to play pamala Anderson’s boyfriend, was really exited"
Belle and Sebastian,Lily James is fucking everywhere
Belle and Sebastian,14 Executive Producers for 7 hours of streaming television. Sigh…
Belle and Sebastian,Tommy Lee got recast again? Is there no consistency in the Mötley Crüe cinematic universe?
Belle and Sebastian,We’re really running out of ideas for shows and movies.
Belle and Sebastian,That site is cancer on mobile
Belle and Sebastian,I wonder if there'll be an episode set on a boat?
Belle and Sebastian,who ever did Lily James hmu fucking nailed. I didn't even recognize her
Belle and Sebastian,Y'all act like Pam and Tommy just burst through the door...
Belle and Sebastian,"I'm impressed. I couldn't picture it at all when it was announced but this looks good so far. I legit thought that first one was Pamela Anderson, you can't even tell that's Lily James."
Belle and Sebastian,JUST GET TO THE BOAT SCENE!
Belle and Sebastian,Hopefully we get a full account of Pam's role on Home Improvement. Wonder who's playing Tim Allen and Richard Karn?
Belle and Sebastian,Cool
Belle and Sebastian,Here’s hoping SS gets cast as Luke 🤞🏻
Belle and Sebastian,I hope it's just episodes of boat footage.
Belle and Sebastian,Annnnndddd I have once again fallen in love with Lily James.
Belle and Sebastian,Really? They’re making a series about this? Couldn’t be less interested.
Belle and Sebastian,Wow. Who cares
Belle and Sebastian,Lol why are these 2 getting a show? This is a complete waste of money
Belle and Sebastian,Who decided this was a story that has to be told?
Belle and Sebastian,Sebastian Stan is one of the best actors in today’s age
Belle and Sebastian,[removed]
Belle and Sebastian,who the fuck thought it was a good idea to make a show about two has-been losers?
Belle and Sebastian,Nobody wants this series sorry
Belle and Sebastian,"Weird flex for the winter soldier, but I'll allow it."
Belle and Sebastian,"Why, though?"
Belle and Sebastian,"She looks great, he looks awful."
Belle and Sebastian,"Feelings aside for him as a musician, I thought Machine Gun Kelly was wicked at Tommy in the Motley Crue Netflix movie"
Belle and Sebastian,"Not into it. Sebastian's a great actor but, he doesn't have the right look for Tommy Lee; not even with the tats and losing weight."
Belle and Sebastian,Can’t wait for the boat scene
Belle and Sebastian,"Oh, spare me"
Belle and Sebastian,Not sure we need this.
Belle and Sebastian,Who asked for that?
Belle and Sebastian,Do people really care about the back story of a porn tape or just the porn tape ? In 6 min of the sex tape I know about all I need to of their story
Happy Jail,I just finished the series. The documentary is entertaining but quite bizarre. Interesting nonetheless.
Happy Jail,"I'm from cebu actually...  just to let everyone know, gwen garcia in the documentary was suspended because of some issues about using govt money to buy a plot of swamplands for millions, that their family agedly owned... but not so sure on the details though..."
Happy Jail,"I watched it! I loved the documentary. It really showed how corrupt and unorganized the Philippines government is. While that jail has been super popular, it's overcrowded as fuck (people sleeping in hammocks attached to the ceiling), you only get palo (hit) on the butt if you disobey, unorganized, etc. However, I don't know who's side I'm supposed to take? 

On one hand, we have an ex-con who basically runs the jail and it's nice that they get visitation/connection to the outside world/self governing within the cells, but obviously it doesn't work out in the end. On the other, we have previous governors who complain about it but don't do a good job handling the prison/end up being governor again and appointing the governor who they complained about the whole time.... 

I feel so bad for one inmate in particular, Marlon. He didn't commit a crime but has been in jail for 9+ years, yet, he still has been positive and hopeful... I hope he's doing well."
Happy Jail,"The story of your friend sounds more interesting, what happened? how did he get out? do you have any news links about it? (I also finished Happy Jail)"
Happy Jail,My wife is from Mindoro and she knows prisons/jails are bad in her country because of corruption. She was amazed at how clean and orderly American versions were. Even if full by our standards.
Happy Jail,I had the same reaction. It was entertaining but also a weird mess.
Happy Jail,"I found it hilarious that she appointed her brother (who seemed like a piece of shit) to be in charge of the jail. And then after he's ousted, he has the gall to call nepotism for this guy putting his wife's classmate in charge."
Happy Jail,Gwen seemed a little too critical for some reason. Guess she just wanted to be in charge.
Happy Jail,"The details are a bit foggy on how he got out. I suspect bribery and corruption but perhaps he got out through more honest means.

He was jailed in 2003 for nearly 200 grams of cannabis. He was on death row and expecting to die at some point. 

He says he paid $100,000 in under the table cash to get out, a news article about his deportation says he got a conditional pardon and had to pay $10,000 dollars. Given the state of corruption in SE Asia I suspect the truth is a middle ground between the two.

He's mentally ill so the details are always a bit different, but a lot of what he says is verifiable. I met him in Northern Thailand, we were both living in a town there. He's ex-navy, ex-death row, and it shows. He'd spend a lot of nights just out there doing crazy shit and end up in all sorts of drama. He had to leave the town after a mutual friend of ours was found dead in the local river, it took a really big toll on him and sent him even further over the edge.

There's no news links about him but there are a few photos of him in a series of photos  [documenting the jail he was in](https://i.imgur.com/hZGhCOl.jpg)"
Happy Jail,"Oh yeah, his brother acts like your typical douchebag politician in the philippines..."
Happy Jail,"Honestly, my reaction was: Why are there only assholes in charge of anything in this?"
Happy Jail,">He was jailed in 2003 for nearly 200 grams of cannabis.

Interesting, I can't find any reference to a case like that even with out death row. Thanks."
Happy Jail,Are you implying im lying?
Happy Jail,"They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.  I don't think they made a persuasive case for that at all.  And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series."
Happy Jail,"dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory. you're nuts for thinking that was in line with the show but BCS's finale wasn't. 

But it seems you're funneling the ending of jimmy, saul, and gene into one ending as if a single moment was supposed to end all of those story lines -- which is not possible. The cartels etc wasn't ""written into a corner"" for a finale, you must remember that Saul's story ends like 3 episodes before the finale. Everything after is solely Gene's story, which ends in its own manner, with the remembrance of Jimmy, and a near courtroom eulogy for Saul. They are different stages of the same person, yes, but you are still only considering Saul as if he's the ""true"" Jimmy McGill. Likewise I saw no ""fairy tale redemption"" for him, his redemption if ever comes after the last scene."
Happy Jail,I can't recall a better series finale.
Happy Jail,"I also have this unpopular opinion. The last episode felt rushed, it should have been split into two so all the scenes could develop further, but the actual story points I have no problem with, it's just the pacing and directing that felt off.

I also didn't like the ending to Breaking Bad.

But I also have the unpopular opinion where endings don't ruin a show for me, so even through I didn't like the ending of BCS it's still one of my favorite shows I've seen."
Happy Jail,I liked it
Happy Jail,I thought it was a satisfying ending. My only gripe is the 86 year sentence. It seems a bit excessive. I think Saul will eventually find a way to get out. He'll start a new life in Hollywood. He'll produce the story of Walter White on the big screen.
Happy Jail,"I loved the ending of Ozark. I love that they could not get away clean. Masterfully done.

Better Call Saul’s ending HIGHLY disappointed me. The last minute courtroom switch made no sense with his character. I cannot believe any reasonable person would trade a 7 year sentence in a nice jail for 86 (EIGHTY-SIX) years in a terrible prison.

Especially not Jimmy McGill. The crisis of conscience felt a little too Hollywood. (Also I don’t see how they were laying all those charges on him.)"
Happy Jail,"Not just the finale but the entire final season was bad. Everything hinged around how they treated Howard and that felt incredibly out of character for the both of them. Howard didn’t deserve any of that, he wasn’t Chuck."
Happy Jail,"I agree with many of your points. While not all bad, it felt rushed and I expected better and it was a letdown, based on the quality of the show up to that point. The noble prison thing was lame, and out of character for Saul or Jimmy."
Happy Jail,"I enjoyed reading this, I found myself let down that in the space of the last so many episodes, we don’t get even one ‘last’ scene of Jimmy and Kim and the final straw for their breakup. I guess I was thinking they would show something more dramatic and his transition to the full-on Saul persona once and for all. A little disappointed we didn’t get a final scene with Fring / Mike either but I suppose we did, in reality, with the Lalo finale ep.  This probably represents a lame take but I was expecting more dialogue, more depth, more scenes with interactions in the present to wrap it up instead of a long running commentary on Jimmy continuing scam-life, as entertaining as a few of those were."
Happy Jail,"I hated the Gene storyline, all the way to it's culmination and yes, the finale. In my eyes, he'll always be slipping Jimmy"
Happy Jail,"It was a completely disingenuous ending to a great character. In a world where there really is no justice, what a cop-out, cheap ending. For shame Gilligan and Gould"
Happy Jail,"Yeah I found it to be a pretty weak ending. Just felt forced and cheesy. Not only that, but the climax of the main timeline a few episodes earlier was quite disappointing as well. The character of Lalo deserved a lot better."
Happy Jail,"I found S6 to be a major disappointment but found the finale satisfactory but forgettable. The more I think about the ending it seems to get worse. Originally I thought it was a masterpiece then it slowly began to age worse in my mind.

I still think it is a great ending when compared to other shows. Like a 8-8.5/10. But the final season as a whole disappointed me."
Happy Jail,I licked it.
Happy Jail,"No I loved it. The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes. Everyone else didn’t matter. Kim know Jimmy would be inclined to bs his way out of everything. So offering up his soul in the court room meant something to her. 

They both had to take accountability to put the past behind them and be at peace. It wasn’t terribly rushed or anything."
Happy Jail,"The counter-circle-jerk has begun. As things were, so they are, and ever shall be."
Happy Jail,No.
Happy Jail,Yes.
Happy Jail,"Yes I'm disappointed at the ending too.
He basically volunteered to not live his life. Wich really doesn't fit I think. Even a remorseful saul Goodman/jimmy mcgill wouldn't loose the wish to live life to it's fullest. All the time he did what he did because he could. Because he wanted to live life with everything it could offer him. This spirit wouldn't vanish, just because he decides to be a honest man from now on.
Yes, he did tell people what he did and why. But what for? He could have been remorseful 7 years in prison. There is no sense in having to be in there for 86 years except that kim now thinks better of him. But he can't even see her (regularly)."
Happy Jail,"It was clear Vince Gillian was not as present for the last few episodes.   Although he was entirely on board for the crap ending.  Their reasoning was Jesse went free, Walter died, so in this series, someone had to go to jail.  Okay, but for 86 years?  I liked the extreme pushing Saul to prove he could get less time. And get Ice-cream) In reality, no person would be on board for a literal life (death sentence imprisoned).  If you actually love someone, you are not pleased with this sentence.  It was disgusting to see Kim's disapproval continue on until Saul/Jimmy life was Sunk.  And then to end on them sharing a moment, a smoke and joke about "" You had 7.5 years, you got 86 but with good behavior, who knows!"".  What were they thinking?  Clearly, they were not.
A redemptive arc for Jimmy/Saul would have been he does some time in prison. 10-15  years.  He redeems himself by devoting his time to volunteer educating inmates. There were a dozen of alternatives. 
Kim has less accountability and was entirely responsible for going after Howard.
Kim's reasoning was, together her and Jimmy were not good together.  Because they enabled each other.  People got hurt, Howard got killed.   So they were no longer together.  
Kim Wexler character has zero character. I am sure Saul, Jimmy, Gene was content and happy being left to rot in a super maximum, but he ""won"" ""Kim's "" approval.  Meanwhile, Kim returns to Florida."
Happy Jail,"It felt lazy and too storybook for the rest of the series. You spend the first few seasons hoping something good will happen to Jimmy because he seems to be on an endless losing streak, honestly he should have got away with it in the end, I think it would have been better. 

Gets the girl, gets away with the crime, somehow ruins Skyler Whites life a little bit more because fuck her….."
Happy Jail,The Gene episodes were so incredibly drawn out and boring to me. There was a lot of unnecessary storytelling that made me totally antsy and uncomfortable.  They should have separated it like they did with El Camino. It was like a completely different show. To go from the edge of my seat cartel drama to boring b&w storytelling. I still loved the series and am considering watching again.
Happy Jail,"Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. It was a swerve at the very last moment. Couldn't believe they showed him in prison with not a care in the world, and in fact getting constant props from other inmates.

I know a lot of people loved it, but I was just surprised that was the way the showrunners decided to depict prison and Jimmy within it.

I honestly think the camaraderie and good vibes between the cast and crew bled over into the writing so that the characters were handled with kid gloves at the end. Possibly to keep various options open for further spin offs."
Happy Jail,Nope
Happy Jail,I liked it
Happy Jail,I liked it
Happy Jail,you wrote all that for your opinion. It was one of the best in modern history
Happy Jail,I liked it
Happy Jail,No
Happy Jail,"I heavily disagree, I can agree that the finale felt rushed and ended somewhat abruptly but the finale was perfect in my eyes, the Time Machine scenes with Mike. Walt and Chuck were the perfect send off scenes for those characters. It depicted them so well while showing us in the last one with Chuck that Jimmy's regret is not having that heart to heart with Chuck that night hence Chucks book ""The Time Machine"".  The episode did an awesome job of making us believe Saul was going to become pure evil by lieing and dragging Kim down with him to get an absurd 7 year sentence, everything about the court scene was absolutely perfect, the suit, the music, having that douchbag Bill as his advisory council, the way Saul just cleansed his soul of all his sins and became Jimmy again was beautiful, he showed that his love for Kim and the guilt of breaking the Law outweighed having a 7 year sentence and living with himself for the rest of his life as a lie and a cheat. Kim and Jimmy having one last smoke with the same cinematography and music as the first time they met was the icing on the cake, people need to get over the ""Better Call Saul"" scene on the bus, I didn't really find it cringy It just showed us that Jimmy is going to be fine in prison, hell might even run it because of everyone remembering what he did for them over the years.  The end ended somewhat abruptly but looking at it now I'm OK with Kim's last glimpse of him being the last scene of the show.

This is my opinion and how I precieved it, everyone has a different way of how they pictured the finale to go down but I believe the majority of true Breaking Bad/BCS fans found this finale to be near perfect, the only things I would have wished for was Skyler and maybe Huell and Kuby to be there at court but that's more fan service than being a necessity, I was glad to see Marie and Agent Gomez's wife"
Happy Jail,"Hi.
I have not talked about it with anyone.

I ""wanted"" Kim to either be killed or be in jail.    

I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?    I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy?    Was that implied?   Or maybe I missed it?   If so, why?   

I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time."
Happy Jail,"Well you basically just defined moral ambiguity in TV. Is it more interesting to study the morally conflicted than it is to study the morally decided. Duh. That's why the show follows ""evil"" people. Also, you're pretty quick to condemn people as evil. Maybe adopting a less simple, less dichotomous definition would be good. Then you'd believe that the show follows the razor's edge of good and evil and that that's what makes it great. Is it ok to do bad things for decent reasons? I guess that question and its like are looked at in the show. 

More importantly, after talking about how sociopaths are oh-so incorrigible, you talk about how McGill's final decision is meaningless, making him no better a person. Well the whole point of his last decision is to show that McGill, an evil guy in your own words (as far as I could tell), could change. Maybe it doesn't heal any damage (plus I'm not convinced that anyone thinks that sentences heal damage), but it does show that he can change if he wants. He's not seeking the sentence because he wants to deflect blame (or whatever); he's seeking the sentence because he doesn't want to be slippin' Jimmy anymore and this is his last shot at being someone else."
Happy Jail,Kim just wouldn't be practising law anymore.
Happy Jail,"Bit late to the party but couldn't agree more. The guy who could lie in his sleep decides to become Mahatma Gandhi & speak the truth at the most critical time of his life!? Cmon!

A clear conscience could have been achieved even with spending 7 years in jail. He could have opened a pro bono practice or something after those 7 years to get the ""approval"" of the person he hadn't seen for 6 or so years.

Not just the finale, but the last two seasons seemed inconsistent. Kim & Saul's reasons for going after Howard also seemed rushed. Like Kim had one not-so-great encounter with Howard at the court (season 5) and then decides to ruin his life!? Umm okay..

Lastly, this black & white thing seemed fine when it was just a few scenes, but having whole episodes with it..Na, definitely not a fan.

&#x200B;

PS: Does anyone know if Peaky Blinders had a decent/consistent ending or not? I'm thinking of watching that next."
Happy Jail,"I know ppl liked this ending but for me also this was prolly the worst ending writers could come up with. The last season went against everything I liked about this show from humorous witty moments as opposed to more serious narration of breaking bad, to forcing a demise for characters viewers cared about, like how Kim Wexler, pullin off a sudden break up or rushed ending of Lalo and whatever they wanted to do with Nacho. From my perspectiv the previous seasons showed the good nature of Jimmy despite being hated by almost everyone not a vile criminal who MUST face his inevitable punishment. Another point of attraction of those seasons were Mike being an interesting character who we cared about but now in the final season he became trivial and almost forgotten in the final ride. They also did dirty to Kim. Especially this character was interesting because unlike Skyler, she actually supported and helped the protagonist/anithero, but I guess the writers at some point decided to punish her for that and for me that build up didn't make any sense whatsoever. The awkward sex scene of Kim with that random dude felt like so forced and out of place I think writers wanted to defile her one way or another. Either way it was obvious the writers had some urge to force their moral compass (again). All in all I find it weird how the light hearted spin off of Breaking Bad had more of a tragic ending than it's more serious predecessor."
Happy Jail,"I was really interested in seeing what happened to Kim in season 6. Their relationship and mainly Kim’s loyalty to Jimmy was what really made the show great along with all their shananagans. I was disappointed that how the show ended simply because I was hoping they had a happy ending. Sort of rooting for the bad guys. 

But Jimmy getting 87 years instead of 7 was real because of how many times Kim bailed him out. And how many times Jimmy pulled off a scheme for Kim’s benefit. They loved each other and even though she couldn’t live with what they did and left for Florida, she was in love with him and wanted him to be ok. When Jimmy found out she confessed about Howard, his only choice was to sacrifice himself to save her and by doing so, prevent her from being sued or charged. He did it for her like he did so many times during the show. 

It may seem corny, but one of the shows main themes was their love story and that is what they ended it on. Her being his lawyer and seeing him on prison. Great acting and they really connected well. I think this show was better than breaking bad"
Happy Jail,"> They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.

No, it was about redemption period, not just Kim. That's why he also mentioned what he did to his brother in court, despite it not even being a crime.

>And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series.

The writers just needed a quick way to show Jimmy would be okay in prison, and wasn't going to suffer daily in a high security penitentiary. It also calls back to when Saul was suggesting Walter White turn himself in and face the music:

>Saul to Walter White: ""You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that?"""
Happy Jail,"Yes! This was my issue with it. He would do all that for  woman he had not seen in years? Willing take on 79 more years just so she would admire him again?

It really is not reality."
Happy Jail,"I agree about Ozark.  It didn't feel like an ""ending"" at all, more like they just arbitrarily decided to stop making more episodes.

People argue that the end fits because the Byrds will just fuck over everyone and anyone to get what they want, which I guess is in line with the whole rest of the show, but that is exactly my problem with it.  They could have made that ending at literally any other point in the show."
Happy Jail,"> dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory

Dexter: New Blood has entered the chat."
Happy Jail,Breaking Bad!
Happy Jail,"I know this is an old thread, but finally watched it last night. I enjoyed the ending a lot"
Happy Jail,I was good at it.
Happy Jail,Probably he'll try to short his sentence or getting transferred to a better jail instead of remaining into an (unrealistic) ADX.
Happy Jail,"Agreed. Jimmy was way beyond the point of caring. He was hardened. His character change was out of nowhere and there was no reason for him to give up his scheming to suddenly come to terms with all the biggest moments in the whole series that he could never accept

A much more fitting ending would be for him to get away with a 7 year sentence and pull off one last scheme to save Kim by weaseling past the system, and then going to jail with a smile on his face knowing he got away with it. Because that's who he became after chuck died.  Or, to fail in his scheme and go away kicking and screaming. 

Instead the writers redeemed him in a very unauthentic, cornball way that left me knowing without a doubt breaking bad is a superior TV show"
Happy Jail,I loved the gene mall montages with the Cinnabon but gene was overall depressing
Happy Jail,"Agreed! As wicked, evil, and as smart as Lalo was, he went out way too easy. The show was a bit anticlimactic after that…"
Happy Jail,WHAT!? Season 6 was amazing what did you not like about it? May have went in a different direction than I thought it would but the way it all went made perfect sense to me
Happy Jail,How'd it taste?
Happy Jail,">The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes.

Sometimes you can understand the point and still dislike how it was executed.

Kim didn't really take accountability, all of the problems that occurred for her were because she chose that for herself. There was no real judgement. She had the freedom still to choose what life she wanted. Just because the story depicts her current life as a bleak one doesn't change that. In contrast Saul's freedom to choose is now completely gone and he was judged by an authority figure."
Happy Jail,"> Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. 

He's going to die in prison. How is that going easy?"
Happy Jail,"Jimmy was broken up with Kim for years why would anyone throw there life away for a ex girlfriend. 
You obviously never seen a prison documentary lol
Prison is tough especially doing life with psychos
You're probably a kid that has never really seen jail"
Happy Jail,"Basically all of this is answered in the show:

She did not use the vacuum guy to disappear. She clearly has a nameplate on her desk in Florida with the name Kim Wexler, her coworkers call her Kim. Remember, Walt, Saul and Jesse all got new names and identities when they disappeared. She goes back to ABQ to meet with Howard's widow and submit her affidavit to the court, etc. She is plainly not hiding.

It's super clear Kim feels very guilty about how her scheming with Jimmy leads to Howard's death. She doesn't trust herself to not do anyone harm, so she cuts ties with Jimmy and the law. Her life in Florida is so opposite from her life in ABQ on purpose. She's put herself in a place where she can't harm anyone. 

That extends to her new personality. Florida Kim doesn't trust herself to make basic decisions (the ice cream flavor at the office party, the mayo substitute, etc)."
Happy Jail,"> I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?

She resigned.

> I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Uhhh, she gave up her life's passion and left the man she had passion and love for? Now she's living a dull life that doesn't excite her.

>
Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy? Was that implied? Or maybe I missed it? If so, why?

Uh, no.

>
I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time.

He wanted redemption."
Happy Jail,"I kind of agree. Her name pamby character was too abrupt. It didn't feel very genuine. 

I imagined Kim and Jimmy being Bonnie and Clyde and going down together. That would have been more suitable for how the show set itself up for the first 5 seasons"
Happy Jail,"He didn't give a shit about redemption until the prospect of Kim being in trouble arose.  And I understand the purpose of the bus scene, that doesn't make it work any better though.  They could easily have found a non cringeworthy way."
Happy Jail,"How does dying in jail redeem anyone? Redemption is about the truth setting you free, dying in prison aint that. I'm not getting the whole ""I loved it"" crew. The ending made the the series pointless."
Happy Jail,Agreed
Happy Jail,"This is a good point. Maybe the show should have ended with Lalo's death.

Jimmy deciding he needs more prison time still seems like a nonsense illogical ending for an otherwise cunning and shrewd character."
Happy Jail,It made perfect sense for a person who is able to talk their way out of anything to talk themselves into dying in prison? That an old woman who could barely turn on a computer could suddenly plug it in and use Google? That she would find Saul as a conman when he was actually a lawyer with a good track record? That he'd confess to impress a woman who left him years ago and how he'll never be with? Literally nothing about any of it made sense. Nothing.
Happy Jail,Tastes like a bunch of convicts chanting my name on a prison bus.
Happy Jail,She literally confesses and leaves it up to everyone else to punish her as they see fit.
Happy Jail,"Right, I didn't memorize every detail, but I do remember now that her coworkers knew her as Kim wexler.

I didn't feel like the show explained why she wasn't working as a lawyer in her new location.    She didn't go tell Howard's widow until later, but, OK, I can see the explanation that she didn't trust herself anymore."
Happy Jail,"Not Kim being in trouble, she's still in trouble. His actions did not protect her from civil litigiation. He lied to the prosecutors (off camera) and claimed he had information to incriminate her criminally, but he only said that to make sure she appeared in the courtroom so he could give his true confession, on record (just as Kim confessed on record to Howard's widow).

Plus from a writer's perspective, Jimmy either had to die or get locked up for the rest of his days. Otherwise there'd be more story to tell where he's free and willing to continue doing crime. If Saul won, it'd basically be a repeat of the Breaking Bad ending, bad to the very end. Instead he chose redemption, inspired by Kim, his brother, and just a slow culmination of events in his life."
Happy Jail,"I think he clearly still cared about redemption throughout his whole time as Gene. The man was just a hollow shell, only by admitting his actions and facing justice can he move on mentally. 

That's the first time in the whole show where he admits to anyone that he was the one who got Chuck killed. The guilt over that is so clear throughout s4-6"
Happy Jail,"> The ending made the the series pointless.

He stopped repeating the same mistakes he kept making his whole life. He could have conned his way out of a long prison sentence. Instead he came clean, he was just honest for once, completely open and honest, regardless of the consequences. He chose another path. That path has serious consequences, but it redeemed him.

If he had gotten out of prison after 7 years or less, he would have just gone back to fraud and crime. The show couldn't end unless Saul's gone. So, Saul ""died"", and Jimmy McGill was born again. It was about Jimmy's redemption, not Saul's. If he got away with it, it'd be the same Breaking Bad ending, bad to the end, embracing the criminal alter ego completely (Heisenberg). Jimmy broke bad for a long time, but chose another path, and became Jimmy again, not Saul."
Happy Jail,110% on Jimmy take
Happy Jail,"Agreed, thank you."
Happy Jail,Yeah you’re dead right.
Happy Jail,"He knew he could get away with it, but he chose not to. He'd rather live his life in prison as Jimmy McGill and be able to look Kim in the eye, than live free as Saul Goodman, alone. Saul Goodman was the last thing he wanted to be. I'm surprised this went over your head, they alluded to it from season 1. His divorce scene with Kim (""have a nice life Kim"", obvious denial), the ending to S6E9 where he has no one but a hooker in his house (loneliness), heck his entire relationship with Chuck (""he'll never change"", discouragement). He WANTED to be the honest guy people loved, except the people he sought that love from didn't precipitate, EXCEPT for KIM. She was the only one. So once she left, he did what he did best, at the cost of his morals, honesty, and true love.

In other words, he never wanted to be ""the person guilty people hire"". So yeah, he did it for Kim, but he mostly did it for himself.

Also, I hope you realize Saul Goodman was one of the most wanted men in America at that point who was known for illegal activities and scam cover-ups. I wouldn't say an old lady typing in google, ""conman from Albuquerque"" is far-fetched."
Happy Jail,I'd rather have a Cinnabon tbh
Happy Jail,"Yes but she doesn't really face any consequences for her actions. If she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants. However, Saul does not. He actually faces real punishment"
Happy Jail,"That is the equivalent of being grounded. Kim, a former attorney knows that involves zero jail time.  A civil suit ""could"" ruin her financial.   Kim deserves more than that."
Happy Jail,There was the whole scene in the breakup episode where Kim tells the judge that as of that morning she wasn't a lawyer. And then later Jimmy is desperately trying to get her to reverse her decision to give up the law .You can't practice law if you're not a lawyer.
Happy Jail,"Actually I respect that take. I think they could have made a better redeeming arc though. Okay he came clean but nothing good came out of it. I see nothing redemptive about dying in prison.
As a lawyer he should have asked to see the evidence against him (it was probably scant anyway) and let justice take its course. He'd have probably got off and then he could have seen that as being given a second chance and then being shown determined to make the most of it. This really did nothing for anyone. Him getting justice by being let off due to a lack of evidence would have actually spoken more about the American legal system and the fact that its existence is a lot of the reason Jimmy was able to become Saul in the first place."
Happy Jail,"I don't think he redeemed him, he just finally accepted his decisions have consequences.

My interpretation is this:

Saul Goodman won. He had a 7y sentence.

Jimmy McGill finally made a good decision.

And he chose to be McGill to himself and Kim. Even though the world will always see him as Saul Goodman."
Happy Jail,"An old lady who could only load up cat videos suddenly being able to use ask Jeeves is a stretch. There were better ways for that to work.

It's not that things went over my head (albeit thanks for believing I'm intelligent enough that it would surprise you) and it's not that he chose to spend his life in prison, it's that there was a better way to come to that conclusion. He confessed. Big whoop. Why didn't he just do that in ep 1 season 1 and we could have just bypassed about 10 episodes and a truck load of unnecessary black and white? Just made the whole thing a massive waste of time. Look Kim in the face? A face he'll hardly see in the coming years, hardly a motive. Also he was already going to prison so it's not like he was getting away with anything. Definitely a disappointing end in that regard."
Happy Jail,They literally say she’s at risk of losing everything she has in a civil suit
Happy Jail,Lol after that affidavit no state bar will allow Kim to get her legal license back
Happy Jail,"This old lady could only watch cat videos when she first got the laptop. I don't think it's a stretch to say she's learned what ""ask Jeeves"" is over a month of time. 

You don't have to like the way the show went, but to say it doesn't make sense is wrong, which is what you said in the first comment. But now, in this comment, you are saying you don't have a problem with the fact he chose to spend his life in prison. But later on, you then say Jimmy choosing to go to prison because he wants to make things right with Kim isn't a motive?

If I'm honest, it's hard to know what you're saying. I'll assume the last thing you said is what you mean. In that case, I've explained these motives in the last comment. If you don't buy it and still think it doesn't make sense, fair enough, but the entire show from 'episode 1' has been alluding to it. If you don't buy that Kim is a part of a reason, that leaves everything else I wrote about morals and consciousness, basically the essence of Jimmy's character (aside from Kim). And if you don't buy that, then there's not much point in discussing this anymore. 

My thoughts are that I thought the ending was perfect, to every minor detail and flashback (except for the ""better call saul"" chant on the bus). Same as the parallels in the episode before. As much as I wanted him to get away with it, it made the most sense to his character that he didn't, given the context of the ENTIRE show."
Happy Jail,But she chose not to be a lawyer anymore anyway.
Happy Jail,"No it's not wrong, just because you've made sense of it and it makes sense to you doesn't mean it has to for everyone else and just because I said it didn't make sense that doesn't mean I disagreed with the ending. What didn't make sense to me was that after everything he just confessed. The allusions aren't really anything they're just plot armour, conveniently placed for us to feel there's context to the ending. Just like the cringey bus chanting. What I'm saying here is that if this was about Jimmy righting wrongs that's fine but the avenue they chose to bring it about was lazy and hasty. I'm also not convinced the state had that great a case against him or they wouldn't have offered him only 7 years and the way this show has dragged I can barely remember what he did to be wanted in the first place. It's not that BCS wasn't a good show, it was especially the back story, it's that it has been plagued with scheduling issues and AMC's stupid mid season breaks meaning it's been hard to piece together the story for those of us who have watched since the beginning because the story is rich and complex and considering the back story is rich and complex, it's a shame that ending want given that same build up and attention. Three tacked on episodes. We deserved better. We were meant to get 13 EPs a season,  think had we had that there have been more time to build up to the ending the way it needed to. I envy the people who are watching now, I think they'll have a better experience as they won't have to wait two years between certain seasons and months halfway between others."
Happy Jail,"You said ""if she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants"". The life she had before was that of a high power lawyer which she cannot attain. No company car, no fancy apartment, etc. She can't go back to the life she had, even if she wanted to"
Happy Jail,"This is the most braindead game I’ve seen about the show. Why would he confess in s1 ep 1? That episode was him being a lawyer and the black and white scenes had to do with gene trying to hide from “Saul” while still keeping that attitude. Walter had a drastic impact on almost everyone he met. The black and white scenes were to show how gene got affected and him getting back to his roots. The ending is a masterclass in storytelling and the perfect end to the show. I’m not even sure how you got through 60+ episodes of this show and completely misunderstanding a character this bad. The 6 seasons were to show how jimmy got up to this point. The flashforward/flashback scenes represented jimmy and sauls morals conflicting with each other. Everything, from chucks betrayal, chucks death, Kim dragging jimmy (and joining) into becoming a scammer, was never his fault. He was the product of what happened around him. This is show in season 1, when he genuinely listens to chuck about waiting and trying to become a good lawyer. He then gets backstabbed by chuck and hears the line “I’ve never really cared much about you” from his own brother. This single handedly kills most of the “jimmy” morals left. Most but not all. We see this within the Saul flashbacks in season 6, where he hesitates and never looks into the eye, while talking to kim. She takes notice of this and leaves without saying anything. He also hesitated before talking to walt in the school, and hearing that he has cancer. His character arc is about learning to accept who he truly is, and how changing names or running away from that, won’t change anything. He’s lost everything and everyone from trying to continue as “Saul”. He made the choice to give up everything in the end because he found no  reason to continue as a conman. Lalo is the perfect antagonist for jimmy. Both Saul and lalo are sociopaths, with one being far more violent than the other. Those seasons 5/6 were to show how both these characters are similair, and how lalo was one of the characters and reasons as to why jimmy ended up to where he is at the end of the season. Those 3 characters, chuck, Kim, and lalo were all part of jimmy, and ones who caused him to go from “jimmy McGill” to Saul goodman. Chuck forced a wrong view of himself on his brother, Kim forced jimmy into scams towards the end, and thus led to lalo becoming involved and the eventual demise of Kim and sauls relationship. The ending of the show was to represent how all these 3 characters affected him, and caused him to make the decision to give into prison. Also you saying how jimmy not ever being able to see kim again contradicts your point about how he did it just because kim was there, but jimmy won’t ever be able to see her again so that point is worthless. Kim was PART of the reason as to why jimmy gave in, but not the entirety. Seasons 1-3 was to show sauls moral and external demise as jimmy, while 4-6 was to show his internal collapse. In the end, there’s still a flicker of jimmy left in his soul, and he felt guilty of everything he had done, which was shown by hints within the Saul flashbacks and Walter and the person he drugged, both having cancer, representing how he’s not entirely sociopathic. His arc was t a redemption arc, but rather a twisted one. In the end, he truly understood that no matter what he did, or how much he ran, jimmy McGill was still him, and yet he deserved his punishment in prison for all his crimes. A poetic and perfect ending to the story, which you clearly misunderstand, along with the whole point in the show."
Happy Jail,"Yes Kim has her black and white life in Florida,  potatoes salad and the yup man.  She was relentlessly, ridiculously after Howard.   Jimmy was accountable but not as much."
Happy Jail,">No company car, no fancy apartment,

Does she even care about this? I mean she came to the realisation in previous seasons a high paying job wasn't enough for her and she would rather defend people in the cases she actually cared about rather than selling out.

But yes okay fair she can't be a lawyer anymore. But she had already chosen that to be the case years ago."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Aries picked a good week to quit Twitter
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Yikes 
No more AT&T commercials"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"“Haddish verbally explained what was expected of Plaintiff Jane Doe and then showed Plaintiff Jane Doe how to give fellatio, including movements, noises, moaning, and groaning,” the lawsuit states. “At that point,” Jane told The Daily Beast, “I knew a hundred percent what they wanted out of me.” The lawsuit describes Spears allegedly looking on while a “physically, emotionally, and mentally uncomfortable” Jane received this instruction.  
“I tried to mimic what they wanted me to mimic, but it still came out just super uncomfortable,” Jane told the Daily Beast. “I knew when I left the booth that I didn’t complete what they wanted me to do.” Haddish paid Jane $100, the lawsuit claims, before sending her home.

""According to the lawsuit, the children were separated during the shoot. Jane recalls that Haddish told her to remain on a couch downstairs while her brother’s shoot took place upstairs. The Daily Beast has reviewed a recording of the video, in which Haddish plays the boy’s guardian and leaves him with Spears—who plays a pedophile.  
John spends most of the video clad only in his underwear as Spears’ character leers at him through two holes cut into a newspaper he pretends to read. During the sketch, the camera zooms in suggestively on the 7-year-old’s buttocks and crotch while he plays. Spears sprays baby oil onto the child’s back and massages it into his shoulders in one scene, and at another point the child plays with a train in a manner that suggests phallic masturbation. In another sequence, Spears smokes a cigarette while observing the child nude in a bathtub and pours water on his feet."""

To anyone who is thrown off by the story, the way Spears and Haddish worked together was through making a Funny or Die sketch.

Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Welp, looks like Haddish’s role on Kids Say the Darndest Things will be coming to an end."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Hold up isn't that the guy from MadTV who used to make fun of Michael Jackson?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,The Afterparty is toast
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Spears is the dude who recently went on and on for like 10 minutes talking about how fat Lizzo is while, himself, looking like Grimace from McDonalds, right?"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"The craziest thing about this is that they literally recorded Spears sexually abusing that kid and uploaded it to a popular website, and somehow no one was aware of it until now."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Imagine being a professional comedian with such a horrendous sense of humor that you manage to traumatize two kids with it.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Aries Spears is having a week
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Bruh...Tiffany Haddish hosted the reboot of ""Kids Say The Darndest Things"" who in the fuck could have guessed that Bill Cosby would end up number 2 on the list of creepiest hosts of that show."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"just checked tiffany's insta, she was at a chris brown concert recently, why is he still a thing??"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,jesus that is truly awful. The fat guy from Head of the Class got nothing on this
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I never cared much for Haddish but always thought that Spears was fairly funny at least from watching some of his standup. Very disappointing if this is true.

If this is true and there is proof that these videos were made, it's a terrible look for these two. Maybe they wanted to go for a provocative comedy sketch but this is obviously not the way to do it. At the best, those two were extremely reckless and irresponsible with children.

Worse case scenario, Haddish and Spears are pedophiles and wanted to make these bizarre sketches as an excuse to exploit children."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Damn. I recently listened to Conan O’Brien’s podcast episode with Tiffany Haddish, and it really changed my perspective on her. She turned out to be a lot more smart and thoughtful than I had previously believed her to be. If these accusations are true, then she just lost all of my respect."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Holy shit
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Found this on TMZ, I got pay walled by the daily beast :( 

[There’s some layers here.](https://www.tmz.com/2022/09/01/tiffany-haddish-aries-spears-sued-grooming-molestation-child-porn-videos/)"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Well that’s not good
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,How could you think that’s a good sketch idea?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Just yuck! How on earth could they think making that kid, in his underwear, film a scene like that and rub baby oil on Aries Spears is even remotely OK, is beyond me! Just wtf! It’s too bad nothing can happen criminally, but I hope they win millions."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,[removed]
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Wasn't Tiffany a victim of childhood sexual abuse too?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,That scene in Girl’s Trip comes across a lot differently now.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,i can totally believe that. sounds legit. tiffany already admitted on air to pimping girls out.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I think I’m gonna be sick. Who does that!!!!
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I remember when Aries Spears was on MadTv they made fun of R Kelly. It was a parody album called Songs In A Minor and he played R Kelly. How sad.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I’ve never ever liked haddish. Knew she was a POS on numerous examples - like when she talked to a reporter after the Will smith slap thing. 

Poor kids. These two idiots careers are over, I hope."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"This shit isn’t funny. Even 10 years ago, this shits never gonna be funny ever.
Fucking disgustin.’."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"***Holy Shit***


There’s no coming back from this type of thing. They are more than cooked atp"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"When I saw how much Haddish loved hanging out with African Warlords, I hoped there was something else awful enough about her to bring her down. We found it boys!"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Well, guess that ""Not Evil"" song in The Lego Movie 2 really was a fucking lie."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Wow wtf. This is sick. Like… How do shit people always make it and get famous.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Her career is over. There's no way she comes back from this
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I’m truly horrified and disgusted by this. How could they even film such a thing? No one stopped them? Ppl actually helped them? They should be in jail.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Can I say now that I never understood why people liked Tiffany Haddish?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"So this lawsuit was filed pro se, so that means no lawyer would touch it. Attorney’s can work on a suit  on contingency if it had merit. She was a kid with her brother, who she is know the legal guardian of at age 22. She and her brother were in a terrible sketch idea that’s whole punch line was sexualizing kids. Terrible idea that was up on funny or die website until they pulled it in 2018. But now it is the reason they are traumatized for life. The mother said she was lied to about what the children she left with her friend, Haddish, we’re going to be filmed for. That’s the mother who lost custody of her own son to her daughter after a series of personal and mental tragedies, per the article.

So before you read the headline and assume it’s true, read it and then judge for self. Any counsel worth his salt would tell them to not even acknowledge this. Especially for the daily beast."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I’m tryna see how these claims are that bogus as Haddish’s lawyer says considering there actually was proof this video was created. Lends belief that the actions that happened did take place and both Tiffany and Aries can fuck off. Tiffany may had been willing to do anything to be where she is now and did do anything to get ahead but this is disgusting.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,What the fuck? I thought this was fake but that still is wild.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Just sick of people making excuses for DARK TWISTED SHIT.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"What is it with comedians and paedophilia.  It's not funny, it cant be funny, it can never be funny."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Who could ever have guessed the person who condoned Will Smith's dumbass smack would be garbage in other aspects of her life and career? Shocker.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I don’t even know who you are…
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Goodbye to her FloJo role! Smh
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I hope they get what they fucken deserve asap !!!
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Evil.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,What the fucking hell??????
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,this is truly horrific
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Those poor kids.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Shouldn’t have said that shit about Lizzo Aries.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Damn,I was just about to finish Afterparty. Gonna ne a weird watch."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Well that all seems horrific
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"You know who I don't want to hear delivering a lecture about the dangers of child predation and creepy men ever again? Tiffany Haddish. She needs to shut her fat ugly mouth and pray silently that $15,000 is all she has to part with before this thing is over."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Anyone watch Tuca and Bertie? Whole arc of Season 1 hinges on Haddish's character supporting a victim of child sexual abuse. 

Fuck."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"In a way they are blatantly mocking the real mother in the skit as well. Even the way they found children for the skit was predatory.

They are telling us right to our faces who they are."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I have a puerile sense of humor.

And even I found the parts of those sketches online sickening.

End of their careers----and it is their own damn faults."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I haven’t read through all the comments, but is anyone else questioning the fact that she hosts Kids Say the Darndest Things?  I know Hollywood accepts and promotes child abuse, but c’mon now, enough of a public outcry should have some sort of effect, they need to be stopped my heart breaks for these poor kids, as a mother myself this is my biggest fear and these celebrities think they can just gaslight us into thinking/believing what we just saw isn’t what we just saw, I don’t understand how they are not already in jail for this."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Celebrities accused of child sexual abuse? Color me shocked
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,“This is what fame looks like”-Tiffany Haddish
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I have no idea what goes in peoples heads when I read about this type shit…I first think OMG..the poor children.
Not what the F is wrong with the perpetrator.
Straight like that."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"How was this sketch supposed to be funny? Sounds weird, awkward, and creepy. Who told them pedophiles were good comedy fodder?"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I fucking knew something was up with her.  Spears is obviously a gross creep but I just had this feeling about Haddish that she is a bad person.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,The mom should also be charged with child endangerment
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I never liked Tiffany! Never understood why people thought she was funny or even good.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Probably the most annoying fucking actress alive.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"LOCK HER ASS UP 
I never liked this bitch couldn’t put my finger on why though."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Tiffany Haddish fucking sucks. She has never been funny in anything and it amazes me that she is even famous. She’s fucking awful and I hope this puts her away from the public forever.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,[deleted]
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Oh SHIT. Like for real, holy *shit.*"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I think the mother should be investigated too, if Haddish or Spears are found guilty. The reason is that she contacted Spears ahead of time, asking for $15,000 to prevent a lawsuit or to stop her from contacting the press, which to me feels like she’s in on it more than she lets on."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,[Is this what success looks like?](https://youtube.com/shorts/JBDemHIfay0?feature=share)
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Hated her voice in Solar Opposite. Good riddance.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Kids say the darnedest things
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,I'll be waiting for all of Tiffany Haddish's projects to be canceled. Lol. Just kidding. They won't be.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"The Aries Spears stuff is just gross, I don’t understand how any of this (haddish’s skit or Spear’s skit) could be funny to them. They absolutely crossed the line rubbing oil on the kid practically nude, wtf. He’s literally a pedophile."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,who?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Welp. Both of their careers are basically over.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Lizzo’s laughing real hard
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,This is a case of comedy going too far. They thought it would be funny but in the and just got themselves into big trouble. Comedians need to understand that not everything is okay to joke about.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Lock them both up
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"So she disnt find out until years later and another article wS published? She didnt find out why her kid was balling, the kids never said anything? Not excusing, jusy curious if i missed details and someone can help me out"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Didn’t Haddish hang out with Will and Jada a lot? Hmmm....
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Temporary cancelation. I guarantee it.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Highly inappropriate but not sexual assault
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"I read the article. I haven't seen any video so I don't know for sure, but this seems like a money grab to me.  

Having a stupid/offensive comedy idea with children that goes way to far is one thing (and terrible), but for it to be illegal or something to sue over, their has to be a ""sexual gratification"" angle. I didn't read anything that suggested that."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Ooof, that statement from her lawyer at the end..."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Radish approved of the Will Smith slap iirc, trash"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"Why is it impossible for celebs to be a normal good human beings? You think all this money,fame and hundreds of celebs getting cancelled would put some fear or morality in them."
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,"""As Jane put it, “I don’t date guys. I don’t have sex. I’m not your regular 22-year-old who is partying, having fun and hooking up and stuff.” Her little brother, meanwhile, allegedly places Band-Aids over the cameras on all of his electronics due to an ongoing fear of being watched and recorded.""

I hope Haddish and Spears get life in prison for what they've done. Absolutely appalling"
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,They make certain people famous on purpose so if they mess up boom remember when you did they shit?
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,Can someone give me a tldr for this? I don’t think I have the fortitude right now to read through the full details of this account
DC Super Hero Girls,Why is Beast Boy eating a burger *or* a burrito?
DC Super Hero Girls,oh cool! i never watched Teen Titans Go! until about 6 months ago but now i love it!  it's hilarious and i can't wait until this crossover movie(?)/episode!
DC Super Hero Girls,[deleted]
DC Super Hero Girls,"yeah, i was wondering about Beast Boy only being a vegetarian in that scene in this trailer, but it being a veggie burger makes sense!"
DC Super Hero Girls,My niece loves this brand. Had no idea it was getting a show.
DC Super Hero Girls,Who's the girl on the left? 
DC Super Hero Girls,U don't know why i find Wonder Woman with earnings so funny. Still the designs look nice.
DC Super Hero Girls,Jessica Cruz? They going to mention Power Ring? That’d be neat. 
DC Super Hero Girls,Wonder Woman's earrings are ugly as fuck.
DC Super Hero Girls,Female superheroes?
DC Super Hero Girls,"I think it already had a show? But Lauren Faust is seemingly rebooting it, which to me sounds promising even though I won’t ever watch it "
DC Super Hero Girls,Zatanna
DC Super Hero Girls,Twilight Sparkle.
DC Super Hero Girls,It defies logic. She's bulletproof...but somehow manages to get her ears pierced.
DC Super Hero Girls,Super Hero Girls
DC Super Hero Girls,Its for kids so Super Hero Girls is more appealing to the demographic. 
DC Super Hero Girls,She had the biggest make over
DC Super Hero Girls,"She’s not, right? Multiple amazonians got shot in the movie & there’s a reason she uses bulletproof bracelets?"
DC Super Hero Girls,Clip ons
DC Super Hero Girls,"Also, the worst.

She used to look like a magician. Now she looks like a teenage goth girl."
DC Super Hero Girls,"Considering the options range from Vegas showgirl, to lace onesy, to 70’s disco tech, she’s doing pretty well."
DC Super Hero Girls,Neat!
DC Super Hero Girls,Any idea what art style they will use?
DC Super Hero Girls,Any new news on Young justice? 
DC Super Hero Girls,I thought this was going on Boomerang. 
DC Super Hero Girls,Awesome! My 4 year old daughter loves these. It'd be great to get it more serialized.
DC Super Hero Girls,"Christ in a carousel, remember Teen Titans? That show taught some pretty good lessons to kids while also being a decent cartoon. This looks like it'll be a setup for advertising children a line of Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn toys"
DC Super Hero Girls,So I'm taking bets on how long this show gets canceled. It's Cartoon Network so they will dump it at a stupid timeslot where it will fail.
DC Super Hero Girls,Really?
DC Super Hero Girls,Probably something like https://youtu.be/VAOckoMitvA
DC Super Hero Girls,It's coming this year but will not be on Cartoon Network
DC Super Hero Girls,It comes out this year on whatever DC launches their service Titans will be on.
DC Super Hero Girls,"I'm confused as well, I thought this was already happening considering they had a direct to dvd movie already based on what I thought was a show that was already in progress. it wasn't at all horrible, but there was a glaring continuity error that just took me out of it. plus i understand the whole superhero high school thing, but Poison ivy and Harley Quinn is there too so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
DC Super Hero Girls,There's young justice if you haven't seen that. 
DC Super Hero Girls,"That's where the idea of this show and thr animated shorts came from, a toyline for girls. "
DC Super Hero Girls,"It's being made by Lauren Faust, who worked on Powerpuff Girls, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Wander Over Yonder, and also created Friendship is Magic.

So I wouldn't rule out this show yet."
DC Super Hero Girls,"Reddit thinks everything, including cartoons for little girls, should be made with a 18-30 male demographic in mind"
DC Super Hero Girls,"man that looks awful to me, not speaking to the quality of the animation but the style just seems so generic."
DC Super Hero Girls,"Plus, back when this exact same concept was called Super Best Friends Forever, it was delightful."
DC Super Hero Girls,Also pretty sure this initiative has been pretty successful for Dc already.They are aiming for it to be billion dollar franchise.
DC Super Hero Girls,Ok lauren faust is a plus
DC Super Hero Girls,The movie was horrible and had villains acting as heroes just because they're popular. And it's aimed at young girls solely so this isn't going to be any better than Justice League Action
DC Super Hero Girls,"If its like SBFF, I'll love it. "
DC Super Hero Girls,Love this.
DC Super Hero Girls,"This looks cute. Hope it finds an audience. It’s interesting that they made Supergirl so punk rock, considering her normal portrayal (And how she’s depicted on her CW show) is much more girl next door."
DC Super Hero Girls,"This is at least the third take on this in the last couple of years.  Just make the girl’s night episodes of Teen Titans Go! into a series, I don’t know why they are stumbling so badly on this."
DC Super Hero Girls,"Garbage in, garbage out."
DC Super Hero Girls,Aww I like it. Cute art style :3
DC Super Hero Girls,Literally the same script as the Super BFF short from DC Nation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ti0bJfWBfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ti0bJfWBfg)
DC Super Hero Girls,[deleted]
DC Super Hero Girls,"I remember when it premiered in theaters.

I believe everyone approved."
DC Super Hero Girls,dafuq you talking about?
DC Super Hero Girls,Can’t stand the new animation. I used to love watching the web series with my little nephews. It’s a wholesome superhero show tiny kids can watch... But this new style is just awful. 
DC Super Hero Girls,This is a bad idea
DC Super Hero Girls,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*
DC Super Hero Girls,[deleted]
DC Super Hero Girls,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
DC Super Hero Girls,so what would be a better idea to you?
DC Super Hero Girls,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
DC Super Hero Girls,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
DC Super Hero Girls,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
DC Super Hero Girls,more scooby doo
DC Super Hero Girls,[deleted]
DC Super Hero Girls,was that supposed to be funny?
DC Super Hero Girls,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
DC Super Hero Girls,this entire post is a joke no?
DC Super Hero Girls,[deleted]
DC Super Hero Girls,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
DC Super Hero Girls,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
DC Super Hero Girls,Now that adult animation is more common at some point putting adult in the description it’s going to sound like porn.
DC Super Hero Girls,Woulda be kinda cool if they just gave YJ more budget instead so they don’t have to do 50% of the episode in stills but ok
DC Super Hero Girls,All the sex and cursing that the 50s intended.
DC Super Hero Girls,This is a monkey paw's situation if I've ever seen one.
DC Super Hero Girls,">Bendis

Nope."
DC Super Hero Girls,"...and *Bendis* is in charge of the project.

Yeah, this isn't good news."
DC Super Hero Girls,I hope we can get another interpretation of Kell-El. He’s a clone of Superman who’s immune to Kryptonite. He can even channel it into energy blasts. His attitude is basically Batman with powers
DC Super Hero Girls,DC needs to make a Lobo Christmas special animated version. Give it the Simon Bisley art style to it. How this has not been done already is beyond me.
DC Super Hero Girls,Reboot Wonder Twins and make them hot
DC Super Hero Girls,"Why an adult series? This is the team that gave us arm-fall-off boy and matter-eater lad. 

This should be an all ages show at the most."
DC Super Hero Girls,Legion yes. Bendis no.
DC Super Hero Girls,"For anybody who hasn't seen it, the [first Legion of Super-Heroes animated series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775372/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) is great. If you liked Batman: the Animate Series or the WB Superman animate series, you'd probably like this one too. Only 2 seasons, cut short before it could get it's footing, but still worth watching."
DC Super Hero Girls,"> Brian Michael Bendis

Get ready for every character to talk like a David Mamet play..."
DC Super Hero Girls,Thank God. Those child animators were just not up to snuff.
DC Super Hero Girls,So they won't be teenagers this time around?
DC Super Hero Girls,"I'd love it, but not animated."
DC Super Hero Girls,Is it porn it sounds like porn.
DC Super Hero Girls,Because who did not see this obvious shit storm coming
DC Super Hero Girls,"Bendis writing this basically means nothing but bad things for the show. Maybe tv viewers don't know about his reputation and hence upvoting this news, but comic readers know his reputation well: he is legit an awful writer 

sure he wrote the great comics that were Ultimate spider-man and Daredevil, but those were years. Since then he hasn't done much anything good be it for Marvel or DC

he's actively taken comics that people like and make them HATE said comic/character, including his terrible recent take on the Legion"
DC Super Hero Girls,They should drop the “every member must have lad or lass in their name” thing.
DC Super Hero Girls,Finally some superhero content.
DC Super Hero Girls,">DC Comics Developing Legion of Super-Heroes **adult-animated**…

Why? It’s the fucking Legion of Super-Heroes. Why does it have to be “adult?”"
DC Super Hero Girls,"Adult animated series now basically means ""sexual innuendo filled gorefest that gets depressing in the last 5 minutes of each episode"" or ""super serious animated series with little to no positive elements"""
DC Super Hero Girls,Wow Bendis has a mediocre run on LoSH and then he goes and makes series about it. I give it a season before it gets cancelled.
DC Super Hero Girls,Do that mean we get to see more Conner Kent aka suberboy?
DC Super Hero Girls,"They’re going to CW Teen Drama it, aren’t they?"
DC Super Hero Girls,Most animation is done by adults. Except maybe those shows farmed out to third-world countries. But I’m sure those animators are at least 10 or 11 years old.
DC Super Hero Girls,Superhero bubble has got burst at some point ? Right?
DC Super Hero Girls,never heard of these guys. are their comics any good?
DC Super Hero Girls,Yes!  I wanna see Tenzil Kem (Matter-Eater Lad) and Mon-El!
DC Super Hero Girls,Superboy Prime???

Secret Unrequited Love,"I have my opinions about how off the rails they went after Change Your Mind (Even a slight reworking of Reunited to tie up some loose ends really would make a good finale) but the show at its peak really meant the world to me for awhile and a special room in my heart is reserved for SU at its best. 

Like I'm actually *not* a fan of how hindsight makes Pearl seem like a codependent mess here as opposed to someone who suffered a genuine loss that stings all the more because her feelings were unrequited, but as the latter it really is top notch. I was *heartbroken* for her when I first saw this, and Mr. Greg is still my favorite episode."
Secret Unrequited Love,"It's such a complex situation... Most shows couldn't do it well, if they dared even touch it... Most viewers probably haven't experienced anything like it. I certainly haven't. 

And along comes this kids cartoon that absolutely nails it with a 2.5 minute song and dance number. Wow. This episode gave me a whole new appreciation of Pearl. 

I almost decided not to watch the show at the last minute because it looked too childish. It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
Secret Unrequited Love,"That is my favourite episode. Live the entire show and future especially, but It's Over, Isn't It broke me. Outstanding song."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon, up to the Adventure Time Alzheimer’s allegory and Hey Arnold’s parental neglect in Helga’s therapy episode. This was the height of SU as a show, and was a major tearjerker in the context of the show."
Secret Unrequited Love,"My friend showed me this once, and having never seen the show, I had zero context for this song. And yet it still brought a tear to my eye. There was no way I was gonna pass on the show after that."
Secret Unrequited Love,That show as full of banger songs tbh.
Secret Unrequited Love,"What makes it worse is that she didn't really die, she's technically still there, just changed beyond recognition. This means Pearl has never been able to properly mourn or let go. Maybe she'd been hoping she'd come back some day, but every time she'd look at Steven all she could see was the crystal that used to be her friend."
Secret Unrequited Love,Wow. Never seen the show but this makes me want to watch. This is beautifully melancholy.
Secret Unrequited Love,It's my second favorite SU song. Pearl is so raw and real and open about how she feels. My heart hurt so bad for Greg and Steven but Pearl.... They had thousands of years together and then Rose was just gone and all that was left was little Steven. And despite all the pain Pearl was there for her son. Fricking love Pearl and Steven Universe.
Secret Unrequited Love,"“Now I have to be there for her son”

That line always hit hard. Even in normal humans, that situation would be tough. In Steven/Rose’s case, I can’t even imagine."
Secret Unrequited Love,I'm sad this era of animation is over thanks to HBO.
Secret Unrequited Love,I would like to point out that later episodes show that Pearl was literally Roses slave. So it’s a slave having feelings for her master and she’s so devoted to rose even after death and can’t get over it cause rose asked her to never stop feeling for her. I wouldn’t call any of this a good thing. I’m hindsight it makes this song seem really hollow.
Secret Unrequited Love,peak CN was dexters/cow/jhonny/pp girls/courage/eds not this
Secret Unrequited Love,"Steven Universe and it's sequel Steven Universe Future was quite possibly the most emotionally mature show in TV. Cartoon or live action included. It handled some incredibly deep issues so well that kis and their parents can both enjoy. 

The episodes of Steven Universe Future with the ""Steven Tag"" was heartbreaking from a parent's perspective and their kids growing up but was so good."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Wow, a lot wrong here.

First if all, it wasn't an unrequited love, they were together for thousands of years. Rose would love humans from time to time but eventually  she'd move on (or they'd die) and she'd be with Pearl again, as Pearl and Rose were effectively (barring an accident or murder) immortal.

Secondly, part of the uncertainty (""It's over isn't it? Isn't it? isn't it over?"") Comes from the uncertain status. Rose gave up her existence to create Steven, but is that absolutely the end? Might she return again, perhaps after Steven's life, if he proves mortal?

Died in childbirth and Pearl's love for Rose being unrequited, did you just watch like...that one episode?"
Secret Unrequited Love,Pink/Rose really messed Pearl up. Just so much damage and none of it hashed out before Steven was born. Poor soul.
Secret Unrequited Love,This show sucks.
Secret Unrequited Love,"Err... Pearl is a born slave with a toxic, almost pathetically dependent one-way relationship with a childish space Nazi. Steven Universe is a dark, inappropriate for children mess. The song is fine (some of them are good tbf), but Sugar's show is not okay in many ways. When Season 2 ended, it took an immediate nosedive. The series finale was the rotten cherry on top with the one-episode redemption arc of a genocidal villain.

Also... if fusion is meant to represent an... *intimate* bond between two or more Gems, what is going on between Steven and Connie (two underage kids) and Steven and Greg (father and son) when they fuse? ☠💀

EDIT: People downvoting en masse, but no one really seems to argue against my points mentioned here. Weird. :^)"
Secret Unrequited Love,I can't bring myself to watch Steven Universe after Steven implies that the Diamonds are family to him

I still haven't seen Steven Universe, so at the time I had no idea what it was from, or that it was even from anything, but the lyrics are so heartbreaking even without context."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Honestly the last moment I remember being impressed and moved by Steven Universe. I dropped it soon after this episode, it was just really starting to make me sad. It's plot had run it's course, the 10 minute long episode runtimes were killing it, and I just didn't think it was as good anymore. But there were some really amazing episodes, mostly focused on Pearl, Rose and Greg, that I'll always hold close to my heart."
Secret Unrequited Love,This episode fucked me up for a while- because it made me realize i was hanging onto a past relationship. Im happy to say i was able to move on and find new relationships. But i still think about that person everyday like the one that got away.
Secret Unrequited Love,"I swear I have some kind of misophonia variant. Musicals and such irrationally irritate me. I like music (particularly early 90s grunge), but when a song becomes part of the plot of something, I can't bear it."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Didn't like how From Here to Homeworld played out so fast, but the ending of the SU movie and Future left a satisfied taste in my mouth.

Wait, hang on...bit of phrasing there."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I remember my father, brother and I were having a conversation while I was trying to watch this episode. We all got quiet when this part came on. I was on the verge of tears, and then the conversation picked up like normal. The power of art."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Well, I think Pearl IS a codependent mess.  After all, she's a pearl, ""bred"" to be obedient to her diamond. Love came into play for Pearl, which just made kind of a mess of her head.  Part love, part obedient servant."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I have no context for anything you’ve just said, but your description of its effect upon you has left me wanting to give this series a try."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Future was fucking stupid in how in sets up a bunch of new plotlines that dont get resolved. 

Volleyball was a super important Pearl development and then she disappears. 

Bluebird was a random ass new threat that just disappears after vowing to kill Steven. 

PERIDOT AND LAPIS DON’T HAVE ANY DIALOGUE TOGETHER. Don’t know what the fuck Sugar was thinking"
Secret Unrequited Love,Help an ignorant and dumb man understand. What is this dynamic she’s singing about because I am way off with my guessing.
Secret Unrequited Love,"The big ""reveal"" with Steven at the end of the show in front of the diamonds legit makes me tear up every time I see it

The show gets a lot of flak, but it's really really solid"
Secret Unrequited Love,They also had to redraw the animation for Pearl because the voice actress put so much emotion into it. Epic acting move.
Secret Unrequited Love,"Steven Universe is a show just full of those.  One of my favorites, and that's coming from someone who was already grey of hair when he saw the first episode.

I do have to admit it took a while to grow on me, and for a long time it was just background noise I'd occasionally overhear around the younger folks. But then I caught little glimpses of the end of season 1 and got hooked."
Secret Unrequited Love,">Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon.

Then we get to ""Steven Universe: Future.""

That whole series fucked me up, man."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Oof, coming to realize later that Helga's mom was an alcoholic, her dad was a workaholic, and the favored child Olga was always on the bring of breaking because she felt so much pressure on her.

Helga woulda been the most relatable if she didn't have the creepy Arnold statue made of gum in the closet thing."
Secret Unrequited Love,Regular Show also did a good job with this. Mordecai spent the entire 8 seasons chasing Margaret before realizing it was just a silly crush and that they are better as friends than lovers and that he needed to move on.
Secret Unrequited Love,They did do that in a later episode when Steven was a baby and she tried taking his gem out. Shit got dark.
Secret Unrequited Love,"Season 1 is a bit wonky, a little too childish, but it gets going by season 2. Season 1 is instrumental for certain things to be meaningful later (most notably the Steven/Connie relationship, fusion and what the monsters they fight actually *are*, Greg's lack of wealth until this very episode, etc.). But you could start with a hand-selected list of episodes, a bigger fan will probably tell you it's *all* important but you can skip around season 1 and watch maybe 10 of its 52 episodes. Just watch in order by the time you get to season 1 finale."
Secret Unrequited Love,"The emotional intelligence of this ""kids show"" is staggering. Made me cry more than once."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I've heard one other song from this show and it was pretty damn good but I still can't separate the knowledge I have of the fandom from the show itself. Every time I think about watching the show I just get echoes of ""you're whitewashing this character that we decided is POC-coded because she's purrrrrrppppplllllleeeee"""
Secret Unrequited Love,*Discovery
Secret Unrequited Love,"You're correct. I loved SU at its peak but they really dropped the ball with the ending. You can't make the villains fascist mass-murderers and just redeem them at the end ""bEcAuse thEy'Re fAmiLy"". It's why I don't recommend the series to friends."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Regular Show, Adventure Time, Over the Garden Wall, etc. all received near-universal acclaim throughout their runs. It petered out a bit for me by the time OK KO came out (I really hate its animation style) but I watched these as a teenager and in college, give them a shot. CN Real was a dumb experiment and Adventure Time in particular revived the network in the public consciousness. I remember seeing the t-shirts throughout high school and not just by the nerdy kids.

HBO Max's desire to kill its staggering animation history makes it all the sadder that the last real CN show for kids *and* adults, Infinity Train, is only available on iTunes now and a persona non grata to David Zaslav due to residuals to animators."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Lol but it's fitting for SU....loads of double entendre in it.

But it's precisely the movie and Future I don't like....but then anything doubling down on the anti Rose agenda and leaving the Diamonds unshattered/unpunished would've left me fuming. Oh well, I am glad the other half of the fanbase enjoys."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Your people gave SU at least a few moments of their time?!

I can't get anyone in my circle to, but still I aspire to it one day. That sounds like a perfect moment."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Yeah I feel like people forget that the gems have some pretty stringent programming in the back of their minds that is shown to still be extremely present throughout characters we know.

“Do it for her” is still a massive demonstration of this she conveys all her feelings about obligation to rose and her willingness to disregard her own safety and to die to protect her and try’s to transfer all of that baggage onto Connie who she sees as the equivalent for Steven. 

And those things are conveyed much earlier than it’s over isn’t it.

Most of pearls arc throughout the show is learning to be her own person with her own needs, wants and desires instead of the ‘servant’ for rose(as was her original programming) and a ton of that requires her breaking out from that dependence on rose"
Secret Unrequited Love,"My issue I suppose is the show reinforcing anything done on Rose's part to make her feel that way, which makes it seem worse, more noticeable, and invalidating of the love she feels. Now We're Only Falling Apart should've been the final word on Rose's feelings on it, where she's depicted as being extremely uncomfortable with it and tries to shut it down at every turn. 

Yes any leaning into those feelings is suggestive of her ""purpose"" and how much she needs to move away from it, but I like the greater mix earlier parts of the show had where the love feels genuine and something you can root for, but not the subservience. Taking into account the show as a whole it's made it seem *all* subservience and I just think this song is less tragic that way, more ""pathetic,"" and I don't like it.

Do It For Her has been mentioned but it's brilliant because it can be read multiple ways. People who didn't literally serve a loved one in real life would still die for them if they needed to and we don't call that unhealthy, and by that point in the show you feel Rose would too if Pearl would allow it, and speaking for her is the problem rather than her dedication to her. This plays out with Steven aka Rose herself in a sense where he doesn't want to stop Connie from having his back, but wants to fight alongside her. 

This part of the show depicts Pearl's relationship with Rose as complicated, but coming from a place of real love and clarity. Those ""silly games"" with Greg mentioned shows real capacity for self-reflection so she knows deep down she has issues, but maybe casting the sum total of her feelings as the issue weakens the power of It's Over Isn't It. Just my two cents."
Secret Unrequited Love,"If you do end up enjoying it, remember to shoot me a message if you want, I'd really like to hear about it. :)"
Secret Unrequited Love,"Its a very long story.  Trying to keep it as short as I can, she was the right-hand to Rose Quartz and she developed feelings for her.  However, Rose Quartz eventually developed feelings for a human (Greg, Steven's father) and, in order for them to have a kid, Rose had to give up her 'gem' to her child, which means her death. Pearl (and the other crystal gems) also had to raise Steven afterwards as they had no idea what a Human/Gem hybrid could end up like.

Rose and Pearl were together a long time.  So the song is about her still trying to move on from Rose's passing, as well as her jealousy towards Greg."
Secret Unrequited Love,"She dedicated and changed her entire life for a woman she loved only to have her fall for someone else. But because she loved her so much, she dedicated herself to her love’s son after she died. Steven is a constant reminder that Rose is gone forever and a testament to what Pearl lost when Rose died."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I love Steven Universe: Future so much. It's so rare we ever get to see cartoon characters age (anything more than a one-off scene in the future is almost non existent), and it really allowed us to explore Steven's life from a new perspective. I feel like the main show was very heavily focused on the story of a child learning about the failings of his seemingly-perfect mother and having to right her wrongs, while Future really started letting Steven become his own person. The updates in character designs and behaviors were just the cherry on top"
Secret Unrequited Love,"Oh yeah, and what would you make the statue out of huh? Ramen?"
Secret Unrequited Love,Broken people becoming obsessed with someone they view as successful and can solve all of their problems is incredibly relatable.
Secret Unrequited Love,"I can't comment about any race related aspect of the show, but I rarely hear good things about the fandom.

They even bullied a fellow fan-artist into attempting suicide."
Secret Unrequited Love,This era ended even before AT&T even involved.
Secret Unrequited Love,I mean you gotta admit that is all very much in brand for who stevens character is.
Secret Unrequited Love,The end shows that the diamonds are all working hard to be better. They're not just magically forgiven now.
Secret Unrequited Love,"I mean, it’s also pretty easy to recommend the show up through the wedding with the caveat that everything after doesn’t handle the antagonists well 🤷‍♂️"
Secret Unrequited Love,While it may not have been as satisfying for you you have to admit that Steven forgiving and rehabilitating the diamonds is 100% on brand for him.
Secret Unrequited Love,"The show had just reached its half-way point when it was cancelled following the wedding episode, everything else was concessions Sugar was able to get from Cartoon Network to wrap up loose ends.  They had no choice but to wrap it up fast :(

As for the anti Rose agenda, something they never got the chance to explore was how Steven had been learning about his mom's life in reverse, from how she was right before he was born to the spoiled monster she was when she was very young.  She had a fantastic character arc, just told in reverse.  I think there would have been an episode about realizing and grappling with this.  His mom was a wonderful person deep down, she just had to break from her toxic childhood household to become that.

Im super happy to see that the show has touched so many people, even when they didnt super enjoy the post-cancel stuff"
Secret Unrequited Love,"Yeah, I think when you include the movie and Future the show ends up having pretty great pacing.  Starts slow, builds in bursts of  expanded lore mixed with periods of downtime, suddenly you are going through a resolution you didn't expect, but then there's time to grow into it and move on."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I just found it this year, is there any other shows you’d recommend?"
Secret Unrequited Love,"I can't get over that the show's premise hinges on the fact that essentially a woman committed suicide in order to have a baby so the love of her life could be a single father, rather than just not doing that so they could live together as a couple. 

Like... does it make more sense in the show?"
Secret Unrequited Love,"I'm not sure about ""developed feelings for her"" is right. Because one of the problems of the show is that Pearl was specifically designed to obey her superior. In this case, Pearl was always supposed to be kinda obssesed with RQ/PD. By default, she was always gonna be by Rose's side no matter what. I think this is why some fans were upset by the big reveal."
Secret Unrequited Love,"So she’s Snape 2.0?

I feel like I’m right but Steven Universe Stan’s can’t take the comparison, oh noooo it wasn’t a totally original idea"
Secret Unrequited Love,Oh shit I had it right. That is a pretty complicated character for 2010 cartoon.
Secret Unrequited Love,Snape vibes.
Secret Unrequited Love,"I think the ending was fitting, but the way it was done in the ""shippuden"" was not great, also the villain of the movie was kinda reviving a plot that was already finished, which seemed like a ""do it for money"" type of movie."
Secret Unrequited Love,"I'm not sure if there would've been that episode or not, but I did notice the reason Steven and so many fans who eat up anything vilifying Rose is because her story was told backwards. But Greg nailed it when he said at some point, I forget when exactly in the story, that who she was then doesn't matter, it's who she was when they met that counted. I feel like more characters, including Steven and including Sapphire when she and Ruby split apart, should've taken that to heart more quickly.

But I'm not judging by the show by what they should've done or perhaps would've done, it's just I hate where they leave us with Rose. Big swatches of the early emotional thrusts in the series mean less when that person is depicted as being as bad as they would later treat her. Your last bit is spot on though, for my gripes and for how imperfect I feel the show is as a whole, it does mean a lot to me."
Secret Unrequited Love,"She-Ra definitely (Reboot), and Infinity Train. :)"
Secret Unrequited Love,"I second Reboot She-Ra.

Also the Owl House and Gravity Falls.  All 3 of these has some similar emotionally heavy themes as Steven Universe,  especially Owl House. These are shoes that both adults and kids love and get different things out of. 

Also another surprisingly emotionally mature cartoon is Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel on YouTube. The are adults only due to themes and language but are surprisingly emotionally mature in ways that adult shows like Family Guy are not."
Secret Unrequited Love,"BoJack Horseman.  Adventure Time. 

And Yes! Love for Infinity Train!!"
Secret Unrequited Love,"It does with...later revelations.

>!Rose Quartz wasn't actually who she said she was. She was actually Pink Diamond and was tasked with colonizing the earth for Gem kind...by wiping out all organic life. She refused and created an alter ego (Rose) to lead a rebellion (the Crystal Gems) against...well, against herself. She was playing both sides. Eventually she faked her death by making it look like Rose killed Pink. She figured the other Diamonds wouldn't care, and she could now live in peace on earth as Rose Quartz!<

>!Bad news. The other Diamonds *did* care. They launched an attack on earth that drove 99% of the Crystal Gems mad, turning them into mindless monsters. Only Rose and a couple others survived. For thousands of years they've been fighting these monsters, their own fallen comrades, to protect earth. And ""Rose"" knows that she's responsible for all of it. Giving up her life to create someone new, someone who can live free on earth as she wanted to, but without the centuries of guilt and trauma, is her way of finally achieving peace!<

Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff for a kids show."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Rose's feelings for Greg are questionable. She doesn't ever really understand human love.  Her love for Greg at least on screen is more of a fascination, like an alien studying what humans are like. She is an alien after all. 

She falls in love with Earth and the human race's ability to grow and change, since gems are born for a single purpose and are not meant to change. A human being growing and changing is the greatest thing she had ever seen, and that's what she wanted to experience and give to Greg and Steven."
Secret Unrequited Love,Yea I mean. I think rose knew that her cause was best represented and achieved by a half human half gem who is raised surrounded by love. She believed he could do what she couldn’t.
Secret Unrequited Love,"Just saying, some women go through delicate pregnancies, so this situation is very real, idk why you would think it's nonsensical."
Secret Unrequited Love,Except Pearl tale care of steven after the death of Rose
Secret Unrequited Love,"She was also created to be a slave and given to Rose (a member of the monarchy) who started encouraging her to have her own thoughts and feelings and talking to her like a friend... but still very much treated Pearl like her sidekick and assumed Pearl would do what she said. Most prominently and horribly when she made Pearl participate in faking Rose's murder, and gave a magically compelling order for it to be kept secret which was still in effect thousands of years later, even after Rose's death - like, we eventually see Pearl trying to break the order and tell Steven what happened, and she's repeatedly forced to shut herself up. It's kind of disturbing.

Pearl's love for Rose was all mixed up with the servant role she was created to play, and as much as she missed and grieved Rose, I also don't think their relationship was healthy and equal, or that she really got to be her own independant person until after Rose died."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children, and convincing Steven she hates him."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Damn, that's some real heavy shit right there."
Secret Unrequited Love,Holy fuck that’s indeed a show worthy of the praise it gets then. I always thought it was one of those things the internet gets insanely attached to for no apparent reason but that summary changed my mind.
Secret Unrequited Love,The sucky thing is Steven ended up inheriting all those problems.
Secret Unrequited Love,"I've seen enough anime to know this is not the most traumatic thing shown to kids through animation by a long shot 

But that's an interesting plot"
Secret Unrequited Love,Didn't Snape do the same of Harry after Lily's death?
Secret Unrequited Love,Sweet Jebus.
Secret Unrequited Love,">Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children

Not intentionally, hard to argue her training of Connie didn't at least border on abuse"
Secret Unrequited Love,"""Dang Steven, when did you get so mature?""

""Right around the time I learned my mom was a war criminal."""
Secret Unrequited Love,To be fair its not a perfect show. Pacing is off and too many deux ex machinas. But the plot and world building is fascinating.
Secret Unrequited Love,"The show really throws out conventional storytelling structure for a kids fantasy show (the central mystery of the show revolves around a deceased character who we only ever learn about from the incomplete pov of other characters revealed and foreshadowed across five seasons, and that’s just one story thread) and I think it mostly but not entirely succeeds."
Secret Unrequited Love,One thing I really appreciate is they don't shy away from how awful Rose often was. But it's not like you find out she was secretly a villain or something. She's just a very complex sometimes very selfish person.
Secret Unrequited Love,Generational trauma is a bitch.
Secret Unrequited Love,"Taking care as in building a house,living with and raising Steven."
Secret Unrequited Love,"No, she actually becomes one of his primary caretakers, the episode this song is from is also all about her bonding over shared grief with Greg, Steven's father who rose ""left"" Pearl for"
Secret Unrequited Love,Isn't this literally dialogue from the show?
Secret Unrequited Love,"It definitely isn't a perfect show, but also to be fair CN didn't exactly make it easy for them to manage their pacing"
Secret Unrequited Love,"Rose isn’t awful, she was a messed up child who rebelled and ran away from her family as a teenager and grew up to be a loving but flawed and regretful adult. She just lived in a society with no concept of childhood or growing up. Actually, now that I think about it, Greg had a pretty similar relationship with his parents (overbearing, ran away, estranged), just without the cosmic consequences, but it makes it more obvious why they made sense together."
Secret Unrequited Love,"Yes, hence the quotes."

It's Christmas time in Sunnydale, so of course Angel, recently returned to Earth after spending centuries in a hell dimension is haunted by ghosts of his (sometimes Christmas) past. While we had seen some flashbacks of Angelus at that point in the show, this is the first time we see how evil and terrible he actually was. Combining that with a take on A Christmas Carol and a ton of stuff that becomes extremely important for the plots of both shows, the sometimes cheesy episode is one that I like to re-watch around this time of year."

Holiday Love,"Growing up: Arnold's Christmas from Hey Arnold, which I already replied to someone else about.

The last few years? ""Home for the Holidays"" and ""No Place Like Home for the Holidays"" from Roseanne (I actually am not super into the White Trash Christmas episode!) One of the episodes involves the characters trapped in three different locations because of a blizzard, and has some great awkwardness from Dan being stuck in the house with Nancy and her new girlfriend (Dan is uncomfortable around lesbians and also has never liked Nancy anyway); Jackie, Roseanne, and their mom and grandmother are stuck in the diner where mom reveals she doesn't believe in God and grandma swears she saw their dad grandpa a week earlier; Darlene is stuck at David's house because they're babysitting his sisters, his mom comes home and screams at him about stuff. When Darlene makes it home the next day she actually kisses Roseanne on the cheek (basically as an epiphany of ""my mom isn't abusive, I've been taking her for granted""), and Roseanne is like ""See, mom, I told ya there's a God!"" It's such a sweet ending.

The other episode is set during the lottery season but I love it anyway. It's mostly just jokes and I honestly get a little teary seeing this family who've struggled financially for so long finally get really nice Christmas presents, including getting to burn the mortgage document because they paid off the house finally. That season is obviously not the best, and the end of the episode sparks the ""Dan is sort of having an affair"" plot, but the rest of the episode is just funny and touching."

This from a freaking show that talks to kids like they're retards. That was a pretty big deal to me."

The episode really just reminds you that at the core of these people, they are just people. J'onn's arc in that episode is very touching and emotional, and I really love the Flash's dynamic with Ultra-Humanite. Even Hawkgirl, a character a lot of viewers don't like, gets some great and heartwarming character moments with John Stewart.

I also think it has some of the best jokes of the entire series, with J'onn's ""I'll grow into it"" and Superman trying to use his x-ray vision on gifts only to be foiled by lead wrapping paper."

Arnold is Mr. Hyunh's (the Vietnamese guy) neighbor who got him for Secret Santa, Mr. Hyunh basically doesn't want anything for Christmas but tells Arnold about giving his daughter during ""a war in \[his\] country"" to departing soldiers, the guy at the public records office will only help Arnold and Gerald find the daughter if they finish his Christmas shopping list ON CHRISTMAS EVE. The last item on the list is that season's hot item and they can't find it anywhere so the guy is like ""sucks to be you"", so they go home disappointed. Meanwhile Helga has been trying to pick out the perfect gift to give Arnold to show her love for him but strikes out, goes home. Her normally neglectful mother notices she's depressed and lets her open a present early, and wouldn't you know it's the same hot item of the season that was the last thing on that guy's list!

It's a great almost Gift of the Magi moment - Helga gives up the ONE thing she wanted that came from her parents who rarely even call her by the right name so it's ESPECIALLY special, to give to the records guy so he'll do the job to find the daughter for Arnold's gift. And she does it totally anonymously, which leads Arnold to basically believe in Christmas miracles.

10/10 Christmas episode"
Holiday Love,It’s perfect 🥲
Holiday Love,Seinfeld rules. I gave my sibling the pole one year
Holiday Love,I ❤️ Garfield's Grandma
Holiday Love,Just watched that again yesterday lol
Holiday Love,Yeah it all counts really I just thought of a lot of ones from when I was younger. The Doctor Who ones I was into my 20 and up for those 2. :)
Holiday Love,"I prefer Regional Christmas Music, personally."
Holiday Love,I haven't seen that one in a long while.
Holiday Love,"> slight gay subtext

As slight as Paul Lynde"
Holiday Love,">Nöel

I just watched this episode last night. So damn good. One of my top three favorite episodes of the whole series."
Holiday Love,"I love those too, I just watched the one I listed and he comes in with a giant red ball and is like ""It's Rudolph's nose."" LOL"
Holiday Love,"Obviously no censorship would be best, but if they have to take it out they should just cut the word entirely. It’s so silly when they dub in a new phrase."
Holiday Love,"This is my answer too. Nothing makes it feel more like Christmas than that episode for some reason. Poor Ricky.

""Do we have to talk about religion? It's Christmas..."""
Holiday Love,Looooove that show
Holiday Love,I was obsessed with this show! Yesss
Holiday Love,Ooooo i love that.. their smooth voices at the baptism & picking Geoffrey
Holiday Love,Oooo mickeys once upon a christmas!
Holiday Love,"That scene at the end with Buffy trying to stop Angel from killing himself is incredible.

""Am I a thing worth saving?! Am I a righteous man?!"""
Holiday Love,Good call that one is a great one.
Holiday Love,"I was actually was a bit let down by it when it first aired. I enjoyed it, but my expectations were high for the new Christmas episode and it was just a Glee homage. It's grown on me over the years, the songs are great and it is funny, but still much prefer Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas."
Holiday Love,"Oh, hard disagree. I still watch broadcast tv and it's so fucking awkward when they just cut out entire words."
Holiday Love,“A XMAS card from the Levetti’s?!?”
Holiday Love,Happy Days - 2x11 - Guess Who’s Coming to Christmas
Holiday Love,"The Ted Lasso Christmas episode 'Carol of the Bells' was fantastic. It's a favorite of TL fans.

Ironically it was a fill in episode, that was not part of the initial storyline of season 2. It was also released in August, which was a weird time frame to release a Christmas episode."
Holiday Love,"Woodland Critter Christmas from South Park is probably my favorite but here's a list of all my tagged episodes in a comment so it can be easily collapsed.

Holiday Love,Wonder Years - 2x3 - Christmas
Holiday Love,Only Fools and Horses Jolly Boys Outing.
Holiday Love,Was it Fonzie?
Holiday Love,Where's Futurama- A Tale of Two Santas? It's a gooden.
Holiday Love,Looks similar to my christmas playlist but you're missing Home Improvement.
Holiday Love,I bet that's a good one. I remember watching that show with my parents when I was a kid.
Holiday Love,"It was, but it was before they switched to a studio audience so it plays like a short film."
Holiday Love,Thanks for the heads up! I definitely have the episode but I'm a couple of years behind on tagging and I've probably replaced that season with higher quality episodes since then.
Holiday Love,"Someone mentioned that in another thread and I definitely agree, I need to get that show."
Holiday Love,"I used this wiki as a reference.  There might be a few more you'd like on there.  
  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Christmas_television_episodes"
Holiday Love,"Thank you! I usually get on IMDB and do a crtl+F for words related to the holiday like *Santa*, *turkey*, or *trick* and *treat*. I started with a Halloween playlist and I have a Thanksgiving one too."
Holiday Love,"I'm pretty sure there's wikis for those as well.  
   
When I get back home I'll PM you my list of Halloween and Thanksgiving episodes, they're not as large as the Christmas as I'm just starting them too."
Holiday Love,"The show was canceled for quite a while and brought back by Netflix for Season 4. The people involved had moved on and had different schedules. The writing suffered from distance, as did the acting, but they did the best they could with a cast that was on a limited schedule."
Holiday Love,"The original S4 cut feels very different from S1-3 but is a better viewing experience than the linear-restructure that is supposed to 'feel' closer to the original seasons. 

S5 is a disappointing epilogue, but not utterly without merit; it sort of just trudges toward an end."
Holiday Love,They had a hard time filming it as the cast was never together at the same time
Holiday Love,I love how painfully obvious it is that every scene with the mom is shot somewhere else in the newer eps.
Holiday Love,Did you watch the remixed episodes or the original episodes that are like 45 mins each? The original version is the one you want (it's buried in the trailers section afaik). Definitely different and not up to par with the original run but nowhere near as bad as the trash fire that is s5. I enjoyed the original s4 though and include it in my rewatches. The remixed version of s4 is terrible. It's all narration and quick cuts to try and make everything linear when the original version had specific character episodes that spanned over several months/years each. There's a lot cut out of the remix too.
Holiday Love,"i actually really enjoyed S4 - they shot it in a way that felt unique (i dug it, but i get why some dont)

S5 was the one that just flat out sucked."
Holiday Love,You’re watching the wrong version of season 4. A few years ago they replaced the original cut of season 4 with a disaster that filled with recaps and flashbacks. The original cut is available in the “Trailers and more” section and is FAR superior because it doesn’t have any of these recaps or flashbacks. It’s very different: each episode is told from one character’s perspective. But if you’re binging it it actually makes for a great season.
Holiday Love,[deleted]
Holiday Love,"I think it's a few years after, and they shot it with the actors in different locations"
Holiday Love,"Makes sense. People look super different and just way too many recaps. Crazy that they would do that with Netflix where I'm guessing all episodes dropped together, so you're going I just saw this and don't need a recap."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"As someone who absolutely loves the original movie, I have very mixed feelings about this after watching the trailer. The animation seems... not that good.  
  
And considering the original story was at its about freedom and sort of showed the ""taming"" of the wild west in a critical light, it seems a bit odd to me that this show seems to reduce the theme to ""city girl has to live in the country""."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Kill it with fire
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Here they go again ruining a classic with a sequel
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Yes but will it have Matt Damon?
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,It's actually pretty good imo
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Nothing will be able to reduce my enjoyment of the original movie or its soundtrack. 
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Unfortunately it will not. Nor Bryan Adams afaik.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I've also watched it in the meantime! It's not too bad, but the animations are incredibly clunky."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions…""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,🙂💕
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"That's acceptable. First go on a reboot 20 years after the original. It'll probably take a season to iron out the kinks, but I'm excited to see. "
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,WooHoo.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,This was a great read.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Delta state was the shit!
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,It was on both actually
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Bronys have really put a “stank” on the MLP brand.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Can only speak for myself of course but, I only knew about the show and the “brony” sphere from youtube videos, I didn’t even know what network the show was on and never saw any ads, even though I was still pretty frequently watching cartoon network, nick, disney, and a channel surfer when bored. I was 14F when it came out. 

I will also say that the shows you mentioned, while not my favs, are all very original ideas. My little pony is a show that was based on a thirty yr marketing scheme of toys and such."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"My daughter loved it. She watched all the episodes, all the movies including the ones where they become “human”… and I always thought it was a solid show. 

My wife came home and found me actually paying attention to the show and I was like, “honestly, it’s far better than most of the other kid’s content out there and this is legit entertaining in its own right”."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"The Bronys didn’t help, I can show off Adventure Time and Gravity Falls and Steven Universe shit and not feel weird, but if I were to wear anything Pony related I’d be concerned people would confuse me for a Brony.

But I think it was also just too cutthroat. They kicked Lauren Faust out early seemingly because she wanted to to be a show first and a toy commercial second. And then they did those godawful human version of all the ponies going to a high school movies that really screamed “none of this matter, all the rules will change whenever we think we can sell you more toys because of it.”"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I'm not saying furries and MLP are linked, but both are loved and hated in much the same way."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Jenny Nicholson released a superb deep dive [report](https://youtu.be/4fVOF2PiHnc) on FiM and the subculture impact on YouTube.

You might want to have a look."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"It is very difficult to assess the ""impact"" of any show without a concerted effort to either interview and collect data from fans (and in your question, non-fans). This usually requires some level of academic research and funding interesting, which MLP:FIM never really got to the level of say, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

However, we do see some cultural critics pointing to the idea that MLP:FIM, while driven by commercial interest (selling toys) targeted at girls was able to expand to a dual audience (men) through more hard fantasy and even hard sci-fi plot lines.

Contrast this to, say, The Powerpuff Girls which used similar ideas, but still had a primarily male audience, and did not achieve MLP:FIM's dual audience success.

The most obvious outcome of the success of MLP:FIM is DC Super Hero Girls which follows the MLP:FIM archetype, again, attempting for a dual audience.

But overall, MLP:FIM I would say is part of a trend (or maybe started the trend? Reinforced the trend?) of ""girls programming"" that treats its audience more seriously, more maturely and appeals to both boys and girls. Other examples of this are Miraculous (super hero theming) and even Barbie: Life in the Dream House (essentially a parody of Barbie which seems to inform the upcoming Barbie Movie.)

How much of this came from MLP:FIM and how much was just MLP:FIM being part of a trend? Hard to say. But if you look at the timeline, MLP:FIM preceded many of the other examples I cite here.

Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Never heard of it.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,The what now?
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"The biggest impact in my opinion was the absolute vilification of men enjoying children's targeted shows. The brony community became more famous than the show.  MLP only achieved popularity with girls aged 4-12...and men. Boys around that age hated the show and it just never achieved popularity with women. 

For the non animation community, it was jarring to see men express fawning interest of a young girls show on the local news. I remember being shocked to see the segment because it mentioned 4chan and at that time 4 chan was still kinda underground.

For the animation community, the brony subset were treated like pariahs because their fandom was out of control. Subset members were never able to completely shirk off the now public pedophilic association. Not to mention as the brony community became more mainstream, explicit MLP context exploded.  Look up 2010s YouTube as bronies were the butt of pedophilia jokes. It was that bad. 

The show's inability to gain dual gender viewership and the ever growing negative connotation of bronies publicly ruined whatever impact it could have had within the animation community.  I forgot to mention that MLP never could secure an overlap with another fandom to help its adult fans. You mentioned steven universe, adventure time,and gravity falls. All of those shows have overlapping fans. All of those shows appeal to multiple genders. The 2010s we're heavy in overlapping fandoms. Remember the Tumblr days of Superwholock? I can't name any shows that I would put in the same category of MLP due to its fan base."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Honestly I just don’t get the appeal. I’ve watched a few episodes. It’s mediocre. To me it’s identical to anything else that came out around then with young women as the targeted demographic. It’s a bright goofy show about toys, to get children to ask their parents for toys. I mean that’s okay, that’s what most kid shows are. I just don’t understand why this particular show sucked up so many adult men. It’s strange. And there’s something to it that we just haven’t quite cracked yet. A common assumption is they’re pedophiles, I don’t think that’s quite the case. Others say it appeals to people with autism, there’s evidence to back it up, but that seems more like correlation than causation. Ive also heard people say it’s a joke but I don’t believe people are spending thousands of dollars on conventions and plane tickets as a joke. I feel like there’s something else about it that made it take off so hard. Something that separated it from the Barbie shows or the bratz movies, despite the fact that they’re essentially identical. (From the perspective of a non fan) 

The impact is has made for me personally is that it is an enigma. It’s like if one day adults just started losing their shit for coco melon. It makes no sense to me, but I’m pretty fascinated by the whole situation. I don’t care that people are bronies but I personally don’t want to hang out with them. I like plenty of shows for kids. Adventure time, regular show, spongebob, drake and josh, Jake long, etc. and I know my friends watch them too. However, I’m not going to drake and josh con. I’m not buying over the garden wall jackets for 80 dollars from hot topic. I’m not going to wear a hat like finn’s to school everyday. It’s strange to make a children’s show your entire identity. No it’s not a crime, but it’s weird. I feel like the bronies know it’s weird, that’s part of why they do it. I’m not trying to be a jerk but most people will always see it as weird. Bronies made sure of that. 

Also my niece used to talk about it constantly and she says they ruined the show when they made the main character a unicorn."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,The cartoon was not watchable
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"MLP along with Adventure time essentially laid the groundwork for 2010s animation, MLP was without a doubt the biggest cartoon of its time from 2011-2015, but it did fade in popularity after that but retained a dedicated and active fanbase. 

Also the term cultural impact makes me roll my eyes after the Avatar discussions lately.

  
Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I'm a brony so my answered is a bit skewed but.
I think it really paved the way for kids shows enjoyed by adults. Yeah there where some before, but this one was in the unique position of coming out 2010s.
The early 2010s where weird, the internet was growing, internet culture was growing aswellm but also was it getting easier to watchs. The first 3 seasons of mlp you could find the episodes in full uploaded to YouTube, just there. It wasn't hard to find them. Before that you had to look at shady sites where you downloaded the show. Alot of people wouldn't do that."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"It ruined its own impact by being ruined forever once Lauren Faust left. And G5 is the worst show of all time and is humiliatingly grasping onto relevance by constantly making shitty references to G4, but nobody cares. I don’t see it lasting beyond Netflix’s original order. After that MLP cartoons are *dead*. It’d be remembered so fondly if they hadn’t fucked everything up!"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I mean the name itself implies that it's targeted for kids and girls at that. Soo the immediate impression is always going to be, dudes a creep."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Nah, few bad apples, but the stank came from insecure men calling bronies pedophiles, homosexual slurs and the like, maybe you don't remember well, but the way the average person treated a brony after say...2012 when bronies weren't everywhere is the kind of bigotry that gets people cancelled like nothing today, it was simply a more toxic time."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"A show which celebrates friendship, how overcoming differences/conflicts can deepen friendships, and how friendship and social support can help one get through stressful times. I’m definitely ok with my kids watching it."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Yea.  Had a daughter in the target demographic at the time it was on.  Watched a lot of kids content during that time and it stood out with having a decent story.  Been a long time now so can’t really say what was unique about it and have no desire to rewatch but it was a good show for what it was.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,I was 50+ when my daughter was deeeeep intonthe whole MLP world and thoroughly enjoyed the Equestria Girls movies.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"So...many...bodypillows...

It was an uncomfortable but still interesting watch."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I have to say, this is a very will thought out answer."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I heard about it and didn't really understand what a Brony was at the time, but I knew of Adventure Time and similar shows, thought it would fall into that category of cartoon based on reviews people were throwing out at the time. It took me about 2 episodes to realize it was literally just... A show about ponies for kids.

Also when the core audience is a split of children and adults on 4chan... Nothing good is gonna come of that."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"> Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences.

Unlike other kids shows at the time, MLP’s market was (after a bit of time) and adult demographic that was full of die-hard fans that could 1.) Afford merch, and 2.) Wanted every piece of merch they could get.

Just because something is prevalent in stores doesn’t mean it’s “culturally relevant.” By all means, most people had no interest in show simply because of the culture surrounding it.

I myself stand to think that the show is probably a good one and is probably (maybe?) Adventure Time-esque in quality, but I have literally 0 interest in watching it because of the stigma. I think that at the end of the day, this was the zeitgeist the show had (and even if people were unaware of Brony culture, they likely associated it as an overly cutesy show for little girls) and thus it wasn’t really in a position to gain ground."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"The show peaked in ratings during season 4, and had the biggest fan events during season 5, so clearly ditching Lauren didn't damage the brand that much"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Uh I think 90% of the stank and mistreatment probably came from the fact that the ponies (including young looking ponies) got sexualized by weird people and those perverts took up more and more space in the fandom until they scared off the rest of the normal fans and kids, so it became a self perpetuating problem"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"I love all the downvotes, indicator that people will resort to negative dismissal instead of just admitting that they were probably the asshole 10 years ago buying into misconceptions or misinformation and generalized a group of people based on nothing but a show they liked and what a few people who also liked that show did."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,a few bad apples spoils the whole batch.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"This is ultimately why I hate discussions around cultural impact, its nigh impossible to find an objective to the goalposts can constantly be moved.

Look at Avatar (Cameron), people say it has no cultural impact due to reasons such as, no memes, lack of internet activity and discussions regarding it, and lack of popular common merchandise

MLP: FIM comparatively has, millions upon millions of memes, tons of internet activity and discussions even now (albeit massively less than when the show was still airing and in it's peak) and tons of merchandise for all ages from toys to clothes to school supplies. 

A massive youtube scene both official and fan wise, with fanmade song ""Discord"" having 65 million views and tons others reaching to 10M and beyond, fan animations such as Snowdrop having 20 million views or Lullaby for a princess with 51 million views. On the official content ""Welcome to the show"" from the second Equestria Girls movie has 338 MILLION views for its oldest upload, with another upload having 138M views  
and of course tons of other official content reaches into 10s of millions of views even into the later seasons

Surges of conventions with the most prominent reaching double digit attendance a few times for such a specific niche show.

So where is the line of it having no real impact besides popular merch, popular on the internet, popular with fan content and official content, and being the talk of the internet for both good and bad for nearly a decade?"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Yes it did.
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"As someone who was actually in the Fandom
No, not really
Obviously there was a porn problem, but it was aboalutelt not a majority or even discussed in any of the sites or circles I used, maybe on 4chan it was

Seems more like people just grasped onto it as a reason to demean others

Look how much Pokémon or Animal Crossing porn there is...or actually don't. But it's there, and yet they are considered demented perverts"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"...is a fundamentally problematic saying when you're talking about individual human beings.

Calling people, Mainly teens and young adults slurs and telling them to off themselves isn't suddenly justified because you heard some of them were drawing porn or that you personally thought they were weird.

You as in general people, not you specifically"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"“Cultural impact” isn’t always positive. I don’t think that the show was ultimately viewed as anything more than a kinda awkward thing that only the fanbase wanted anything to do with.

I suppose it entered into the cultural Zeitgeist sure, but at the end of the day, it was a relatively niche thing tied to a weird corner of the internet that a lot of people wanted nothing to do with."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Adult male MLP fans literally all had autism. This is not me using autism as an insult, I unironically believe if they academically studied it they would struggle to find non-autistic adult male MLP fans.

MLP was an incredibly appealing world for autistic people, because the key theme was friendship and the messages near universally was “if you are nice to people, they will be your friend, and if they aren’t your friend after you are nice to them then something is wrong with them, not you”. This isn’t true, you can be nice and still be an incredibly annoying, or even repulsive person to be around, but autistic people have huge trouble understanding **why** people might not like them, so MLP was perfect escape fantasy in the same way Scott Pilgrim or Fight Club might be for other people.

The stink was because it was a community of almost exclusively autistic men, and pretty much identical to 4chan if 4chan decided being nice was better than being a meanie. Oh yeah and it literally started on 4chan."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"Maybe, but within the broader ""niche"" of western animation, it still is among the top, search trends while not infallible or even super reliable show MLP with a steep lead over the 2nd biggest of the 2010s, which was adventure time in the U.S. As for Worldwide it is much closer with MLP still in the lead and AT close behind (both of which far beyond the other options.

That extends to today where its avg interest is still higher than these other shows (AT, Steven Universe, Gravity falls, etc) all ended for years now"
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,"This is arguably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read, and is peak redditor (since we are generalizing here) thinking they have anything near the ability to diagnose MILLIONS of people based on a show that they had a shared interest in. You do realize that many many many people liked MLP not because and absolutely not solely because of the theme of friendship right? A lot of people liked it for the same reason adults to this day enjoy Disneys animated films, because they are lighthearted simple escapism in an enjoyable universe with engaging although no overly complex characters and stories.

It is really that simple, but instead of simple acceptance you reach into this insane idea that It attracts exclusively autistic adult audience for these reasons you made up, reasons that aren't even true which is the funniest part.

MLP even at the simplest point of its storytelling (the first season) never once said that as long as you are nice everyone will be your friend and ABSOLUTELY never went with the ""if they are not, it's with them, not you"" that is just made up drivel.  


I liked MLP for the same reason I enjoyed Gravity Falls, or Owl House, or Steven Universe for a time, because I thought it was a well made animated show, and I love the medium of animation."
Spirit Riding Free: Pony Tales,Are you autistic?
