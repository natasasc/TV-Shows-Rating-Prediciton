TV Show,Comment
Henning Mankells Wallander,"I think the *original* version (the Swedish one) of Wallander is overall much better, despite liking Kenneth Branagh over Krister Henriksson.

Spiral is something I haven't seen, and I'm a little hesitant to start playing catch-up with 40 episodes."
Hinterland,"I loved it. I love that area in Wales. The episodes are longer than usual for TV, so by the time it wraps up at the end, it’s difficult to remember all the pieces. And all of the details add up to the finale. I loved it. Wish there were more.

A similar series is the two season BBC production of Case Histories based on Kate Atkinson’s Jackson Brodie detective series. Find on streaming services. Set in Scotland, but just as good."
Hinterland,"I loved it!  (Still do...)  

I can be a bit dark which kind of goes with the landscape but it's amazingly good.  A fascinating piece of trivia is that they filmed the episodes twice:  Once in English and once in Welsh.  

Another series I loved is ""Shetland"" which is a police procedural (but much more) on the island of Shetland.  Features the fabulous Douglas Henshall and a great cast with amazing scenery and good storytelling."
Hinterland,"I really enjoyed it.  Foreign crime shows like that always get me.

Some of them you can tell are just the localized version of network schlock I'd never watch here, but they remain interesting to me because they show the color and culture of some distant place."
Hinterland,"Really good at a slow burn, developing characters over a long run.  Certain things that happen in Season 1 matter in Season 3."
Hinterland,"Loved it. VERY dark, but beautifully acted."
Hinterland,In the genre of 'crime shows in the isolated UK countryside' I preferred Shetland.
Hinterland,Loved it.
Hinterland,I thought it was really good. I loved all the scenery.
Hinterland,"Yes, very good show."
Hinterland,I loved it. Great setting. Think I read somewhere they did it in both English and Welsh scene for scene
Hinterland,I only made it through about half of season 1 since there so many far superior European crime shows to watch.
Hinterland,My wife is watching this show right now. Boring is not a strong enough word IMO.
Hinterland,Just be sure to watch the Welsh version.
Hinterland,"The Welsh version isn't on Netflix AFAIK (although the English one is, or was last time I checked) which is a shame 'cause I wanted to check it out."
Hinterland,I watched two episodes of it. It was boring as hell.
Hinterland,"I watched the first 2 seasons on PBS, then they stopped....like many series. But I was just able to find the 3rd season online for free, & have watched the first ep. I like it, but I like Richard Harrington. And well the scenery is to die for."
Hinterland,Got any examples? I've watched so many that I'm on the hunt for something I haven't seen.
Hinterland,"The Polish version is too, oddly. A Welsh show filmed back to back in Welsh alongside the English version, yet Netflix in Wales has no Welsh version."
Hinterland,"My favorite of all time is Wire In The Blood but if you want something in HD then Trapped, The Valhalla Murders, and Case are good.  I assume you have already seen Happy Valley the great English show."
Hinterland,The Wire
Hinterland,"A bit untraditional compared to the ones mentioned here but

Veronica Mars, especially season 1."
Hinterland,The Killing
Hinterland,Maybe check out Fargo if you haven’t already. Great show. Especially seasons 1 and 2
Hinterland,The Fall
Hinterland,I feel like half of the UK's TV output is dedicated to creating crime shows set in small seaside towns.
Hinterland,Bosch
Hinterland,Columbo will always be my go to.  Peter Falk is just great in the role and makes it a fun watch.
Hinterland,Psych.
Hinterland,"The Killing.
Bosch."
Hinterland,Bored to Death.
Hinterland,True Detective S1 still cant be topped imo
Hinterland,"The Missing

Hinterland,Monk
Hinterland,I really enjoyed HBO's Perry Mason.
Hinterland,Foyle's War
Hinterland,Luther
Hinterland,The Rockford Files
Hinterland,Justified
Hinterland,Bosch on Amazon Prime Video. It's based on a series of novels by Michael Connelly about a crusading LAPD homicide detective. He also writes the Lincoln Lawyer series of books which have been adapted as a Netflix series.
Hinterland,"[Line of Duty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2303687/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) \- This is a British tv show where in every season they deal with one case. It follows a team who police the police (so like the American Internal Affairs) and honestly every 1st episode of the season has grabbed me in a stranglehold to find out how the story will end. There's an overall story which stretches throughout the seasons as well. I liked this show way more than I had expected beforehand when I gave it a shot. Really top tier.

[Bosch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502248/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) \- It has already been mentioned multiple times here. So here's a +1. I think the endings of some of the storylines don't really end as great as they start. But like *Line of Duty*, I believe you will want to find out where each season takes you.

[Beyond Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13634872/?ref_=rt_li_tt) \-  This is a Korean show. An upcoming police officer moves to a small town to try and catch a serial killer, he does this with the help of a police officer who has his own dark secrets..... This series shows flashbacks to really mess with what you think is happening. I thought it was pretty good. Very much a binge worthy show as you just want to keep watching to see wtf is going on.

I think you would probably like some of the older tv shows like [Millennium](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115270/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (a show made by the creator of X-Files and deals more with kults and crazies) and [Cold Case](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) or [Without a Trace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321021/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_1) which both deal with missing persons or old murders they try to solve. These 3 shows are more procedural than the ones above, and the 'hot damn' quality isn't as high, but they definitely fall in what you're looking for."
Hinterland,"This list changes a lot for me, but I love the Brits for this.

***Sherlock Holmes*** (1984-1994). Granada. John Hawkesworth *(Upstairs Downstairs, Duchess of Duke Street, Danger UXB)* as its showrunner. Starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and David Burke and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. Best straight-up most faithful adaptations of ACD, even with the weird departures in the fina 90-minute episodes.  Down to the point of them recreating Paget illustrations off the page. Next best thing to reading the stories.

Other '80s literary BBC adaptation detective shows are a bit numerous to mention, but I'll add *Poirot, Lord Peter Wimsey* (though I prefer the '80s series (Edward Petherbridge) to the '70s series (Ian Carmichael)), *Brat Farrar, The Racing Game* (so good Dick Francis decided to write more Sid Halley novels), *Inspector Morse,* and *Rumpole of the Bailey.* More modern proponents of this type of mystery would include *Magpie Murders, \[C.B.\] Strike,* and *Case Histories.*  

[***River***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrGdo8PDgzY) (2015). BBC. Abi Morgan *(The Hour, The Split)* written. Stars Stellan Skarsgard as a detective who sees ""manifests"" of the victims of the crimes he's investigating (it's not a fantasy/ghost thing, it's a mental health thing). 

***Happy Valley*** (2014-2023, 3 seasons). Sally Wainwright brings another funny, wry, tough Northern heroine to the screen in a really taut extraordinary detective series. Many of us who saw this first think of *Mare of Easttown* as a pale wannabe imitation.  I love all of Wainwright's writing, but this show is more concentrated than, say, *Scott & Bailey.* 

***Bron|Broen***  (2011, 4 seasons) (""The Bridge""). Hans Rosenfeldt.  A cross-border murder where the body is found placed exactly on the border in the middle of the bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen teams up a veteran detective (Kim Bodnia) with an Aspbergery quirk-filled detective (Sophia Helin).  It's been remade something like six times. *The Tunnel* (UK/France) and *The Bridge* (US/Mexico, an FX series) are both decent, but not nearly as good as the OG show, even though they only remake the first season and go their own way after that.

***The Missing/Baptiste*** (2 seasons each, 2014-2021) Harry and Jack Williams. Border-crossing/non-linear narrative detective thrillers that basically were a UK response to Scandinoir series like *Bron|Broen.* 

***The Shadow Line*** (2011). Hugo Blick, the auteur who writes/directs/produces all his series. And even after *The English,* I still think this one's his best.  A murder of a crime boss being investigated both by the cops and the criminals. Lil' bit surreal, a whole lot violent, and very surprising."
Hinterland,"Homicide - at least early seasons - it fell off quite a bit after Melissa Leo and then Andre Braugher left.

Also will put in a good word for Barney Miller"
Hinterland,"midsomer murders, shetland, wisting, vera, pembrokeshire murders, dublin murders..."
Hinterland,The Night Of
Hinterland,Poirot with David Suchet.
Hinterland,Shetland and unforgotten
Hinterland,Twin Peaks
Hinterland,Murdoch Mysteries
Hinterland,"Cracker, with Robbie Coltrane."
Hinterland,"Only Murders in the Building. The tone is vastly different from what you've listed, so maybe not for you, but still a fun watch."
Hinterland,"Morse.

It was huge when it came out. I remember there was a really popular theory that the murderer could be discovered if you listened to the theme tune which sounded like Morse Code and spelt it out. Sadly, untrue. 

But it was a fantastic show, great acting."
Hinterland,Psych and Monk. Two lighthearted detective shows where the stakes aren't always super high. And the chemistry between all the actors in Psych is absolutely phenomenal.
Hinterland,"Elementary. Very enjoyable show to binge, and great shakeup of Watson by Lucy Liu."
Hinterland,Bron
Hinterland,The Bridge
Hinterland,Columbo
Hinterland,The Killing
Hinterland,"Top of the Lake, The Killing, The Fall. If you’re into documentaries about the same topics, these are some great ones: Paradise Lost, The Jinx, The Staircase, Going Clear, Murder on Middle Beach."
Hinterland,The Killing
Hinterland,I have a particular soft spot for Bones. I like the more sciency approach and the humor is just perfectly balanced with seriousness. Also the corpses are sometimes fucking gross. I had to stop watching it while eating and I don't consider myself to have a weak stomach.
Hinterland,"Babylon Berlin - 

I like this show almost as much if not even more than True Detective and Mindhunter. 
It has great suspense, action and main characters. The will-they/won't-they chemistry between the leads is amazing. Season 2's finale is like something out of Indiana Jones. If you like history + gritty detective drama then give this a watch."
Hinterland,Terriers
Hinterland,Psych is my favorite.  Numb3rs was good back in the day as well.
Hinterland,"Perry Mason, The Wire, Monk, Columbo, Murder She Wrote, True Detective season 1 and 3(I’ll give season 2 another try) Mare Of Easttown, Midsummer Murders, Sherlock, Mindhunter, Wallander, Young Wallander… I am missing a billion more from BBC, the English always have great detective shows.

Added- Wednesday"
Hinterland,"True Detective S1 was amazing and it might be my favorite thing I've ever watched on a screen.

That said, I can't stress enough how good Mare of Easttown was too. Kate Winslet deserved every award she won for that role. Some of the most real and immersive acting I've ever seen in my life. 

And what I really appreciated about it too was that >!even though the mystery was solved, everyone's lives were still in shambles at the end of it, which feels so different than the murder mystery shows of old.!<

* >!Erin's son will grow up without a mom or dad.!<
* >!Dylan is severely injured, possibly paralyzed from being shot in the back.!<
* >!Kenny, Billy, John, and Ryan are in prison/juvie, leaving Mare's friend Lorie alone and bitter.!<
* >!There's still an opioid epidemic destroying the members of the community like Freddie, Kevin, and Carrie !<

Hinterland,Only Murderers in the Building is actually a really good mystery show. Like surprisingly good.

Hinterland,A Touch of Frost
Hinterland,I loved The Killing!
Hinterland,"For a mysterious/occult twinge the French series Crimson Rivers. It is fantastic! Also good for character-driven mystery: The Missing/ Baptiste, The Wall, Three Pines, Baltic Crimes, Der Pass, Trapped, Black Spot, Deadwind, River, The Unforgotten, Hinterlands, Modus, Dark Winds, Witnesses, Remember, Valhalla Murders, Secret City, The Tunnel."
Hinterland,"Monk, it's one of my fav ""B shows"" of all time. It's very funny but has plenty of emotional moments and Tony Shahloub is just incredible in that role."
Hinterland,"CB Strike, Cracker, Morse, Unforgotten, Happy Valley, Luther, Marcella."
Hinterland,Monk and Psych
Hinterland,"I’ll throw “The Alienist” and “Miss Scarlet and the Duke” out there for you. Both are well written and very engaging, but “Miss Scarlet” may be harder to find. I know it’s on PBS Passport and Britbox, but it’s worth your time if you can find it!"
Hinterland,"Oh! You need to get into the French crime drama Engranges (Spiral)! Not for the faint hearted, is pretty dark and gritty. But is a great show (8? Seasons) and was cool to learn about a new criminal/judicial system. It's widely available with English subtitles - perhaps even dubbing - but the original French is awesome."
Hinterland,Monk.
Hinterland,Only murders in the building
Hinterland,Damages is more of a legal thriller but i feel like it's underrated.
Hinterland,The Missing. I think it was on STARZ. Two seasons were made. Season 1 was so good.
Hinterland,"The Mentalist, Lie To Me, Person of Interest…were a few of my favs along with the ones you’ve already mentioned."
Hinterland,Elementary and lucifer
Hinterland,Psych
Hinterland,[deleted]
Hinterland,Unbelievable
Hinterland,"Given that you've got Luther and Broadchurch on your list, I think you'd also like River (miniseries) and Happy Valley (series, with season 3 coming out soon)."
Hinterland,"Not exclusively a detective show, but Southland is one of the best depictions of day to day law enforcement you'll find on TV.  Really does a good job of showing the mundane and insane and everything in between."
Hinterland,"The Tunnel is pretty decent. Kind of stumbled across it and was surprised by its quality.

I figured I’d add The Tunnel to the list even if it’s not the best. I mean ppl are replying with Bosch and such."
Hinterland,Poirot from 1989. The whole show is a masterpiece.
Hinterland,Intelligence. Early 2000s Canadian crime show. As good as the wire honestly.
Hinterland,Happy Valley!
Hinterland,Nero Wolfe.  They recycled the same actors in different roles - like a dinner theater.
Hinterland,The Killing.  So good.
Hinterland,"There are some excellent translated series, like the Finnish “Borderland” and Swedish “Young Wallenberg.” I’m finding a lot of great translated series are available now."
Land Girls,"> Starring Retta, the story will follow big city Instafamous book reviewer takes a page from the murder mystery books she reviews and becomes an unlikely detective to uncover the shocking truths about an eccentric seaside town.

so its retta as a new murder she wrote? i can dig this."
Land Girls,Love Retta
Land Girls,"Hope there are decent writers because whoever write Good Girls, was terrible."
Land Girls,"Jenna Bans, probably one of the mods from r/TwoXChromosomes"
Land Girls,"Whenever I get too critical of streaming, I just have to look at what the networks are doing and it makes me take a step back."
Land Girls,"Wow, you got a lot of them already, but here's the one's I think you could also include:

*Freaks and Geeks* is Lindsay Weir's story of how she falls in with the bad crowd.

*The Legend of Korra* while not as strong as the original, yet, is still a good animated series with a female lead.

*Dollhouse* has a female lead although the you could right question how strong a character could be in that role considering the memory is wiped clean every episode.

*Dead Like Me* has a female lead. The show certainly has its ups and downs but overall pretty good.

I would argue the Major from *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* is the lead there, and an excellent character all around to boot.

*My So-Called Life* was the original Claire Danes TV show before *Homeland* came along."
Land Girls,Why wouldn't Homeland count? Carrie is the main character. 
Land Girls,[deleted]
Land Girls,Why'd you put Parks & Rec under dramady? It's a pretty straight comedy
Land Girls,"[Bomb Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1955311/reference) is Canadian btw, unless there's another one, in which case the Canuck show should be on there...

Also, add in [Being Erica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149608/reference) - love that show.

And [Hunted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069449/reference)

Both versions of La Femme Nikita, of course... (although the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118379/reference) was better than the [remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592154/reference) hehe..)

[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098898/reference) (UK) - all seasons/series.

[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/reference) - renewed for a second season yay.

(ps you dont really need to mark anything as Canada since like 50% of the shows listed are produced here and it's redundant.)"
Land Girls,"What about Bones? Booth is also a lead, but the show definitely revolves around her.

The Middle could also potentially fit. It generally focuses on Patricia Heaton's character as she deals with her family, though it's become more of an ensemble.

The New Adventures of Old Christine was definitely all about Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character, and should be added for sure."
Land Girls,"I think perhaps you might consider adding Little Mosque on the Prairie, it's a little goofball, and kind of skirts some of the more serious issues brought about by the meeting of Canadian culture and Islam, but does feature some strong women, and women of colour to boot.  My personal favourite character is Fatima, a local restaurant owner."
Land Girls,I think both Moesha and The Parkers would both qualify as well as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 
Land Girls,"""Veronica Mars"" is not a fantasy show. You might want to add ""Nancy Drew Mysteries"" though. Cheers. :-)"
Land Girls,"*Necessary Roughness*

I quit watching this season because it basically rebooted itself. Not groundbreaking. Along the lines of traditional USA shows, but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Definitely add *Murphy Brown*.

And while they're older than most shows listed: *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, *Rhoda*, *Maude*, *One Day at a Time*, *Cagney & Lacey*, *Police Woman*, *Wonder Woman*... I'd even argue *Bewitched* and *I Love Lucy*."
Land Girls,"Without a Trace (US Marshall/cop drama)  
~~Gilmore Girls (debated whether this fit your 'strong' criteria, decided relationship-oriented didn't necessarily mean weak).~~  

Edit: never mind, you were on it."
Land Girls,Hawthorne! Was on air for 4 seasons. Jada Pinkett-Smith is lead. 
Land Girls,No X-Files? 
Land Girls,"I would have thought Grey's Anatomy would count. It's named after the main character, Meredith Grey.

Borgen, Spiral, Lost in Austen, Land Girls, Sugar Rush, The Sarah Jane Adventures.... Daria? ;)"
Land Girls,"Separate the list to include science/speculative-fiction and fantasy as a separate category. Put Fringe, Torchwood, Terminator:SCC. Dollhouse, Star Trek Voyager, Buffy et al under that. "
Land Girls,[deleted]
Land Girls,"Both from Denmark -  Borgen and Forbrydelsen.  The Killing is based on Forbrydelsen. Borgen is a political drama.

Also Annika Bengzton, Crime Reporter.  On Netflix."
Land Girls,"I'm glad to see Covert Affairs here--that show is continually getting better and better. Season 3 was incredible. 

I'm also a big Necessary Roughness fan, although the show's new direction has taken some of the focus off of Dani, and doesn't spend much time on family life anymore, which I enjoyed because how many other shows revolve around a mother with older kids? "
Land Girls,"[McLeod's Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod's_Daughters) - this may or may not be to everyone's taste, but it's really good for what it is. The story is carried by a strong cast of female leads and is very heavily female-centric. I personally love it to bits."
Land Girls,"None of these have women of colour except maybe Drop Dead Diva (asian woman), but she isn't really a main character.

Pulling (UK) - A comedy revolving around the antics of 3 quickly aging but uncompromising women.  

Accidentally on Purpose - a middle aged woman gets pregnant on a one night stand (might be too focused on both the woman and the dude from the one night stand, but I think the woman is really the main character)

2 Broke Girls - The story of 2 financially lacking girls trying to make it in life.

Drop Dead Diva - A female model gets put into the body of a chubby female lawyer after death.

Hellcats - Cheerleaders dealing with university and athletic pressure.

Reba? Might focus too much on the whole cast rather than just Reba.  (Don't judge, it's a great and adorable show)

Pan Am? Also might focus too much on the men in the show, but I think the women are the main characters.

EDIT to add more shows and: This is a pretty comprehensive list you've got going - I'm definitely saving this thread."
Land Girls,"Maybe I'm wrong but I would definitely say Castle.

I guess Castle may be the lead, but Beckett is a close right?"
Land Girls,You can put Law & Order SVU on your list. Detective Benson is the main character now that Stabler has left the show.
Land Girls,"American Horror Story,
The Americans,
Bates Motel?

"
Land Girls,"What do you suggest if I like action/crime shows? I have already watched R&I and I don't like things that are too old or that can't be grabbed from the Internet.
"
Land Girls,"I'm rather late to this thread, but: [Hit & Miss](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70271757?locale=en-US&mqso=81198655&titleVideoId=70271757&awadgroupid=8344250348&awcampaignid=121071908&awcreative=34988547188&awdevice=c&awexpid=&awkeyword=%2Bhit%20%2Bmiss%20%2Bnetflix&awmatchtype=b&awnetwork=g&awposition=1t1&gclid=CMP-vaOv_LsCFXPNOgodf2IAqw) (UK). (Technically the character is a pre op transexual, but close enough)"
Land Girls,Nice list but now the question is : which are worth watching?
Land Girls,"""Strong"" female figures? Some of them, maybe, not all. Not by a long shot."
Land Girls,Hightown.
Land Girls,I take it you didn't see the end of *Dollhouse* if you question whether or not Elisa Dushku's character is strong even with the memory wipes.
Land Girls,"Some good ones, thanks! Added to the list."
Land Girls,"I wasn't sure - it seems like an ensemble show (Carrie and Brody). But now I'm remembering that the producers have said the show could go on even without Brody, so you're right. I'll add it to the list. Thanks!"
Land Girls,"Great suggestions! Hadn't heard of Devious Maids or Scott and Bailey, and forgot about Prime Suspect and Call the Midwife. Will add them and The Killing to the list. Probably won't add The Bridge since it appears to be an ensemble piece (both the male and female lead have equal billing), but still plan to check it out. "
Land Girls,"Just missed it when I was going back through the list. Thanks for the reminder, I'll correct."
Land Girls,"Good catch re: Bones and The New Adventures of Old Christine. Never watched the latter, but love Bones. She's a great character (Angela, too :).




Left The Middle off for now because it seems more of an ensemble."
Land Girls,"Added. Looks like an interesting show, is it available to watch on DVD or a streaming service?"
Land Girls,"Good additions, thanks!"
Land Girls,">but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Damn right. Her guest starring on Burn Notice was great as well."
Land Girls,"Added. Keep seeing Necessary Roughness and plan to check it out - though this season's promos of John Stamos have not filled me with confidence. Good to hear the first few seasons are good, though."
Land Girls,"Nice one! I like Jada, though I got bored after a few episodes...did it get better over time?"
Land Girls,"The show seems equally focused on Fox and Scully. Scully's a great character, though."
Land Girls,"Agreed. Greys main character, meredith, is complicated and interesting. And the good thing about greys is while Grey is the show's namesake, the rest of the female cast are arguably more interesting and funny and fun to watch. It seriously belongs on the list of good shows with strong female lead(s).

It's written by a woman of color, Shondra Rhimes who also writes Scandal. It's also very rewatchable, it has layers and connections that you can pick up on a 2nd or 3rd viewing. It's on Netflix, 172 eps, and it's good until the S8 finale."
Land Girls,Done. Also specified which shows have teen leads. 
Land Girls,Added. Is it sc-fi?
Land Girls,Are these shows in English?
Land Girls,"Just finished marathoning Covert Affairs from the beginning. Starts off a little generic, but gets really good! I'm definitely hooked now."
Land Girls,"Good suggestions, added. And I liked Reba, too. :)"
Land Girls,">women of colour

sup tumblr"
Land Girls,"Officially it revolves around Castle, so it doesn't qualify. Since most TV shows are still led by male characters, or by ensemble casts (if you don't believe me, just browse top TV shows on IMDb, or the shows nominated for Emmys, or the prime-time lineup for almost any network), I want to keep this list to the relatively smaller number of shows led by female characters."
Land Girls,"Good point - it started out as an ensemble show, but I think she evolved to be the main character."
Land Girls,I think all these are technically ensembles. Good shows! But not appropriate for the list.
Land Girls,"All pretty good (in my opinion): Alias, Nikita, The Closer, Major Crimes, The Commander (UK but available on Netflix), Scandal, The Good Wife, Damages"
Land Girls,Depends on what you like. What are your preferences?
Land Girls,"From the OP:

> It doesn't necessarily mean likable or physically strong, but they have to be *more than one-dimensional caricatures* (i.e. no I Dream of Jeannie's).

""Strong"" as in carrying the show, not as in a character trait."
Land Girls,"I think they've said it could go on without Carrie, too. But I would still consider her one of the two lead characters for now, which is enough to make the list, I think."
Land Girls,[deleted]
Land Girls,Another one is Rookie Blue. It's a Canadian show where Missy Peregrym plays a rookie cop that the show is centered around.
Land Girls,"Grey's Anatomy has tons of great female characters, I just forgot it technically revolved around Meredith. I'll add it. 




LOVE Scandal - that was one of the first I thought of when I started making the list."
Land Girls,"I was thinking Utopia as well.  It's not exactly sci-fi, but you can put it in that category.  It's also amazing btw lol..."
Land Girls,"They're not but the first two are definitely worth watching even if you don't like reading subtitles.

My suggestions would be The Blue Rose (NZ), Outrageous Fortune (NZ), Offspring (AUS), Spirited (AUS) and Lip Service (UK)."
Land Girls,I don't get it.  Is there a famous women of colour tumblr or something?
Land Girls,That makes more sense. I've always thought that science fiction writers tend to create more well-rounded female characters than other writers. Why do you think that is?
Land Girls,If they take Carrie out then they'd have to change the opening.
Land Girls,Added. Thanks! Been meaning to check some of these out on Netflix.
Land Girls,"Will definitely check out the Danish shows, thanks for the recommendation! And for the NZ and AUS shows, they're good additions to the list."
Land Girls,"I think it's because of the writer's theory-of-the-future, or progress more generally.

When thinking of how the future will be, they decide that women will have a larger role in society, more important roles in leadership, and to-but-it-bluntly *more complicated* lives.

I think this is gibberish myself as women already have more complicated lives than they are shown to live in most fiction. When a writer has a female character in a present day fiction that character needs to be complicated in order to be both interesting and realistic.

I think another reason is the mostly male producers either poorly relate to complicated female characters *or* the believe the *auduience they are selling to* will poorly relate."
Land Girls,I don't see that as a problem.
Land Girls,[deleted]
Land Girls,"If I had the time, I'd try to do the Bechdel test on all of those shows/movies. Thanks for your reply, I didn't think I'd get one from anybody!"
Land Girls,"After the Franchise Wars, all shows are produced by Greg Berlanti."
Land Girls,He is about to lose 90% of his 50 TV shows when they shitcan the CW Network…
Land Girls,He still has Netflix and HBOMax 🤷🏾‍♂️
Land Girls,"Or, maybe it’s utter shite"
Land Girls,I like A Pup Named Scooby Doo
Land Girls,"I watched it, it’s pretty bad tbh"
Land Girls,Calling people racist for disliking a horrible TV show is just as cringe as the meta jokes that were written for Velma. Everything is subjective when it comes to TV/film but there’s a reason it’s sitting at a 2/10.
Land Girls,"This review is hilarious. OP says ""Comedy is subjective"" multiple times then proceeds to tell people they're ""this or that"" for not finding it funny. Lmao. Wow."
Land Girls,"I just watched it. They utterly trashed the entire history of the characters. First of all, every single character has been given a total makeover that barely resembles anything that came before it. They did Fred completely dirty and turned him into a narcissistic psychopath a small wang. They made Shaggy not even Shaggy. I can get Velma is gay but DAPHNE? Where the hell did that come from?  I have never watched a show that totally crapped upon all the characters and actually feels like it HATES its target audience.  This wasn't made for Scooby Doo fans. It was made for self insertion and pandering. It's horrible."
Land Girls,"You put it on the same level as two shows with wildly different scores (8.5 is good/great, 5.8 is mediocre/bad).  Maybe it's just subjective and bad.  I haven't watched it yet because I don't currently have HBO Max, but your 6/10 is the most ringing endorsement I've seen for it.  It's not just racists who don't like it."
Land Girls,Scooby-doo is not even in this show lmao
Land Girls,"It's important to remember that two ideas that aren't in conflict with each other can be true at the same time. People can be negatively reviewing Velma sight unseen because they don't like the politics, AND Velma can also be a bad TV show."
Land Girls,"Or maybe, and hear me out here, people don't like the Scooby-Doo show without Scooby-Doo that turned Fred into a Trump parable and thinks complaining about society is the same thing as jokes"
Land Girls,Or it’s just bad and a bad idea
Land Girls,"I got 7 minutes into the first episode and couldn’t take anymore. The show is hot trash. You can’t even make the argument that humour is subjective, because the show just doesn’t even feel like it’s making an attempt at it, it feels like it’s just trying to edgy and controversial for views, and it is getting rightly destroyed for it."
Land Girls,So basically according to you there's no way for this show to be bad. What a take.
Land Girls,"This feels like a really long, “if you don’t like this then you’re racist” post. I haven’t watched it and probably won’t because currently watching Be Cool Scooby Doo has really soured me on Velma. Is it fair? No. Is it racist or misogynistic? Nope."
Land Girls,"I’m tired of people getting mad at bad shows getting bad reviews and blaming it on review bombing. It stinks, get over it."
Land Girls,"""If you don't like it you're a racist turd""

And that's where your opinion became irrelevant."
Land Girls,"The only people that have the right to be bothered by review bombing are the creators. If you follow audience scores, that’s on you. They’ve always been terrible and will continue to be. By making this post, you are the one giving the “review bombers” power. I have no stakes in this show whatsoever but this applies to everything, and it also goes for things that are rated highly because of fanboys. User scores can’t be trusted. The average user of any service is an idiot.

EDIT: I turned the first episode on after posting this and what the fuck. The first joke is cockroach sex?"
Land Girls,"Just addressing your edits in relation to the comments I've been reading in this thread: You are adding your own interpretation and meaning into comments that I just don't think are there. I'm mostly seeing responses that respectfully disagree with your post. 

I'm certainly not seeing many people that are so ""fragile that an animated minority teenager sends them into a frantic rage."" You seem more upset than the comments section."
Land Girls,The show is absolute garbage they need to be shown that making shows like this is 100% a money losing situation so they stop making them.
Land Girls,Could it entirely be possible that a scooby doo show that does not include scooby doo would be a terrible idea?
Land Girls,"It's the show that was already arguing like a drunk in a bar before it even launched right?

I can believe its terrible, its always been SCOOBY and the gang, without the dog the others are just some dudes and dudettes who ride around in a creepy van and trespass."
Land Girls,"Ugh I’m beyond tired of this “if you don’t like this thing then you’re a questionable person” narrative. It’s lazy, reductive, and reeks of brittle egos that can’t handle that someone doesn’t like a thing they like. 

Secondly, when you’re summarily proven wrong that, no, it’s not just racists or whatever who don’t like the show, you fall back to “this isn’t supposed to be the peak of art, wHy iS eVeRyOnE bEiNG so SeRiOuS?”

Why can’t we just accept that some shows are just bad?"
Land Girls,"I think shows like this are toxic. They try to promote themselves off outrage culture and thus throw insults out before the show is even made. They use minorities as a gimmick. They purposely create a heated online community in an attempt to get clicks, with no respect for the audience or if they are hurt by it

I fit the minority groups they are trying to appeal to, and I thought it looked bad from the trailer as well as the actual show.

In this case, they wrote, filmed, an animated a response to toxic racist man babies before the show was even announced. Clearly the intention is to stop you from judging the show based off very revealing trailers.

It's not review bombing to dislike a show. Reviewing bombing would be if one person gave it a thousand bad reviews, not if a thousand people dislike it. I find it a poor Imitation of what Harley Quinn does better and the showrunner hasn't been putting effort into her writing in a long time.

Plenty of reasons to dislike this show that uses a corporate brand name to boost an already dated satire. It's fine if you like it, but it's also fine for people to dislike it.

Edit: the ""review bombing"" is literally what they wanted. If you're a fan of the show, be happy it happened. I for one am bored of outrage culture shows"
Land Girls,"OP, get your schizo meds"
The Game,I just hope there’s a giraffe at some point
The Game,reading this as a Halo fan: :D :(
The Game,All I see is the Prince of Dorne babysitting the Lady of Bear Island
The Game,"The filming crews shut down parts of Edmonton and Calgary, as well as several other locations in Alberta on and off for a year and..well, went crazy with the ""sets"". 

Like major roads into the city, and in the central business districts, etc... 

Without knowing a darn thing about the game, I can tell you the audience is in for a treat."
The Game,"I really hope the ""Joel, we really are the last of us"" and than they proceed to be the last of them scene stays true to the game and hits just as hard 😢"
The Game,"> The heartbreaking first 15 minutes of the game are depicted here, and Pascal’s performance underscores the blooming heartache that would fester into a shriveled, diminished soul.

No question, I’m ready to be destroyed again. Except now I’m a married man with a 2 month old, so I imagine this will hit that much harder"
The Game,starting at 84 on Metacritic
The Game,Paywall removed: https://archive.is/wip/n2yfL
The Game,My girlfriend has no idea what’s coming. Gonna be great to watch the show knowing everything while also being able to get her genuine surprise reactions
The Game,"Gene’s a great writer and huge videogame fan. If he signs off on it, this show is going to be amazing. Possibly eclipsing the game, narrative wise.

I suspect the shows success will open the floodgates for good videogame television series. Where writers work with developers to be faithful and make a good adaption."
The Game,Already drinking more water so I don't dehydrate from tears.
The Game,Part of me is very excited for this show but another part of me is a pc gamer who has somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game and just learned that it’s finally coming to PC and now I just don’t know what to do!
The Game,Did people really doubt the creator of fucking Chernobyl?
The Game,"I know absolutely nothing about this game. Should I do some research to prepare myself for the show, or go in blind?"
The Game,My body is ready
The Game,[deleted]
The Game,"Halo and Witcher TV show, take some notes pls

Finally a good video game adaption, at least Cyberpunk and Arcane were too"
The Game,so best live action tv adaptation of video game? i know its not high bar.
The Game,"I'll shit my pants if it's 75% as good as the game, I'm so excited for my non-gamer friends to feel the things I have felt."
The Game,"Sorry for the obvious question, but when is this going to be released?"
The Game,"PC gamer. really wanted to watch the series, but don't want to ruin the experience. the tempation ooh,,temptation"
The Game,"I hope they have one whole episode showing Joel open millions of drawers, collecting little screws and pistol grips and rags."
The Game,"Oh look a a director & a company who knows how not to piss off a fan base.

*Cough* paramount plus *cough*"
The Game,I'm just interested to see how the story is going to work with spores being removed.
The Game,I'm so nervous about introducing my wife to this. She watched me play some of part 2 but has no idea what's coming in the pilot and >!we just had our first child a year ago and so of course watching things in which kids suffer/die is now very emotional!<.
The Game,I hate that HBO is literally the only studio you can trust to adapt stuff properly for series. Wtf is wrong with Hollywood these days?
The Game,I am nearly done with my replay of part 1 :) I am so ready for this show.
The Game,"I'm still not giving my hopes up, but I am really starting to believe this might be amazing.

Please, don't fuck it up."
The Game,"So turns out when making an adaptation for a video game you *dont* need to mindlessly change every single detail for no reason and it works? What!?!?

It’s almost as if the reason it’s getting adapted in the first place was because the original product was actually good. Go figure."
The Game,"And it looks like they’re also releasing this in 4K, just like HotD. Things looks promising so far."
The Game,"i am so happy about this, i also can’t *wait* to see ashley johnson 😭😭😭"
The Game,"Sooo fucking stoked to check this out. 

I adore the games. Best storytelling out of any video game medium in my opinion.

The fact that Druckmann has been closely part of this project gives me immense hope and these reviews are feeding the fire.

I honestly haven't seen any promo material for this besides a few images here and there and my first thoughts were skepticism over their casting decisions but I've learned to accept these choices.

Sunday can't come soon enough."
The Game,Couldn’t be in better hands. I’m pumped! TLOU 1 and 2 are my favorite games. I even named my daughter Ellie ;x
The Game,"Just found out that the first season will cover the entire first game. That is such welcome news. I was worried they’d try and stretch this out over a few seasons. Honestly really, really excited now."
The Game,"Hyped! 

Can’t wait to see my wife be devastated so I can call her a loser for crying at a video game adaptation like she laughed when I cried playing the game."
The Game,The haters are going to lose it
The Game,I'm really hopeful for this.
The Game,Is the show going to be super gory? My playthroughs certainly were. Curious to see how true to the game the they handle the showdown with Ellie & David.
The Game,Do we have any idea how much story season 1 will be covering? Is it the whole game?
The Game,"Mazin is a boss, always had faith in him"
The Game,The television writer for this is Craig Mazin. He cohosts an awesome podcast called ScriptNotes for anyone interested in writing for film and tv.
The Game,"My daughter was about 15 when I played the 1st game, and she loved sitting in on the story while I played. It’s just us, so the special bond of Joel and Ellie hit home for both of us.  Then she wanted to go to comic con and we decided to go together and cosplay it. 

I’m so excited to watch our first HBO together, old school style weekly episodes. And she’s excited that next time we cosplay them people will know us haha."
The Game,Sigh of relief anyone?
The Game,I've never played the game but like apocalyptic series. Should I watch this? And what differentiates it from something like The Walking Dead?
The Game,What!!!??  wasn't it supposed to come on the 15th?
The Game,"I feel like the first episode is definitely going to be as upsetting as the opening was, so Yay... I guess. My wife is going to cry again and probably bust my balls for having her watch that again lol"
The Game,"Finished the first game a couple of days ago and started part 2 yesterday. Show must be absolutely brutal, then."
The Game,BuT tHeY Don't LoOK tHe SaMe aS tHe ViDeO Game! Worst show ever........ /s
The Game,"Can’t freaking wait, finally playing through part 2 right now"
The Game,Fuck yeah
The Game,This many awards for a link to a review in the first hour? Nothing sus about that.
The Game,Doubt
The Game,This and then LOVM season 2 in the same month. I'm excited.
The Game,"Damn, I wish I hadn’t told my wife every plot detail as I was playing through."
The Game,"The other day I was watching people reactions to that intro of the game (the scene with the security guard  right before the title shows up). I must have watched it like 10 times in a row, cried everytime"
The Game,"as long as we have at least one big boi rip off someones skull from the jaw, I'll be happy."
The Game,Play the game first or watch this first…hmm
The Game,I really gotta play this game finally
The Game,I hate these [weirdos](https://twitter.com/bigbybadb/status/1612722416530202625).
The Game,"I haven't played the game but its going to come out on March 3rd on PC. So, should I play the game first or watch the TV show first?"
The Game,Do you think it will be worth a watch for someone who doesn’t care about video games? Trailer looks good.
The Game,"it was so funny to see people calling it ""woke fanction"" in the last few days after the Gamer reaction to TLOU2. cannot wait to see hilarious flamin hot takes after this releases. congrats to all the production and folks who worked hard to get it made - and also to rational fans!"
The Game,If it’s anything like the game.. we are all in for a very good series
The Game,"Hopefully it wont be too long until they confirm and start shooting Season 2.

Also, while they've said that they don't want to do stuff beyond what we've gotten with the games, I honestly wouldn't mine some mini-series for some of the side characters. Bill & Frank, Henry & Sam, Tommy & Maria, Marlene and even Ish are all characters I'd be more than happy to see further explored, even if it's only like 4 episodes of 30 minutes each."
The Game,"I haven't even played the games, only know the story, and am very excited for this.

On some level, you just want some good TV, and them staying true to the source is a great endorsement for that"
The Game,"Is this just the first game, or does it include the second?"
The Game,Can't wait for season 2 what a disaster DOA
The Game,"No it doesn't. They didn't even keep the whole spore thing... Forced race swapping and odd choice of casting.  How is it faithful if the 3 main characters shown at the start aren't even the same race for starters?

What a snooze fest this first episode was. I was barely engaged, unconvincing characters, acting and world. Pretty cheesy.

Let's hope it'll change my view."
The Game,Good. Now start working on season 2 so we won't have to wait 2.5 years.
The Game,Like the Witcher was going to stay true?
The Game,Me when I make a cinematic game into a cinematic show and nothing changes 🤯🤯🤯
The Game,Nerds are going to be eating good in 2023
The Game,"Stays true, but didn't they change the cordyceps virus to have ""tendrils"" instead of spores? You know, something fundamental to the world building and dangerousness of it that provides very specific moments of terror/stress the game and should/would have been perfect for the show?"
The Game,"Looking forward to it, seems a little overhyped, and I heard they removed the fungal angle, and apart from the acting that was a really big part of the first game, gave the monsters a uniqueness and roots in reality which made it way creepier.

Cautiously optimistic tho!"
The Game,Did a stuido finale figure out that maybe it's not a bad idea to stick close to the source material?
The Game,All the whining about casting from Reddit but the trailer looked great.
The Game,"Sure they are, all shows are great when reviewed by corporate shields, and then they come out."
The Game,I’ll be the judge of that
The Game,Reassuring. The game is a complete and utter masterpiece and I hope the show will do it justice.
The Game,Pfft I’ll believe it when I see it
The Game,I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOD
The Game,I’m so pumped for this!!!!
The Game,"bUT eLliE dOeSn‘T lOok LiKe ThE cHaRaCtEr In ThE gAmE….

hate these trolls…"
The Game,"The more journalists claim that, ""It remains true to the source material,"" the more I doubt it."
The Game,"This revier, Gene Park, gave a positive review to she hulk. Take that as you will"
The Game,"Stay true to game, literally first 10 mins Joel is mexican and his daughter is black"
The Game,"How many episodes did they get to review? First 3? Whole season? 

I read a review earlier that said the shows great, but didn't really get the point of it. Just made me think they must not have seen the whole thing."
The Game,Fucking paywall...
The Game,Seriously considering giving this a watch. Always sceptical of Video Game adaptions.
The Game,"Woah, an adaption of a franchise that *doesn't* butcher the source material?!?  

Are there really some good eggs in Hollywood after all?"
The Game,Stays true to the game…..uh didn’t they replace the fungus?
The Game,just like the game? so that means its a big as a lake but as shallow as a spoon? got it.
The Game,Is this releaed weekly or is it all available from the release?
The Game,I really want to read the review but that fucking login wall...
The Game,I’m going to cry so good
The Game,Hooray!
The Game,"This is the one, this is the GOT breaker"
The Game,Report | People So Desperate To Justify HBO Subscription Decide This One Checks Out
The Game,Doubt.
The Game,"I have a question but I don't feel like reading the review because it's 4 A.M and I don't feel well.  Does the opening scene make you cry like in the game, because I don't reust anyone that doesn't cry there?"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Ymmv, but TNG has a reputation for kicking into gear after s2. See [growing the beard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard)"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Yeah Season 1 of TNG is sort of infamously bad, with its half-assed efforts to mimic original series allegories, chewing through writing staffs. 

But TNG is pretty truly episodic. Watch the Q Borg episode from Season 2 (""Q Who""), then you could jump to Season 3 if you wanted. 3 is pretty good then 4-7 are as good as it gets."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Be patient, the best happens later. Season 1 is the worst, followed by season 2. The problem with these early seasons is that they were both finding their footing, but also transforming the concept from a 60's style show, to a modern style show. This means less ham fistedy-ness is on the way. The characters in those early years feel like the old guard had the reigns. And it really shows with their sometimes-dated concepts regarding women. But a lot of the cringe  stuff goes away. And the show itself will start to address fun sci fi concepts with a modern POV regarding most of them. It does get better. And there are some fun concepts in the early years that they touch, but they are also skippable. Im sure somebody out there has a list of necessary season 1 and 2 episodes that you need for ""Lore"" reasons, but other that, start at the fun points."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Season 1 - mostly awful. But lays the foundation of the show and characters. There are a few episodes others will suggest you watch and tell you to skip the rest. The pilot movie, and Lore are basically essential, just because we'll see those characters in seasons to come. I liked the two conspiracy episodes that were tied together, but nothing came of it after season 1. 

Season 2 - meh. A few noteworthy episodes in a season cut short by a writer's strike (The final episode is a clipshow ep, as a result). Introductions of The Borg and Moriarty are somewhat necessary, some other episodes are enjoyable. But still a lot of episodes are mediocre at best. 

Season 3 on - We hit full stride! Enjoy the series. Not to say there aren't some turkeys in seasons 3-7, but they are few and far between."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Haha theres actually a meme about how the show doesn't get good until Riker grows his beard
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"STNG's first season was ... disappointing.

But then we got to the 2^nd season and things started to get much better."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"It gets better

But in every Trek, the crew are some how genius astrophysicist moron idiots.

A secret part of the Starfleet charter is that security measures are prohibited.  You must allow your ship to be hijacked once every 5 episodes, minimum."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"It does, and it’s worth having season 1 in your memory because a lot of those bits come back. 

Also understand it was a different kind of storytelling they were doing. It’s not like today’s TV drama. It was much more in line with classic Trek, and kind of an improvement on TOS season 3."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Like others said, it greatly improves down the road.  Plus like all shows that churned out 20 to 26 episodes a season there are some clunkers even in the good seasons."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,You can't watch these shows like modern shows also. These are very long seasons.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"In season one they didn't know what they were doing and were ready to be be cancelled at any point.

In season two they had the confidence they were missing in season one. It made a huge difference. They also got rid of the man skirts."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Watch it all, if for no other reason than to say you did; but it gets way better."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Season 1 has a handful of great episodes but it's the hardest part of a TNG watch. It gets much better.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"growing up in this era we didn't have to deal with trudging through each episode. 

we just caught an episode whenever we happened to be watching TV and noticed one was on. Mostly reruns and we'd never pay attention to which season. Some episodes were weak and others memorable. 

You can really feel the difference between that vs. nowadays shows being made for the modern environment where procedurals are borderline extinct."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Red letter media goes over how bad season one truly is.

The show is episodic, try skipping to Elementary, Dear Data, season two ep three.  There is some bland junk ( some people like these eps a lot, maybe you will as well ) and then you hit S2, Ep8 Matter Of Honor and The Measure of a Man.  IMBD rated 8.0 and 9.1.

Season two ep twenty-two is a clip show, skip it.

After that it has highs and lows, but nothing as crap as season one."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Yes, it does. Much much better. Season one had growing pains. Keep us posted on how you liked later seasons."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,To the Battle Bridge!
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Trust me, it will get better. Season 1&2 are a necessary tedious task to enjoy the legendary seasons from 3 onward."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Let me be honest with you. But really, you need to be honest with yourself. If you're still watching this show after the ridiculous racist stinker ""Code of honor"", you're in love with these characters as much as the rest of us."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"You can skip ahead into S3 (imo this is really where things start to come together). TNG a classic episodic show that was meant to be re-aired in syndication out of order, so you can jump into the show at almost any point and not be missing out on much background context. (And then you can go back and watch the rest of season 1 and 2 later if you're curious)

There's been some documentaries made, but Season 1 had a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and was trying to emulate a lot of the original 60s show which didn't really work. Season 2 faced a writers' strike (and several unused scripts from the original show and unmade 70s show got used)..things really started to settle in Season 3"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"If it gets to be too much just skip to Season 3.  Season 2 has a couple good episodes as well, but isn’t consistent."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Just jump straight to Season 3.  Trust me, you won't regret it.  I'm amazed you even got through 60% of Season 1."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"If you are truly struggling, just skip to season 2. You won’t miss anything you can’t figure out through context. S3,4,5,6 are my personal favorites and worth getting to."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,It gets better but people talk the shows up way too much. It's like they haven't watched them recently. I was always sad growing up that the only sci fi stuff we got was corny. Star trek was right there in that category.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"no spoilers.. and no cheating. you need to watch your way to this one..

S5 finale

&#x200B;

In 2013, Slate ranked ""Time's Arrow"" one of the ten best episodes in the Star Trek franchise.\[3\]  
Writing for The Deseret News, television editor Scott D. Pierce found the first part of the story ""fresh and intriguing"".\[4\] Wired asked readers to select which episodes of the series were their favorites, and ""Time's Arrow"" was highlighted in their resultant article.\[5\]  
Variety listed ""Time's Arrow"" (Parts I & II) as one of the top 15 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 2017.\[6\]  
In 2016, the ""Time's Arrow"" two-part episode was ranked by SyFy Wire as the 9th best Star Trek franchise episode involving time travel.\[7\] 

  
In 2016, Empire ranked this the 32nd best out of the top 50 episodes of all the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes.\[9\]  
In 2018, CBR ranked this one of the top-twenty time travel themed episodes of all Star Trek series.\[10\]  
In 2020, SyFy Wire noted in this episode the relationship between Picard and Data, in particular showing that Picard is reluctant to risk what they call his ""robot bestie"".\[11\] They point out the episode begins with the shocking discovery of .>!..i said no spoilers!!<"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Yeah, I'd say it gets better.  I think like a lot of shows it was still finding its way in the first season.  The tone changes a bit and the actors get a bit better later on as they settle in to their roles.  Honestly though, its not really high-brow TV.  There are much better sci-fi shows out there, though it was arguably one of the best that had been made through that point in time."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"As you know by now, seasons 1 and 2 have a lot of problems. However, they do have a handful of great episodes so if you can't push on through and watch them all my recommendation would be to google a list of 'essential' episodes for season 1 and 2, watch those then when you get to season 3 watch everything up until the end of season 7. Yes, there are still a few stinkers, particularly in season 7, but it's still worth watching them all.

In short, don't stop watching just because you're finding season 1 rough but do seek out a list of which episodes to watch if you're feeling like giving up. TNG really is an excellent series ...... for the most part."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Everyone else covered it but yeah just stick with it. The general rule of Star Trek tv series pre-new-Trek (so TNG, DS9, Voy, and Ent) is that the first 3ish seasons are rough, the 1st especially so, then you have good shit."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I personally unironically love tng season 1. It's campy as hell and I love the wierd plots. However it is the worst season of TNG and all of the 80s-90s trek and hard to sit through on your first time but it does get better. Season 2 is a vast improvement and season 3 they get the formula Right. I'd recommend watching all of it but there's only a few that you have to watch as as been pointed out by others here so feel free to watch only those and come back to the rest later.

Edit: watching code of honour for the first time In decades I was this isn't so bad...wait a minute...what the actual hell...did I actually see that...oh my god"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Season 1 is truly dire. I'm a huge Trek fan but never re-watch any of the episodes from that season. Season 2 is slightly better with a couple of gems. Season 3 is when things really kick into high gear, which the show maintains until its final season when the wheels start to come off."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"TNG is epic, peak trek but like many others say - really finds its footing in season 2.

If you end up liking it I HIGHLY recommend jumping into DS9 after. 

For me TNG has the best writing, the best stories and upbeat 'Gene Rodenberry'esque feel of all trek, but DS9 has the greatest character arcs and most relatable characters of any trek. Perhaps, any TV show?"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Joe Piscopo wishes he could skip season 2.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I'm jealous that it's still on Netflix wherever you are.

They took it off of everything but Paramount in the US.

That said, everyone is right.  The first season has a few good episodes, the second season has several good episodes, and then you're basically free sailing until the last season, which is a lot like season 2 in quality."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,STNG gets great late in Season 3.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Season 1 still had the polystyrene set issue too.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Q : Oh, you're so stolid! You weren't like that before the beard."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I don't like to say it, but it got better after Roddenberry died."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Measure of a Man is also from S2.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Would it be okay to completely skip S1 (at least for now) and not feel lost in S2 and subsequent seasons?
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"People love to bang on about ""Roddenberry's Vision"" when they need a strawman to punch at when Star Trek does something they don't like.

The funniest part about season 1, when you think about it, is that season 1 is the purest example of Gene Roddenberry running a Star Trek series as you can get. For season 1, he was in control. This is the ""Roddenberry's Vision"" everyone gushes about.

And it sucked. Everyone uniformly hates season 1 of TNG."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,">Season 2 - meh. A few noteworthy episodes in a season cut short by a writer's strike (The final episode is a clipshow ep, as a result).

Not quite.

The '88 writer's strike did ultimately affect the length of season 2, but it was the production and writing of the end of season 1 that it hit.

The reason S2 ended with a clip show show was because the producers blew most of the season's budget on the introduction of The Borg. But they learned from that going forward and allocated their money more wisely to avoid the need for future clip shows."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,">I liked the two conspiracy episodes that were tied together,

I just watched Conspiracy and came back here because I remembered your comment. It was certainly an episode. The kicks and the pseudo-body horror 'splody head were epic"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"i would argue that season 1 has some episodes that are a ""need to watch""  to understand later season story - ark's. For example
""Hide and Q"",""Datalore"",""11001001"",""Symbiosis"",""Skin of Evil"" and ""The Neutral Zone"""
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I watch TNG yearly and I mostly love it. There are some bad episodes, but mostly it feels like coming home."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,That's so bizarre. Time's Arrow is generally considered to be an okay but hardly spectacular two-parter.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Interesting pick. ""Time's Arrow"" is a decent two parter but I personally would never put it in the top tier of TNG episodes. Hell the episode just before it (""The Inner Light"") is widely considered one of the best episodes of the whole series and, imho, is a far superior episode."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,">  I think like a lot of shows it was still finding its way in the first season.

This is very true, although I will say that TOS pretty much hit the ground running. Even the first half a dozen episodes of season 1 had some good stories and it didn't take long at all for the actors and the show in general to settle into its groove. It's the best season 1 of any Star Trek show."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"First season of DS9 was still better than most. It wasn't great, but there were plenty of enjoyable episodes."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"> The general rule of Star Trek tv series pre-new-Trek (so TNG, DS9, Voy, and Ent) is that the first 3ish seasons are rough

Except in the case of TNG where it's only the first two seasons that are rough."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"You can definitely do that. Watch the first episode, and skip to S2. I did that when I got my wife to watch it"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,I personally would watch the Q episodes (especially the pilot) and the death of Tasha Yar episode (it’s bad but it’ll help Yesterday’s Enterprise in S3 make more sense) but imo no other S1 episode matters
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"It's totally fine.  Back in the day, you just jumped in at whatever episode you were on, whichever season you were on."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,The S1 episode The Neutral Zone is considered to be a bit of a preamble to later events in TNG. Might wanna consider watching that one. You won't miss much if you skip it.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"You can, but I think you miss out. There are lots of little things set up early on from seasons 1 and 2 that come back later."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"People also forget that the best TOS content came after Roddenberry was kicked off (ST 2-4, 6)"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I would argue that those episodes have connections to future events, but enough context exists in the future episodes that a reasonably intelligent person will understand what is happening.  I guess for me I’d rather see someone get to the good stuff and enjoy the series rather than get stuck on episode 16 and quit forever."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,I know I actually watch them unlike msot of these nerds. They're my go to bed rotation. I've seen them all many times. They're corny. These dorks can down vote me but they aren't some kind of masterpiece.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,DS9 is just wild in that the show has a 7 season serialized story and the antagonists aren’t even introduced in the first season.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Oh I agree. DS9 is my jam.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Hence the 'ish'.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"""Skin of Evil"" is that episode."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"> rather than get stuck on

That of course is a valid point. Better to enjoy many seasons of quality episodes and then return to season 1 if so inclined."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Yesterday's Enterprise doesn't have the full impact it does without watching Skin of Evil though.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,DS9 is the bomb. Just rewatched it and was as sad and depressed there will be no more of it as I was the first time.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"The people at DS9 were waiting to see how that Babylon 5 experiment was doing. After about season 3, they realized B5 was working and they really needed to compete."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Walter Koenig (Chekov in the original series) said his roll on Babylon-5 was much better than just saying ""warp speed Captain"" over & over again."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"The first season of ST:TNG was a shit show.  From the studio down to the writing room, there was backstabbing and in fighting.  Morale was pretty low and the prospect of spending hours on a set that was just unpleasant was a deciding factor.  

Unfortunately for her, the series gelled going into season two and took off from there."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,It's easy to say that after the fact but at the time it probably seemed like a good decision. The first season wasn't very good and she was underused to the point of irrelevancy. I'm pretty sure I read that one of the producers told her that was as good as it was going to get for her. I'd have quit too with that information at hand. It wouldn't have been immediately obvious it was a bad decision as it took until the third season for TNG to become popular. She obviously regretted leaving and even came up with ideas for how to return as a guest star so it's not like she was above admitting her mistakes.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"STNG was a mess at first. The front office was removed after the second season and the whole thing turned around. 

When STNG was released TV shows was were careers went to die."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Maybe it was the proper life decision for her at that time.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Hindsight is always 20/20
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I don't really understand your tone, OP. ""Joke was on her"". Why would you want to look at it like that?"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,To me this sounds like a thread about a supporting cast person who should have been happy being underused since she could be underused a little less a few years down the road.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Except for Shatner and Stewart what other ST actor has been anything other than a supporting actor?  She has had a 40-year career and still does Trek stuff, so it is not like she burned all of her bridges.  Plus, ask any Trek fan, that first year was a little rough with some of the shows just redo's of the original, I am sure there were many who thought it would not last beyond that first year let alone become so beloved and timeless."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Berman era Trek has always had issues with sexism. I think the only cast members to leave mid series has been women. 

Also, if they didn't kill her off we wouldn't have gotten Yesterday's Enterprise."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I don’t think any of them were optimistic about a non-network scifi show in the 80’s being anything more than decent job for right now.  Patrick Stewart was on the fence if it was worth the flight from England iirc and the guy from roots and reading rainbow was the biggest acting name on the project.

Edit:  I don’t know what you mean by the women of “Star Trek  had been underutilized”. You mean Uhura?  She was the only one at that point but she was used a fair amount"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,But we would have missed out on Commander Sela.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,She probably just wishes she had the money all those episodes would have paid.  I doubt the actual role would have gotten any larger or any more satisfying to her as an actress.  Star Trek has a consistent pattern of having one or two characters turn into wallpaper.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I’m sure, at some point, she realized what a mistake she made then begged to come back."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Hindsight is 20/20, the first couple seasons of TNG sucked ass behind the scenes and in front of the camera. Drama on top of drama and long hours and a show that everyone thought would be cancelled.

&#x200B;

Who knows if her role wouldve gotten any better if she stayed? I dont think we should shit on actors for leaving big shows if they are unhappy with their role in it... if they are unhappy who says a fat check will fix that? rich people arent immune to unhappiness/depression."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I think she also had issues with the writers too. Her character kinda sucked, the backstory was pretty bad"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I didn't realize how limited his role was in TOS until I watched it recently. He's not even there at the start.

He gets to do quite a bit more in the films, especially Wrath of Khan."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Loved it when he was sitting in the captains chair and Sheridan tells him to get out of his chair.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Two was still bad, the show runner was an asshat and Roddenberry's lawyer was trying to manipulate the show. Season 3 gave Michael pillar the reigns who made the open script submission policy which discovered Ronald D Moore. Pillar and co saved star trek. But also fuck Rick Berman he was always a piece of shit."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Yep. They played up the ""oh my gosh, a female security officer!!"" a little too much when it shouldn't be a surprise at all to that century. And with both her and Worf there, it was gonna be hard to find work for both.

S1E1, gets frozen by Q for drama.

S1E2, virus makes her sleep with Data

S1E3, leader of the Africa Planet wants to take her as his wife by force (jesus christ...)

Struggling to remember any plot critical stuff she got to do after that.

Her once off appearances later in the series via time travel or her Romulan lookalike were much better."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Came here for this. Nobody thought Next Gen was going to last very long.  Hindsight is 20/20.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Yeah tbh she never seemed like her interest was acting, she always looked pretty disinterested. 

Probably just a way to pay the bills."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Agree. It sucks what they did with her character, and for her it wasn't a bad decision at the time"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,">Except for Shatner and Stewart what other ST actor has been anything other than a supporting actor? 

I was reading one of the threads about Takei vs Shatner that cropped up, and regardless of their personalities, people correctly pointed out that Mr. Sulu was a bit character that just happened to make the cut when it came to casting the movie and it made his career from that point on. Shatner was the star of the show, Takei was some guy who in a few episodes has a few lines. They weren't even being close to the same level of prominence, not on the show and not in the movies."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Wil Wheaton left Star Trek: The Next Generation mid-series.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"In all the Star Trek movies, she probably only had two pages of dialogue. Uhura had more screen time in the original TV show but she was still background."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Most of S3 was still bad as well. It got much better in the second half of the season and the cliff hanger ending of S3 is one of the greatest of all time.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"S1E3 was really wild. Like WTF were they thinking, Jesus christ"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Yep. TOS was mostly the Kirk/Spock/ Bones power trio. Most of the later Treks(bar Discovery...) did a better job of spreading out the officer's importance and screentime.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Very true. 1 guy, 5 women, although Gates came back. 

Nana said if she didn't resign there would have been a shuttle accident. Marina almost didn't come back for Nemesis because of unfair pay and they threatened to replace her with Jeri Ryan."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,Well tv is about 65 hours of content v under 10 in the first five movies.  She is principle cast and has a historical scene.  One of the stars of search for Spock is an adventurous science woman.  I don’t think that “Star Trek underuses women” is a correct characterization of the franchise that anyone would have used in 1990
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I liked ""Who Watches the Watchers"" and ""The Enemy"". 

2nd half of the season was better though. 

Deja Q, Sins of the Father, The Offspring, Captain's Holiday, Allegiance."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Gates didn't ""leave,"" she was fired. (I think that was another Maurice Hurley screwup, was it not?)

Trying to think of which ""5 women"" you are thinking of. Obviously Crosby, Jennifer Lien, and Terry Farrell are the obvious ones. Who else?

(Edit: and technically, Lien didn't leave, she was fired as well. Forgot about that.)"
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Lien wasn't fired, her contact ended after 3 seasons and wasn't renewed. I didn't specify fired/quit intentionally because I don't know what happened behind the scenes. It's interesting to me that it's mainly women who left. 

And Diana Muldaur."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,"I'm a pretty big TNG fan from way back, and, although I disagree with you about Dr. Crusher, I also agree with your point that Dr. Pulaski gets a lot of unnecessary dislike from deep fans and casual fans alike.  I think Diana Muldaur did a great job as Dr. Pulaski (she also appears in two episodes of The Original Series as a guest star as well).  

The problem was, she didn't like TNG, she didn't fit in with the cast personality-wise, and she basically did it as a favor to Gene Roddenberry.  There was almost no chance she was going to be on TNG for very long.  Also the reason Gates left was because she was essentially bullied by a grating producer from Season One, and so it made sense that she would return after that producer moved on."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"God damn, I remember watching the initial series on WB Kids! Saturday morning cartoon block 

Fuck I’m old now, how do I get off this ride 

Also, I play Pot of Greed..."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Anyone who keeps up with the card game knows what a shitshow it has become. It's like they're constantly out-doing themselves. 

Everyone knows Normal, Effect, Fusion, Ritual. But that requires spell cards. It's too complicated! Then came 5D's where Synchro was introduced which was kind of like Fusion summoning but a lot more generic. It's a decent concept, but I think people stacking 3 copies of things like Black Rose Dragon became ridiculous. 

Same with XYZ monsters. Synchro was too hard apparently, so now you don't even need Tuner monsters. Just two level 4 monsters. 

Then came the Pendulum monsters. XYZ? Nah fuck that. We want monsters with 2 effects per card and let you special summon five level 8 monsters in one turn. Every single turn. 

But wait, even that is too complicated. Let's just require 2 monsters. That's it. It's just 2 monsters. Send 2 monsters to the graveyard, and here comes the **Link Summon!** 

Not to mention the game is constantly being filled with bullshit like Effect Veiler, Ash Blossom, and cards that specifically say ""UNAFFECTED BY OPPONENT CARD EFFECTS"" because they realized how awful it was to spend 3 turns summoning a monster that can just be Bottomless Trap Hole'd. But now it's like every meta deck is built around summoning 5 monsters per turn, using half your deck on the first round, and full of ""cannot be destroyed/affected/targeted by card effects"" nonsense. 

The game is just a massive shitshow. It's fun to play with intentionally bad decks but if you even touch competitive, you're asking for a massive headache."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,And they did it all with the power of friendship!  🙄
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Detective Conan aired its 990th episode this weekend and One Piece isn't too far behind at 954. Lotta anime gonna be hittin' this milestone soon. Ignoring ones that already have like Sazae-san of course.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,that's a lot of children's card games
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Pot Of Greed? What does that do?

Also 1000 episodes is crazy, I think the last time I saw it was the first season of GX."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Hey Pot of Greed is on the Forbidden list, you cant use it...

...but I'll overlook it for a fellow Kids WB fan.  That block was awesome, so many classic shows."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I remember getting the soundtrack of the first movie from McDonald’s and it had different faces. My version was Kaiba. 


Dios Mios, we are old.

Quick, someone find seven dragon balls!
... Don’t wish for a TV!"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I got back into the game when plant synchros were running wild and i quite enjoyed synchros. Then XYZs came out and that name is still incredibly stupid but it was ok. It was like an even more generic form of synchros but I still preferred synchros. I quit shortly after. Then Pendulums became a thing and to this day I still don't understand that stuff. There were Link Summons and I have absolutely no idea wtf that is. I tried reading up on it, watching videos, it's just utter nonsense to me. I don't even know if they have any newer mechanisms now but holy hell did it become bloated and complicated as hell. That's been my experience with the have, anyway. 

I just want TeleDAD back because DAD is one of my favorite cards ever with awesome artwork."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Yeah I got one of the recent Yu-Gi-Oh Xbox Games and tried online. I was 100% fine with the original rules, and kinda decent at it with people in school. 

I’d never heard of any of the new rules, in like turn 1 the other dude Had summonsed like 3 high level monsters and I had one in defence mode..."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Honestly just play the Runeterra card game. Not only is it really well designed but you can easily get a free full collection in not even a year.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Jegus YuGiOH what happened to you
Yu-Gi-Oh!,They never follow their own rules in their show.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,You just need to really really *believe* in the heart of the cards.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,And money
Yu-Gi-Oh!,I can't believe Detective Conan is still on-going. Shame it stopped getting dubbed but it's probably pointless to do without a fan base in the US.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,And a whole lot of shiny cardboard
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"YOU MEAN POT OF GREED, WHICH LETS ME DRAW TWO CARDS

Yu-Gi-Oh!,"And I'm over here not knowing much about anime but like....which one doesn't have fucking 1000 episodes?

I bet Pokemon and every other anime from 20-30 years ago has a thousand episodes or close to it its just what anime does."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Yeah, I’d heard that before but I haven’t legit played a game since....... 2008? Apparently nowadays the game is loaded with One-Turn KO combos from what they say at my FLGS, but I’m usually too busy “FOR THE EMPEROR”-ing to give it a another try."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"*It’s an older code, but it checks out sir* ❤️"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I remember season 1 of og yu gi oh was basically Vietnam, no rules"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"That's because Konami are the ones in charge of making the card game, whereas the Yu-Gi-Oh! show is made by Kazuki Takahashi. 

It's just like how in the video games Krillin could beat Goku but it could never happen in the show."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Yeah well if they followed their own rules Kaiba would just Google ""best Yu-Gi-Oh deck [current year]"" and then win every duel on the first turn with his OP pubstomp deck that he spent thousands of dollars on."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I watched Case Closed religiously, late at night on Adult Swim back to back with Lupin the Third at 3-4 in the morning. Watched all the dub episodes and movies I can find afterwards.

Had to watch Detective Conan vs. Lupin the Third with subs since there’s no dub (and that’s a travesty, but another time.) and yeah, they stopped dubbing it pretty quickly. 

Either a combination of low viewership or the staggering number of episodes they have to dub that it wasn’t worth the effort.

I’m still calling bull that Rachel doesn’t know Conan’s Jimmy. Lady, you grew up with him as a kid, how do you not recognize the kid version of your best friend?!"

It was a story about games being used in high stakes situations with harsh penalties that grew to focus on a fictional card game due to an arc with it that gained popularity with the fans. The fictional card game then became a real card game."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,It's anime. They make anime about everything humanly possible. The joke recently about a Fidget Spinner anime wasn't actually that outlandish...

Yu-Gi-Oh!,The first season of the show was based on chapters of the manga that were written before the trading card game was a thing. That's why most of the rules that they follow for the rest of the series are introduced really abruptly at the start of Battle City.

A person on a passing boat had called Japan's maritime hotline to report an apparent body, floating 300 meters (about 1,000 feet) from the coast off the resort city of Nago, at about 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Yu-Gi-Oh! is a great manga that is extremely underappreciated. Most English fans' exposure to it was the anime, which is not only missing a huge chunk of the story that's barely ever been animated, it was also localized with a terrible English dub that butchered a lot of the tone and intent of the original story.

If you ever liked Yu-Gi-Oh the anime, I highly recommend reading the manga. The art is beautiful and the stories are strange and fun in such a unique way. Also watch the Japanese anime; that soundtrack does not deserve to go unnoticed.

Kazuki Takahashi was a great artist and writer. This is awful news."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Damn! What a fantastic artist and an awesome legacy left for others to enjoy for years to come. I feel like Yu-Gi-Oh never quite got the widespread appreciation it deserved.

A really sad loss, and in such a tragic way too. RIP and thank you Kazuki Takahashi"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,What a horrible way to die.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Kazuki Takahashi has made an enormous impact on my life, more then any person that I never met and I guess I regret not shaking his hand somehow somewhere. His show, playing on Kids WB at the time got me right into it, collecting and playing with my friends. I eventually grew out of it, but one day I decided, because of my love of yugioh, to pick up and play a different card game, Magic the Gathering, I played competitively from about 2009 all the way to about 2018. I made some of my closest friends during this time, in 2018 when I quit playing magic, I picked up and starting playing Takahashi's own creation again, I play competitively to this day and my closest friends all play. Yugioh is something very very close to my heart so I am grateful that Takahashi created such an amazing game. May he rest in peace."

I absolutely loved the Yugioh manga. Growing up I would sit in barnes and nobles and read the issues for hours while my mom would run errands."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Rest In Peace to the Eternal King of Games!
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"A piece of my childhood just died. This makes me very sad. 

Thank you Kazuki Takahashi for introducing yugioh to the world. Thank you for making us all duelists, for teaching us reading comprehension and quick mental math. Thank you for the problem solving skills acquired from playing this game. 

Thank you for giving me a game that got me lifelong friends and allowed me to make memories that I'll never forget. All the road trips to YCSs, all the nights of dueling till we couldn't stay awake anymore.

Thank you for everything, you will be sorely missed. 

I'm sitting here extremely upset as I type this, I never met him but it's almost the same feeling as a distant relative that you used to be close to but drifted apart dying. 

Truly filled with sorrow. R.i.p father of all duelists."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Rip to dude
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I mean, the shadow realm is a pretty apt description for the depth of the seas.  


RIP"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Man…that is unfortunate.  RIP you amazing writer and thank you for many childhood memories.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Grew up obsessed with this series and game.  Recently got back into it hard.  Absolute legend
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Yugioh debuted here in the US when I was six. Lots of childhood memories watching the king of games or playing irl with friends. Yugioh taught me structure and basic math, I was just ghetto boy, but it gave me relief from my environment. A reprieve. Rip."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,He sent himself to the graveyard and ended his turn.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Oh so many good memories… RIP
Inspector Gadget,"Ahem, no they're not. They acquired the American streaming rights to the already-existing reboot that started airing in Europe."
Inspector Gadget,Ewwww that cgi looks like crap. 
Inspector Gadget,i hate that cheap looking ghetto-3D crap they have now. i saw a Garfield catroon in that style and its almost unwatchable
Inspector Gadget,More importantly... DANGER MOUSE!
Inspector Gadget,I always wanted one of those portable touchpad computers that Penny had.  Maybe we'll have them in the future.
Inspector Gadget,awful 3D shit.
Inspector Gadget,"For the love of god, make it animated."
Inspector Gadget,"Except...  The only people who want to watch Inspector Gadget are like 30 or 40 years old now.  And, that is a group of people who avoid stupid kids movies like the plague!"
Inspector Gadget,what if penny met a dinosaur? 
Inspector Gadget,Will Ferell would make a great evil guy [ I dont know I.G. enough to know the evil guys name ]
Inspector Gadget,If they changed the song I don't even.
Inspector Gadget,"Huh, that's weird. I thought this show was going to be released as part of Boomerang's new rebrand."
Inspector Gadget,"Second remake of their that I can think of off-hand. They just made a Richie Rick show. If you're looking for some animated shows to bring back, then can you get Invader Zim? Maybe get some Gargoyles? "
Inspector Gadget,"Wait, it started in Europe already? I thought Boomerang US was getting it first."
Inspector Gadget,you dont even have to look at the article you can just look at the thumbnail and see that it looks like crap
Inspector Gadget,Brain looks like he belongs in a pizzeria stalking the night crew.
Inspector Gadget,This is what I am afraid of for the Duck Tales reboot.
Inspector Gadget,It makes [Dire Straits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD6Obi7Cag) look good. 
Inspector Gadget,The original show looked pretty crap too though.
Inspector Gadget,"I've seen that show multiple times and it IS unwatchable. It's like it's trying to be Loony Toons and failing. Hell, John is a complete idiot instead of just a dork, Nermal is overblown... I mean, at least Garfield and Friend was well done."
Inspector Gadget,So you are saying there's a chance it is watchable?
Inspector Gadget,"I know, right?  It's clear they don't give a shit about quality."
Inspector Gadget,Or that is the demographic that now have children the same age as they were when they first watched this show.  Why do you think there are also reboots planned for DuckTales and The Magic Schoolbus?
Inspector Gadget,Invader Zim is actually coming back this year as a comic book.
Inspector Gadget,Netflix aren't making this. They just bought the streaming rights to a show that has already aired.
Inspector Gadget,That video kicked ass in 1985.
Inspector Gadget,"This is exactly it. If you're turning on cartoons for your child or buying them a toy, you're 100 times more likely to pick the one you're already familiar with. It's also really neat to be able to relate to a kid about something that both of you grew up with. "
Inspector Gadget,"As long as Phoebe and Carlos finally get what's coming to them, Magic Schoolbus should definitely make a comeback."
Inspector Gadget,Can't forget about about tmnt 
Inspector Gadget,"that is, if the modern version has similar qualities to the original. don't think you can have a transformers-based conversation with a kid who's only seen the fucked up movies while you grew up watching g1."
Inspector Gadget,Have you watched G1 lately? It's pretty crap. I got through maybe 10 episodes on a rewatch a few months ago and couldn't bear to watch any more. 
Inspector Gadget,"It would absolutely destroy me to have to play Sonic Boom with my kid, or to have to go on release day to see something of the calibre of the TMNT movie that came out last year.

I agree - being part of something nostalgic that your kid loves too must be amazing, but some of the reboots are just painful."
Inspector Gadget,"nostalgia definitely plays a role here but I watched the '86 movie a few years ago and I enjoyed it (same for teenage mutant ninja turtles, watched the first 2 seasons a couple years back). been planning on rewatching a lot of my favorites from the 80s but there are so many episodes of everything."
Inspector Gadget,I can't believe they got rid of the theme song!
Inspector Gadget,"Yeah, not feeling this at all.  But I'm also not the target audience so...oh well.  I'll always have the memories."
Inspector Gadget,"What a turd this looks like, but at the same time, this isn't for those who were fan of the original."
Inspector Gadget,"This is obviously a show for younger kids in the vein of Agent OSO, Mickey Mouse Club or Super Why, you know, edutainment for toddlers. Us adults are obviously not the target audience."
Inspector Gadget,"I'm having a deja-vu, this is going to be 3D Garfield all over again. Oh boy."
Inspector Gadget,[deleted]
Inspector Gadget,"I really just watched it to see if Cree Summer would be returning as Penny. Trailer didn't even let her speak.

edit: Apparently Tara Strong is taking over the role. I THOUGHT YOU WERE FRIENDS, TARA!!! "
Inspector Gadget,No theme song?  Bad move.
Inspector Gadget,"Well, looking for a positive here...at least Chief Quimby pops up in ridiculous places and gets blown up by self destructing messages. Unfortunate song change aside, it looks like it retains at least some touchstones to the original. ""Cheap CG"" is the new ""cheap animation from East Asian studios"", that's just the way it goes. "
Inspector Gadget,I'm really not a fan of that cheap(looking) cgi with the really undynamic backgrounds.
Inspector Gadget,I hate it when reboots go cheap and use CGI over drawn animation yuck.
Inspector Gadget,I'd rather just watch the original.
Inspector Gadget,"They gave Penny boobs...

http://i.imgur.com/3HpiFi0.gif"
Inspector Gadget,So...a penguins animation style? If you're gonna butcher it don't bother.
Inspector Gadget,There was a cgi inspector gadget movie back like in 2008 or something
Inspector Gadget,"Er, well... I guess it'll be okay... Hopefully it won't be trash because I remember loving the original as a kid and this just looks cheap, the way they move and seems to be very cliche for a cartoon now...

RIP the original song..."
Inspector Gadget,"Hopefully it won't be as horrible as the Richie Rich reboot

Dissapointed it's CGI and not hand drawn, but I guess that's inevitable with present-day production companies"
Inspector Gadget,"What the fuck is this Disney Channel bullshit?

As an 80s kid, I'm offended. Are all cartoon reboots needing to look this plastic just to appeal to kids today?"
Inspector Gadget,"You've got to be kidding me.

They changed the theme song and used 3D rendering for no reason."
Inspector Gadget,More like Inspecraptor Gadget. 
Inspector Gadget,The song popped into my head as soon as I read the headline. Can't believe they ditched it. 
Inspector Gadget,I can't believe everything I just watched. Some random kid to be a love interest for Penny is probably the worst.
Inspector Gadget,the rights to the song might have been harder to come by than the rights to the reboot
Inspector Gadget,"What?  You mean they are making a children's cartoon show for children?! What?  Why aren't they catering to the adults who watched the show when they were kids?  I'm outraged, I tell you!  Outraged!  I was hoping for a gritty realistic reboot that would appeal to my adult fanboy sensibilities.  How dare they force us to remember we aren't little kids anymore.  /s  

I'm with you buddy.  Not feeling it, but I'm not the audience, and there is nothing wrong with that.  You have a healthy perspective and I'm happy to hop on your bandwagon.

*Edit: I'm an idiot who doesn't proof read when he posts on his phone until after he posts.  Nothing changed, just words fixed."
Inspector Gadget,"I like the shows that entertaining for everyone like WordGirl, Cyber Chase, Arthur, and some others. I wish there were more shows like that."
Inspector Gadget,There are no adults in this thread.
Inspector Gadget,French Stewart (Harry from Third Rock from the Sun) played him in the sequel. Stupid fact kicking around my head for years.
Inspector Gadget,"That decision must have been funny.

Voice casting director:  ""You know, we can get Cree Summer back to play Penny.  The fans would love that, and I'm sure she'd get a kick out of, too.""

Showrunner:  ""Nah, let's just get Tara Strong to do her Young Cree Summer impression.""  

VCD: ""Uh, but Tara is going to be more expensive, you know.""

SR:  ""I don't care.  Get me Tara Strong.""

VCD: ""I've got Cree on speed dial.""

SR: ""Taaaaaara...""

VCD: ""We go to the same yoga class.""

SR: ""Stroooooooong....""

VDC:  ""Ah, fuck it.  Okay, I'll get in touch with Tara's people."""
Inspector Gadget,"they didn't make this, just bought the streaming rights or something. still, it looks like crap and changing the theme song was also a bad idea (though 'modernizing' the original would've been horrible as well)."
Inspector Gadget,That sounds more like he is raptor-like than crap-like. That would actually be a pretty cool show. It could almost be like a dinobot inspector. 
Inspector Gadget,"Look, I'm fine with the show being for kids. What I am NOT fine with is the show looking like cheap CG crap."
Inspector Gadget,"So if changing the theme song is a bad idea and modernizing the original would have been horrible...what should they do? The show isn't designed for people who grew up on IG, so having a weird 80s soundtrack would just be jarring for children today, instead of the warm nostalgia we feel.

Not trying to be a troll, but what would you do?"
Inspector Gadget,"yeah, I should've added that they basically couldn't win over the old fans either way. I still would've chosen to re-do the original, I guess. noone might agree but I kinda liked the knight rider reboot's theme music, for example (the show itself was a guilty pleasure of mine as well but when I went back to the original, I couldn't stomach more than a couple episodes, which could very well be the case with gadget too, been planning on re-watching the original).

and since I don't *have* to watch it, it doesn't really bother me that it exists, I just don't like reboots/remakes/spinoffs/etc. of my favorite things because most of them aren't that good."
Inspector Gadget,[deleted]
Inspector Gadget,Can't most of Penny's job be done now with a smart phone?
Inspector Gadget,I wish teletoon would reboot some of its old shows like Undergrads and Clone High.
Inspector Gadget,It won't be the same. Don Adams is dead and gone. It would be like giving someone else Homer Simpson's voice or Shaggy's voice. You know it just wouldn't sound right.
Inspector Gadget,Awesome! I want to hear an updated version of the old cartoon intro song!
Inspector Gadget,">...the bad guy will be the nephew of Gadget's original nemesis, Dr. Claw.

So...Professor Claw? Gotta say, that sounds way less intimidating."
Inspector Gadget,"You can't reboot reboot, reboot's perfect."
Inspector Gadget,Weren't they going to make a feature movie to wrap up the story? 
Inspector Gadget,Why would they MTV and others were involved in production. 
Inspector Gadget,"I just wanted to make the joke. Truth be told, I just want the cliffhanger resolved :("
Inspector Gadget,Last word on that was in like 2011.
Inspector Gadget,Didn't they wrap everything up nicely with that special?
Inspector Gadget,"No. If you're talking about the musical number, that was Season 3. Season 4 ended on a cliffhanger."
Inspector Gadget,I can't remember what happened. I remember Andrea getting tits and Bob growing his dreads out and not much more. 
Inspector Gadget,"Man, the story was so cool..."
Inspector Gadget,I suppose it's worth noting that this segment isn't particularity funny. But I helped animate it! And am in desperate need of validation! 
Inspector Gadget,"With Don Adams being dead, I feel like Inspector Gadget died with him. This was a pretty terrible skit.  "
Inspector Gadget,The laugh track kills this show for me
Inspector Gadget,"This was my first look at Canadian television, and let's just say it wasn't pleasant."
Inspector Gadget,Impressive.
Inspector Gadget,You did great!
Inspector Gadget,"Can't say I enjoyed the segment's gags, but Gadget looks on point!

Are you part of the 2015 series' animation team then?"
Inspector Gadget,"Definitely not funny, but it was well animated!"
Inspector Gadget,Well it's better than [Mike Matei's impression.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0C0J8rAumM)
Inspector Gadget,"I don't know, I actually don't mind the new voice actor. But yeah, this skit was weak. "
Inspector Gadget,"The funny part is, during the live taping, the only time people actually laughed for real was during the ""Go-go-Gadget Microwave"" bit, but when it aired on TV, they took out the laughter during that part and added it in everywhere else, like an inverse of what actually happened."
Inspector Gadget,Brown Bricks. 
Inspector Gadget,22 Minutes have gone downhill. A lot of their pretaped is hit and miss but more on the latter with forced repeating.
Inspector Gadget,Where's the Reboot reboot?
Inspector Gadget,"It seems sort of pointless to complain about studios pandering to millennials, but this stuff is really getting out of hand. "
Inspector Gadget,First Disney with a [Ducktales reboot](http://deadline.com/2015/02/ducktales-animated-series-ordered-disney-xd-1201380913/) and now this. Crazy day for 80's/90's cartoon nostalgia. 
Inspector Gadget,Was anybody else feeling the new Richie Rich show? 
Inspector Gadget,Supposedly still being worked on. I'm hopeful we hear more about it soon. That's one I really can't wait for.
Inspector Gadget,"I feel like almost everything I watched as a kid pandered to baby boomers, so I guess it makes sense."
Gilmore Girls,"I love Stars Hollow as a setting and I love the supporting characters. Re-watching the series feels like coming home to a place I’ve never been. But the more times I’ve watched the series, the less I find myself liking the two main characters. Even so, I can’t help watch it from time to time."
Gilmore Girls,"Watch Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, same creator as Gilmore Girls. It’s also very good, great quippy dialogue."
Gilmore Girls,I would recommend Bunheads from The Palladinos as well. Still sad that one got cancelled
Gilmore Girls,"Gilmore Girls has been one of my long-time comfort shows. Stars Hollow is just so cozy.

I only really rewatch the seasons before Rory goes to college."
Gilmore Girls,"It gets a little rough in the later seasons, but as a 23 year old dude I agree it's a great show. I think if a show or movie is well written enough, it doesn't matter what genre it is for people."
Gilmore Girls,"""Seen"" it twice; watching as background while the girlfriend was watching it.

It was enjoyable except for some things (I won't go into now, spoiler). I hope you enjoy it overall though!"
Gilmore Girls,I won't lie I binge watch Gilmore Girls with my sister in law during the holidays when I visit. It's become our thing. And I thought I hated those shows. I still won't openly admit to everyone I watch it. Lol
Gilmore Girls,"It’s funny how everyone rates this show’s banter, I found the rapid fire dialogue anxiety inducing and unmemorable."
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah good small town characters.

Other ones that are a bit more trashy or not written like Gilmore Girls I have seen with my wife are Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills 90120, and 90210 (CW modern version for short attention spans). Happy Endings on the more comedic side."
Gilmore Girls,"I've been thinking about watching this show for years, i can tell I'll wind up liking it more than I'll publicly admit, like that Hallmark show I'm rewatching for 10 billionth time i will not name"
Gilmore Girls, Saw this with my gf. Thought it was lame
Gilmore Girls,One of my favorite media theories is the Netflix Gilmore movie is the real world.  While the show is Rory's book with an unreliable narrator.
Gilmore Girls,I just started rewatching this while I'm sick with Covid. It's such a comforting show.
Gilmore Girls,"Gilmore girls is my comfort show. The characters sometimes can annoy me so much, but I always get back to it, because I love the overall tone and how cozy it is. Also perfect fall show. But the early seasons are definitely the best."
Gilmore Girls,"Isn't that a major part of the show? All 3 Gilmore Girls are morally ambiguous and spoiled women who routinely make terrible decisions that come back to bite them in the ass. Without this realization, the revival series won't make any sense."
Gilmore Girls,I’m with you on this. I loved the show when it first aired but on a recent rewatch I realized Lorelai and Rory are kind of mean-spirited bullies.
Gilmore Girls,As we get older and society moved on. You realize they are linda selfish and kinda spoiled.
Gilmore Girls,"Oh! I have seen Marvellous Mrs Maisel, didn’t know they had a common creator! Now can see the similarity!"
Gilmore Girls,[deleted]
Gilmore Girls,"It was the main thing I disliked about the show. Nobody talks like that, it was so fast as if they constantly knew what each other were about to say which is sometimes charming but eventually highly unrealistic and annoying"
Gilmore Girls,"I was about to watch this show because of OPs recommendation, but as a non native English speaker that mostly reads subtitles this worries me, is it really that bad?"
Gilmore Girls,The length of the continuous camera shots with perfect acting lines memorized in Marvellous Mrs Maisel is simply amazing.
Gilmore Girls,">pretty much assholes.

Oh come on. Don't sell them short. They're the biggest dickheads in their own show.

Amy Palladino always writes her main characters to be massive assholes and I'm not sure she realizes that she does. Same with Mrs. Maisel."
Gilmore Girls,"I haven’t seen it in years, I remember the daughter whining incessantly about college and I had a crush on the mum because Bad Santa had just come out. It was hard to pay attention to any character development when the actors have to spit their lines out so fast it’s like they’re fighting off diarrhoea and need to escape the scene."
Gilmore Girls,"> Nobody talks like that

I hate to break it to you, but television isn't supposed to be reality."
Gilmore Girls,"That's the point.

I mean, obviously you don't have to *like* it. But most 'good' television and movie dialogue is highly unrealistic. West Wing, Deadwood, Gilmore Girls, Succession. Nobody talks like that. Simply pointing it out doesn't do much."
Gilmore Girls,"Maybe try one episode or YouTube highlights first and see how you feel. I have hearing issues and incessant chatter drives me mad, so you shouldn’t take my opinion as fact"
Gilmore Girls,"Yep. It's awful. And I'll still watch it. I loved Rory, I loved Lorelai, I loved Suki, and even Kirk.

It's not the example you'd want to set for a teen girl, or a female relationship with your grandmother.

But man, I watched it so many times."
Gilmore Girls,Rory kind of became everything that Lorelai was running away from when she got pregnant. It's kind of tragic. But I think it was a very bold move to make one of their main characters a person who actually makes really ugly mistakes that have actual consequences.
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah, Rory is not a great character.

People were extremely upset about her character's actions in ""A Year In The Life"" when that came out, saying it betrayed her character in the show, but it's literally a logical extension of who she was in season 4-7."
Gilmore Girls,I seriously started to question if I liked Rorie at all when she started dating Logan. There was the episode where she ate dinner with his family and they were condescending to her. She was outraged and talked about how she's a Gilmore; a wealthy family and member of the DAR!!!!
Gilmore Girls,"Yes. 

Though now looking back maybe that was always going to happen. As soon as the grandparents money and influence got involved, it shows how the lives of Rory and Lorelei really change. 

Carrie from SATC js another character where at the time, most women wanted to identify with. We all wanted to be the Carrie. But when you actually take a look, she is a selfish entitled brat and a shit friend. 

That said, I still like watching GG reruns as something about it is still so cozy. I just retcon everything to where a pleasant and we'll adjusted Rory ends up with the mature bookstore owning Jess."
Gilmore Girls,"While it can be seen as negative, as someone who loves the show and watches it once every couple years, it felt realistic. For me the show always thrived because I related to characters to my real life. I feel its okay sometimes for characters to take the rory route because that is what happens in life too"
Gilmore Girls,I see your Rory Gilmore and raise you one Theodor Mosby
Gilmore Girls,I didn’t mind Rory’s character progression. Hated her relationship with Logan and the Life and Death Brigade stuff though. That ended up consuming her character and it was just all very irritating to watch.
Gilmore Girls,"I never made it to the end of the show, but did catch A Year in the Life, like many people. That was where I an encountered an adult Rory who was, in the end, a complete failure, the classic case of the kid who peaked in high school. We all know people like that - clever, attractive, charismatic - who somehow lose their magic, and become a shadow of who they once were, strangely stuck in neutral. I hated that, but now that I come to think about it, this was sort of a daring decision, and they planted the seeds."
Gilmore Girls,The whole 'the other woman' angle was really icky. Especially Rory having the nerve to be upset when Logan told her his fiancée was moving in with him or whatever.
Gilmore Girls,"I think it does happen in comedy a lot... but its wierd in a show that is supposed to be a feel-good/ soap. 

Like seinfeld protagonists get people deported, kill their fiances, give handicap people damaged wheelchairs etc...and end up going to jail. 

Larry in curb also isnt a good person...

Also in british comedies things often go against optimistic expectations"
Gilmore Girls,"Her character started going downhill ever since she left high school, and I don’t know if it’s because the Sherman-palladinos were so enamored (for whatever reason) with Logan and his group of asshole friends. So much so that almost an entire ep of the revival series was dedicated to them. And Rory getting entangled with them was (to me) the impetus of her unlikable behavior."
Gilmore Girls,"So there is a theory, Year in the Life is real world Rory. The original series was the novel she wrote. That's why in the original run of the show Rory is whip smart over achiever who has all the boys wanting her and in A Year in the Life she is a prissy girl acting entitled because she was good at school when she was younger and thinks that should get her advantages. But real Rory can't even hold a cup right."
Gilmore Girls,"If there's anything Amy Sherman-Palladino excels at, it's turning initially likable protagonists into assholes."
Gilmore Girls,"she grew up in a wealthy family in the northeast 

kind of her destiny"
Gilmore Girls,"not every character should have a good ending.

sometimes the descent into evil/madness/being an ass is more fun."
Gilmore Girls,"I only watch until she finishes high school. I think the amount of drama it had in the beginning, mixed with the sense of magic and wonder, was amazing. It is like taking a happy pill every time I watch it. Later it was as if the creator got depressed and wanted to ruin the show."
Gilmore Girls,"I love this show. And I also love to hate this show lol. I've watched the series probably a good six+ times through, including when I originally aired on cable. And every time I start again, there's a different character that I seem to hate LOL. 

When I was younger and in my early twenties, I hated the grandparents and their overbearing opinions/stuffiness. As I got a little older, I despised Lorelei and her constant commitment phobia and the hatred of her parents.  As an adult it really was off-putting seeing her not to want to have dinner with her parents once a week, after asking them to pay for an insanely expensive private school for her daughter. Now that I'm closer to 40 than 30, Rory is the one that makes me angry because while she initially seemed sheltered and naive, she really squandered all of the opportunities that were handed to her.  Instead of being a hard-hitting journalist, she's okay with being someone's mistress.

All of these things are surprisingly real life situations, and probably happen far more regularly than most people think. Which is also probably why the show is so relatable and rewatchable."
Gilmore Girls,"I was really bummed where they took her character for a year in the life.  She definitely does very questionable things throughout the original series, but I personally was able to chalk that up to being a teen/young adult and figuring things out.  She seemed to learn lessons along the way and overall know what was morally best (even if not always acting on it).  But she was just a full on piece of shit in A Year in the Life and after the whole show having her on this path for a successful journalist, she fucks that up to.
I almost have to forget her outcome during any rewatch of the original show.  I guess if you look back, her outcome somewhat makes sense, however I never really saw this show going for the “real and hard outcome”.  It always seemed like a warm, hallmark style show, but with better writing and acting."
Gilmore Girls,[deleted]
Gilmore Girls,"Both her and her mother are spoiled entitled brats.  They are using men and then dumping them for no reasons.   Bitching about money but spending hundreds on food and stupid stuff.  

I feel terrible for the grandparents.  They give them thousands of $ and only ask for one dinner a week and they are bitching about it.    They gave Rory money for school, university, gave her a brand new car and paid for European vacations...

Poor Luke also gives them money and he's always there to help them but what does he get?   Getting cheated on after renovating her house,"
Gilmore Girls,"It's fine in the show. She graduates from college and looks to begin an adult life. There is obviously going to be conflict when she re-enters 'wealthy world', otherwise there's no story.

The movies are a little hard to believe."
Gilmore Girls,Jess and the beginning was not good enough for Rory. Rory at the end was not good enough for Jess
Gilmore Girls,"In hindsight the obsession with Harvard in season one was already strange.

What does she want?

Going to Harvard or Yale isn't a career. Apparently she wants to be a journalist, which is attainable without going to Harvard or Yale.

In order to increase her chances to be accepted to Harvard, she 'needs' to go to a very expensive private school.

It's a strange message: the thing that makes Rory special is that she has rich grandparents who can afford to pay for her exclusive school.

Instead of Rory and her mother figuring out how Rory can have a fulfilling life (in her case being journalist) the solution is to have dinner with her grandparents once a week.

I don't think Rory's arc was intentional.

Amy Sherman-Palladino genuinely seems to be obsessed with money and privilege and see those things as positive character traits."
Gilmore Girls,"I look at her as being a human being. Some of us make small mistakes...a lot of small mistakes. Some make really big ones. Personally I think she learned from hers for the most part. Would she make more in the future?-yea, because we all do."
Gilmore Girls,"Worth noting that both Jess and Dean greatly improved their lives once they moved far away from Rory. 

Dean reconciled with his wife, had a bunch of kids and was living the happy family man life.  Jess went for a more bohemian life with his publishing house. It’s not glamorous, but he seems happy and fulfilled."
Gilmore Girls,"I thought the appeal of Gilmore Girls was that it was an escapist fantasy. It's about a charming and quirky small town where everyone knows everybody, and a Mother-Daughter family that can be charming and quirky because they have wealthy grandparents to bail them out if they're in a bind. Yes, Lorelai really wanted to be independent, but if she was ever really in trouble, mom and dad were there for her. Not everyone has wealthy parents to pay for private school. Not everyone lives in Hallmark Village. 

Hence - it's escapist fantasy. I still enjoyed it though."
Gilmore Girls,"Just because she was raised by Lorelai, does not mean that she was required to follow her path. 

To be honest, she went off the rails when Dean turned into a violently jealous potential domestic abuser, and she stayed with him."
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah, it sucks.  I didn't mind her having actual flaws, but what I don't understand is why she never learns from her mistakes and becomes a better person."
Gilmore Girls,"Most Gilmore fans from what I experienced very much dislike Rory, and more so like the show for almost everyone else. That and the dialogue is really fantastic writing. Would highly recommend checking out the creators current show, The Marvelous Ms. Maisel. Still the same energy of dialogue, but you actually want to root for the main character"
Gilmore Girls,"It's snowflake/gifted child syndrome.  Everyone told her that she was special.  She was loved by everyone she met.  She never faced any real challenge.  Then for the first time when someone told her she wasn't special, that she wasn't good enough she flipped out and committed a felony and dropped out of college.  Then she was too special to take a job that wasn't perfect and kept floundering."
Gilmore Girls," Was it the writers' goal to have the protagonist become the antagonist. I mean all good characters have their flaws but come on, Rory's story arc was more vomitous than applaudable. She dumped Dean, her first love, for the ill-tempered, bad-mannered bad boy, Jess; and then dumped Jess for Dean after she broke up Dean's marriage - and then, dumped Dean for the frat guy. She was ungrateful, unconcerned about who she hurt, especially her mother's feelings. Wasn't her character supposed to be timid, shy, polite, and intellectual? Yet, she was all of the above -- a most annoying and cringe-worthy character. I'd take 1 Paris over 100 Rorys."
Gilmore Girls,My wife watched this on repeat and I could never for the life of me remember what happens
Gilmore Girls,"Rori abandons Lane at every step in her life    Says it all 

She goes to college and by the second year is unrecognizable.  

Truthfully going back and watching it the last time.   I couldn’t get why every guy was fighting over her.  

Or why she was worth dean cheating on his wife w her.  

She’s an average looking girl.  Plain if I’m being honest.  

Lorelei was gorgeous the main reason I watched it."
Gilmore Girls,I gotta ask because idk if it's just me but do these characters converse extremely fast? It almost feels unnatural. Not ripping on the show I'm just going off from what I've viewed.
Gilmore Girls,Poor Suki.  Her husband pretended to get a vasectomy and she got pregnant again.   And then everyone was ok with it.
Gilmore Girls,"What do you mean ""even Kirk""? He is the best (supporting) cast member at all."
Gilmore Girls,"Yep, quality rewatch material right here. I like to start season 1 the week after Halloween. Stars Hollow really slaps in the Fall."
Gilmore Girls,It's interesting that as you rewatch you start empathizing with different characters.
Gilmore Girls,"I never really got too into the show, but my sister did growing up so I saw a fair amount of episodes. One of the hallmarks of good writing is to show, not tell. I feel like the show got stuck in the trap of telling us how smart, talented, gifted, and special Rory was, but did a poor job of actually showing it a lot of times. In fact, we were often shown the opposite, where Rory acts selfish, entitled, and privileged."
Gilmore Girls,"Uh, I think you mean ESPECIALLY Kirk."
Gilmore Girls,Yes. But Rory didn't grow up with all that affluence and it is understandable she was taken in by it. I started to notice the change in Rory when she was at Yale. She preferred Logan and his friends over more middle class kids. It was an early sign of where she was headed.
Gilmore Girls,"On the one hand, I agree, characters we love should be able to be sognificantly flawed and make bad choices, but it is an upsetting trend in 90% of revivals these days, especially ones after a long break, that either the characters have stagnated and reset to their old status quo e.g. Luke and Lorelei somehow still in a will they/won't they. Or the world/characters has only gotten worse/sadder. 

I get that happiness doesn't always make for interesting tv but I feel that you definitely CAN have characters be happy and interesting."
Gilmore Girls,It was a bold move but also an ugly mistake. Incompetent asshole Rory is arguably not unrealistic but it's pretty far from what most fans enjoy about the show. There's a reason only Emily's parts of A Year in the Life were enjoyable
Gilmore Girls,It really was perfect.  You could tell from her constant negative reactions everytime she encountered a roadblock.  It's gifted child syndrome at it's heart and the reason that you need to make sure your kids are put in things they suck at.
Gilmore Girls,I'm confused? Everything I'm hearing sounds like she is a pretty great character in that she's well written and has a well realized character arc. It just didn't go in a positive direction. I haven't seen the series but honestly this thread makes the show sound kind of interesting if anything.
Gilmore Girls,Showed how highly she thought of herself
Gilmore Girls,"Logan's family was awful, but his dad was right that time he said that she didn't have the right stuff to make it as a hard hitting journalist. And because she was only ever told she was amazing her whole life (by an entire town lol) she totally freaked out."
Gilmore Girls,I may be misremembering but I was under the impression that she took it the wrong way and it was more because she had aspirations of being a journalist and not a housewife then she wasn’t good enough for Logan.
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah I agree. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen complaints regarding Rory’s character online but I find her to be quite realistic. And she isn’t a bad person for taking advantage of her position in life. Or for becoming a bit spoiled or lazy because of it. It is what it is. 🤷‍♀️ 

Also I do love that GG shows that people are constantly changing for better or for worst. Without spoiling anything, Emily goes through a whole new season of life post AYIAL. And Rory will too. It’s not shown unscreen but it’s there. 

Also you have Jess as the sort of Anti-Rory of the show- showing the journey a smart kid has to go through when offered very little opportunities in life in order to find success. He’s a lot more scrappy and pretty much achieved his position in life through knowing he had barely anything to fall back on."
Gilmore Girls,I believe it's spelled Schmosby
Gilmore Girls,One of the best things to come out of the last season of HIMYM was a promo where they brought back the child actors from the flashfowards in the early seasons to berate Ted for wasting their entire childhoods with endless stories about all the chicks he banged.
Gilmore Girls,The guy who ran the hotel In suite life of zack and Cody?
Gilmore Girls,I mean Ted sucked the whole time
Gilmore Girls,I see your Ted Mosby and raise you one Felicity Smoak
Gilmore Girls,"I enjoyed HIMYM, but the show really needed grow beyond its original premise if they were going to keep it on the air for 9 seasons."
Gilmore Girls,Or making you love the asshole
Gilmore Girls,"It happened because Amy Sherman-Palladino absolutely despises millenials, and made the whole revival about her distaste for them. There’s a quote from her that goes something like “I don’t care if you have a degree, sweetie, quit bitching and work for Starbucks”. I’m probably messing that up but that was the gist of the quote. She thinks they’re whiny, immature and entitled, so she wrote all those traits into Rory. 

Not to mention she was so upset with them hiring new writers for season 7 that she stuck with her original ending for AYITL even though it no longer made sense for Rory to get knocked up at 32. Rory graduated with a bachelors degree, but when the miniseries begins she’s essentially homeless, unemployed, and cheating on her boyfriend with a married man. Rory didn’t grow as a character because of ASP’s feelings toward a whole generation that grew up watching her stupid show."
Gilmore Girls,"I sort of get the point but the answer to why they go to her grandparents instead of Rory becoming a journalist from a public university is because it is a relationship/family drama. Things have to happen. The multiple generations must be involved, for development, catharsis, etc.

Or, as put in this interview,

>Rory’s whole point in this is that she had a plan and the plan isn’t working and she’s a little bit in denial. What would people want us to do instead? That Rory was married to Jess and they’re just happy and pretty? Life is about conflict. The conflict of this girl was to take her down the road that she was least prepared for."
Gilmore Girls,"Dean got divorced and remarried some chick named Jenny, but I still agree with you. I love Rory’s character and she’s always been an asshole right from season one.  Watch closely."
Gilmore Girls,She's wealthy enough to not need to learn. :/
Gilmore Girls,"Eeh, she's pretty self centered and terrible herself.  Who cares if she ruins someones life, she gets laughs."
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah, in general the scripts were about 2x longer than what you normally see. It’s a style the creator uses in her other shows too."
Gilmore Girls,"Yeah, that’s more or less part of the appeal or the creators shtick anyway."
Gilmore Girls,I just started the series for the first time a few days ago. Close enough!!
Gilmore Girls,"Logan was great, though, to be fair."
Gilmore Girls,"Yes and it was the worst part of the later seasons. Logan was a terrible love interest, just terrible"
Gilmore Girls,"She's still treated like a Pixie queen while being a bitch, though. It's rather frustrating to watch."
Gilmore Girls,"Oh I agree that her dad was right about her not being cut out to be a journalist. But they were jerks when they thought she wasn't from a good enough family to marry their son. 

Her response should not be that she comes from ""good stock."""
Gilmore Girls,My head went here first too
Gilmore Girls,"I never understood the hatred for Millennials, but it makes even less sense now. People still mock the generation as if we're in our teens and twenties, when in reality most of us are now 30+ adults, and many are parents."
Gilmore Girls,">  She thinks they’re whiny, immature and entitled, so she wrote all those traits into Rory. 

Okay but how do you explain Ms Maisel having all those qualities. You can't even to a place that has a mic because she will unprompted take over like the worst type of heckler even those she has ruined numerous friendships for doing this exact thing and it has only worked out well for her, maybe twice."
Gilmore Girls,">That Rory was married to Jess and they’re just happy and pretty?

That has nothing to do with what I wrote.

And the argument that the grandparents paying for an expensive school was the only way to get the grandparents involved isn't very strong.

Lorelai could have had real financial troubles. In fact, that would have been realistic."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I really enjoyed this show, it was lighthearted for the most part and entertaining. 
The costumes were on point, it's like they pop out of the screen.
Props to the costume department."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I haven't watched it, but my parents are obsessed with it. In addition to the three seasons, there's a movie (Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears) and a spin-off mini-series (Ms. Fisher's Modern Murder Mysteries).

Here's where you can find the main series for streaming: [https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/miss-fishers-murder-mysteries](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/miss-fishers-murder-mysteries)"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"This is my absolute favourite feel-good-series, everything bad turns good in the end but in an intelligent way, the characters are lovely and funny and miss fisher is just the ideal heroine while dot, hugh and jack are perfect sidekicks
If you‘re looking for complex drama this series might not be for you, but if you want to loose yourself in a beautiful story about a strong woman and lot‘s of love and fun, this is it"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,It is a total delight. I really love the cast as a whole and the acting and plot but I can't overlook the beauty of the costumes. I still need to watch the movie but I've been saving it for a day when I really really need it.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I had heard that a movie was also on the way. Any idea when is it coming out?
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,The books are also good.  The plots of the shows are taken directly from the books byt the show involves the supporting cast much more.  The books are basically just Ms. Fisher.  The books also have more sex.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Miss Fisher has the very best outfits. So envious of her wardrobe.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,YES. i love this series so much!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"If you like Miss Fisher, you may also enjoy Frankie Drake Mysteries. Takes place maybe 5-10 years earlier, and in Toronto, Canada. Strong cast, wonderful writing.

3 seasons available, with a 4th season being filmed now.

In the US, it's aired on Ovation cable channel, and available through PBS Masterpiece streaming. Possibly also DirecTV, but not 100% sure."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Costumes are amazing! Think there’s interviews with the designer on YouTube.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,The 60s spin off is ok but doesn't have the charm of the original
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"About 6 months ago.

Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears was released on streaming and disc sometime in June in the US."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Wouldn't suit me  
Tho I have to confess: Essie looks well cool in two pink fans..."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Me too. And every time I watch it I consider getting a bob!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Many thx; never heard of it.  
I will take a look"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,And when looking for frankie drake I noticed also [Murdoch Mysteries...](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091909/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt)
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,did not know that. Thanks for letting me know
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Yes, Murdoch Mysteries is one of my favorites. 13 seasons, and still going strong. It's a bit less serious than Miss Fisher... and sometimes a bit out there. A little different dynamic, but I find it very enjoyable. 

In the US, Murdoch Mysteries is available on Ovation. For streaming, last I checked, seasons 1-10 were on Hulu, and seasons 1-13 were on AcornTV."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,One downside of streaming is that services only want you to know about what they have to offer. I know many people who think series have ended only to discover there's two more seasons available somewhere else.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"> Yes, Murdoch Mysteries is one of my favorites. 13 seasons, and still going strong. It's a bit less serious than Miss Fisher...

But, er, Miss Fisher makes an art form out of flippancy..."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Ovation airs MFMM all the time & I keep watching to see if they'll air those seasons....&  perhaps the movie. But not as of yet.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I bought the series and film on blu ray cause it’s one of my favourites.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,The seasons used to air on the national free-to-air television station where I live (in 2012 when they first came out). I saw the movie on DVD. I just think it's interesting how out-of-touch most people have become now that they're all watching different services in the ever-fragmenting streaming market.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I have such a girlcrush on Miss Fisher. I have absolutely no idea who the actress is, but she plays it with such panache and confidence and wit. I recently read the first book out of curiosity, and wow, she nails it."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Thanks! I'm hyped for more Phryne and Jack. One of my favorite TV pairings.

A compilation of some of their scenes, to tide us over:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NasT2qNl6W8"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I'm worried it will ditch half the cast from the tv show.  While Miss Fisher herself is great, the side characters add a lot."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Oh awesome! I didn't even know there was a movie coming. I love this show
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Thanks!
Have you seen the TV series about her niece?
Is it any good?"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Neat. Will have to finish up the show and check it out. Been needing to get back to that one anyway.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Does anyone know if it's being released at cinemas in the UK?
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"If you like that one, I'm gonna also recommend looking at Marvelous Mrs Maisel if you have Amazon, it's much in the same vein of self confident female lead in a time when women weren't supposed to act that way."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Same actress who played the mom in The Babadook. I didn't recognize her in it.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Me too! I'm so bummed that it's leaving US Netflix this month :(
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Yes. It's a fun show.

It's out on Blu later this year, and streaming on Acorn TV."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I didn't find it nearly as good as the original. The new cast doesn't hold a candle to the original ensemble.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Haven't watched it yet - it's not on any of the streaming platforms I have. But I've heard good things!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Sadly, I don't have Prime. I've wished it was available on other platforms. I've been tempted to stream it somehow."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Dang, I didn't know that either. I better do a rewatch. Thanks for all of the enlightenment today :)"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I think it's like $13 for one month of prime. Binge it and whatever else you like on there within the month if you just do one month and then cancel. I know a lot of people do that across the services.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Might do that, thanks! Want to watch that Boys thing too, actually."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Wow, is the streaming service really that expensive or does that price include other stuff as well?   
Over here it's 2,99e per month for the first 6 months and after that 5,99e."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"The (first) movie is out in Feb. Going on an Indiana Jones-like world adventure.


MISS FISHER & THE CRYPT OF TEARS | Teaser Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLvViNHPrvo"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"The mysteries don't even matter; the show succeeds on the sparkle of its cast, plus the setting and costumes. I think people will know by the first episode whether it's for them or not.

The plots are of so little importance to me that I don't remember Phryne's younger sister at all! Guess it's time for my third rewatch before the movie."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Shame they stopped making this show, some things I just like better as episodes than a movie. I honestly didn't even mind how long they strung along the ""will they/won't they"", generally I despise that but when the cast is all so charming about it the anticipation is better than the end."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I really need to finish this series up.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Essie Davis is goddamn underrated actor. Watch her godly tour de force performance in babadook probably one of the best horror performances ever
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"If you haven't heard of it before, Miss Fisher is a fun detective show set in 1920s Melbourne. In the US, you can watch it on Netflix."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Nice.

It was a real bloody shame when the ABC canned it due to costs and budget cuts. It was very popular with overseas sales. I had hoped netflix partnering with the ABC for Glitch and some other content they would help fund another season.

Probably a bit cheaper to film a show set in 1960s too, a bit easier to dress a street scene vs a 1920s design."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I wish we got more Phryne. I'm sure this will be good, but I LOVE the original."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,YES
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Peregrine is an awesome name, too. "
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,My wife will be happy. She loves these period detective shows. One of her favorites involves using the little grey cells. I always enjoyed the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I hope they bring back the mystery series ""Zen"""
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"That is cool, it is really light hearted show but it is fun. "
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I'm not sure how I feel about this... I found the last season of the series weak, tbh."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Also, once you finish Series 3 and have a huge withdrawal, go on over to Canada and watch Murdoch Mysteries.  I THINK the first few seasons are still on Netflix but the whole series is on Amazon Prime for sure."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"> Later this year, the feature film Miss Fisher & The Crypt of Tears, set in 1929 and starring Essie Davis will also go into production."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Or the Doctor Blake Mysteries which was also made around the same time by the same broadcaster (as Miss Fisher's). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_Blake_Mysteries
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Frankie Drake Mysteries is a semi-related thing, set in Toronto a few decades later, shares a world with Murdoch Mysteries, if you still want more!"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I know! I'm excited for that, but I wish we could at least get a whole season. I love that show! And I like that era much more than the 60s. (I'm sure I'll love the new one too)"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I dunno why Doctor Blake didn't do it for me like Murdoch did. 
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Frankie Drake feels more like Miss Fisher than Murdoch does.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Murdoch Mysteries is 11 seasons long with over 150 episodes, so that will keep someone busy for quite some time."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"She was a character in the show, right?    I would love more still waiting for Season 13"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Essie davis is simply too old to play miss Fischer. If you have read the books this is glaringly apparrent
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"It’s set in the 20’s, there’s not much cross over other than George Crabtree making an appearance. But it’s made by the same company and shares showrunners/producers/writers I can’t remember which. 

"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Would be nice to have a wrap up of the series.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,yes please....we need a resolution.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,The plan seems to be a globe spanning adventure.  A bigger deal than just a wrap up
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I am pretty sure that Death Note does not have 11 seasons
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,We're back to having tv channels
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Have all these departures been officially announced?  

 I am glad Halt and Catch Fire and Rectify are not on this list."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,">Paramount+

wtf is this? first time i hear about it"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,This is why used to use VPN for Netflix before then blocked them all. You guys have so many tv shows we don’t here in Scandinavia.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,That’s good to know; just decided to re-watch Nurse Jackie a few days ago only to realize it won’t be on for much longer. Damn it!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"The appeal to Netflix for me was always that they had a mix of shows I liked to rewatch and a good amount of original content that was largely good. Now they're losing most of the licensed content (a lot of shows I like are already gone) and their track record with original content is mediocre, made worse by their quick axe with shows.

They're becoming the most expendable streaming service to me. The one I don't need to have all the time."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Good thing I have the internet
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Damn, I was about to finally watch The West Wing."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"> High profile

> Friday Night Tykes

What."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,If only this meant we could get The Last Kingdom s3 and s4 on Netflix...
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"I find it interesting the second or first most binged show two years running isn't moving

I guess Netflix won't be going to hell..."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I've only seen two of these shows. None of the other shows interest me so I guess I am lucky!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"> Netflix Canada

> Friends (Seasons 1-10) : moving to Crave

> The Office (Seasons 1-9)

> The fresh Prince of bell-air (Seasons 1-6)

Actually, The Office is staying put for now and it is Gossip Girl in fact that's leaving Netflix over here in the North."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I started Gran Hotel on Wednesday but I don't think I can watch 60+ episodes in the next week!  Hope it moves to Hulu.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Yeah what the duck. Unless one season consists of 3-4 episodes

The anime has 37 episodes in total and it's all labeled as one season and there are few live action movies including a western one which failed."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Not having ads and choosing what to watch is a huge plus though
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"We were never not going to have that. When we complained about cable it wasn’t because they asked us to pay for content we wanted. It’s because they also forced us to pay for content we didn’t want. I was paying thirty bucks a month for four ESPN channels I never ever use. I don’t want that.  I don’t have to pay for that without cable, which is great. But “I’m gonna get all the content in this entire world for 12.99 a month” is kinda unreasonable."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Time to buy a 3TB hard drive and work on the only channel that matters, a Plex server"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"People wanted the ability to just pay for what they watch, right? Well here you go."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Except the ""TV channels"" have everything available immediately and you can cancel anytime. Seems like a pretty major difference."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,[deleted]
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"This are all officially announced, but the bad news is what i listed is probably only 1/10 or 1/15 of what will be leaving Netflix soon."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"For the ones on Netflix France at least, you get a warning when playing them. So that's sure for those. I assume the others are the same"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"New name for CBS All Access, they're rebranding"
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,Some still work like Expressvpn
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,I completely agree.  I regularly unsubscribe from Netflix for months at a time to save a few bucks until something I REALLY want to watch starts up.
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,For a minute I thought it was a typo for Friday Night Lights!
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Wait, you don't? Where are you? I thought they carried that everywhere."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,"Damn that sucks man, the last kingdom is awesome. That’s a shitty situation I’d be pretty irritated."
Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries,What show

WWII: Lost Films,I DID like her interview with Jeannette Mccurdy. They had a very Frank and open conversation about the abuse they faced as children because of their show moms. It kinda made me tear up a little.
WWII: Lost Films,How is this different then all the other talk shows?
WWII: Lost Films,Maybe you just don't like Drew Barrymore?
WWII: Lost Films,Did you mean Tom Cruise on Oprah? He is the one  that had the infamous couch jumping segment
WWII: Lost Films,From this post I have learned two things. People have a higher standard for daytime talk shows than the format probably deserves. And you all genuinely care about Drew Barrymore and her well being. You are all so lovely.
WWII: Lost Films,I think that’s just how Drew Barrymore is lmao. But go off
WWII: Lost Films,"Drew Barrymore can be a lot… but for me it comes across as always genuine. 
She seems like such a happy person. Excited about everything in life. 
In the current climate we’re in I’m glad there’s someone like her trying to share her joy with others ✌️
Don’t like it, then don’t watch it."
WWII: Lost Films,I'll root for Drew Barrymore in whatever she decides to do. One of the only celebrities though not over exposed on sm also comes across as a genuine down to earth person. For a lifelong Celebrity at least lol. If anyone doesn't know she was addicted to cocaine at 12 years old ( or even younger??) And was in rehab at 13. She's been through the ringer and I'm just glad she's functional and alive at this point.
WWII: Lost Films,"Gotta disagree. While I don't watch the full show, I see many clips as a big DB fan on the interwebs. She seems really earnest. Like she wants to be there, she wants everyone to have a good time, she wants the best for her guests and audience. Idk, I mean day time is a rough go anyways, but she makes it her own, which is enjoyable."
WWII: Lost Films,"I love it. She had a really hard childhood and escaped the seemingly sealed fate of most child actors who are exposed to that stuff. 

Now she does what makes her happy and runs around laughing and being a flower-child to her hearts extent and I’m happy for her. She posted this video where she was laughing in the rain and people were making fun of her but I envy her ability to create joy out of something that would annoy most people. 

Maybe this is what makes her happy and she’s a human being and she deserves happiness just like we all do."
WWII: Lost Films,"I thought so too until I saw it live. It's not an act--she has a lot of feelings and lives to connect. She has plenty of experiences to share, good and bad, but also has genuine interest in others' lives. Her roundabout style doesn't fit the standard talk show mold, which is more interesting to me than a perfectly constructed show that hits the marks. Entire episodes could be made out of her digressions and interactions with the studio audience that are cut."
WWII: Lost Films,"I actually totally disagree. She seems pretty authentic. I would imagine to many she would seem annoying, but I think that's really what you get. And I enjoy it. I also really enjoy seeing her interact with celebs knowing she is a huge celeb, too. There's an understanding that isn't with every show.

In short, I genuinely like it."
WWII: Lost Films,Wendy Williams says hello!!!
WWII: Lost Films,Have you seen the Nick Cannon show?
WWII: Lost Films,"Unpopular Opinion here, I guess. I really like her show!"
WWII: Lost Films,"That's pretty harsh, first you shit on her for being too wooden then for being herself lol."
WWII: Lost Films,Here's a solution - stop watching it. Problem solved.
WWII: Lost Films,I really enjoy the Drew Barrymore show. I guess you really have to be a Drew Barrymore fan to really appreciate it. I understand why some people wouldn't like it. Drew is my favorite celebrity since childhood.
WWII: Lost Films,Her ratings are actually up 40% this season.
WWII: Lost Films,"I for one think it’s awesome that she’s at a point in life to be fully authentic and enthusiastic on her own show. The put-on seriousness of most talk shows is lame. She always feels genuine.

This post reads like the jerks who made fun of her rain video."
WWII: Lost Films,Are you really complaining about a show you've watched 2 seasons of? Must not be that bad.
WWII: Lost Films,Why? She seems actually nice. I get she's not going for the Reddit demographic of edgy guys but still
WWII: Lost Films,I think Drew Barrymore reached some weird level of celebrity where she has no idea how to act like a normal human being. I’ve seen her on a couple reality shows and the like and she has this very weird hyperactive persona you’re describing that seems so out of touch with reality. I guess if you’re that famous for so many years it must take a toll somehow.
WWII: Lost Films,"Man, and the show is the fastest growing show on daytime TV among people who are actually IN the demographic it's aiming for. Crazy. Who do they think they are appealing to other people. The audacity. I'd write them a letter. Tell them to quit it right now and do some stuff you like, sir. It's just uncalled for.  It's like they don't even care if you watch it."
WWII: Lost Films,And yet you keep watching
WWII: Lost Films,"You know you don't have to watch it. You aren't going to like everything but luckily not everything was made for you lol

When I don't like a show, I just change the channel. I don't normally hate watch it until I can post an angry paragraph about how much I hate it.

Literally everything you said is subjective. Wendy Williams has a much worse show imo"
WWII: Lost Films,"I was at my grandparents once and Drew Barrymore was on in the background. She had some YouTube Chef on making lemon bars. The guest said something like ""Aren't these delicious and just remind you of childhood."" Without missing a beat Drew Barrymore hits back with ""The craft service table reminds me of MY childhood."" Everyone on the set started genuinely laughing. You could hear people behind the camera breaking. It was one of the most genuinely funny moments I've ever seen on Daytime Talk-Shows."
WWII: Lost Films,Sounds like you're still watching...which is the whole point.
WWII: Lost Films,I like Drew and her show! 🤷
WWII: Lost Films,Daytime TV is garbage. Always has been.
WWII: Lost Films,The View says otherwise
WWII: Lost Films,This is the most innocuous thing to have a negative opinion of 😂
WWII: Lost Films,"I don't care for this show, how are you still watching and know so much about it if you supposedly hate it."
WWII: Lost Films,You just explained why Jimmy Fallon is unwatchable on the tonight show
WWII: Lost Films,Jennifer Hudson’s show is unwatchable. Who green lit that??
WWII: Lost Films,Vs those great daytime talk shows?
WWII: Lost Films,I enjoy it
WWII: Lost Films,You clearly haven’t witnessed the View.
WWII: Lost Films,I want a final season of Santa  Clarita diet. Just to wrap things up!
WWII: Lost Films,Seems like you’re out of touch or just don’t like expressive women.
WWII: Lost Films,“The food at the 7-11 is terrible!!”
WWII: Lost Films,I respect your opinion but don't watch it if you don't like it... I like it
WWII: Lost Films,No way. The View beats this hands down 😂😂😂😂
WWII: Lost Films,"As a dude I dont catch much daytime tv but if I did I would only watch Drew Barrymore. She's happy, genuine and just so fucking wholesome in a way I cant explain. Brilliant!"
WWII: Lost Films,Bring back Santa Clarita Diet.
WWII: Lost Films,I think Jennifer Hudson is worse.
WWII: Lost Films,Better than Ellen
WWII: Lost Films,May I present to you The Kelly Clarkson Show?
WWII: Lost Films,How dare you insult the hilarious ross mathews
WWII: Lost Films,No one will be as terrible as wendy williams
WWII: Lost Films,Why go out of the way to be negative?
WWII: Lost Films,Carnie Wilson would like a word.
WWII: Lost Films,Imagine complaining about daytime tv.
WWII: Lost Films,So many odd comments in here...about the Drew Barrymore Show.
WWII: Lost Films,"My kids were watching that show on Netflix with the two women who run a business putting everything into containers, and one episode covered them doing Drew's prep kitchen. She certainly has a lot of energy, but I chalked it up to a joie de vivre. 

Having an entire episode of that kind of energy is too much for me, but I can see how some others could enjoy it."
WWII: Lost Films,OP so then why do you keep watching the show? You seem to be a casual viewer
WWII: Lost Films,Ricki Lake has entered the chat
WWII: Lost Films,"There’s nothing exceptionally unbearable about Drew’s talk show compared to the view when they are doing an interview or other talk shows like Wendy Williams, they’re all the same level of cringe when you understand people are just there to promote something and put on their persona"
WWII: Lost Films,Ugh day time talk shows are the worst
WWII: Lost Films,The only thing that bothers me is her wardrobe. Such fugly clothes!!!
WWII: Lost Films,"If you like the Drew Barrymore show, wait till you see the Jennifer Hudson show! Jesus, she may be a hugely talented EGOT, but daytime talk show host she is not. It is THE EPITOME OF CRINGE. She overreacts (overacts) and seems completely disingenuous. When she's ""interviewing"" other celebrities or just adults, at that, she'll talk to them excitedly like they're children. She also manages to humble brag throughout the whole episode. Another issue for me is that she'll suddenly talk with the speech pattern of someone from the deep south yet she's from Chicago. I'm not talking shit on Black dialects. It's just wayyyy put on. It makes me embarrassed because it's like she's a caricature of a Black woman.
Like I said, cringe."
WWII: Lost Films,JHud’s show is worse.
WWII: Lost Films,My wife got tickets to a live taping early next year and is making me come along.  Never seen an episode but I can only imagine what I’m in store for
WWII: Lost Films,You're describing every daytime show.
WWII: Lost Films,She seems like a genuine person who tries to find a connection to her guests and segments. Maybe she is a bit awkward but it is sincere and kind. I prefer it to Ellen and Rosie who were not genuinely nice or Oprah and her over the top nature. I think she is improving
WWII: Lost Films,"I like her show, unlike the View, bevy of women yelling, she seems like a hippie, I like hippies"
WWII: Lost Films,You could just not watch it and save us this useless post. People who complain about a tv show and then describe the show are delusional and don’t for one second think just changing the channel might work 🙄
WWII: Lost Films,The SNL skit making fun of her show is hilarious
WWII: Lost Films,"She's perfect for that segment of our population that is disgusted with non-stop Trump, Covid, War, Corruption.  They just want a moment in the day to not feel rage.  Give them some space since obviously her show isn't meant for you."
WWII: Lost Films,"I doubt most of the people here watch any day time television, let alone her show."
WWII: Lost Films,"Don‘t watch it them, edge lord."
WWII: Lost Films,But it's extremely popular
WWII: Lost Films,"If you know this much about the show, I'd say you're a pretty devoted fan."
WWII: Lost Films,Haven't seen The View I take it...
WWII: Lost Films,It's not for you anyway.
WWII: Lost Films,"Whenever ""The Talk"" comes on, I have to change the channel. Between them kissing each others ass, then bending around to kiss their own, I can't stand it."
WWII: Lost Films,I loved Santa Clarita Diet but it got cancelled.
WWII: Lost Films,So a female Jimmy Fallon then?
WWII: Lost Films,Her and Jimmy Fallon starred in a movie together and have now gone on to have the worst daytime and nighttime talk shows at the same time.
WWII: Lost Films,But that's the point of daytime talk shows now... unbearable. Her show accomplishes this.
WWII: Lost Films,Rude!
WWII: Lost Films,Ross is both funny and endearing imo
WWII: Lost Films,"I like Drew! I thinks she is beautiful and talented. Its the outfits that kill me. Like she just closes her eyes and pulls something out of a random thrift donation bag. Her being so pretty, I don’t get it."
WWII: Lost Films,Kelly Clarkson show is sooooo much worse!
WWII: Lost Films,"Honestly, why is daytime television so bad?"
WWII: Lost Films,We get syndication pitches from the worst of the worst shows. I recall seeing Kato Kaelin's judge show and wanting to vomit. We have Drew Barrymore's show running before Jennifer Hudson's POS show. It's even worse than Drew's. You should see some of the pilots of shows that never make production.
WWII: Lost Films,Who is dressing her?  She’s wearing clothes that are more suited for a 75 year old woman visiting the country club.
WWII: Lost Films,"Drew is my vote for 3rd place.   


1st will always be Wendy Williams.  
2nd is Tyra Banks."
WWII: Lost Films,"Well, as long as she doesn't give horrible people a platform like Oprah or is just a horrible person in general like Wendy Williams or Ellen, then whatever."
WWII: Lost Films,[deleted]
WWII: Lost Films,I’m not sure why anyone would think DB would be a good talk show host to begin with.
WWII: Lost Films,"Her show and Kelly Clarkson's show annoy me to no end. Shows that money talks, if you've got it"
WWII: Lost Films,All daytime TV talk shows are cancerous imo
WWII: Lost Films,Jennifer Hudson is the worst!!  She needs to stick to singing.
WWII: Lost Films,Live with Kelly is by far the worst of all of the shows. They're just so insufferable. How can middle america relate to these NY dickheads?? They're terrible.
WWII: Lost Films,The Kelly Clarkson show would like a word..
WWII: Lost Films,"Most of the daytime talk shows are the same product in a different package. Over-caffeinated host, an audience that cheers or gives a standing ovation for everything, and 10-minute conversations with guests who act like they’ve known the host for 40 years. 

I listened to a Kelly Clarkson interview and had to turn it off because the constant chatter and laughing felt like something out of Family Guy."
WWII: Lost Films,I can not stand the new Jennifer Hudson show.
WWII: Lost Films,Wendy Williams would like a word
LEGO: Friends,These things are going to be highly sought after. Might not be bad to pick up more than one.
LEGO: Friends,Something's happening at Cartoon Network that is stomping all over the effort put in post-Ed Edd and Eddy era to revitalize the channel
LEGO: Friends,"oh my God, 10 hours of Johnny Test, the thought of that makes me feel nauseous. It is not possible to make a cartoon that is worse than Johnny Test."
LEGO: Friends,"They could've at the very least put the previously aired Season 8 episodes before the movies. That is, if they didn't want to really honor the show by using this weekend for a big Regular Show highlights marathon. 

Why would they waste a day off from school for already seen, highly advertised, and often rerun episodes of TTG? Didn't they do this over one whole weekend before the Winter Break? They played every single episode for no real reason (no commemoration, celebration, anniversary, nothing). 

I agree, this is really upsetting. No love for the fans, just pandering to money making kids. They messed up big time with Steven Universe recently, and this only shows how incompetent they've become lately. 

Make CN Great Again."
LEGO: Friends,"Some higher up at Cartoon Network probably isn't a fan of the show's adult-friendly themes, and is doing whatever they can to bury it.  I'd imagine something similar is happening with Steven Universe."
LEGO: Friends,that kinda sucks
LEGO: Friends,It's moments like this that make me fear the great animation era is coming to an end.
LEGO: Friends,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hxIi8j3QR0
LEGO: Friends,Question. Would you rather watch a whole day of Johnny test or teen titans go?
LEGO: Friends,"Same thing with adventure time. Once upon a time, both RS and AT aired only on Saturdays."
LEGO: Friends,"goddamn, and that looks like it was an episode where the obnoxious POS title character Johnny Test was asleep the whole time. It is even worse when he is talking XO"
The Fosters,"I totally read this as being ""NCIS: The Fosters"" and was like that's quite the mashup!"
The Fosters,She had a playboy spread about 15 years ago I still think about sometimes
The Fosters,I´ve watched the show at least the first episode and Im really interested. The show actually had some of the cheesiness of The Fosters but seems a lot more grounded to me. 
The Fosters,"I really liked the premiere! I'm a fan of The Fosters, but I was one of the people thinking it didnt really need a spin off. I tuned in anyway & didnt regret it. My mom actually liked it too, & she hated when I used to steal the bigger TV for The Fosters."
The Fosters,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first episode, having never watched The Fosters (nor watching Freeform shows in generally).

My only complaint is that Dustin Ingram is channeling Thomas Middleditch way too hard. "
The Fosters,I watched the first episode it was pretty good. I have never seen the fosters and think I might have missed a good show.
The Fosters,"I really enjoyed The Fosters when it started, but it kinda went off the rails by the end of the series. Some of those story lines were absurd. It's kinda put me off of starting this new series."
The Fosters,"The first season of The Fosters at least is a good watch. If you care about the family, the rest of the seasons are good too."
The Fosters,Oh yeah they were. Like annoyingly off the rail. This one is starting on a good start. And with a focus on ONLY Callie and Mariana the show deals with their work and their home life and it was really well balanced. 
The Fosters,"Cool thanks! I'll give a try, then."
The Fosters,Anyone vaguely interested should give this show a shot. I'm liking it a whole lot right now.
The Fosters,"amongst the many things i love about this show - the 'side' characters are given depth, and some scenes of their own without the main characters.  i'm enjoying getting to know them as much as i'm interested in seeing how the two sisters navigate young adult life in L.A.  "
The Fosters,"interesting comments with some additional time to see how the show develops

i'm not sure they are really being taken seriously, especially given the social agenda of the show.  these are two entirely priviledged individuals that are crumbling into pathetic messes in front of our eyes - saved largely by the fact that they are attractive.  kind of incredible."
The Fosters,I am liking this show way more than I expected to!
The Fosters,Who's your favorite(s) of the side characters?
The Fosters,"> priviledged

Check your privilege.

The Fosters,"malika, even before the sweet *love and basketball* callback scene.  also alice.  but i'm liking davia more lately, too, and the blond guy (dennis?) became so much more interesting after his conversation with steph the other week.  i also enjoyed him and davia connecting and singing together.
  
gael is not only hot but also has some depth.  i actually like the conversations between him and callie.  and i appreciate the tension between him and his sister, so it's not just presented as this rosy perfect relationship.

i enjoy the scenes at the two workplaces, but i'm definitely more invested in the coterie residents.  i also like the idea that there are other ones we can get to know in the future since it's a big space.  i enjoy ensembles.

how about you - who are your favorites?"
The Fosters,"First of all, and even as a straight guy, I can't get over how hot Gael is... But back on topic, it's hard to pick, all the Coterie folk are really well drawn and humanized. Probably Davia? I like how prickly she is. They aren't afraid to make her unlikable, and the actor is playing it wonderfully.

I know the workplace characters aren't the focal points of the show the way the Coterie residents are, but I hope they continue to get fleshed out as well. They're there to be antagonists and drive conflict, and we're revealing some more depth to some of them, but Ben and Alex for instance could use stuff that elevates them from mere villains I think."
The Fosters,*sobs*
The Fosters,"Peter Paige did such a great job with this. When I watched Queer as Folk, he was one of my favorite actors on the show, and seeing him do a show like this was a joy. I look forward to his next project and hope he goes back to acting."
The Fosters,Ugh. Canceled just as it was beginning to get good again. I'm so interested in this spin-off though. I'm sure the family will visit them wherever they end up.
The Fosters,lol I honestly think this was one of the worst tv shows I've ever seen
The Fosters,"They are in talks with other actors and actresses besides the ones that play Mariana and Callie to see if they are willing to jump ship. I hope the new show captures what made the show so special, the relationship between the characters. "
The Fosters,"How is this show? Is it just typical teenage drama stuff, or is it something that an adult can enjoy as well? "
The Fosters,As well as Beyond. I'm halfway through season 1 on that. It's pretty interesting so far.
The Fosters,"Great news, really like this series. Great to see it will get 100 episodes. "
The Fosters,It's about a family with an interacial same sex parents.
The Fosters,"It's emotional and dramatic, but definitely enjoyable. I found it very easy to get sucked into."
The Fosters,"It's a soapy, social-issue family drama that does what it does well. There are some frustrating stories but it frequently pretty watchable."
The Fosters,It's really good. It has more to offer than only the teenage drama stuff. But it is more centered around the teenagers than the adults stuff. So it's not like Parenthood.
The Fosters,"Just read that yeah, just started with that series. I liked the first episode."
The Fosters,"Oh wow this show is such banal PC garbage. Amazing the show whose only 2 qualities are ""I'm an out of control teen trying to get better! Give me a chance!"" and ""We're lesbians! see? Progressive!"" gets another season."
The Fosters,[deleted]
The Fosters,[deleted]
The Fosters,Yeah! That's some good news. After cancelling Chasing Life I had a slight bit of fear that they also would cancel this show. But numbers wise it was well more than save. But still...  I'm happy... 
The Fosters,So happy for this show. It's so good and I also thing it's an incredibly faithful and realistic portrayal of the family (and married) life of LGBT people.
The Fosters,"Ughhhhhhhh why is everyone trying to get on the ""We love gays!"" bandwagon. Its like everyone is trying to out do each other. First its Disney with lesbian mothers. Now its to the point where ABC is like ""LOOK! LOOK! We're so progressive that we have children being gay!"""
The Fosters,Who cares? 
The Fosters,"Hot dam. Child porn goes mainstream.

Thanks Obama!

The Fosters,"Do you want Joe Biden in this thread? Because this is how you get Joe Biden in this thread. Also, Joe wants some thanks too."
The Fosters,Gotta give Biden some credit too.... Come on now. 
The Fosters,"Ho, hey. I'm, I'm sorry."
The Fosters,"Great news! Love the show, enjoying season two so far."
The Fosters,Emmit Otters Jug Band Christmas
The Fosters,"I don’t think will I ever get tired of Community’s Christmas episode “Regional Holiday Music”. It has all the ingredients of perfect for me- musical episode with super catchy songs! Taran Killam! Relentless mocking of Glee! (Which is still funny to me all of these years later somehow)

*I got a Christmas time for me! I got a Christmas time for a tree!*"
The Fosters,Trailer Park Boys
The Fosters,It's between The Office's Xmas 2 parter and Anatomy Park. I also love the South Park Christmas Musical.
The Fosters,"The early Simpsons Christmas episodes are classics. The two that immediately jump out are the first one where they their dog and the one where Bart steals the game. Funzo is great too. 

The Queen of Sheba is an excellent episode of Royle Family. Probably the best of the lot."
The Fosters,"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. We make sure to watch it multiple times every year. 

Second favourite, Mr. Bean’s Christmas"
The Fosters,A Charlie Brown Christmas.
The Fosters,"Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol 1962.,,,fantastic."
The Fosters,"The 1974 classic ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"""
The Fosters,"Father Ted Christmas special, watch it every year and still love it. Also, has Ireland’s biggest lingerie section I understand."
The Fosters,Festivus on Seinfeld for me.
The Fosters,A Muppet Family Christmas. There was a good quality version with the 80s commercials that was on YouTube for 10 years before it got taken down. Now all the ones on their are crap quality. I heard it was uploaded to Archive.org but I haven't watched that version so I don't know what quality it is.
The Fosters,"can't decide between The Office OG Christmas Special or Only Fools and Horses' ""Heroes and Villains"". Maybe OFAH edges it because I was 16 and feel a lot of nostalgia for it"
The Fosters,"The ""Always Sunny"" Christmas episode (originally released on DVD as a one-off) is one of my annual favorites"
The Fosters,The Snowman.
The Fosters,"Legacies. Krampus arrives to town in the middle of October, making everyone think it’s Christmas. Then he and Santa fight to the death."
The Fosters,"Blackadder's Christmas Carol, no question.

\[slow clap\] ""Utter. Crap."""
The Fosters,Pee-Wee's Christmas Special
The Fosters,The Christmas & Hogmanay specials of Still Game.
The Fosters,"Santa Claws, no I didn't misspell that, from Miraculous Ladybug is honestly not that terrible. Kinda cute.

The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special was pretty fun."
The Fosters,The American Dad Christmas special with the second coming of Christ and the apocalypse.
The Fosters,The Best Chrismukkah Ever - The O.C
The Fosters,"John Denver's Rocky Mountain Christmas. One of the many, many Muppet properties out of print.

A Garfield Christmas. I watch it every year and can quote large chunks of it.

A Claymation Christmas. Such a brilliant special, but it never gets re-aired. Thankfully I bought the DVD this year.

If we're talking episodes of shows, then that Christmas episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show when Mary is stuck working alone."
The Fosters,Bernard And The Genie. It was a BBC one-off that has been lost to most of us.
The Fosters,"Minstrel Krampus from American Dad. It has great songs and I learned about Charles Bradley because of it.   
I also like Sunny Christmas because Danny DeVito in a lambo eating cheese doodles out of a designer bag is my ideal image of Christmas."
The Fosters,"The Vicar of Dibley Christmas special where they are to perform a Nativity play. Both hilarious and heartwarming. 

I also liked this year's Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special quite a bit. Also just very fun and lighthearted, and Mantis and Drax are a great comedic duo.

And then there is of course the classic Star Wars Holiday Special. Though the special itself is excruciating to sit through, the Red Letter Media double episode discussion about it has become a classic Holiday Special in itself."
The Fosters,"Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse 

A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All

Blackadder's Christmas Carol

A Muppet Family Christmas"
The Fosters,Year without a Santa Claus. Even as a 50 something I sing along with Heat Miser and Snow Miser.
The Fosters,This is the only answer.
The Fosters,"Oh, Britta's in this...?"
The Fosters,What the hell are Regionals?
The Fosters,The one where he stole the game made me so anxious as a kid. Even now just thinking about it stresses me out!
The Fosters,Mine too!
The Fosters,"Not sure if it's the same broadcast, it was a rerun from 89, but I watched it on archive.org and there were commercials."
The Fosters,"I googled it and [found this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zi68pvazxI&t=1s&ab_channel=Sam%27sDisneyDiary) which seems to be good quality, especially by 80s recording standards."
The Fosters,[for the uninitiated...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSgZpRyzsQ)
The Fosters,Word.
The Fosters,Nothing says Christmas like trimming the Hellraiser.
The Fosters,"Hot in Cleveland has been off-air for 7 years, a different world in TV. 

The short answer to this is they don’t do it anymore because a lot of these shows are a creative embarrassment to parties involved, can be redeveloped down the line, or have contractural strings that make it not worth it for a variety of reasons."
The Fosters,"There is a podcast called the dead pilots society that does table reads for pilots that were bought but never made. 

They bring in a cast of actors and will do multiple scripts as a live show and they interview the writers of the shows later. 

So each episode is the show being performed and an interview about the show and the writer."
The Fosters,"Also that’s not exactly true about The Middle. The spin-off was officially killed in November 2018, a full month after The Conners premiered. So sure the success of The Conners meant they didn’t need The Middle spin-off as much, but it wasn’t tied to the “cancellation” of Roseanne so closely."
The Fosters,[deleted]
The Fosters,"I'd bet out of 10 unsold pilots, 2-3 would gain enough audience reaction for a network/service to think ""Maybe we DO have something here...."""
The Fosters,"I know what you're talking about but I can't recall an example in my lifetime and I'm a 80s kid. Here's a link about [Freeform summer shows](https://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/freeform-summer-2022-premiere-dates/), I've seen a few episodes of ""Good Trouble,"" it's decent if you liked ""The Fosters."""
The Fosters,"I wish the rest of the British parody of ridiculous American sitcoms called ""Heil Honey I'm Home"" would leak online.  Such bad taste."
The Fosters,"CBS Summer Playhouse in the late 80s was this. I remember them showing the TV pilot of “Coming to America.”

NBC also would show stuff they didn’t pick up, like “Turner & Hooch” starring Tom Wilson (Biff from “Back To The Future”).

Wasn’t “Blossom” an example where they did this and then it got picked up to series based on a positive response?"
The Fosters,"It’s probably because when something isn’t picked up by a network, the creators attempt to shop it to streaming services and other networks in an attempt to get picked up.

Networks are also green lighting far fewer traditional sitcoms and pilots - summers are reserved for cheap game shows.

[“This season, the five broadcasters have (so far) ordered only 35 pilots combined — that’s the lowest tally in at least a decade — and down significantly from the pre-pandemic days when 60 was considered a record low.”](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/broadcast-pilot-season-total-volume-low-1235108089/amp/)

Lower performing shows will often get moved to strange summer time slots where they can burn off episodes in order to fulfill contracts without having to mess up the carefully planned fall schedule. So I guess they just don’t see the value in airing failed pilots when they can produce a season if I Can See Your Voice for pennies and sell a crap ton of advertising."
The Fosters,Amazon use to put up pilots but without much viewing interest they didn't get picked up. There was one about a priest at a space colony that was pretty interesting that I wished got some more episodes.
The Fosters,I honestly wish streaming did this. Maybe like a vote every month for which pilot should become a show or if a show gets renewed. It’d probably have to be an elimination thing. If not then it would all be approved.
The Fosters,"This may scratch that itch:

The Fosters,"Recently seen some Middle and Sue Heck character completely carries the whole show. That lady is extremely funny, I hope we see more of her doing something"
The Fosters,"I believe historically, they stopped doing this because they kept getting letters from people begging them to change their minds and pick the shows up when the actors had already been released and there was no chance. Hard to imagine this effect wouldn't be waaay worse with the internet.

BTW, Seinfeld was one of these pilots and after higher than expected ratings and some exec seeing promise, NBC picked it up - the rest of season 1, only 4 more episodes, aired almost a full year later."
The Fosters,"- It's probably not free for them to air it and might not be worth the time. Like they could be airing reruns of some popular sitcom instead.
- For Netflix, they don't do pilots at all and they probably won't want to code new systems and UI for showign pilots of other failed shows from other companies. It's not free, can add confusion, and might not bring enough valkue.
- There's probably less pilots than ever, straight to series seems to be more popular than ever."
The Fosters,"Well, it is on YouTube I have seen many unsold pilots, so they do exist somewhere. I never understand how posters get their hands on them, but collectors are devilish!"
The Fosters,How can that result in anything but disappointment for the 1-2 people that really get intrigued by it?
The Fosters,"Youtube has tons of them but it may take a year or two to get there.  There's a lot of weird podcasts where they review unsold pilots, some are crazy."
The Fosters,">One of my favorite former ABC single camera comedies did film a pilot for a spin-off about the middle daughter Sue Heck, and they did originally green light it for a full series

Only a pilot was ordered, a full series was never green lit."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Can’t wait for Baby Gollum.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,And that type of mindset is why all of it won't be as high of quality as it could be.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,I’m so fucking tired of these creatively bankrupt industry ghouls cannibalizing everything they get their hands on. Nothing is sacred to them.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Don’t you fucking dare.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"would be a bitter irony if Tolkien's works get turned into a soulless parade of assembly line ""content""

there's nothing sacred to these hacks"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Of course it could be as big, but should it?"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,God I'm so bored of franchises.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,">‘The Lord Of The Rings’ IP Broker Says Franchise Can Be As Big As Marvel & ‘Star Wars’,

for my pocketbook"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,But the real question is do people want it…
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"The year is 2122. Only three genres of film are still produced. Medieval Wizards, New York Wizards, and Space Wizards"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"This is one of those rare exceptions were I'd say ""*blank* is rolling in their grave"" and really truly mean it. Tolkien crafted his world with such love and care, and was fiercely protective of it. He absolutely would not approve of what they're doing with his work, and on top of that, would probably be very upset by it. 

A soulless corporation and a team of underqualified showrunners are standing on the shoulders of a genius, and perverting his work. It's gross. There are just some things you don't touch. Nothing is sacred to these people. The words ""just leave it alone"" ring hollow to them."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Everything doesn't have to be a ""franchise.""  The funniest thing to me was when the Firestarter director tried to create a franchise.  

In any event, the way this theoretically works is if you focus on low budget high margin.  How about a rom com/dramedy set in Hobbiton.  A Cheers style mini-series at the Prancing Pony. 

Franchise IP owners tend to make everything such high stakes and high budget, but that's not really necessary."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,That’s what Morgoth would do.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"I'm not a gamer and haven't owned a current system since the PS3 was a thing, but wouldn't a property like LOTR be better suited to creating a more interactive experience? I just feel like the world building for Middle Earth would be much better suited for that medium than movies or a series."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,For fuck sake do we have to run everything into the ground? You would think this a golden age to be a nerd but i am so fucking sick of it
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Please... for the love of god just make new IPs
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"This is where “if it looks like trash, don’t watch it and/or ignore it” comes into play. None of the garbage Jaws sequels ruins the original for me and the same can be said for many other sequels out there. 

The movie industry is all in on franchises right now. The only way they deviate away from it is if people stop seeing that shit. Marvel starts to suck? Don’t pay for it. Same with rings, Star Wars, and so on and so forth.

Also, find a way to bring back the mid-budget action/drama/etc movies! Streaming tore into dvd sales which really helped those get approved."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,So LOTR is gonna turn into a bloated reanimated corpse like Marvel and Star Wars.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Too bad It will also become shit like Star Wars and Star Trek
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Important to note that this has nothing to do with the Amazon show. Embracer bought Middle Earth Enterprises which encompases rights that Tolkien sold in the 70's.

Amazon worked directly with the Estate on a new set of rights that is outside of this.

This has more to do with The Jackson films, The upcoming Anime ""War of the Rohirim"", Video Games, theme parks, & merchandise."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Didn’t it come out that this was Netflix’s pitch? A Gandalf series, a Elrond series, a legolas series, etc? giving each character a movie/tv show? And even though Netflix’s bid was the highest, the Tolkien estate hated the idea so much they rejected it outright"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"LOTR: A new Ring, LOTR: Mordoor Strikes Back, LOTR: Return of the Hobbit, LOTR: The Ring Awakens, LOTR: The Last Hobbit, LOTR: Rise of Baggins..."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"I always wondered if users like OP /u/VarkingRunesong works for Amazon.

The amount of promotion and work they do online for certain shows exceeds even the wildest superfans I've seen."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"I’m gonna be honest. I didn’t really mind Star Wars and Marvel becoming how they did because the owners and creators of those IP’s seemed to WANT it to go in that direction. 

George Lucas knowingly allowed what happened to Star Wars. Marvel was ALWAYS going to be what it is now. 

But Tolkien wouldn’t want that. I don’t think he would want 15 shows and 20 more movies and blah blah blah. He didn’t seem like that kind of person."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Boy they are in panic mode
The Moon Embracing the Sun,not when you completely walled them off from using anything from the First Age
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"In the word of Red Letter Media, ""ENDLESS TRASH"""
The Moon Embracing the Sun,I don’t want Lord of the Rings to be “bigger” than it already is.  It’s one of the most influential novels of the 20th century and one of the most well received film series of all time - I don’t need *anything* else!
The Moon Embracing the Sun,They are going to butcher this in ways we can not yet imagine.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,“We will find a way to ruin this IP as we ruined Star Wars… and that is a good thing!”
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"another cow to milk dry. I pity the 80s and 90s generation, watching all they loved getting slowly assassinated"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,For the love of Eru Ilúvatar can these fucking corporate cunts please just fuck of and rape some other IP’s corpse.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"AKA let's ruin an amazing universe to make trillions.

F these guys..."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"I was thinking about this with Star Wars and Andor not doing well despite arguably being one of Star Wars best works in years. Are these worlds really strong enough for this much content? In books and comics where people who really want to find them can get to them sure, but is the world of LOTR and Star Wars so deep it can support a little industry of media around it and only it. Books and comics are cheaper to produce so Star War's expanded universe thrived with a hardcore smaller group of fans but can that keep up when you're producing multiple shows and you need everyone to tune in like it's the next big event? Everyone wants to be Marvel but Marvel is also unraveling a bit now that shows are added to the mix, but at least they have the benefit of very different stories to tell (She-hulk vs Loki). With LOTR you're always kind of stuck with the same kind of fantasy. You can't move into space or magic, or military espionage like Marvel can. People seem to barely be tuning into a single one season show. Can it really obtain Star Wars and Marvel levels of expanded universe when both of those are already straining under their weight?"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Still wild that Rings Of Power is just based on notes and scraps of LOTR lore…
The Moon Embracing the Sun,NO! NO GOD PLEASE NO! NOOOOOOOOOO!
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Inb4 *The Silmarillion* gets retconned.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Tolkienburgers for everyone guys. are you ready?
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Oh no ... another toothpick.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Oh no :(
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Fuck!
The Moon Embracing the Sun,The idea of a LOTR conematic universe hurts my soul
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Make it stop.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Rings of Power swiftly put an end to that theory.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,If they do to lotr what theve done to SW and Comic books.then LOTR will be just as dead to me like the others.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,I want a different spin on LOTR. Peter Jackson basically set a precedent for what it has to be like. Was very exited for Del Toro version of the Hobbit.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Wow great. Isn’t this exactly what Tolkien didn’t want to happen? Now his world is about to get fucking ravaged thanks to greed.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Can't even deliver a passable TV show and they're already frothing at the mouth for spinoffs and all that shit.

At least in 10 years time when LotR is exhausted and left in shambles after being Marvel'd/whored out for commercialism, we'll still have the original films to enjoy."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Fuck me that would be so sad
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Can be with good writers. It’s just night and day between the lord of the rings vs house of the dragon in terms of writing. 

Amazon finally did figure out how to do good visuals which is good. 

They just need to work on hiring better writers because they are terrible at pacing."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Not with shows like ROP.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Where do they get this fucking info lol
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Smaug: Tales from the Dragon's Lair
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"This has nothing to do with Amazon or Rings of Power or television, in fact. It's more about the game and movie rights that the Embracer Group has. Why was this posted here again? Everyone can pack up their pitchforks... (or at least aim it elsewhere)."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Not one, not two, not three, not four, but over a hundred movies can be made in the LOTR universe. This isn’t coming from me, a certified film buff said so, and I believe him."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Another franchise joins the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and Harry Potter into going creatively bankrupt. I predict the same to happen to GoT next the way shit’s going."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Yay, more franchises!"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Just don’t sell it to Disney ffs.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"No it can’t not in that way ….

The $ and time should go to different fantasy franchises which there r tons .. let’s give Brandon Sanderson a spin at the wheel of this"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Hell yeah! Good shit!
The Moon Embracing the Sun,If it’s done right yeah
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"SW is not big anymore. 
LOTR It’s not a ‘franchise’ but they’ll try and franchise it. Tolkien is dead. Everything you franchise would be pure made up stuff and we all know the LOTR fans are numerous and very fond of that universe. They will never buy it"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"""We paid a stupid amount of money to make this, so you have to fucking like it"""
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Oh yay now this franchise can be ruined too!
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Has Hollywood ever thought maybe marvel is the only franchise that should be marvel
The Moon Embracing the Sun,It was a bit shit though
The Moon Embracing the Sun,No thanks. I got bored of trying to keep up with all the Marvel stuff. Don't go the way of having to release a new movie or TV show every other month.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Will it be as sucky
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Ring Wars Trek Part IX: The Shire Fights Back
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"There is just not enough story there to hold that kind of interest. It wasn’t written like a comic it was written like a history. The further you stray from the popular story’s main characters the more you risk losing interest. Unless the storytelling is fire, there’s no way this will work"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Not every successful ip needs to be pumping something of varying quality more then once a year to be considered good
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Please, no.

Marvel and Star Wars are a never ending train of mediocrity."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.”"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Can be milked to death\*
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Dude Hollywood needs new blood, even if the source material is good (and played out), it gets ruined in the execution."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*deep breath*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Lord of the Rings isn’t marvel. It isn’t Star Wars. It’s it’s own unique and beloved thing. It can’t be processed and packaged like those things.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Ring balls 2: The search for more money
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Yeah I'm done
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Tolkien’s son even had some issues with Peter Jackson’s adaptation, I can’t imagine what Tolkien would think of some of the things in the pipeline"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"I'd be ok with it being bigger but just a bit. Honestly, Marvel and SW went too big and I got fatigued and burnt out on both after a while."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,It won’t
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Oh wow, I’m starting to reach that age where everything I loved is being destroyed for money. Is this what Star Trek fans felt?"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Tolkien deserves so much better.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"For fuck’s sake, can’t we just let stories end?!

LOTR has a beginning, middle, and end. There’s a reason Tolkein’s sequel plans were never published. We’ve had the whole story, the end! (A proper adaption of the first and second ages COULD be cool if done right, but Rings Of Power showed us how that goes in that hands of modern Hollywood)

Same goes for Star Wars, Lucas’s story had a beginning, middle, and end which is why the Disney stuff feels so awkward and forced 

Just make new stories, even Marvel’s been stretched too thin lately just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. ENOUGH"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Considering how the current MCU is pretty garbage I wouldn't be so quick to say your IP will be like the MCU. Disney is spamming MCU and Star Wars properties.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"“Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.”
-Christopher Tolkien"
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Suddenly I start to understand why Christopher Tolkein never let anyone have the rights.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,JRR Tolkien would be horrified to know this had happened to his IP.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"For that, it should be good first. Tolkien is spinning in his grave right now."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Please God no.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"Imagine the hubris of these cunts, looking at the prototype for all fantasy and thinking ‘this thing has potential’."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Not with RoP being this shit lmfao.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"No, not everything needs a cinematic universe. Marvel and DC comics can do it because the comics served as a template for many many years before the movies were a thing... And Warner Brothers still can't get the DCU right."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,damn so Hunger games and Harry Potter should be TV shows too now huh? Then Junnie B Jones and Captain underpants can have their extended series runs. Woah cinematic universes everwyhere.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,They are going to milk every frnachise to the point of overdose
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Any particular reason this was posted here?  Seems out of place since it talks about movie and gaming rights and of course does not include TV rights since Amazon has those.
The Moon Embracing the Sun,"lmao every fear I had about this shit show is coming true. 

Consume your LOTR slop and get excited for more slop."
The Moon Embracing the Sun,Fuck off you greedy gremlin
The Moon Embracing the Sun,God damn can they just please stop fucking with everything?
Angel Eyes,"Not sure if John Dutton is a villain. He is a ruthless man to his broadly categorized enemies, but he doesn't take land or cattle at the expense of others. That final point is what really exemplifies Western villains.

Beth and Rip definitely qualify on all the villainous points.

Also, 1883 is a better show so far."
Angel Eyes,"I agree that they're villains, but I think my issue with the show is that I get the feeling the people who make it don't look at them that way. They don't deserve a happy ending, but I suspect that they'll get one."
Angel Eyes,"I don't think you are wrong in how you describe them, but they aren't really ""villains"", they are conservative hero-fantasies. 

The antagonists of the first season are Native Americans taking advantage of reservation laws to steal hundred of thousands in livestock value and a liberal California billionaire elite trying to attack their way of living. Monica is a woke shrew constantly shrieking about how bad white people are while also being the conflict points separating Kayce from the rest of his family. Jamie, who was sent from the family to one of those damn liberal brainwashing facilities (Harvard) comes back as a giant pussy who the show absolutely loves shitting on. 

I enjoy the show for how ridiculous it is, but the people who enjoy these characters DO NOT see them as villains."
Angel Eyes,He is not that rich though
Angel Eyes,"He may not take land or cattle, but he definitely takes lives."
Angel Eyes,"I agree. Dutton is ruthless, but he is also a good and kind man with strong principals, and those principles lead to bad ideas like the branding. But ultimately, he is a man who is trying to hold on to what his family has built while everyone around him tries to take it. That alone makes him a villain on communist Reddit.

As for 1883, I started that before I had ever seen an episode of Yellowstone, and knew nothing about it. I also know that a country singer named Tim McGraw exists, and I knew he was married to Faith Hill but had no idea he acted, or that he was in the show. And after the first episode I had to look up this badass cowboy to see what else he had done and why I didn't recognize him. I can't say 1883 is better, or that I like it more, but I like it. But honestly, each episode is kinda just more of the same. I'mma need them to speed this journey up if each episode is just going to be river-cattle-more dead germans-kick thief our of camp-""THIS TRIP IS GOING TO GET HARDER BEFORE IT GETS EASIER!!!""

Edit: I just want to add that today's eps of 1883 kicked everything I said above in the teeth. Great episode."
Angel Eyes,Be stunned if Jamie gets a happy ending. In fact he probably needs to be written off next season.
Angel Eyes,[deleted]
Angel Eyes,">they're villains, but (...) the people who make it don't look at them that way

Isn't that modern TV in a nutshell?"
Angel Eyes,"I get what you're saying, but I don't see much difference between the way they're portrayed and other classic tv villain protagonists (like the aforementioned Walter White and Tony Soprano). Because they're the protagonist we're kind of on their side, we're compelled to root for them (it helps when their opponents are also clearly villanous), but that doesn't mean the writers think they're good people or that they'll get a happy ending.

But then again, the way Kayce and Nate humanize them does push in that direction in some ways."
Angel Eyes,"Banshee was one of my favorite shows. I revelled in how ridiculous it was. My super conservative friend hated it because it was ""so ridiculous it didn't make any sense"". Fast forward a few years and he convinces me to watch Yellowstone, and I love it, but my friend flipped out when I said that it's funny he likes it because it is just as ridiculous as Banshee. He went on a tirade about how it's mot at all ridiculous, and yes, I'm certain he is just living out his hyper conservative cowboy fantasies.

He's even mentioned that he ""has to fast forward through some parts because they are too woke"", and I can only assume those are parts where native americans just want to exist? I really don't know."
Angel Eyes,Certainly but haven't all those people had it coming?  They were either trying to steal from him or harm others?  I don't recall him causing harm on those who didn't deserve it.
Angel Eyes,"Yeah, I find 1883 is already starting to cover the same ground (thieves getting caught and kicked out of the caravan) but it's still fun to watch and Sam Elliot is doing fantastic work as always.  It's really impressive that he's almost eighty years old and can still cast such a presence.  I look forward to seeing the new episode after you mentioned how great it was."
Angel Eyes,"I was disappointed that they all survived the coordinated attack on them that ended Season 3 going into 4.  Sometimes, the only way to move forward and make the show exciting is to sacrifice one or more characters, and I guess they're afraid to do that."
Angel Eyes,"The two examples used, Tony and Walt, got what's coming to them. I'm blanking on other examples to be honest.. Got any?"
Angel Eyes,Is it?
Angel Eyes,"> He's even mentioned that he ""has to fast forward through some parts because they are too woke"", and I can only assume those are parts where native americans just want to exist?

He is most likely talking about Monica and, to be fair, she is absolutely written to be as uncompromisingly, unreasonably ""woke"" as possible so that conservatives can ignore the already questionable points she is trying to make. There is no chance that the writers wrote the angry wife character trying to stand between the prodigal son and his family while simultaneously hating everything they have as a sympathetic character."
Angel Eyes,Why are you friends with a dude who fast forwards through a western show because its 'too woke?'
Angel Eyes,"Beth and Rip are villains in service to John Dutton. Saying he isn’t a villain is like saying that Tony Soprano isn’t a criminal because, mostly, it’s other people who do crime."
Angel Eyes,"I feel like the show glosses over the real bad things that John does though. SPOILERS UP THROUGH SEASON 3.2 because that's the last episode I saw lol.

Jenkins did not really deserve to die, which I am 100% convinced was what happened at the end of season 1 that they later retconned once the show got renewed. The bully ranch hand who mysteriously ""saw too much"" is debatable as well. The rich brothers in season 2 deserved to at the end, but that's only because the show did a really weird slide from them being powerful/rich politician billionaires into being white supremacist-supporting, willing to kidnap and murder thugs.

Outside of killings though, John is still a pretty bad guy. He is emotionally abusive to his children, shown constantly with Jamie (who he doesn't even love for some reason) and even with Beth when she is wailing in the house drunk but he ignores because he needs her to be the evil bitch she is. Also, the branding thing is pretty crazy, how many people watching this show do you think are against stereotypical gangs while cheering on this actual gang? Not to mention the mark is kind of described as a second chance for criminals who would otherwise have no place in society, but it makes absolutely no sense that Rip would have been in trouble for what he did."
Angel Eyes,How about one of the employees that was not branded?
Angel Eyes,Vic Mackey on The Shield.
Angel Eyes,Why would you use that as a metric of who to be friends with? That's weird.
Angel Eyes,Beth and Rip are working for John who has taken the justice in his own hands.
Angel Eyes,"Oh yeah, he got away for sure good point. The rest not so lucky but the main culprit did. Another great show lol"
Angel Eyes,"Felicity in Arrow. That said, my feelings on that changed. After season 2, I no longer liked Arrow."
Angel Eyes,Kai Wynn - Deep Space 9
Angel Eyes,Bob in Schitt's Creek.
Angel Eyes,Andy Bernard- The office
Angel Eyes,willow pays off in the end with Dark Willow
Angel Eyes,I loved scandal when it started but I kept watching even after I realized that I hated pretty much every damn character on the show except David Rosen. They were just horrible people and the secret romance that was supposed to have me swooning was responsible for pretty much every bad thing that happened to the characters.
Angel Eyes,Connor from Angel is by far the worst
Angel Eyes,Roland Schitt in Schitt's Creek and Gina Linetti in Brooklyn Nine-Nine

Angel Eyes,AJ Soprano
Angel Eyes,All the adults in The 100 except Sinclair
Angel Eyes,"Gregory in both The Walking Dead show and comics. Granted, he's a sleazy politician type of person that you're supposed to hate.

Negan is probably the most obvious character, but, in the comics, he's at least endearing because of how absurd his personality is and how ridiculous his justifications are - almost like The Joker, really. In the show, I like his portrayal by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, but I think the writers/showrunners screwed up his character arc.

They went a little too far in making Negan overbearingly evil in Season 7 (he kills >!Glenn and Spencer!< in the same way as the comics, but Comic Negan still has an, albeit messed up, sense of morality whereas Show Negan is harsh for the sake of being harsh), got him mostly right in Season 8, and then dialed him way too far back into being a reformed good guy starting with Season 9 as if the writers realized ""oh crap! He's supposed to have a redemption arc!"" and overcorrected his character. Comic Negan has a redemption arc too, but he never becomes ""good.""

Instead, in the comics (massive comic spoilers), >!it's just that Negan makes a deal with Alexandria that if he helps fight The Whisperers then they'll exile him instead of keeping him prisoner. Both sides honor the deal, Negan confesses that Rick's ways of doing things were better than his (something that never happens in the show because Show Negan always makes excuses for himself), and Negan goes into exile and leaves the story (Negan is completely out of the picture by the time The Commonwealth arc happens and only makes a brief appearance in the final timeskip issue with no dialogue). He spends the rest of his life mourning over Lucille and is alone with the guilt of his actions weighing over him, and he's eventually forgotten many years later by everyone except Carl while the rest of the world is rebuilding civilization without him.!<"
Angel Eyes,Danny Stevens on For All Mankind suuuuuuucks.
Angel Eyes,"Xander gets on my nerves because of Once more with feeling,  people are dying and he still doesn’t fess up to what he did and shows no remorse afterwards"

Angel Eyes,Mineta from my hero
Angel Eyes,"Billy Walsh in Entourage
Darlene in Ozark"
Angel Eyes,I absolutely hated Monica Reyes on the X Files.
Angel Eyes,That 70s show - Randy played by Josh Meyer to fill in on the sudden  exit of Eric. Josh is a great actor. Have watched his skits on Madtv but the character was insufferable.
Angel Eyes,"Connor, from Angel."
Angel Eyes,Dr. Pulaski in *ST: TNG*.
Angel Eyes,"Billy, Stranger Things."
Angel Eyes,Theo from You
Angel Eyes,"It's a newer show, but Kash in Extraordinary."
Angel Eyes,Xander and Willow are \*so\* freaking whiny.
Angel Eyes,Chibi-Usa/Rini from Sailor Moon. She drove me nuts in the original show.
Angel Eyes,Julie in friday night lights
Angel Eyes,"Scotty Valens from Cold Case. 

He's a smug prick who is always doing unethical stuff in the name of ""justice"" but never faces any major consequences for it. There's one episode where he gets suspended for 30 days, but it doesn't affect him at all because his boss serves the suspension to protect his record. 

He also gets caught up in a ton of personal drama, especially in the later seasons. Other characters have personal drama too, but Scotty's drama seems to drag on for ages which eats up time that the show could spend focusing on the actual murder investigations."
Angel Eyes,"Dawson on Dawson’s Creek. 

Carrie in SATC."
Angel Eyes,Gale in bobs burgers
Angel Eyes,"So good to see people are actually understanding the show as the way it was meant to be watched.

It’s laughable to see people say that Buffy season 5 is a good FINAL season. You can actually see all the terrible decisions Willow and Xander are going to make in the next season, unless you are completely blind.

Why that is? Because they were written that way. Because season 5 was NOT written as a final season and characters enter arcs that are unfinished until season 6 or 7.

But yeah, I agree with the annoyance Xander brings to me. Not so much with Willow because they actually dare to touch how selfish she is and that is entertaining. Xanders problems are never fully addressed."
Angel Eyes,"Amy Schumer in Only Murders in the Building. I had to check IMDB to check how many episodes she was in, and I was so glad that she was only in one more after the one I just watched."
Angel Eyes,"I hated the scenes where buffy had to apologise for hiding angel, but willow and xander get away with a lot worse."
Angel Eyes,"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Can’t stand Sabrina but love everything else about the show!

(But love Sabrina in the old Sabrina the Teenage Witch)"
Angel Eyes,"Dexter Morgan’s sister, Deb."
Angel Eyes,"Gina in Brooklyn 99.

Yet somehow the show really feels like it's missing something ever since she left. Go figure."
Angel Eyes,Paige on The Americans
Angel Eyes,"Kris on Becker. Terrible chemistry with John, and she just lacked the charm of Reggie.

Pacey on Dawson's Creek, after he got with Joey. He just got so self absorbed and jealous of her accomplishments. And his sense of humor just suddenly evaporated. Maybe he got better later, I stopped watching after the sesaon they got together."
Angel Eyes,Herc on The Wire. Vanessa on Gossip Girl. I like her but almost everyone hates Beth on Yellowstone. I'm not a fan of Monica but don't hate her.
Angel Eyes,Lana Lang - Smallville
Angel Eyes,"Sara on CSI

Joey on Friends"
Angel Eyes,I am also watching Buffy/Angel with the kids and we all hate Riley (just gone) and Tara for being the most boring characters.  I don't understand how Tara is people's favourite character.

Angel Eyes,Todd in Breaking Bad
Angel Eyes,Roland; Schitt’s Creek
Angel Eyes,"Amy Juergens- Secret Life of the American Teenager

Not sure how I feel about the show now but I loved it when it was airing. That said, I could never stand this character as all she did was be endlessly moody.


Erin Silver- 90210

My dislike for her started when they paired her up with Navid and she got worse, not better. Wasn't even sad about her cliffhanger ending."
Angel Eyes,I don't hate him but... shut up Wesley!
Angel Eyes,Joffrey and Ramsey
Angel Eyes,"June from Handmade tale. 
She’s annoying. Can’t stand her character. 
For the record I hated the girl that plays her in mad men too."
Angel Eyes,Tarik from Power
Angel Eyes,I think I ended up hating every character on Buffy during S6 lol.  I'd been watching it as it aired since S2 and I just about dropped it during that one. The writers just decided to make the show about everyone having personal problems and self made drama over stuff like monsters
Angel Eyes,Tanya in The White Lotus
Angel Eyes,Janice Soprano.
Angel Eyes,Arya Stark in GOT
Angel Eyes,"Game of Thrones, Sansa Stark. Her character grew extremely annoying and entitled."
Angel Eyes,Debbie in Shameless. I couldn't finish the show because she was so insufferable. Same thing with Dan Scott on One Tree Hill. Ray Pruitt on 90210 for being an abusive asshole.
Angel Eyes,"Joxtar on Xena, Warrior Princess"
Angel Eyes,Rachel in Friends
Angel Eyes,I think it would be Quinn from Dexter for me; everything about his character rubs me the wrong way from beginning to end.
Angel Eyes,"I absolutely adore new girl, but every time I rewatch it, Jess gets more and more annoying. Like the show wouldn’t be the same without her, but she is by far the weakest character in the show"
Angel Eyes,Gina from B99. Unfunny and annoying personality
Angel Eyes,Jay Landsman on The Wire
Angel Eyes,"I love Fringe and I'm rewatching now after years and I am really having a hard time with Peter Bishop, he's such a smug ass. I'm hoping he gets less annoying because otherwise this show totally holds up."
Angel Eyes,"Abby on ER. I don’t understand why so many fans gush over her and talk about how amazing she is. She’s selfish and treats almost everyone around her like crap, and I don’t think she deserved the happy ending she got in the last season. She was fine as Carol’s OB nurse and when she was first introduced as a medical student but then they made her completely miserable and bratty. I also felt like she was elevated above the rest of the cast and seen as more special and attractive than the other characters, especially in the later years. It felt like ER wasn’t an ensemble drama anymore; it was basically all about Abby all the time.

I just don’t understand all the praise she gets because she’s “flawed” and the insistence that she be liked and felt sorry for. Everyone has flaws, but Abby’s flaws hurt others more often than not, and no I don’t find it interesting to watch. It’s super draining and about ruined the show. Plus sometimes in real life…you just don’t like some people you meet and I think that’s OK. That’s how I feel about her. She just rubs me the wrong way overall and I don’t care how “complex” and “interesting” she is."
Angel Eyes,I couldn't stand Janice or Lidia Soprano. All they did was whine and drive Tony mad. No wonder he had to see a shrink.
Angel Eyes,"Yeah, Buffy. I really don't like Buffy, the character. Buffy, the show, is one of my favourite shows. But I think that makes it special. You relate to the other characters, these characters love the main character, and that's why it works. I'm convinced that's by design. Many other shows use this device, the lead is unlikeable but the side characters make the viewer care, and it's effective.

It's a bit like life. Your friends aren't always particular nice people, not even particular interesting. But they're your friends and you love them."
Angel Eyes, Chloe in Lucifer. The acting.
Angel Eyes,"tbf it's sort of the point that you're supposed to hate most characters from the Sopranos, but paulie was pushing it for me. i fucking hate paulie. wormy cocksucka.

also, loved the handmaids tale, but started to dislike june more and more"
Angel Eyes,Phoebe/Friends
Angel Eyes,Walter White
Angel Eyes,Daphne is pretty unfunny on frasier
Angel Eyes,"Jeff Winger. 

I feel like as the show goes on they try to frame him as being more sympathetic but idk to me he’s just a total douchebag the whole way through. I mean sure, he’s somewhat nice to his friends when it counts, but is that really enough?"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I thought this was interesting because it's not just about Star Trek, but it's also kind of about the industry as it was in the early 2000s and what it took to make a 26-episode season of TV."
Star Trek: Enterprise,I thought Jolene was going to do more. She really had chops. In a former job I saw an audition she did for a film that didn’t come together at the time. It was pretty remarkable.

Star Trek: Enterprise,"This was my favorite series after the original 60s series. I feel it never gets the respect it deserves. It was a bit slow for the first two seasons, but really picked up in season 3 and 4, and then that horrible horrible season 4 finale happened. Guess it was a bit of a foreshadow of things to come with the Picard show."
Star Trek: Enterprise,I enjoyed it. Glad to see they also touched on how her relationship never went anywhere with Trip. Her and Scott really did carry the show alot.
Star Trek: Enterprise,This was great thanks.
Star Trek: Enterprise,She married someone super rich and basically retired from acting.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"she was also pretty good on SG1 but she never broke out of B-series Scifi. i guess she didnt want to end up like Denise Crosby, she was also quite talented but ended up doing crappy B movies."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"It's great. they don't just talk about trek episodes. they interview other actors, etc and learn about their roots. Highly recommend."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Oh yeah, you know that Jolene Blalock can't stand Rick Berman."
Star Trek: Enterprise,yeah Braga would've had a different view of Berman if Braga was a woman.
Star Trek: Enterprise,[removed]
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Her husband owns Ticketmaster.

Blalock herself does a lot of charity work."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"A lot of people cant stand Rick Berman,
And from what i´ve heard, its well justified."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Phlox was a great character, thanks to this actor."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"**Tone of 'Enterprise'**

* **Trekmovie**: Star Trek shows often work in what’s happening today. Had Enterprise come out at a different time instead of around 9/11, do you think the tone of the show, and especially those later seasons, would have been different?


* **John Billingsley**: Yeah.  One thing that happened is, **Manny Coto was brought on, who subsequently went on to write for 24. And he wrote some of my very favorite episodes. But Manny, who I’ve worked with on a number of occasions, has a different sensibility, certainly, than I do, and I think probably a somewhat different sensibility than some of the Star Trek creators**. So some of the third season was, in my opinion, given the nature of what happened on 9/11, leaning towards a philosophy that didn’t strike me necessarily as the Star Trek philosophy. And I say this with all due respect and deference to Manny; again, I think he wrote some of the best shows we did.

* **John Billingsley**: There was an episode **[“Anomaly”] in which the question of whether or not it was legitimate for our captain to throw somebody into space because they weren’t coughing up the goods—it was presented as a moral dilemma fair, but it was very much the same moral dilemma that kind of undercut 24**. And it was very much in our consciousness at the time, do the ends justify the means? Is it okay to waterboard somebody? Candidly, as a leftist, I was uncomfortable by aspects of season 3. And I say that with all due respect for Manny’s enormous talents.


**UPN & viewership** 

* **Trekmovie**: You mentioned UPN, which Scott Bakula has been critical of; do you agree with him that the show would have lasted longer or been better had it been somewhere else?


* **John Billingsley**: Undeniable. But the thing is, **UPN was a dying network. You can look at it from two vantage points: Yes, we probably would have been better in the pre-syndicated universe, which is what the other shows were. But syndication was, as a concept, beginning to fade away.** So I don’t know if that was going to be a feasibility. And if UPN could have interested other writers and producers to pitch shows, then they might have been able to get rid of us. They couldn’t get rid of us, they didn’t have anything else … the network was schizophrenic. It didn’t have the support of CBS. I don’t even think it’s a question of blame to go around, the world of television was beginning to change in that era. And we were one of those shows that was on that cusp.

* **John Billingsley**: Dominic [Keating] and I **went to convention in San Antonio, early on. The show had been going on for six months, maybe. And nobody was there, and it turned out that San Antonio is one of the affiliate stations that was not airing Star Trek on Friday nights**, because that’s high school football night. UPN didn’t even have the power to command their affiliate stations to air the product. That’s how weak UPN was.

* **Trekmovie**: And there was nowhere else to get it, it wasn’t like you could wait for it to show up on Hulu the next day.

* **John Billingsley**: That’s some of it. I don’t think any of this addresses **the fact that for the premiere episode, we got, I think, like 10 million. In the second episode, we got 2 million. So people didn’t, on some level, dig it. Whether it was Star Trek fatigue, whether or not people were wanting something that was unique, or whether they felt that we were actually kind of off the reservation too much, I don’t know.** But I think the writing on one level was on the wall. **The fact that we went four seasons, to me is the miracle.** It’s not that I was ashamed we didn’t go seven… I liked the character a lot, don’t get me wrong. And I really liked the other actors and appreciated my time on the show. But yeah, rubber headwear… I don’t know that I’d want to do it again.

**Enterprise revival?**
 

* **Trekmovie**: There are fans who think that the new area of streaming could find a way to bring back Enterprise in some way. Do you see a way that that could happen?


* **John Billingsley**:   **No. Not without radical—I mean, I mean, okay, first solve Trip is dead. Two, the actress who played T’Pol is not coming back to television. She has three children, she’s retired. And Scott [Bakula], I don’t see doing it. Scott’s got another show on now**. So just start there. But beyond that, **I think you have to have somebody who’s burning to tell the stories and that’s the [Mike] McMahans or whoever.** I hear the fans are interested, but you don’t get that to happen without somebody like an Alex Kurtzman saying “I love Enterprise and I want it to continue.” And I don’t see that person emerging."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"He's really tired. Mostly because he carried that show the whole way.

Don't get me wrong because I loved Enterprise, but he was definitely the most charismatic character on the show."
Star Trek: Enterprise,John’s great. Always found it wild he got that Denzel movie in the middle of Enterprise’s run
Star Trek: Enterprise,">One of the things about Enterprise that was challenging for me as a viewer was that it did feel retro in terms of women

It was, now that I think about it. Especially with the decontamination chamber gel rubdown scenes.

And that weird episode where T'Pol gets infected by Vulcan Aids. 

I did like Phlox's character, the episode where he's alone on the ship was really good.
None of the other characters seemed very memorable, compared to DS9 or even Voyager they were quite bland."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Yeah, I think that Trip & Phlox were the best characters on ENT."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Especially after reading this interview that is so apparent!

I can clearly see this wasn't just an actor doing a job, like he thought it would be when he auditioned.

He liked the Trek philosophy, he was happy to be a part of it, he cared, and it shows in his performance."
Star Trek: Enterprise,I love seeing him in other movies and shows.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I think they'd have better luck getting it to come back as a made-for-streaming film or a very short series. Then they could work around Bakula's schedule and probably get Blalock to at least appear in part of it.

Personally, I'd love it if they just guest-starred in some of the other series. Blalock could maybe show up in Strange New Worlds since Vulcans are long-lived. Not sure about Phlox's race, but maybe him too.

EDIT TO ADD: If the Section 31 show is still in the works with Yeoh, that would take place around the time of the early seasons of Discovery. That could be a good spot for them to guest as well."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Don't be silly, everyone knows the decon chamber was the most charismatic character on the show!

Seriously though Doctor Phlox was amazing.  That episode where he cannot cure the disease of the dominant species, and he has to allow them to go extinct, so the other species can thrive.  Wow.  Amazing Trek right there.

I loved his ability to be an outside observer, remaking on all the quirks of the human species with interest and curiosity.  For example when he is getting romantic advice from Hoshi about his relationship with crewman Cutler."
Star Trek: Enterprise,You didn’t like Reed frowning the entire show??
Star Trek: Enterprise,"decon chamber also had half naked, super oily muscular men, especially the English guy and the cowboy. One might say it oversexualised them as well"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I think the entire officer group was great, I really think Archer let the crew down though. He didn't have that spark all the previous captains had. Even Janeway had it, despite the horrific writting, due to Kate's charisma"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"> That episode where he cannot cure the disease of the dominant species, and he has to allow them to go extinct, so the other species can thrive.

Isn't that the Prime Directive progenitor episode, where Phlox *does* come up with the cure but refuses to administer it despite Archer's protest? I remember thinking the writers really didn't get the ethics right with that one, but then I suppose the Prime Directive was always immoral and mostly used as an antagonistic force for the heroes to ignore or find a loophole around."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Dude looked like he was always ashamed of himself throughout the entire series.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"The only main character in a Star Trek show I ever actively disliked. (Yeah, I even like Neelix.)"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"My second favorite character was Hoshi, she deserved more. I will admit the joke about the 'Reed Alert' was pretty funny."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"That's true. I just thought it was a bit too fan servicey to take seriously.

I initially thought Seven would be like that too, from seeing her outfit before watching Voyager, but she's actually really well written, mostly."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Disagree, Archer just makes a bunch of boneheaded decision since this is early starfleet. 

Archer has some really good moments but god damn you have to go through some idiocy to get there."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Correct in every way!
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I'm not sure if the Prime Directive is immoral, just that they always show it where it makes sense to ignore. Whereas Orville had an episode where they both show where (their equivalent rule) made sense because the planets culture was too immature and unstable, and an example prior to the rule where they did intervene and it went terribly wrong.

One alternative would be to try and judge when to uplift or assist on a case by case basis, but then you're passing subjective judgement on the ""worthiness"" of societies. Whereas the ""do they have warp"" category is objective and has the pragmatic threshold of ""can they meet other space faring races or not""."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"it was a bit fanservicey, yes. Seven was introduced to bump up the not good ratings and thus, her super tight outfit was definitely by design. I didn't much care but Jeri Ryan was, and still is, a woman who you could not take your eyes off of"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Sure, when it comes to letting a society mature I totally agree, the Prime Directive is useful. For example, if a space-faring Federation-esque society tried to incorporate us real life modern humans into their utopia, we'd just fuck up and possibly ruin it because we're still pretty awful. We'd alienate uglier aliens, revere prettier ones, our religions would definitely get in the way and create violent radicals, and we'd start wars based on lies in the name of acquisition / profit. Or maybe their society would ""fix"" us, who knows. Either way, I understand that perspective.

 It's situations like the TNG episode ""Pen Pals"" where it's problematic and, in my opinion, outright evil. Achieving warp is such an arbitrary limit on whether or not a society is worthy of being saved. The people in that episode weren't animals; they had a functional society, language, technology, etc. They just hadn't flown at a specific speed in space yet, so Federation law says we have to let their planet blow up even though we know how to save them. Like... fucking what? It's no wonder the hero captains have to break the rules all the time."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I only remember bits of the episode so I'm reliant on the Wiki summary, but didn't the Enterprise save the planet? The only time the Prime Directive came up was with Data's communication with the girl

I think if fair that if the disaster isn't self inflicted, and the Federation can't save them without revealing themselves, they should do so."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Yeah, Picard definitely saves the planet in the end (I think the way they save them ties in to the B-story) but I remembered Data having to convince Picard to do it. I might be misremembering though, could do with a rewatch."
Star Trek: Enterprise,[Nothing's gonna stop us now!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P4IlgtwHmA)
Star Trek: Enterprise,"This would be a fine opening for any space show other than a Star Trek series.

It's so out of place and saccharine in the context of the universe and other Trek opening themes.

Even the series from the 1960's feels less dated than this."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Despite the bad rep Enterprise got, at one point being the worst Star Trek series (not anymore) I still enjoyed it. It was my guilty pleasure, and the first Star Trek I ever saw."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"My first exposure to Enterprise was catching a few season 3 episodes, so when I eventually heard the original it felt way too slow."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"No, no worst star trek intro ever and my god, that song."
Star Trek: Enterprise,[deleted]
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Video is great, music not so much."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"It had the best intro..followed by voyager, the 4K intro is loverly"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I've been watching this show for the first time and (at least for season 1) it's pretty much the T'Pol show.

Captain gets covered in alien dick snot? T'Pol will help figure out how to talk to them.

Captain and Trip become accidental space jihadists? T'Pol will navigate the complicated political maneuvering while also putting together a rescue plan.

Captain and Trip need some sleep this lady straight up tells them a bed time story about rural Pennsylvania.

God forbid they get boarded. 

Then you've got Ferengis molesting her ears while she's unconscious and weird Vulcan incels immediately trying to mind rape.

At least they eased off the semi nude mandatory gel bathing.

If it isn't clear I love T'Pol and think she's great."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Yeah someone should update it with the new footage. Piloting a remote control flying machine on a planet 90 light-seconds away in a different atmosphere is incredible.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Later seasons of Enterprise were pretty good but it did have one amazing episode, in my opinion. ""Dear Doctor"" was fantastic."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"the video is cool, albeit banal as fuck, but the song, good lord, burn that Bryan Adams trash to the ground"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Holy shit, it fits so perfect"
Star Trek: Enterprise,I love it because it’s so cheesy and different. I have no idea who let it happen but every time I let it play I crack up
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Amen to that.  People that crap on it at least should take note how it respected everything that came before it. 

Even though the special effects are superior to TOS that Enterprise is not.  It doesn't have shields or a tractor beam.

It explained the smooth Kingon head's of the TOS and the ridged heads after TNG.

Etc. Etc. Etc."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Compared to Discovery, Enterprise is an absolute masterpiece.  Burning Ham in Discovery is just such a horrible actress, and she always whispers instead of speaking like the director tells her to do."
Star Trek: Enterprise,This reads like a dude who thinks in memes.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Tractor* beam - like how a tractor pulls things.

Side note: I thought devoting any time at all to explain the make-up differences between the 60s and the Golden Era Klingons was very silly. Everyone knows the real reason and there are other races that had budget revamps that never needed that kind of screen time to reconcile it. I much prefer the DS9 “explanation” when they go back in time to the “Trouble with Tribbles” TOS episode. Everyone is baffled when Worf recognizes a Klingon because they have no idea who he’s talking about. Then they look at Worf like “da fuck?” and he simply says “We do not discuss it with outsiders”. Playing it for a laugh was imo a much better choice than treating so super seriously and tying it to a major plot point in Enterprise.

Ranting aside though, I otherwise agree with your view that Enterprise at the very least made a sincere effort to respect the canon and certainly respected the style and philosophy of Star Trek."
Star Trek: Enterprise,[deleted]
Star Trek: Enterprise,">I much prefer the DS9 “explanation” when they go back in time to the “Trouble with Tribbles” TOS episode.

I feel like the Enterprise story arc adds to Worf's explanation...  A warriors race's wounded pride."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Ha! Nah.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Honestly, let’s be honest: it was 95% the intolerable adult contemporary theme song, which was jarringly off-brand and bafflingly inappropriate for the context."
Star Trek: Enterprise,There is no such thing as franchise fatigue. Audiences were never tired of Star Trek. Enterprise failed because it sucked.
Star Trek: Enterprise,Man it must be John Billingsley day or something.  Just saw an old Cold Case & Criminal Minds eps with him in both-this morning.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I think he's got a point about franchise fatigue, even if there were definitely other factors - I suspect if Enterprise had aired before Voyager it would've made 7 seasons and Voyager only 4. (Actually I suppose Voyager might even have done better if their places were swapped, getting a boost for its 'return' to the more familiar time?)"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"""Star Trek has been one of our most enduring franchises since The Original Series
launched way back in 1966. While movies were the dominant force in the franchise for
almost two full decades following that show's demise, 1987 brought Trekkies Star Trek:
The Next Generation and that would last for 18 years.
Unfortunately, the last series of that run, Star Trek: Enterprise, did not see the success
of the other shows fans had enjoyed for so long, but actor John Billingsley, who played
Dr. Phlox on the series, thinks he knows why that is.
Enterprise came at the tail end of the run that included TNG, Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager, with each of those shows seeing a lot of success and
clocking in at seven seasons each. Enterprise, however, only saw four seasons and was
cancelled by UPN, and even wrapped with in television
history. So, why does John Billingsley believe the show didn't get the same amount of
love from fans as the shows which came before? He recently spoke in a Galaxy Con
Live virtual panel (via trekMovie) about Enterprise, and had this to say:

""We came on after so many years of Star
Trek, and in a number of those years,
double-dipping. Deep Space Nine actually
overlapped with Voyager, for instance. I
think by the time we aired there was
fatigue, understandable fatigue. The show
did really at least need a year off. I always
felt badly for [co-creators/executive
producers] Rick [Berman] and Brannon
[Braga] that they weren't given that time."""""
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Or maybe it was the insistence on having the camera hover right around Scott Bakula's package in his blue briefs.

I did most of the first season and it was just so lousy. Ever since STNG Trek Shows have rough first seasons. Maybe I did have Trek Fatigue. I sure wasn't willing to slog for years of mediocre shit to get to the good, AGAIN."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"While the theme song was bad, the real problem for me was the feel.  It started with squabbling and almost fighting between Earth and the Vulcans.  The initial episodes were a show about angry people trying to act tough to prove humans were good enough.  It had no feeling of Star Trek for me."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Personally when I think “Star Trek” I think “cover of a Rod Stewart song written for Patch Adams” so I just don’t know what everyone’s issue with the theme song is.

Seriously, the issue is that they forgot to hire writers for the first two seasons. The list of episodes from season one or two of that show that stick out as memorable and interesting are: That one where Phlox accidentally invented the Prime Directive.  End of list."
Star Trek: Enterprise,I didn't give Enterprise a fair chance back then due to the horrible theme song and the dull washed out colors. I like the show well enough now but I do think that it still looks incredibly drab.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"
I actually liked the show, and was disappointed when it was canceled."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I have [no idea](https://i.imgur.com/HZPNwRj.jpg) what you're talking about...

It wasn't the only issue the show had but it sure didn't help. I think Star Trek in general suffered from a problem where they didn't want to contradict there own internal lore so it's difficult to really make stories that are logically consistent, important enough for the viewer to care about but not *so* important that their results aren't glaring in their absence from later works."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Honestly I rather enjoyed the song until they changed it slowing it down a bit.  I think it was season 3 when they changed it.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I think there is, but it’s the other direction. Audiences doesn’t get tired of seeing the same franchise, but the franchise gets tired.  Between 1987 and 2001 there were something like 550 episodes of Star Trek created. And now they want even more and they wanna add an extra level of complexity by making a prequel.  The franchise is exhausted."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Enterprise was pretty damn good.  

It has the most 8.0 or higher rated episodes in a row for any ST series on IMDB.  (7, it did twice, and had another string of 6 in a row.  TNG did 5 in a row, I think DS9 did like 5 in a row but the best I'm seeing right now 4.)

It had 15 8.0 or above episodes in its last season which consisted of 22 episodes and that's more than any other season of ST in any other series. (And it's also the lowest number of episodes in a season too.)  DS9 had 11 in 26 episodes in season 3.  TNG had 11 in 26 episodes in 5.  TOS had 13 in 29 episodes in its first season.  

tldr: Enterprise isn't one of the Star Trek shows that suck and it deserved more seasons. The ST shows that did suck were the Animated series and the two currently broadcasting on CBS All Access."
Star Trek: Enterprise,Of all the Trek doctors he was the most fun with all his pets.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Thank you for commenting. As usual I am being stalked by downvoters who don't really care. I enjoyed the show and this is one opinion coming out of the Enterprise cast, and not the whole cast so there are bound to be other opinions."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Can't really agree with him there, the way the show overlapped seemed to be very popular.  Fans loved the way one show segued into the next and could even guest previous characters.

It simply got stuck in a bad period for tv.  Voyager damaged Star Trek pretty thoroughly.  It ended up on UPN and everything they touched turned to shit.  They wanted to be a major network, take zero risks, and appeal to youth demographics.  They weren't prepared to ever support a lasting show, they certainly had no business in sci-fi.

On the one hand they wanted to film it to look cinematic, and be dramatic in a way that wasn't going to be realized until Battlestar came along.  But on the other, they weren't prepared to write a show as mature as BSG and keep it appealing to a major network.  So it was wishy washy, and the writers dropped the ball too many times for most people to forgive them.  They simply couldn't write for their own characters.

Though personally, Billingsley is the shining gem and one of my all time favorites.  Loved his character and performance."
Star Trek: Enterprise,They sped it up starting with season 3.
Star Trek: Enterprise,Marvel.
Star Trek: Enterprise,Being on UPN wasn't great.
Star Trek: Enterprise,Fringe also did something like this.
Star Trek: Enterprise,[deleted]
Star Trek: Enterprise,"One of the only times that opening was decent. I kind of wish the whole series was a mirror universe setting, that would have been interesting. "
Star Trek: Enterprise,I like the one shot taken from The Hunt for Red October of the submarine firing the torpedo. 
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Well anything would be better than the original theme song.

I remember what an instant turnoff that themesong was. I instantly did not like the show. Which is silly I know, but what can you do."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"It was amazing if you went in without knowing it was a mirror episode - first the shock at the end of the opening scene, then this."
Star Trek: Enterprise,I really hated Enterprise when I watched at the time it was first released. I think part of what made me dislike it some much was that the theme song was unlike any of the other ST modern ST theme songs. It just felt jarring. The tone of the series was also quite different which further added to my dislike. Having rewatched it on Netflix recently though I felt quite differently. I still hated the theme song but now I could skip it easily and came away with a better appreciation of what they were trying to do. Overall I would say I like this series now and would rank it above Voyager whereas before I would have put it dead last.
Star Trek: Enterprise,If only all of enterprise's seasons were as good as the last one. 
Star Trek: Enterprise,"If anyone's interested, that first scene is the [Raft of Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa)"
Star Trek: Enterprise,"The mirror universe is magic, right?  Like, that's the only explanation how so many different choices could be made and we still end up with the same people?  Somehow, despite the human government being completely demolished a hundred years beforehand and humans living as slaves, working for the brutal Klingon Cardassian alliance, Miles O'Brien's parents still met and still had a kid who managed to end up on a Cardassian space station orbiting Bajor.  Magic's the only thing that makes sense."

Star Trek: Enterprise,[A whole lot of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADERxGkheZI)
Star Trek: Enterprise,It's in the episode where it belongs 
Star Trek: Enterprise,That opening song is funny cause it's awful when you first hear it a bunch then you find yourself singing it later on. They definitely should have went more orchestral though like the other shows.
Star Trek: Enterprise,"I absolutely love the opening number, it's very inspirational and moving.

Never stuck around to watch am episode though because of all the bad things I heard about it."
Star Trek: Enterprise,"Honestly, aside from a rough first season and a **terrible** series finale, it's a really great show."
Star Trek: Enterprise,It's a good show. It's better than Voyager for sure.
Star Trek: Enterprise,I disagree. I'd say Enterprise is basically unwatchable unless you're a large Trek fan

It just aired its final episode on Christmas, so you can plow through the entire run."

Doc Martin (2004–2022)

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408381/episodes?season=10"
Doc Martin,"I live in the US and watch some PBS on the weekends. Sometimes I watch Doc Marten in the evenings, and I grew to enjoy it. Another one that grew on me even more was Shakespeare and Hathaway."
Doc Martin,Loved the series. Big fan of Martin Clunes.
Doc Martin,One of my comfort shows. The location is gorgeous. Good for a sensible chuckle.
Doc Martin,"It’s a great show, though it runs in pretty similar loops."
Doc Martin,Love it and friggin visited Cornwall on our honeymoon because of it.
Doc Martin,"It's a goofy little show with reoccurring plots. But we really liked it, it's quite wimisical and very British."
Doc Martin,Just finished watching it for the second time.
Doc Martin,Absolutely crazy finale. Loved watching the show with my parents
Doc Martin,"This show...lol, I love Doc Martin ""I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU!"""
Doc Martin,Thanks Reddit stranger! I'm going to start the final season now!
Doc Martin,"I Watch a lot of these PBS mysteries with my family. Sometimes it’s good to take a break from them, but they’re good for mystery shows."
Doc Martin,"Yes!! It makes me want to uproot and move there, but I know it would be pretty much impossible to afford any property there lol"
Doc Martin,"Yea, I'm a Yank, and I like the UK shows. *Doc Martin,* *Friday Night Dinner,* and *Derry Girls.* Shame Derry girls had to happen during the pandemic, otherwise we could have had five seasons."
Doc Martin,Friday late nights they have some unusal ones. If you are ok with sub titles...because they're generally from other countries. One going right now is Astrid & we think it's great.
Doc Martin,[deleted]
Doc Martin,"Yea, unfortunately. They got too old."
Doc Martin,"I had no clue it was still being made, kinda shocked tbh"
Doc Martin,Why is it ending? Because it’s gone on way too long? This show has been on since 2004!
Doc Martin,Looks like I'm in the minority here but I loved damn near every episode of this show. I do agree they were running out of stories the last few seasons but it was such a good comfort show. At least I'll still have All Creatures Great and Small.
Doc Martin,I gave up on this show by episode 1 or 2 because he rehired the awful receptionist instead of stabbing her and throwing her off a cliff with blistering anger.
Doc Martin,i know it didn't stop him from doing 2 seasons but i want martin clunes to do more manhunt
Doc Martin,"Usually, it's a British show that typically doesn't overstay its welcome...then again, there's *Midsomer Murders*"
Doc Martin,"Its a shame its over. But really it was the right time to call it a day. There just wasn't much left they could do at this point.

I can't wait to see what the cast do next, their are all really good."
Doc Martin,"Seriously, this show was wearing thin after the first 3 seasons or so..."
Doc Martin,"Funnily enough, the seasons are so short and the gap between them so frequent, that even though it started in 2004, it only had 80 episodes across 10 seasons. NCIS, which started a year earlier in 2003 and is still going, has 444 episodes. Heck, one of my favourite shows is Elementary, and that only ran from '12 to '19 and had nearly twice as many episodes, 154."
Doc Martin,Exactly! That article title is ridiculous.
Doc Martin,To the shows credit it does swap out the receptionists every other season.
Doc Martin,"If it makes you feel better she's gone after the first season, and her replacements are a lot more likable."
Doc Martin,How is there anyone left alive in the town?
Doc Martin,Morwenna was best!
Doc Martin,"To be fair every once in a while they go on ""vacation"" to the next town over, then there's a murder there-that a Barnaby needs to solve."
Doc Martin,"I mean technically Midsomer is a county, but even then its pushing it."
Doc Martin,"Agreed she really was. I loved how her arc unfolded. Plus to be honest I think she had the best comic timing of them, she just played off them all so well, especially Martin Clunes."
Doc Martin,"This is great news!  Anyone who hasn't seen Doc Martin should definitely check it out.  It's really funny and has a lot of heart.  Martin is a super interesting character in that he is totally unlikeable, and yet you still root for him, a bit like House.  "
Doc Martin,"It's rather corny, but watchable. "
Doc Martin,"I thought the show ended for good like  year  or two ago. Always a big fan, this makes me super happy."
Doc Martin,Is he dating the teacher still or did that fall apart? I wonder if he's the first 
Doc Martin,And don't forget to watch Saving Grace before the show. It's a good starting point and Craig Ferguson is wonderful and funny. 
Doc Martin,Oh no. Totally unlikeable? My wife says I remind her of him :(
Doc Martin,"Absolutely.  Great movie.  I found it after watching the first 2 seasons of *Doc Martin*, and it's wonderful (if a little nutty)."
Doc Martin,"Amazon has all the seasons and they're free if you sign up for a 7 day trial of Acorn TV ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Doc-Martin-Season-6/dp/B00HCNGM2I)). If you're binging, you could probably get through the whole thing before it costs you any money."
Doc Martin,"I know someone already answered your question, but I just have to thank you, because I used to *love* Doc Martin, and thought that Series 7 was the last one, and that they weren't making any more. I had no idea they had made more. Thanks to you, I have Series 8 (and soon 9) to watch, and I'm very excited lol"
Doc Martin,"There is talk of a US version of DM

Sigourney Weaver is in the last two seasons of DM (becasue she's irl besties with the actor who plays Mrs Tishal)

If you like Brittish TV you absolutely MUST watch The Detectorists.
"
Doc Martin,Thanks so much for that
Doc Martin,"If you live in the US and watch on PBS, there is a big lag time between when shows are originally aired in the UK and when PBS airs them."
Doc Martin,"I'm pretty sure after every series recently they say it will be the last one, and then they go and make another!"
Doc Martin,Yeah it's a pretty great show.
Doc Martin,"Yeah, I know that (I watch too many shows from The UK lol), I just thought I read that they weren't planning on making anymore after Series 7, so I never bothered to look for any new episodes when I was finished.

Also, Series 8 is on Amazon Prime, so I'm going to watch it there."
Doc Martin,A murder mystery about British boots?
Doc Martin,If only
Doc Martin,Coupling is really good. Absolutely Fabulous. Black Books.
Doc Martin,"The Misfits is a great show on Hulu, lots of WTF moments, blood, and comedy."
Doc Martin,"Black Adder, The Mighty Boosh, A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Spy, The Wrong Mans.

They have a pretty good selection."
Doc Martin,"I dont have hulu (not sure if its available here in the UK) so Im not sure what is on it but if you want some decent British comedy shows look out for in general then there is an impressive pedigree.

Doc Martin,"""Moone Boy"" is good, though I don't know if it's still on Hulu. "
Doc Martin,I like My Mad Fat Diary.
Doc Martin,We have the NHS so its paid through tax and s basically free at use .
Doc Martin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)
Doc Martin,"My understanding is that most western countries make it pretty cheap and easy to access health care.  I mean you could come to New Zealand from US, break your arm  and your treatment in NZ wouldn't cost you anything or would be minimal as the it would be covered by the [ACC scheme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_Compensation_Corporation)"
Doc Martin,"The Office kind of skirted this successfully after Jim & Pam got together. Their relationship was a problem for the show late in its run but never really the main problem IMO and the show wasn't exactly boring when they were together. Maybe those two characters became boring, but there was enough to the show outside of them that allowed it to remain interesting."
Doc Martin,"It does, but on the other hand, I get really tired of shows with two leads dancing around each other season after season, and the writers has to come up with one crazy reason after another, why they can't be together."
Doc Martin,Parks and Rec is amazing with Leslie and Ben together or Andy and April.
Doc Martin,I can't think of any recent series I've watched where this has happened.
Doc Martin,Cheers
Doc Martin,"I've noticed that the only time it tends to actually work is when the 
 writers completely drop the romantic aspect for a couple seasons and make sure the dynamic shifts almost totally to ""just friends."" That way when they get together, it's about the same chemistry, they just kiss now. Scrubs and Brooklyn Nine-Nine are good examples of shows where the characters getting together didn't wreck them. "
Doc Martin,"I disagree in general. I prefer a show that actually gets its leads together and has them stay together, rather than continuing to yank the audience around."
Doc Martin,"Sometimes, but not always."
Doc Martin,"Moonlighting curse, basically? Yeah."
Doc Martin,Its equally bad if they keep repeating a will-they/won't-they storyline for 3+ seasons.
Doc Martin,"Have you noticed how shows can drag on with the will they, won't they for ten seasons? It's because of what you have noticed. When the tension is gone, it becomes boring. And writers know this."
Doc Martin,"When it comes to comedies, I don't think I've ever been emotionally invested in a relationship so I usually prefer when things get settled and they have to look for new sources of story/comedy. Sexual tension in comedies usually just comes off to me as boring/formulaic. The dramas that I like have never really suffered from this."
Doc Martin,"And not just ""TV Series"" but more broadly to ""Storytelling"". Specifically, many stories in the classic ""3 Phase"" format require ""conflict"" to propel characters into action.
When you remove the Conflict, you reduce the Storytelling Options you have - simple as that. So, if the writers are not good at coming up with new, SMART ways of using the new relationship dynamics, then yeah, it starts to go downhill."
Doc Martin,The way I know a TV show is about ready to be done is when they bring a baby into it. 
Doc Martin,"The writing in later seasons just didn't know how to handle any of the characters anymore, and it's sad to see Jim and Pam get so much of the blame. 

Andy was WRECKED. Kevin became way, way too stupid to even be funny or believable, most of the new inters and that british woman were just terrible to the point I can't remember their names.. 

I think all the characters suffered later on. Jim and Pam were really great at first but unfortunately a lot of their marriage was with the new writers. "
Doc Martin,"Exactly.  I did eventually find them boring, but the rest of the show's quality has declined significantly as well."
Doc Martin,Castle
Doc Martin,New Girl
Doc Martin,Try Doc Marten.
Doc Martin,The article I read used Cheers as an example.
Doc Martin,">The writing in later seasons just didn't know how to handle any of the characters anymore, and it's sad to see Jim and Pam get so much of the blame. 

You can literally blame Toby for this. Greg Daniels left the show and Paul Lieberstein (the actor who plays Toby and a writer/producer on the show) took over and mucked it up. Daniels returned for the final season and IMO it was considerably better from a writing standpoint, although it still had its issues. 

You mentioned Andy, who was so far gone after the shit the writing put him through that even Daniels just gave up and made him the villain (although I'm sure Ed Helms' schedule didn't help). The episode where he Andy hires Erin and Pete's exes to spite them might actually be the worst of the series.

As for Jim and Pam, putting them together was necessary. I was actually just listening to an interview with Mike Schur where he was talking about why he decided to do things they way he did (no spoilers) for season 1 of The Good Place, and he quoted Daniels, with whom he argued about Jim and Pam kissing at the end of season 2. Daniels told him you have to put forward your best possible finales no matter what. Writing seven seasons of a show when one of the central premises has been turned on its head is difficult, but good writers can over come it, and while Daniels was still around, The Office did. Hell, even when he came back. The plot with Jim moving away and the boom mic guy was rough in certain spots, but I actually really appreciated what they were trying to do, even if they didn't stick the landing.

But I have a soft spot in my heart for event he worst episodes of the show. When you're binging they remain pretty watchable and few episodes aren't funny."
Doc Martin,How would you articulate why/how was Andy wrecked? Was it just that his character was all over the place and never fit a niche/foil to anyone
Doc Martin,Nick and Jess never got married?
Doc Martin,"I was a fan of Doc Martin until Doc and Louisa married, then it became uncomfortable to watch."
Doc Martin,"For me, my issue was that I wanted to root for Andy as a character, but they kept.... Ruining him. Like the crybaby stuff, ya know? Like that wasn't funny, just... Weird. And his relationship with Erin was... What the fuck? Like a writer had a literal vendetta against a fictional character so they kept making his life seem worse and worse, lmao

I constantly kept thinking ""oh they'll turn his character around here"" like when his dad ran off and he had to save his family, or when he signed what's her name's adoption forms, or when what's her name stole his position as manager... And then he pussied out of that. 

I was never comfortable with the direction they sent him."
Doc Martin,"No, but it doesn't take marriage to kill romantic tension on a show.  Sam and Diane never got married, nor did Dave and Maddie and that was plenty to kill their momentum. "
Doc Martin,"Community, Archer, Wilfred"
Doc Martin,Battlestar Galactica
Doc Martin,"Misfits! It's a brilliant little show from Channel 4. Two six-ep seasons and a christmas special, and a third season on its way."
Doc Martin,"I have similar tastes, and would add West Wing (my favourite show ever), Garth Marengis Dark Place (perfect comedy) and Eastbound & Down (another perfect comedy) to your list - I think you'd like all of them definitely."
Doc Martin,Workaholics
Doc Martin,"After much research: Extras, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Louis Theroux's BBC2 Specials."
Doc Martin,"For SciFi I suggest you check out Fringe on FOX, the first two seasons aren't as strong as the third, but I think you'll enjoy it, it' right up there with Doctor Who (BBC America) as one of my favorite science fiction shows. 

Also, check out Archer on FX, it has a unique style of humor, ooh and community on NBC"
Doc Martin,The X Files is a classic and all nine seasons and both movies are on Netflix Instant. Very highly recommended.
Doc Martin,"Check out Carnivale, it's an unfinished series, but f***ing fantastic. "
Doc Martin,Dexter Dexter DEXTER...... also Community is great. Parks and Rec. Archer or Venture Bros if you want to try adult cartoons. Futurama is starting the second season on comedycentral and it 100x better than when it was aired on fox (the last season was hilarious and can be found on netflicks) Walking Dead if you like zombies. 
Doc Martin,And Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure for nineties drama brilliance. And Jonathan Creek if you like Sherlock! 
Doc Martin,http://www.reddit.com/r/tvcritic/top/?t=all
Doc Martin,"You have IT Crowd and Black Books on there, so I'd suggest [**Father Ted**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Ted). It was created by Graham Linehan, the same guy who did IT Crowd and Black Books.

Also, you've watched and liked Life on Mars, I'd suggest [**Ashes to Ashes**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes_\(TV_series\)). It's kind of a sequel to Life on Mars.

It was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but I'd second [**Misfits**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_\(TV_series\)). If you're in the U.S., I believe it's available on Hulu.

I'm assuming you've tried Torchwood, right?

"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"She served as an executive for Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network both, and both runs were during some of their best years. I have high faith in her selecting quality projects for kids."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Man...I'm not saying it's a bad show but the wild kratts drive me up the fucking wall. They have access to multiple pieces of completely ground-breaking technology and make the DUMBEST GODDAMN DECISIONS with it. Like they were studying ~~grizzly~~  black bears and ~~one of them activates into a bear to get into a salmon-fishing competition with a real bear~~, they track two bears catching fish to see who gets more, and one of the brothers gets into a salmon-sized boat that looks JUST LIKE a fucking salmon and SWIMS INTO THE EXACT AREA WHERE REAL FUCKING BEARS ARE TRYING TO CATCH SALMON and QUELLE FUCKING SURPRISE, a bear catches this fucking miracle of technology and tries to EAT IT.

Sorry. I've been carrying that around for a while.

Edit: mis-remembered a few details. The point still stands."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Odd Squad is awesome.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Dinosaur Train sounds like a badass metal band
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Grownnnnnn ups come back.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,My 2 year old loves Daniel Tigers Neighborhood.... and I love getting the little reminders of Mr Rogers. So she’s a-ok in my book and I’m happy for her success.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Odd Squad FTW
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Dinosaur Train is pretty fun for my oldest, but I really like Wild Kratts and love Odd Squad. I just turned 36."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"If she's also responsible for Pinkalicious, my 3 year old may have single handedly secured the promotion for her."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I had some friends shit on Daniel Tiger as ""it wasn't made by the Roger's estate"" a few years ago. So I assumed it was shit.

Flash forward to me having toddler and I am realizing it's the best show on TV to teach kids how to be a decent human being. (t also makes me realize the kind of behaviors I need to exhibit as a parent, too)

Just because a piece of media is made outside the legacy of a prominent figure doesn't mean it can't be amazing."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"My 3 year old loves all of those shows.

&#x200B;

I approve."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Daniel Tiger is great. Wholesome, with lots of teaching moments for both kids and adults."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,All my favorite shows
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Odd Squad is great, and Wild Kratts is good enough.  My kid likes them both, but even I, as an adult, somewhat enjoy OddSquad."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Odd Squad rules.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Good! She’s great! And give PBS funding too!
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"PBS Kids is the only subscription service my family pays for. My boys enjoy all these shows. Actually, my wife and I do too.
 
Based on the shows listed and Linda’s overall track record, I’m looking forward to what’s coming next. It should be great."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Who made Paw Patrol? ...'cuz they need to be exorcised and sealed in a floating tomb of holy water
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,/r/danieltigerconspiracy
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Good! We need moar Dinosaur Train things! My youngest who isn’t even born yet will give me an excuse to watch it again.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Molly of Denali is my jam
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,She knows what to do
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,I miss just old school Mr. Rogers
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,We did most of these with our son. I hope for all the best things for her:)
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Idk what odd squad is, but the rest are pretty good. Dinosaur Train is something I would want to dislike, but I’d stick up for it if some other show was bullying it."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,My son and I have some good memorable times watching Wild kratts 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,She deserves it! I have a 6 and 5 year old boys and they grew up on those shows! My wife and I ended up liking them as much or more as our boys
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"My kids like most of the above shows, but for me, **Peg + Cat** is where it's at."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Congratulations Linda!
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"The Kratt bothers are still around? Damn, I didn’t know they were still making shows. I still remember Kratt’s Creatures and Zaboomafoo."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Just FYI, PBS Kids is free steaming live on their website. Important bookmark for the living room PC!"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Lol, saw the thumbnail and I was like why is Weird Al associated with this?"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,I was hoping that satan Caillou was not on her resume and am greatly relieved
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Those are the four shows that my kids like.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,bring back zoom
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Dinosaur train. Dinosaur train.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Basically all the best shows.  I’m not young anymore and I still think they’re all awesome.

....Now the dinosaur train song is stuck in my head.... damnit"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Oh no, not Odd Squad."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I watch all this shit all morning before getting the kids ready for school, and I love Nature Cat!"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I watch dinosaur train after the kids go to sleep, no shame."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,The first time I watched Dinosaur train like 9 years ago I was half asleep half dreaming with a screaming 3 month old in my arms and I thought I was hallucinating. My son and I still sit down to watch the time traveling dinosaurs because it’s something we shared and it’s completely bonkers. And the equally bonkers odd squad is one of the strangest funniest shows I’ve ever seen.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Of course the promote a woman since in todays world if you promote a man you are sexist and oppressing.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Hopefully she can bring it back to level of 90s PBS
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Why doesn't Daniel Tiger wear pants?  Or his dad.  Everyone else seems to wear pants, dresses, or skirts.  Daniel wears PJ pants and snow pants, but most of the time he's out there freeballing it.  Why?  This is a show that deals with serious issues like the potty and dealing with strangers.  Daniel should be wearing pants."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Wild Kratts depict predators as malicious animals. Total bullshit and misleading.  Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood is mindless garbage.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Look I know I'm biased because I'm an adult and I wasn't raised on any of those shows, but they all pail in comparison to their predecessors. Kids really have to settle for Daniel Tiger and Wild Kratts when we were getting Mr. Rogers and Zoboomafoo? Give them some good shows. Odd Squad is the only thing listed there that didn't make me roll my eyes and that's because I only know it by it's name."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Daniel Tiger would make a nice rug tbh.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,If both my kids are indicators her track record is phenomenal
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,That's a lot more relevant to the new position than shows she's directed. Makes me more confident.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,It makes me miss Zoboomafoo.  But I do love the Kratt Bros so we still watch Wild Kratts.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I thought Wild Kratts was live action for a second so I was majorly confused until I looked it up... ohhh


https://youtu.be/Vqj-r83ywUc?t=1170"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,LMAO so mad that the French came out
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,See you on the creature trail!
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I was about to be mad at first, and by th he end I was rolling. I can totally relate"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I think we made a lot of good progress today. Wait here please, and we'll schedule your next appointment."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"If they really want to perform a Creature Rescue, they’d shrink herds of cattle, put them to grange for a month on a half acre, then bring them back to size. No more clear cutting the Amazon."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"You definitely have kids and have been watching Wild Kratts with them. That one is definitely not my favorite for the reason you stated, so it's usually when I tune out a little and read."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Honestly, that sounds hilarious."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,I have similar feelings about Vampirina. That show seemed so cute at first but now its permanently banned in our house because it pisses me off so much.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,The Kratt brothers when they appear on the show in the real look bizarrely different than their young and spry animated counterparts. I feel like they really dropped the ball on more accurately portraying middle aged dudes.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"How did they react to it, being their fault and all? Maybe the point of it was to teach kids not to get angry at animals for behaving as they obviously would and to act accordingly around them (i.e do not become salmon shaped in front of a bear and then put it down when it attacks you)."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"This happens all the time on this show. 
My problem, though, is how narcissistic it is. Chris and Martin Kratt create, write and produce a show about themselves. They give the main characters their names and have them always out in the wildest landscape, seeing amazing sites, saving the environment, with the most amazing tech especially built for them. With the people essentially following them about driving them about and inventing things for them.
The way they talk about how they love to see animals fighting each other. Some of this just weirds me out."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Odd Squad is one of the weirdest shows I've ever randomly seen. [Like full on Adult Swim level weirdness.](https://youtu.be/XdENWz0zIus)


I guess spoilers for a kids show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HHeaULkIk"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Love me some Odd Squad!
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"that show is fuckin wild man, spy kids meets scp foundation."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I love the cop show parody jokes that only adults would get. I love all the weird quirks they bring out of each character, like how Agent Otto eats soup weird.

It's a house favorite."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Odd Squad is the goods. Actually, if anyone involved is reading this, there’s a little girl I love named Oswin and she soaks up everything about each episode. Almost five years old and a huge fan.She’s able to follow the math concepts but she’s studying the humor too. 

Anyways, what I’m saying is  “O” names are cool and if she ever heard her name on the show? I think she would run squealing through the house for at least half an hour. Just tossing that wishing coin out into the internet wishing well. (That said, I have no clue when this show was made or if new episodes are even being produced)"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,I’m super impressed by their set designs. Always wondered how they got the budget for it.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,My kids love it...almost as much as my wife and I do. If this was on when I was a kid I’d be downright OBSESSED with the show. As an adult though I’m equally impressed with the performances they get out of the kid actors as I am with the writing/world building/sets/etc. They must pick just the right kids and then have people on set working absolute magic with them.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Odd Squad is this generation's MathNet, basically."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Odd Squad pisses me off. You notice, all the competent characters have to be attractive. The fat kid is, surprise surprise, an idiot who calls himself Potato. Only attractive girls can lead in the show. The less attractive girls are nerds, dorks, etc. Pretty pathetic stereotyping if you ask me. It's the only PBS Kids show I won't let my kid watch.

Edit: guess I found where all the incels went. Touched a nerve, didn't I?"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,It’s also a metal concept: a train filled with dinosaurs run by velociraptors that travels through time.

Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"God-tier public transportation and for some reason Daddy Tiger and Grandpere don’t wear pants, but Mama Tiger does."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Can Blue fish play, tomorrow?

No... Blue fish cant play anymore."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood acts like they are teaching kids but they are low-key incepting ideas on how to be a good parent.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"My two year old demands “the kitty show” daily.   I feel like bad parent letting her veg in front of the tv but it buys me so much time for chores and self-care!  Plus, it’s educational and not horribly annoying to listen to.   

We’ve started teaching daddy the cleanup song and will probably hit others as we go."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I was not aware of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood until my son was born, and so far removed from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood that I didn't even realize what I was watching until the end (I didn't hear the opening theme).

I actually teared up from the flood of childhood memories that came back while I held my infant son. It also comforted me to know that he will have exposure to the same quality material I did, if not better than what I watched back in the 80s/90s."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"Coming from a masculine household and not being able to properly convey my emotions, DT and my daughter have helped me tremendously"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,My sons a year and a half and loves the show. It’s really good imo.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Hell yeah...
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Wild Kratts is great. Family favorite here too. PBS kids app could use some help though. I’d pay for content on it.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"pinkalicious is the female caillou, and i fuckin hate caillou."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I'm not sure I'd say it's outside his legacy. I mean would you rather a show be made by the guy's estate or by [his production company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers_Productions), including many of the people who worked with him?"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,I can only watch so much of it because I miss Mr. Rogers so much somedays
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Disney
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,What the fuck did I just walk into
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,A way for adults who are forced to watch kids' shows to derive entertainment from it
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"My god, thank you for this. Now I have to dig up the outline for the YA action adventure I almost wrote as a sequel to Jim Henson’s Pajanimals."
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Cheers!
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,"I grew up watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and I firmly believe that he would be rather disappointed with the spiritual successor to his show. Many who loved his show may remember his prominent display of the yellow traffic light as a reminder to ""slow down."" The frenetic pace of Daniel Tiger sells out on that point completely, electing instead to cater to over-stimulated i-pad children just to stay competitive. I think this show would fall closer to the TV that Fred Rogers ""hated"" when he struck out to do something better.

I low key fucking hate Daniel Tiger"
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Same. My 2 year old loves it and I’m fine with her choice
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,You can watch some episodes on the PBS Kids app.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Odd Squad is like “what if the MIB or SCP Foundation was only run by kids and they learn math and stuff while trying to contain weird aliens in Canada”. It’s legitimately good.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,All of those shows are still on demand via their website. My 3yo enjoys Daniel *and* Mr. Rogers.
Daniel Tigers Neighborhood,Odd squad has some good jokes even for adults.
Ouran High School Host Club,Thanks for the warning!
Ouran High School Host Club,"Thankfully, it seems to be a brief break for Ken as he will return the day after this tournament ends. Weird scheduling decision to end the competition on a Thursday and pick up with a different host on a Friday — but then again, it was a weird decision to hire two hosts.

Source: [@IsKenHosting](https://twitter.com/IsKenHosting/status/1626225418553683969) on Twitter"
Ouran High School Host Club,I don’t really dislike her but Ken is just so so much better. It’s kind of incredible how good he is at it considering he was like a software engineer from Utah or something when he went on the show. Hosting a show like this is not easy!
Ouran High School Host Club,"Time for a jeopardy break, thanks."
Ouran High School Host Club,"so High School tourney champs, but 10/20/30 years later?

nope...

The tournament reunites former teen contestants from four seasons ago who appeared in Jeopardy!‘s two Teen Tournaments. Now, the bright young minds who impressed viewers with their knowledge in the past are being given a chance to do it again, this time as college students.

no thanks"
Ouran High School Host Club,So - I’m a non Jeopardy and non Big Bang person. I know a lot of people don’t like her and apparently she messed up a couple times. But I think she does well for my occasional casual viewing.
Ouran High School Host Club,Aaaaaaannnnd pause DVR series recording
Ouran High School Host Club,"Is there a reason why they keep flip flopping between these two? I thought she was pretty universally disliked, and Ken was pretty universally loved. The fans have spoken, like dozens of times."
Ouran High School Host Club,Reddits fav!
Ouran High School Host Club,Ugh. Why won’t she go away. Let Ken host or give LeVar another shot! Don’t give him the Olympics time slot this time!
Ouran High School Host Club,Question: if they host-split next year too will the balance be a lot more equitable/Mayim actually host a seemingly-equal amount of syndicated episodes because whether or not it's the right thing to do I know she'd hate it if the main reason the decision got weighted in Ken's favor was because of the death of a co-star on her other project (Leslie Jordan on Call Me Kat) and how that threw their filming schedule pear-shaped
Ouran High School Host Club,"Personally I like regular jeopardy quite a bit.


But I do NOT like celebrity Jeopardy, College Jeopardy, HS Jeopardy etc.  they are way too fucking easy, the guests are stupid and it’s just trash.


I haven’t seen much of Mayim, but Ken was ok at best.  He’s definitely way more boring than Alex was.  Maybe he will grow into it, but I’m definitely not impressed, so far."
Ouran High School Host Club,Is this when he's going to shoot the episodes for Jeopardy Masters?
Ouran High School Host Club,Ken is not very good.  He’s boring and monotone as fuck.
Ouran High School Host Club,She does all the celebrity/lower-level tournaments. I think she hits with the type of crowd that would watch celebrity jeopardy unfortuantely.
Ouran High School Host Club,She’s disliked on Reddit. She tested highest with Sony’s focus groups among all the guest hosts including Ken. Plus outside the social media bubble she’s pretty well liked.
Ouran High School Host Club,Reddit favors Ken.  By far
Ouran High School Host Club,LeVar was terrible.
Ouran High School Host Club,"Not sure what their future plans are, but they have definitely moved on from the original arrangement as Ken is hosting the primetime *Jeopardy! Masters* spinoff on ABC later this year. Originally he was only supposed to share the syndicated episodes with Mayim and now it looks like he's taking on a larger workload."
Ouran High School Host Club,Not really. She was also a terrible host of that celebrity TV show making show that Kevin Smith got robbed on.
Ouran High School Host Club,He was the worst!
Ouran High School Host Club,"My point is does larger workload mean he's more likely (as in getting more spotlight) or less likely (as in getting more busy) to ""win the battle"" for syndicated hosting"
Ouran High School Host Club,Yeah really. Despite what Reddit thinks Sony found otherwise and that’s facts.
Ouran High School Host Club,"“Facts”. Did you watch the focus groups? Did an independent third party publish the results? Lol. It was the idiot Sony suits putting spin on the turd that was Mike running the search process and choosing himself, Cheney style. https://leblanguage.com/jeopardy-gate-putting-focus-groups-in-focus/"
Ouran High School Host Club,"Sony chose her as the sole host in 2021 but she couldn’t do it full time so they added Mike Richards. Richards was then dropped and Jennings added. 

Why exactly do you think she was their first choice? Of all the guest hosts she rated most popular. Do you think she’s black mailing Sony? Or has put some sort of magic spell on them? That they signed her to a multi-year multimillion $ contact for fun?
Use your head. They want their damn money and wether you like it or not they saw she brought in the eyeballs and made them that money. 

Seriously. Stop and think about how big media corporations with and stop being silly.

Your blog posts literally tells you what I just said then added some rando’s opinion on how it must’ve gone because he didn’t approve of the results. That’s not any kind of authoritative source."
Ouran High School Host Club,"But they’re pretty clearly wrong based on ratings and backlash. The sub and other communities are full of people who don’t record or watch the mayim eps, and next to zero people complaining about ken. Also, several of the guest hosts including LeVar were sabotaged and got next to zero prep time or advice, while others like Mike and Mayim were EXTREMELY prepped."
Ouran High School Host Club,https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/5569493/jeopardy-mayim-bialik-mistake-ratings-ken-host/amp/
Ouran High School Host Club,Not really. Her ratings are as good as Jennings. Again Reddit isn’t indicative of the Jeopardy audience which is primarily made up of seniors. You have social media confirmation bias. The people cutting the multi million $ checks no more than you.
Ouran High School Host Club,"So you think an article that takes ratings from one short period of time a year and a half ago during Sony working out the hosting situation is somehow indicative of a trend?
Yeah, I won’t ever expect to see you on Jeopardy lol."
Ouran High School Host Club,This has been proven demonstrably false - nearly every time they switch back to Mayim the ratings tank.
Ouran High School Host Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/w87har/looking_at_jeopardy_ratings_since_mayim_bialik/
Ouran High School Host Club,The other dude literally posted a ratings chart for nine months’ worth of data that consistently tells the same story. But you just keep on defending Mayim. You do you.
Ouran High School Host Club,"No they don’t. Jeopardy’s ratings are up under both significantly. 
Or maybe they’re just lying to protect Bialik. Yeah that makes total sense."
Ouran High School Host Club,"I’m not defending anyone. I’m telling you Reddit’s weird hate boner for Bialik is not shared by the majority of Jeopardy viewers. 
I’ve been on this site since I was a kid and once Reddit turns on someone they are forever awful and irredeemable and that’s the case here. 
It’s bizarre that people who don’t even watch the show are obsessed with trashing this woman. 
In fact according to Jeopardy since the 2 started sharing duties the viewership numbers are up nearly 400,000 per episode on average. 

Why do you think she was the first choice of the executives of one of the largest media companies on earth?
Were they all Big Bang Theory fans? Or maybe they knew more about what they were doing than a bunch of dweebs on Reddit."
Ouran High School Host Club,"It’s not just Reddit. Other communities and hell, just random folks at work distinctly don’t like Mayim eps. Also you seem to think Sony suits are some omnipotent producer gods. These were the same idiots that greenlit giving Adam Sandler some batshit insane infinite money deal."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Oh ok. I’m sure your anecdotal evidence totally out weighs the research done by the multi-billion $ media conglomerate.  
Jesus.

Edit: yet Sandler makes them $ and as I have repeatedly said to you money is all they care about."
Ouran High School Host Club,Why do you conflate large bags of money with competent decision making? Sony’s also the same company that managed to nearly completely shit the bed with Spider-Man three times in a row before begging Disney to bail them out. Update: nice creative editing to revamp your weak ass arguments 🤡
Ouran High School Host Club,"Why do you assume one of the most successful media corporations in history doesn’t do some sort of due dilligence?

They make terrible superhero movies yet they still made billions from them (except for morbius). 
The first Andrew Garfield movie grossed $778 billion. The 2nd $709 billion.  The 3rd McGuire movie made $894 billion in 2007. 

Yeah I’m sure their investors were real disappointed."
Ouran High School Host Club,Lol. Did you literally just say those movies made Sony trillions of dollars? You may exit the chat now (screenshot kept for posterity)
Ouran High School Host Club,Also: Sony WAS disappointed with the ASM franchise. They thought ASM2 would gross over a billion. It didn’t come anywhere close. https://www.looper.com/846903/the-real-reason-the-amazing-spider-man-flopped-so-hard/
Ouran High School Host Club,"Yes I mistyped and should’ve put millions. 
Explain how those totals are “shitting the bed”.

Oh look now it’s Facebook with Grandma emoji time. 

You’ve got nothing.


Oh no he screen shot my typo. Whatever will I do about this angry nerd who got pissy he lost a debate."
Ouran High School Host Club,Sony was scared shitless that they’d have to get off the MCU money train when Disney demanded a renegotiation of the revenue split for the Spider-Man deal. Why do you think Sony caved and went from a 10-90% split to 50-50%? It’s because it was painfully obvious Sony didn’t know what the fuck they were doing.
Ouran High School Host Club,"Ok and thats pertinent how? You said those movies “shit the bed”. They didn’t. 
Also it’s not exactly like Marvel is doing a bang up job right now. 
You are a weird little man. What did Bialik and Sony do to you for you to be so emotional and invested? Maybe keep throwing other bullshit at the wall and it will come to you. 
You can enjoy your screen shot and the peace of mind you seem to need."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Sigh. They were critical flops, financial failures, and clearly headed in the wrong direction - if not, why not make ASM3? My point is you seem to think Sony is some aces high production company that can do no wrong and I put out several pretty objective cases where they did and you’re still dickriding them for some reason. And Marvel? Dr Strange 2 was a recent low point - at 677M (but it also didn’t get shown in China). Black Panther 2 was 855M. Not sure why you dragged them into this."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Yet you made my point for me without being sharp enough to get it. 

The same executives who thought going with Bialik would bring in more $ also made the correct decision that going with Marvel would make them more money. 

Good job sport.

Edit: you can have the last word if it soothes your ego my low EQ friend. You appear to be deeply invested and need it as strange as that is.


>Sony Pictures chief Tom Rothman - known to be a tough negotiator - had actually offered up to 25 percent and a co-financing agreement, but that Marvel and Disney had walked away. Given that's the case, it's hard not to get the impression that Sony came out on top in this renegotiation, with Marvel ultimately signing up to their proposal.

https://screenrant.com/spiderman-sony-marvel-deal-explained/"
Ouran High School Host Club,"I don’t think “uh, we suck so badly we recognize we need to give up 40% of our profits on the biggest superhero franchise in the world to have Feige come bail us out” is the flex you think it is"
Ouran High School Host Club,Irony at the intended insult of giving me the last word while taking the last word. Good to know you switched to personal attacks since your argument is weak ass corporate dickriding
Ouran High School Host Club,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
Ouran High School Host Club,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
Ouran High School Host Club,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
Ouran High School Host Club,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
Ouran High School Host Club,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
Ouran High School Host Club,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
Ouran High School Host Club,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
Ouran High School Host Club,"""Adulting"""
Ouran High School Host Club,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
Ouran High School Host Club,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
Ouran High School Host Club,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
Ouran High School Host Club,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
Ouran High School Host Club,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
Ouran High School Host Club,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
Ouran High School Host Club,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
Ouran High School Host Club,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
Ouran High School Host Club,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
Ouran High School Host Club,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
Ouran High School Host Club,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
Ouran High School Host Club,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
Ouran High School Host Club,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
Ouran High School Host Club,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
Ouran High School Host Club,as a nonactor me too.
Ouran High School Host Club,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
Ouran High School Host Club,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
Ouran High School Host Club,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
Ouran High School Host Club,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
Ouran High School Host Club,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
Ouran High School Host Club,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
Ouran High School Host Club,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
Ouran High School Host Club,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
Ouran High School Host Club,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
Ouran High School Host Club,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
Ouran High School Host Club,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
Ouran High School Host Club,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
Ouran High School Host Club,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
Ouran High School Host Club,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
Ouran High School Host Club,This whole sub has just become ads lol
Ouran High School Host Club,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
Ouran High School Host Club,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
Ouran High School Host Club,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
Ouran High School Host Club,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
Ouran High School Host Club,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
Ouran High School Host Club,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
Ouran High School Host Club,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
Ouran High School Host Club,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
Ouran High School Host Club,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
Ouran High School Host Club,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
Ouran High School Host Club,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
Ouran High School Host Club,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
The Code,The age of the implication is over. The age of the echo chamber has just begun.
The Code,They cut out the best part at the end
The Code,"You can’t just cut out the last part hahaha
Everyone deserves to see that face"
The Code,Feel bad for the millennials nearing 40 lol always getting lumped in.
The Code,"Finger on the pulse, finger on the puss!"
The Code,I need to get back into this show.
The Code,Love when people post stuff from always sunny like the evolution argument and miss the point that all the characters are sociopathic monsters.
The Code,You should’ve put the whole clip lol
The Code,That's true the hive mind is real... Especially on Reddit.
The Code,The Dennis System 2.0
The Code,"This is actually a real conversational tool. Mirroring. And I do it all the time when people say something I don't really know how to respond to. I'll say it back to them, usually the last few words. Like a summary of what they just said. Most of the time they will continue to go on and hopefully give me something to work with. Works like a charm."
The Code,"Honestly one of the best bits of social commentary the show has ever delivered. This can be evidenced by attempting to have a dialogue about a current event on this very website. People have been conditioned to go to their respective corners and block out anything that may be contrary to their mindset, and this has made it impossible to inject nuance into conversations. 

If we largely insist on operating in bubbles of confirmation bias, then we lose our ability to function as a society."
The Code,Sounds like Reddit in a nutshell!
The Code,"It is hilarious watching the people in this thread worshiping this idea.

As soon as the characters say something they agree with they forget that IASIP is a show about terrible people and anything they say is dumb as shit.

If you ever find yourself agreeing with any of these characters its a sign that you need to reevaluate everything about yourself."
The Code,"I feel like this isn't meant to stand as some generational critique. It's supposed to read as Dennis being a psychopath who cannot understand this woman's sense of empathy. Sorta like when people talk about ""virtue signaling"", because they cannot even comprehend a world where people actually care."
The Code,Actress name?
The Code,"Dennis shouldn't be a beacon of generational relations.  It's good to laugh at him, but he should be right like a broken clock.  Twice a day.  

Are people in echo chambers?  Fucking right, they are.

But if Dennis is right all the time, then the viewer has crossed into Joker fanboy territory."
The Code,"""Generations"" aren't a real thing anyways. An older millennial, say age 41, is much more likely to be similar to a young gen x person aged 43 than they are a young millennial aged 27."
The Code,Who tf posts a Always Sunny clip and doesn’t include the Dennis O face?
The Code,It's like they were describing reddits user base.
The Code,Because of the *implication.*
The Code,Finally someone takes a shot at Millennials.
The Code,This was my favorite episode from this season.
The Code,ITT Millennials who are offended
The Code,"Basically Reddit in a nutshell.

Example:

Weekly posts of ‘omg Leftovers is so good’- ez Karma."
The Code,I'm sure everyone can appreciate this being uploaded to reddit - perhaps the greatest echo chamber of them all.
The Code,"I can't even. What can't I even? I don't know, but the kids tell me this is a thing."
The Code,"I think you mean Gen Z.

The Gang already are millennials..."
The Code,The nose ring 🤣
The Code,"The entire bit is flowing over most of the heads of the people in this thread

But sure “hur dur young people care too much”"
The Code,Generations are just astrological signs for redditors.
The Code,This entire subreddit is just my YouTube algorithm from last week
The Code,"Or, hot take, younger generations are just genuinely more empathetic than the generations that threw rocks at black school children."
The Code,Damn he looks old now
The Code,"Sadly, facts."
The Code,"Uh you know Dennis is intentionally wrong, right? This 'cracked code' is some old man dinosaur take on a younger generation."
The Code,Wanting to be seen as more ethical is better than not wanting to be seen as more ethical.
The Code,Dennis is a moron anyway
The Code,She think she a bull.
The Code,"Man. If anything tells me a show has lost it, it is bitching about younger people. Like fuck off Archie Bunker."
The Code,That sounds dangerously close to boomer logic to me
The Code,"The number of Gen Z's in this thread raging about ""boomer humor"" is really funny. Y'all take yourselves so seriously."
The Code,"I'm not a fan of that show, but I'll join in more explicitly. Fuck Wokeism."
The Code,Sounds like marriage
The Code,Didn't know Always Sunny was such a boomer show.
The Code,Scarily accurate
The Code,Still waiting for them to crack the code for making a good show after season 12.
The Code,"Nooo fuckingggg shittttt. 
I’m going to try this with my son.

Edit: Wtf. Sorry I did not know this was about sex..  I was only talking about the method of just saying exactly what the person says back to them   to make it seem like that you are listening and on there side.   
Lol. This is why I belong here…  I have to see the show now…"
The Code,Spot on. I bet a lot of people would laugh and be like “that’s what i’m like” without any awareness that they don’t have to just say whatever everyone else is saying. if you say argumentum ad populum they’d say “fuck you too.”
The Code,"Lol she’s too ~~old~~young to be a millennial. Guess millennial means group of people that OP doesn’t like. Boomer detected.

e:oops I meant too young"
The Code,"""Don't even understand half the shit that they're saying""

Says a fucking dumbass screaming about CRT at the top of their lungs because right wing media said so."
The Code,"As a Millenial, I really want to see Mr. Dennis Reynolds crack the Gen Z code."
The Code,"Did they film this multiple times with different girls?  I could have sworn it was a blonde when I saw it on Hulu the other day and she looked much younger, was a bit weird."
The Code,"Wow, she looks like a younger Pamela Adlon."
The Code,this belongs on r/GenX
The Code,"The super troopers ""repeaters"""
The Code,"all these people here, yet there isnt any links or debate on who she is??!!! HERETICS!!!"
The Code,"It applies to all generations and all people, except for politicians."
The Code,"Has he had plastic surgery? Giving me a real ""Ronaldo"" vibe."
The Code,This sounds oddly familiar in a very scary kind of way
The Code,She is a classic Reddit mod and Dennis is an average white male walking into Reddit.
The Code,"It's not ethical but when my ex started yammering on about things that made no sense, I'd keep like a three second loop of what she said, echo her statement, then discard.  Funnily enough, my bad behavior is not why we broke up."
The Code,Lolllolololllololo exactly! I Think I’ll deploy that tactic at every opportunity hilarious.
The Code,"Bruh you left out the best part, the pay off."
The Code,what episode is this?
The Code,Which episode?
The Code,What episode is this?
The Code,"As a male feminist, I find this clip extremely offensive and misogynistic"
The Code,How pathetic and predictable these people can be?
The Code,What episode is this? Looks like I’ve missed a few
The Code,What episode was this
The Code,Which episode is this from? I don’t remember this scene!
The Code,The age of the implication is over. The age of the echo chamber has just begun.
The Code,Should this be read in a creepy orc voice? https://youtu.be/R1x4JkZTfPs
The Code,Something's over and something started
The Code,Cut that cut that cut that
The Code,"Here:

https://youtu.be/uOVJ3zaQnYo"
The Code,"Interesting how the edit kind of redirects the satire. The edited version is being shared around to make fun of millennials, the actual scene is indicting selfish and cynical older generations."
The Code,Is it the return of Dennis' O-face?
The Code,"IKR  
https://youtu.be/uOVJ3zaQnYo"
The Code,I think officially the oldest millennials turn 42 this year and the youngest 26.
The Code,"Seriously, I'm turning 40 this year and technically a millennial. There was no such thing as social media until I was already in college. Us Xillennials are like a lost micro-generation."
The Code,"People think there are only 2 generations that exist right now; Millennials and Boomers. 

Millennial age range: 28 - 42 (born 1980 - 1994) 

In this scene, about 20 seconds earlier, there's a joke Where Denis says ""OLD!? I'm 26...""

This entire thing is just more ignorant circle jerking about millennials. 

*For those who don't understand, they're making fun of Gen Z. Nowhere does he say ""Millennial"" in the scene."
The Code,It’s also almost like Dennis is a terrible person. So the things he says are from point of view of a terrible person.
The Code,[deleted]
The Code,"The MORONS' rotten brains can't handle more than one label. They get flustered and panic if the see two or more, example: if they see Antifa and BLM in the same sentence, most of them have mini-heart attacks thinking WW3 started."
The Code,40 year old millennials have almost nothing in common with 26 year old ones. Technology and the way we grew up are so different. Generations need to be grouped in much smaller time periods. Things change much faster today.
The Code,Almost as though lumping people together based on what year they were born is as logical as Astrological signs
The Code,I'm pretty sure everyone on that show but danny devito is millenial.
The Code,Yeah it bs. These guys are only like five years older and they get to act like they're somehow superior
The Code,I’m 39 😩
The Code,"I feel bad that the generations most susceptible to propaganda keep accusing the younger generations of not knowing anything.

I mean, you’d think the people who grew up through the Civil Rights movement and the people who were disillusioned by the rampant corporatism of the ‘80s and early ‘90s would be more sympathetic to people being denied their civil liberties and indebted to oblivion, but no—*somehow* the younger generations’ ire at people’s rights being taken away and not being able to buy anything beyond living expenses means we’re “too thin-skinned and don’t appreciate the value of work.”

Seriously: you’d think age would give people wisdom to see that maybe—just *maybe*—the fact that none of the shit from the past is getting better has something to do with the people convincing suckers that “no, there’s nothing wrong with you. It’s those *other* people (who you should kick down on) responsible for the problems in this country.”"
The Code,"Yeah, are they not millennials? If they're gen x, they have to be the youngest batch of gen x"
The Code,"how about those of us already over 40... because yes if we go by the grounds millennials are 1980-1995, then there are 41-42 year old millennials out there."
The Code,Eewwwww
The Code,"God, the nose ring. It’s like a signal that you’re about to deal with a tremendous amount of bullshit."
The Code,The new season was great imo
The Code,"This show is brilliant, it's just getting better each season."
The Code,You should! The Ireland episodes were incredible and classic Sunny
The Code,This clip was one of the very few highlights of the most recent season. It’s pretty rough overall.
Chuggington,Yeah I've been noticing that... Lots if kids shows now have snotty little shits for main characters. Caillou being the obvious holy grail.
Chuggington,"The thing that really bothers me is the railroad owner's policy on rolling stock. They must be running 20+ locomotives, no two are alike. Steam electric diesel they run everything. Talk about a maintenance nightmare. Must be costing them a fortune in running costs."
Chuggington,"Watch the octonauts instead man. By far the best show on bbc children's television. The characters are genuinely interesting and have to figure out tough situations and overcome their own weaknesses. Every episode includes awesome true facts about the ocean and ocean creatures, and it is even frequently funny. Actual compelling science fiction, for 3-6 year olds."
Chuggington,"Chuggington is to Thomas the Train as Gobots were to Transformers. Don't bother trying to make sense of it, just realize it belongs on a shelf at a dollar store."
Chuggington,"I've never heard of Chuggington, but this is the best thing I've read all day."
Chuggington,[deleted]
Chuggington,Paw Patrol is always successful....
Chuggington,These trains need a little discipline.  See [the sad story of henry](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iO6qIM2WO6k) for an example of what might work.  
Chuggington,"Jees, just wait until you see peppa pig, nothing quite like the whole family humiliating the dad every episode to inspire the children of today."
Chuggington,"Yes, another with hatred in his heart for Chuggington! Oh, this just feels so good to know about you and the others who have gathered here on this post to disparage that awful show! May Chuggington be utterly vanquished, the creators incinerated, and all evidence of its existence struck from history! 

And for me, the absolute worst part of the show is the intro song. They just repeat Chuggington continually! IT'S SO AWFUL! Chuggington is just a Thomas wannabe!"
Chuggington,I saw my 1st episode of Chuggington the other day w/ young niece & was thinking the same thing.
Chuggington,"This is basically all modern cartoons, especially those aimed at younger kids.

Take moral lesson. Remove anything pertaining to morality. Poorly wrap it in anthropmorphic animals or vehicles. Profit."
Chuggington,"If Chuggington pisses you off, never watch Max and Ruby."
Chuggington,Plot twist: Charles Manson was raised by a TV also.
Chuggington,"It's sad that I know exactly which episode you're talking about. I agree with you the show is bad. Thankfully my kids never got into it, they do however, LOVE Peppa Pig. "
Chuggington,Mike the Knight is the worst for this. God I hate that little shit.
Chuggington,"Yup, Chuggington, Mike the Knight, The Little Princess: They are the worst. Whining little turds that don't learn and aren't disciplined."
Chuggington,"Just wanted to say I enjoyed reading this post , you explained the little shits so well!"
Chuggington,"Sheriff Callie, there's an episode where the two pigs or skunks or whatever belch without saying excuse me and the deputy threatens to arrest them for not having manners.


Peppa Pig has the mother always insulting the father, in the episode where the queen is giving away a vacation for the hardest worker mom pig looks right at dad pig and says ""well it certainly won't be you dad pig"""
Chuggington,I've seen that fucking show. The fat controller needs to get down there and kick some ass. He's a stone cold mother fucker and don't take no shit from no stupid train. 
Chuggington,"I think the only thing ""good"" about Chuggington is their opening theme. Slightly catchy, although pretty uh . . . yep. That's all I really have to say. 

A lot of kid's shows these days are kinda like that. Main character fucks up, plot armor lets them get through it all with some sort of bullshit like ""oh no that's what we WANTED you to do you're cool"", everyone drives away happy go lucky without any care or worry in the world without learning anything, rinse and repeat.

Sorry if I'm sounding like an old crank here, but I miss the kid's shows I grew up on. Berenstein Bears, Little Bear, Spongebob, etc. where characters fucked up and it -meant- something lol Kid's shows nowadays are just creating a society of whiners and half-ass'ers. "
Chuggington,"If the trains on that show learned their lesson every time, there would not be much to learn later. Just trains following orders and never screwing up. What's the point in that? "
Chuggington,"This is pretty typical for kid shows. Character does something wrong because they do what they want instead of what they are supposed to do. Character realizes it sometimes by themselves or sometimes when it is pointed out. Character tries to make amends, and everyone forgives character. Ever watched an episode of Thomas the Train or Ni Hao Kai-lan?"
Chuggington,"This is hilarious, loved the show tho"
Chuggington,"I watched Caillou once, to see how bad it was. I had Excel open and kept track. **In the first 90 seconds, Caillou whined three distinct times.**

People are not exaggerating about that show. I timestamped every time he whined, and it averaged out to about once per minute. And it's not like he ever get chastised for whining. The show literally teaches kids to be annoying little whiners.

TLDR: Caillou will make your kids worse."
Chuggington,caillou? more like callous.
Chuggington,"Henry Hugglemonster is no better, that little shit will do anything but what he is told. I wont let my daughter watch that Disney Jr. garbage."
Chuggington,Pocoyo is an asshole too. 
Chuggington,Teaching our kids bad business practices! The nerve
Chuggington,"Don't even get me started on the impracticality of creating an entire city around rails instead of cars.

And don't worry about maintenance because they have the equivalent of an MRI for trains that can talk and tell them exactly what is wrong."
Chuggington,Hell they bricked up a perfectly good locomotive in a tunnel for years because it didn't want to get dirty in the rain. Just a massive misuse of resources all round.
Chuggington,"I know it's 7 years later, but I completely agree with this, haha.

Everytime I watch this I find myself picking apart the infrastructure of this ridiculous city. For instance one of the engines had to train to move shipping containers - they somehow arranged them all in a house of cards kind of formation. Completely unsafe by shipping yard standards and would cause a disaster in high winds.

But no, he got praised and invited back. Ridiculous."
Chuggington,The safety record is terrible too
Chuggington,"My wife loves Octonauts......when my kid (female) was four to six she loved it as well....because of the cat, Kwazii (a headstrong troublemaker).

Bubble guppies is also quite educational.

"
Chuggington,"Thomas the *Train*? Is this an American thing, because *tank engine* isn't as marketable?"
Chuggington,YouTube an episode and see what the fuss is about. 
Chuggington,That red train is a poster child for ADHD meds.  Get your shit together red train 
Chuggington,Who is John Galt?

Chuggington,A strange world where all the women wear pillowcase dresses and all the men wear leotards.
Chuggington,The show where everyone's head is a penis and scrotum. 
Chuggington,"I'm now sat here with it going round my head, thanks OP.

Chuuuuggington. Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chuggington."
Chuggington,PBS Kids still has a great selection of cartoons
Chuggington,Kids like animals way way better than human characters.
Chuggington,"dear god yes, I HATE those those stupid ass bunny's. They do bad shit and never get in trouble. Terrible, terrible show."
Chuggington,Arrogant little bastard.
Chuggington,"Why'd you throw Spongebob in there at the end? Almost every episode was about was about waht an annoying little fuck-up asshole Spongebob was. He was just a dick to his artist neighbor and coworker all the time and at times, it got super-frustrating to watch. "
Chuggington,"I like how you have fallen into the Berenstein trap for Berenstain. Another example of how the universe has shifted as in the Matrix.  Edit: There is a huge section of online folks who insist that its always been Berenstein, and that there was some matrix like shift to alter alll the books to read ""Berenstain."" Amusing to read about. http://woodbetweenworlds.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-berenstein-bears-we-are-living-in.html?m=1"
Chuggington,That's right. When our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ comes down on the Day of Judgment with many flaming swords of death and justice-- then them darn trains will learn!
Chuggington,"I'm a nanny and I was interviewing with a family one time when the discussion of children's TV came up. The dad says, ""we *hate* Caillou."" The mom gives him a scolding look and says, ""we don't say that word."" The dad looks all sheepish and says, ""sorry. We *hate* that little bald kid."""
Chuggington,We have a no tolerance policy on whining in our house. Caillou is permanently banned. The great thing is my kids know why and agree with it. They tell other kids it's not allowed because Caillou is a whiner. Small victories man.
Chuggington,Plot twist: Caillou grew up to be Justin Bieber.
Chuggington,Wasn't that Shining Time Station (Thomas the Tank Engine)?
Chuggington,"The show is called Thomas & Friends but he's still Thomas the Tank Engine. A lot of (American, I guess) folks tend to call him ""Thomas the Train"" or ""Thomas Train"" for whatever reason."
Chuggington,I'm American and I've always referred to him as Thomas the tank engine. 
Chuggington,"I like umizoomi...i mean my kids like it. Yeah, that's it. "
Chuggington,It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
Chuggington,"I previewed an episode where Spongebob cried nearly the entire show.  I vowed that my son would never watch a single episode, and so far he hasn't.  My son grew out of Chuggington, thankfully.  I found that the trains never really solved problems very well, for the most part.  There are some exceptions, but mainly I think they use mistakes and deceptions to create drama to entertain children instead of being truly educational, like Dora the Explorer, The SuperReaders of SuperWhy or Paw Patrol.  Chuggington is not my least favorite though.  That dishonor falls to Fireman Sam, where they have a firebug named Norman who lights the town on fire in nearly every episode, and yet everyone seems to have amnesia about it.  He even cheats at a race in one episode.  The Norman character should be in a detention facility, evaluated, tried as an adult, and put into a mental hospital for the criminally insane."
Chuggington,Sponge-Bob can be pretty damn funny at times. Also most kids need to be over five to like it.
Chuggington,". . . You know, I think I knew this back when I was a kid. Not the parallel universe thing because fuck me that blew my mind and I think I have a new religion now, but like, it being spelled Berenstain rather than Berenstein. Because as a kid, I'm not gonna lie, I was a DANK speller. I still am. So when I found out that the ""stein"" was supposed to be ""stain"" I basically had my existential crisis right there at 7 years old. 

But christ, if that doesn't put everything into perspective, I dunno what does. Praise be with Berenstein, where the world makes more sense."
Chuggington,"My favorite story was from Reddit:

At a daycare, they showed Caillou. The kids started misbehaving and whining and complaining. It continued got worse for about a couple weeks. A teacher realized the kids were imitating Caillou, and stopped letting them watch it. They quickly returned to normal and stopped whining so much.

Can you believe a *popular* show exists that teaches kids to be whiny little brats?"
Chuggington,"Yeah it's Thomas the tank where they brick up the engine. I think he requests it though. Shit man that just flung me back almost 30 years.

And I've just flung you back 8 years (assuming you still Reddit, under this account.)"
Chuggington,"We also call Sir Toppum Hat ""The Fat Controller"" in the UK"
Chuggington,"Okay. When I was growing up, the title card always said Thomas the Tank Engine. I think I have flicked past to see it's now Thomas & Friends."
Chuggington,It just doesn't feel right to have him called that
Chuggington,"Let your son watch seasons 1 to 3 of spongebob, everything after that, never let him see. Unfortunately the shows quality has fallen REALLY hard since 2004. I would recommend every child seeing those seasons only."
Chuggington,I always felt like Fireman Sam should have a much larger role in the day to day management of Pontypandy.  He should be mayor or something more than than solely a fireman.  From what I can Sam and the chick firefighter (i want to say her name is Penny) are the only competent people in the town.
Chuggington,"I like Spongebob but if you wanna talk about how cartoons were more logical or less annoying in the '90s, Spongebob is a poor case in that point. He isn't always an annoying little shit but he often is and there's no denying that. It's kinda a point of the show. "
Chuggington,The way people go on and on I can't help but think my kids are the only ones in the world who are capable of watching this show regularly without turning into whining monsters. 
Chuggington,The first few episodes I saw growing up here in the U.S. he was called The Fat Controller.
Chuggington,"He's both, surely. "
Chuggington,What is this !!!! What?
Chuggington,"Thanks for the heads up.
I have found *lots* of educatainment content for children without resorting to Spongebob or the Purple Dinosaur or the annoying Veggie Tales.
We avoid violent content like Rescue Bots and Mutant Ninja Turtles as well.
"
Chuggington,"Agreed.
The complete nitwit fire commissioner should have been jailed for incompetence.
I think that Sam should have held a town meeting and asked the town to lock up Norman, and his Mum.  Then the town would be safe from fire at least, and could then concentrate on the fisherman and lighthouse keeper who were constantly falling overboard or off their lighthouse tower, and also concentrate on all the fools who went up a ladder and then got stuck on a tile roof somewhere.  The whole show is how *not* to be safe, including the folks who fight fires, save for Sam, the only competent person in the entire town."
Chuggington,When they pass through the fire they will be consumed or become stronger for having survived.
Chuggington,"I watched Recess and did not turn into a sneaky, resourceful elementary school kid who treated the playground like a POW camp."
Chuggington,"That is because in the US, it was realised that they could hardly call him the ""average-sized controller""... So his real name was used in the american accent dubbed versions"
Chuggington,American accent versions? I thought they were the same narrators in both the U.S. and the U.K.
Chuggington,"If its not narrated by Ringo Starr, then it's not real Thomas The Tank Engine, IMO.

Source: Old school British Thomas fanatic."
Chuggington,"No, the later movies and later episodes all have different narrators for US and UK versions, especially annoying for me, because my son has all the movie DVDs and a lot of the TV show DVDs, but, i also pirated the same movies/episodes of the DVDs we have (for the NAS, for convenience), and a lot of them have different narrators to the ones we own, with awful american accents.

There are a few shows that do it, one we have noticed recently because he has started watching it is ""Paw Patrol"", all the dogs and the kid, are all american all the way through season 1, then in season 2, English accent, but if i pirate it, american accent."
Chuggington,"I haven't seen any new Thomas, all I know is that it's all CGI now and looks ""meh""."
My Big Big Friend,"We'll see if they lose more people like you than they gain new people signing up.

They clearly think that this won't significantly hurt them."
My Big Big Friend,My biggest complaint is that the cost is already per device. It shouldn’t matter where the device is.
My Big Big Friend,"I sure wouldn't mind a 1 screen 4k option. As it is now, i just subscribe and unsubscribe in intervals because paying full price every month is too expensive for me."
My Big Big Friend,I travel for work. I shouldn’t have to tell Netflix I’m traveling. I should be able to just use my account.
My Big Big Friend,I will probably cancel. The price isn't worth it for one household when I can get both HBO and Apple+/Prime instead and even save a few bucks.
My Big Big Friend,"I just cancelled today.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just do what Steam does with library sharing; If someone is using the service, notify the second user that it is already in use and they'll have to wait.  Maybe the person who was using a shared password would get frustrated and get their own account."
My Big Big Friend,People have been threatening to leave Netflix for the past 3 years and yet they keep gaining subs
My Big Big Friend,Feel like I’m in stuck in limbo seeing these copy paste doom of Netflix threads
My Big Big Friend,"Every time Netflix does anything, this sub starts claiming they’re dooming themselves and they’re terrible at business, and then they do just fine."
My Big Big Friend,"They need more subs. This will almost assuredly bring that. If they can turn 1 sub in to 1.1 subs, then that is a success for them at this point, even if it means less revenue. For example, they would rather have two subs paying $7.99 each than one sub paying $19.99 just so they can show subscriber growth. They will recoup the lost revenue with incremental price increases.

It sucks, because I am 100% in agreement with you. I pay for 4 screens, who the hell cares who or where? The answer is that they have tied their value to subscriber growth. But then at least let me have 1 or 2 streams with 4k."
My Big Big Friend,Netflix is up to $20 and cable keeps offering me $40 deals. About to drop my Netflix and Hulu and just go back to cable.
My Big Big Friend,I’m in the same boat.
My Big Big Friend,"They lost me when the only option for a single screen at once was standard def only. I want 4K I still only need 1 screen at a time, not 4. Netflix can go fuck themselves"
My Big Big Friend,For those wanting to cancel because of this (myself included) we should all pick a specific day to do it and leave all at once. The cancelocalypse as it were.
My Big Big Friend,Problem here is that if this doesn't hurt Netflix it won't stop the others from doing the same.
My Big Big Friend,I remember when Netflix was the plucky underdog. The more money involved  in any organization the more about profit over everything else it becomes. Rip.
My Big Big Friend,"As for why the strategy is dumb, for starters it demonizes and insults loyal customers, and loyalty is everything in subscription model businesses.

It also falsely assumes those sharing will happily just sign up and pay.  You can't succeed doing stick only.  You need some carrot.  

Since they decided to break their other big promise regarding advertising, a smarter strategy would have been to make the ad tier pretty limited but free.  No sign up obstacles.  No silly $6.99 fee that they lose money on anyway.  The most successful streaming operation on earth does that.  It's smart.

Just a free very basic taste of Netflix, with ads.  

In an advertising model business, the one and only metric that matters is number of eyeballs.  Making it difficult to view and charging people is deliberately blocking eyeballs.  That's incredibly dumb on their part.  

A free, no-sign up Netflix tier with ads would have been one the largest advertising businesses on earth on launch day.  They would be making bank selling ads, instead of what actually happened, which was that they had to refund the advertisers money because of such low number of eyeballs.

And the whole tier would have served as a 24x7 commercial for people to consider signing up for paid Netflix.

So once they've made that smarter decision on the ad tier, you use that as your on ramp for the so-called ""password stealers"".  

You have them half signed up, so you've lowered that barrier of entry.  You flip them to your free ad tier, but with easy on boarding and generous promotional offers to any of the paid tiers.  They're halfway there.  They have logins.  You just need to tempt them (not vilify them) into inserting their payment info.  

Instead, they treat them like thieves and then expect them to hurdle both on-boarding barriers.

I've said it for many years.  The executives running Netflix are fools.  They got lucky being number one in a one horse race, but when the going started to get tough they resorted to deceptive stock market manipulation, misleading metrics, hiding material information, and dumb strategy after dumb strategy after dumb strategy.  They have the worst run studio in the business and the decisions they made would have bankrupted any other studio fifty times over.  They've survives only on the artificial gravity free environment of debt and other people's stock market money."
My Big Big Friend,Same. I've been on my parents plan since...forever. I'm not gonna get my own.
My Big Big Friend,"To be fair it is up to Netflix what you are priced for. I’m not throwing shade I do the same shit but it has always been against their terms and services to share accounts across households. You, like everyone else, were breaking the terms you agreed to when doing that."
My Big Big Friend,"We share ours with our daughters who live in other houses.  If they try to charge us for that we will cancel.


There is nothing that fantastic on it.  Hell I haven’t really watched anything on there in months.  My wife does watch some things on there but she’d be fine with canceling if we can’t share with our daughters"
My Big Big Friend,"The negative feedback was probably so big, Netflix removed all mentions of this new policy from their help page today. The only thing is you might have to verify a device via a 4 digit code they send per Email."
My Big Big Friend,">Netflix will lose me as a customer. This is really going to backfire on them. CEO is not smart for this one.

Considering your relatives didn't pay for years, they aren't going to miss you."
My Big Big Friend,"If you are paying for four devices to be shared, they are already registered and you should be able to use them wherever you desire.   
Watch the mass exodus."
My Big Big Friend,Then cancel and stop posting about it.
My Big Big Friend,"I will probably be killing my subscription.
That said, the rest of my household would all probably create their own accounts so Netflix will be ahead…"
My Big Big Friend,"Of course there are ""cheats"" who share across several households but I have no faith Netflix will accurately address these people and leave the rest of us alone. If I get a warning or an upcharge, I'm gone. I do not share across multiple households."
My Big Big Friend,I'm thinking of canceling my subscription. My daughter who's away for a month at a time uses it where she has to work.
My Big Big Friend,"Exactly my situation with my parents. If that can't work, I'll cancel and I'll maybe subscribe for a month every year or two to catch up. My parents already said they'd be okay with it cause they barely use it as well. 

I say bring it Netflix! Help me save money"
My Big Big Friend,"If you're paying for Netflix, you're a sucker. Everything on Netflix, and every other streaming service, is on Usenet. For less than $50/year you can download everything and share it with whomever you choose through Plex. To complain about Netflix sharing rules when you've already been getting shafted for years is LoL hilarious."
My Big Big Friend,Subscribe to a VPN and sail the high seas. (งツ)ว
My Big Big Friend,"This is exactly why I just canceled. I don't use it enough to justify subscribing for just myself, but I paid for the extra screens so my kids could use it (I don't even know if they do to be honest). Why not just change it to a family plan like YouTube and Spotify? This seems asinine."
My Big Big Friend,I'm in the exact same boat. I'm thinking I'll just start sending them 20 bones a month and they can start their own account.
My Big Big Friend,Netflix has done focus groups before announcing so they have a pretty good idea how most people will react.
My Big Big Friend,"What I don't understand, is that Netflix's whole schtick is ""gathering data about what people are watching."" So, can't they use that massive treasure trove of data to create pricing tiers based on hours watched? Netflix doesn't have to nitpick about account sharing at all. If they just charged people based on hours, the account sharing people would pay more. That would disincentivize sharing while still allowing it as an option. 

And casual viewers like OP can glean value from Netflix without getting shafted. 

And they ALREADY HAVE THE DATA. They just have to link it to pricing tiers. It would be fair to everyone, allow people to continue doing what they've been doing, and bring in revenue. It's a win-win-win."
My Big Big Friend,"Netflix seem to be under the illusion there are no other streaming options out there and/or that streaming is a necessity not a luxury. 

I'm in no way struggling financially but with a cable subscription, Amazon prime, Dropbox, Audible, Netflix and a couple of others costs add up and I'd set myself a budget for non-necessity services, dropping Netflix and switching to Disney+ means i can now binge watch all the Marvel movies and a load of new shows, win win.

Though whatever the press says we are in a global recession, there's increased poverty, more and more low to middle income families resorting to food banks. Whatever some think, Netflix is a luxury I think they'll continue to see subscriber numbers fall if they force this issue and continue their policy of cancelling popular shows simply to focus on new unproven ideas.

I've dropped Netflix after subscribing for 8 years after recent cancellations, the whole password sharing crap which only hurts low income families who were sharing accounts because college/uni students or parents/grandparents couldn't afford their own subscriptions and the push to further monetise remaining viewers by increasing prices and adding an advertisement driven subscription plan."
My Big Big Friend,I cancelled my subscription and set sail for the high seas as soon on as I heard it was in the offing.
My Big Big Friend,"I sincerely hope they lose a lot of subscribers. If their bottom line doesn't get hurt by this, it will encourage other streaming platforms to do the same."
My Big Big Friend,"Between this and Disney+ increase, I am going to do a full eval of my services. Netflix will be the first to go.

Netflix is biting the hand that feeds. The truth is, if they want more $, they need to expand services. Sell merch right from the service, branch into streaming audio and challenge Spotify, challenge Amazon and start to sell other shit.."
My Big Big Friend,"If they do that, I will cancel my subscription and start pirating their shows. And with that I mean downloading, not torrenting. Because that's actually egal in Switzerland.

Let's see if they reverse their decision or up the lobbying to make it illegal."
My Big Big Friend,"I have no dog in this but will say the strategy they're using here is dumb.

On the one hand I sympathize with customers who have been doing this after Netflix themselves encouraged them to do so, bragged about it, promoted it, promised to keep it, claimed it was a non-significant cost, etc.  Now they're treating their own loyal customers as thieves and overstating the impact?  That's slimy.

On the other hand, very few other subscriptions in our lives allow this kind of sharing, and we all know that.  You can't photocopy your gym pass for three other people around the country.  Your login is your login on most services.  Try logging in with multiple software instances at the same time and watch your account get locked.  So it's a little bit odd to expect password sharing on just one of our many services.  Absent of the fact Netflix promoted it and promised it as a feature, of course."
My Big Big Friend,I just hope that people are more than just talk with their boycott considering this subs track record... And that more people outside this sub finds it just as off-putting.
My Big Big Friend,"Just so you know, unless all four of you are watching at the same exact time, you should drop down to the lower tier. You don't need the 4 screen tier."
My Big Big Friend,Dude Darby is fucking crazy
My Big Big Friend,There's a reason Reed is leaving IMO.
My Big Big Friend,"I am the same, I hardly watch anything, I use it so I could share it."
My Big Big Friend,Waiting patiently for that ULPT on how to get past their rules
My Big Big Friend,"You are exactly right, my family will drop it instantly."
My Big Big Friend,"The last Netflix show that blew me away was Queen's Gambit. To think that was over 2 years ago now is insane! Seriously, Netflix does not produce enough quality shows ona consistent basis for me to keep a yearly subscription. The only reason I do is because I don't want to interrupt my family if they're watching something. Honestly Netflix is going to be saving me money."
My Big Big Friend,I am gonna cancel my account. Aint worth it with the shit content they have
My Big Big Friend,same... everytime you log in from different area.. i mean a lot are mobile users
My Big Big Friend,"I'm in the same boat. Only reason I paid for the 20/month was to share it was family. Been that way for a decade now? I'm not sure. I was one of the first to subscribe when they went streaming options. 

I'll still subscribe but I'll be paying their lowest, non-ad sub 10/month. I very much doubt my family will subscribe too. We'll see."
My Big Big Friend,"Said it before, I say it again, the moment im hit with a message about my password sharing I'll cancel my subscription"
My Big Big Friend,"There was a fight between 2 boys on the playground yesterday, so nobody can have recess the rest of the year...."
My Big Big Friend,I’m considering leaving Amazon Prime after prime music got a huge downgrade in functionality. You end up paying more money for less… so it’s worth reviewing whether it’s still worth what you’re paying. A lot of people are boycotting unnecessary subscription models these days.
My Big Big Friend,"From what you've said, I think Netflix knows this. What they are counting on is that, when you cancel your account, the people who do watch Netflix (like your mom or niece) will then be forced to get their own accounts. So, according to Netflix, by cancelling your account, Netflix will get two new subscribers. Whether that logic will stand remains to be seen."
My Big Big Friend,"For people, like me, who don't have a single home base this makes things very difficult.

It's not that uncommon.  I live in South Florida, and our snowbird population is huge.  They are all going to have problems with this, for example.

I also wonder how does that 31 days work?  For example, if I hit the road for a long trip, 31 days is likely enough for most of those, but when does the count start?  The first time I use the app outside my wifi?  That would be the best case, but seems unlikely.   It seems more likely you could get unlucky and that authorization check happens on day 3 of your trip.  What if I use my netflix to watch movies while I eat lunch at work or on the road?  Do I need to bring my work computer home every 31 days and watch some Netflix there?"
My Big Big Friend,"I'm with you. I will cancel if they go through with this. Someone should do a vote. I don't know how to make a poll on here but I'm super curious what people would say. Cancel, keep paying the steep price even if they charge more for other households, keep paying but kick of outside users by changing password, or open a new account (if you were one of the outside houses that shared but the buyer canceled or changed password)"
My Big Big Friend,"IF they do this. Then let me take my ‘login’ from y sisters account and copy to a new account that I pay for. If I cared enough, I wouldn’t want to lose my viewing history and saved for later list. 

I really only watch on my lunch break at work. Since I pay for prime and Hulu, im not sure it’s worth it for another subscription."
My Big Big Friend,"Been a subscriber since the days of DVDs and will cancel if I now have to pay more for multiple screens. I mean, it’s not Premium TV/movies. There’s less and less I want to watch."
My Big Big Friend,"I pay $20 for the 4screens, if this goes through, ill cancel my sub, i really dont even need it personally, it was always meant to share with family, i have a HACKED firestick with all those programs for free, thats why i cut my cable also"
My Big Big Friend,"I hope consumers just leave and forces them to revert this policy 

They need to find a way to balance their budget over trying to get literally every single person who watches them to pay them.
Netflix literally created this model and it’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle"
My Big Big Friend,I’m in a similar boat. I was thinking about cancelling then I got my parents and AppleTV for Christmas and my mom uses the account quite a bit. I’m thinking about going to a lower tier plan since their TV is 1080p and sailing the high seas for any Netflix content that I want to watch. If I pay for 4 screens it shouldn’t matter where those screens are located.
My Big Big Friend,"Probably going to cancel as well. I don't want to have to log in every 30 days, signing back in to stuff is a pet peeve. Between that and already paying for 4 screens enough is enough. Their programming has gone very back to basic and formulaic anyway. 

I canceled service back in the day when they tried to pull that separating into 2 services crap. They wanted 2 subscriptions if you wanted to order DVD's and stream. We signed back up during their golden period of quality programming. Probably right around when Stranger Things came out."
My Big Big Friend,I'm in the same boat. I pay for Netflix but don't use it that much. I keep it so my parents can use it
My Big Big Friend,"I was trying to figure how to make it work with the 'connect to the primary network once a month thing,' and initially it felt doable, but then I remembered I watch it on my PS console a lot, and there's no way in hell I'm packing that once a month to visit the person who's account I use lol. It'll be easy enough to do for my phone though. 

Besides, to be honest, I've felt for a while now that Netflix isn't worth the cost. There's so much bad content on there that it's a slog to find something worth watching."
My Big Big Friend,"they lost me, I only kept it constantly with a 4 stream plan because my niece and nephews in a different state watched it."
My Big Big Friend,"Hi - so about the new policy it seems people don’t fully understand what it is.

1. You can still share your password. Their new policy is making people _verify_ accounts every 31 days. There are lots of other services who already do this. I share my Hulu account with like 20 people and we constantly have to log back in because there too many devices.

2. Whatever devices you set as the primary household will not have to do this verification every 31 days.

3. Netflix has not specified what the verification process is - it could be like an MFA where someone gets texted a code that you have to input. Amazon Prime and Hulu already do this & it’s a common verification process."
My Big Big Friend,"My mom has the account that I use. She's up there in age and likely has forgotten she even pays for Netflix (It was always meant for me and my brother to use primarily). Once we graduated school she just kept (auto) paying. Both me and my brother live out of state and both of us are very occasional watchers (we're very busy with our careers). The day I log into Netflix to watch an occasional show as background noise and it shows I can no longer watch, is the day I'll proceed to cancel my mom's account. And that will be that. Netflix is insane if they don't realize they're tanking their own company doing this."
My Big Big Friend,Yea pretty much. My guess is the churn numbers will work out in the long run and short run may be less predictable
My Big Big Friend,">They clearly think that this won't significantly hurt them.

They may be thinking it'll benefit them long-term, even if it hurts short-term."
My Big Big Friend,"It's pressure from shareholders that expect growth.
But there is a limit to growth and Netflix kinda hit it.

Just be profitable and stable, but that's and how most companies think sadly"
My Big Big Friend,"Heres the thing.. **Netflix is expecting people to keep current plan (4 screen) $21 and upgrade to share but whats going to happen is people will downgrade to $9.99 or $15.99 (1 or 2 screens)  and others who are shared passwords will not subscribe like they believe.**

&#x200B;

The 4 screen plans will not be needed for millions of people once the sharing ends."
My Big Big Friend,"It's actually somewhat unclear what their executives think.  Netflix executives do some pretty reactionary things, then they use fuzzy justifications and dubious claims to support those decisions."
My Big Big Friend,"Well the problem is much of the modern corporate world is focused on short term growth - even if it harms the long term health. 

To me it seems pretty clear the current crop of executives are looking at boosting short term subscriber numbers to boost share price to make sure they get their contractual bonuses. 

They then leave the company and go somewhere else to talk about how amazing they are at Growth. Then some new schmuck will have to work it out. 

I imagine all the c level executives are looking to get out before stranger things finishes at which point im predicting some big issues for them. 

Their best hope is all the other streamers start banning shared accounts too."
My Big Big Friend,They will say that it was the Ukraine war again.
My Big Big Friend,"This really comes down to if people think netflix content has value.  They have increased their content spend by 10 Billion over the last 5 years.  

If people find value in that this will be a blip and people will moan, but sign up.  If the content isn't worth it people will cancel.

Today netflix is the only streamer who has a sustainable business.  Others are likely going to go down this path to some extent in the coming years."
My Big Big Friend,exactly
My Big Big Friend,I also don’t see how this isn’t going to make it hard if not outright impossible to use Netflix while travelling.
My Big Big Friend,"Same.  I hate having to pay for multiple screens just to get 4K, so I just rotate my streaming services, and only have 1 or 2 active at a time, watch anything that's highly rated on it, then move on to the next one."
My Big Big Friend,Thats smart.. I never did that only because I share and I think about them. But yeah I probably only need Netflix 3 months out of year and of course cheaper plan
My Big Big Friend,"I have prime and hulu and in the same boat.. prime is the best because free shipping but I rarely watch anything same as hulu. 

I literally be lucky to watch somethign on hulu every 3 months and prime once 2 months."
My Big Big Friend,"I have other ideas too, but yes you're right that soft restrictions work way better than their insane strategy of calling their customers thieves for doing exactly what Netflix encouraged and promised to support."
My Big Big Friend,I dont think thats a good idea. People dont want to wait. Netflix started off unlimited though
My Big Big Friend,"Did we forget that period of time in the last 3 years when the planet shut down and all people could do with their free time was stream shows, movies and play games.

Did we already forget?"
My Big Big Friend,Yeah that's what this discourse look like. Netflix is dying post are extremely old at this point and yet they keep growing. I don't think this will in any way endanger them. They'll lose subs and then regain even more like 2 quarters later.
My Big Big Friend,..because sharing is allowed
My Big Big Friend,Netflix has been threatening to kill password sharing since the end of 2021.
My Big Big Friend,"They'll unsub for a month or two and then hear that the new season of Arkane is good and there is some new show everyone is talking about, resub for a month, find something else they want to watch and continue to sub while they wait for the next Netflix outrage so they can comment how they are cancelling their sub again. Rinse and repeat."
My Big Big Friend,"Except that's not true.  They hit customer saturation many years ago.  Netflix execs deceptively started obscuring that by mixing in $4 overseas subs to pad the numbers.  Pandemic gave them a huge relief, but since then saturation and price hikes caused shrinkage.  

Even this recent murky ""gain"" they've announced will be the last time they ever release subscriber growth numbers.  You don't do that because you think the numbers will be good..."
My Big Big Friend,Astroturf PR campaign by the other major streamers hoping to burn out people's outrage over a policy they're going to adopt in six months.
My Big Big Friend,Yeah but look Netflix started at $9.99 and pushed itself up to $21 so now its a different ball game. People can only take so much punishment. Personally this is my first time complaining. The content always been ok not a reason for me to complain
My Big Big Friend,"Im sure the sub is full of exaggerations, but I disagree with ""Netflix is doing fine."" 2022 has been a rough year for the company : unprofitable quarters, the stock tumbled, subscriber counts dropped, lots of employees had to be let go and they have more competition than ever before."
My Big Big Friend,Squid Games will air S2 and people will flock back lol
My Big Big Friend,"There aren't more subs to get.  Not really.  Not good ones.  

Nobody you or I know who would be interested in Netflix isn't already signed up.  

And they've hit price levels that are making people want to cancel.

The true solution is to fix their broken studio and promotions, and to cut content costs.  

That would change the whole game for them.  Unfortunately their executives are incompetent and can't see that more surgical solution."
My Big Big Friend,"[Yes, you do that](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/noboycott.jpg)."
My Big Big Friend,"Very true but still a dumb move to piss off families worldwide. People will cancel because the audacity to enforce something like this while they already increased prices and originally had unlimited screens and made us start paying per screen.

&#x200B;

To many like myself its already been priced in and further increases will result in a downgrade"
My Big Big Friend,"Remember ""*Sharing is loving*"" ?

I mean, paid commission fanart is breaking the laws of fair use but no one prosecutes that because the bad publicity is not worth it."
My Big Big Friend,They will pro ably do it without warning next time which will cause panic and be an even worse reaction
My Big Big Friend,What do you mean? Obviously OP's 20 dollars a month is the only thing keeping them afloat.
My Big Big Friend,What would these entitled people whine about then??
Rosario + Vampire,I'm looking forward to this -- anything by Connelly is worth checking out.
Rosario + Vampire,"I heard it's meant to be a spin off of Bosch but if it isn't then I'll pass.

Casting choices make this look like it's just a CSI clone."
Rosario + Vampire,"Why would I watch this when I could just go watch McConaughey’s performance? We all know which one is going to be better, especially given that this is going to be another case of an uninteresting dragged out show that could’ve just been a movie. Everything has to be a *show* now though, and a *Netflix* show? Forget about it"
Rosario + Vampire,When do the vampires show up?
Rosario + Vampire,I wonder how soon until Ghostface shows up.
Rosario + Vampire,"Wait, this is coming to Netflix? I must have missed that prior, I was thinking this was an Amazon Prime series and it'd have Titus Welliver's Bosch show up in it at some point. Huh."
Rosario + Vampire,"My biggest peeve about The Lincoln Lawyer is the decision to totally ignore Bosch as it is on another streaming platform. Really poor form. The even use Eleanor, Bosch's wife to profile for jurors but never mention her name. 

The could have had their own Bosch  but in this world he has weight. The comment from Micky that he trusts no cops, should have been except one, his half-brother Bosch. The lack of acknowledgement smacks of small mindedness."
Rosario + Vampire,It is. It's set in the same univers. The books are phenomenal. Mickey Haller is also the half brother of Harry Bosch
Rosario + Vampire,It's not. The Bosch spinoff is called Bosch Legacy and they already skirt around the Lincoln lawyer's appearance in the show with a different character on Bosch.
Rosario + Vampire,"How is that a 'given'? You could watch it since it will be based on the next book(s) in the series. It's also not a remake of the film. It worked great for Connelly's other character, Bosch which was adapted into a solid series. The novels are pretty good ,with lots to cover (and like Bosch, work better as a series than a two-hour movie) so if they'll adapt it properly there's no reason for it to be dragged out."
Rosario + Vampire,">  Why would I watch this when I could just go watch McConaughey’s performance?

While McConaughey was great in the role, the movie itself was silly."
Rosario + Vampire,[removed]
Rosario + Vampire,"If I recall correctly, there was a point during pre-production that Welliver was going to be part of it, but then Amazon picked up the Bosch spin-off and that was no longer possible. Would have been nice, but if the choice is between Welliver in this and just more Bosch... give me more Bosch. That show is great."
Rosario + Vampire,"Nah, Amazon doesn't have the right to The Lincoln Lawyer books and they already use the Honey Chandler in place of the lincoln lawyer character in the Bosch show. The only thing they share in common is Connelly (writer of the books) writing on the show."
Rosario + Vampire,"The books are in the same universe. The show being from different production companies and streaming services will not be. Sadly, I wouldn't expect more than a reference a la 'I have a brother who's a cop' or something like that. The rights were up for grabs a few years ago and Amazon could've bought them and make it a proper spin-off but it seems they weren't even interested."
Rosario + Vampire,I know canonically it's the same universe but I'd ideally just want Bosch but Lawyers
Rosario + Vampire,I think it's pretty clear that anyone who dismisses something based solely on Netflix's involvement isn't going to have a very nuanced take lol
Rosario + Vampire,"Because 

1. This is Reddit and a negative comment about Netflix = upvote 

2. They didn’t know it was based on a series of books 

3. They didn’t have their cereal this morning before posting (speculation)"
Rosario + Vampire,Fans of the book series?
Rosario + Vampire,Well there are multiple books in this series and at this point they are not making any more movies with McConaughey. Plus the Bosch tv show is really good. I know this is Netflix so we don't know what the quality will be like yet. But maybe wait for the show to come out first before shitting on it?
Rosario + Vampire,Netflix and the production company that holds the rights for adapting the Lincoln Lawyer books doesn't have the right for Bosch and vice versa. It's why they used the Honey Chandler as a stand in for the Lincoln Lawyer's part on the show during the 5th season of Bosch while this show will replace Bosch with a stand in played by Ntare Mwin.
Rosario + Vampire,Bosch is getting its own spinoff I believe.
Rosario + Vampire,It basically is. It's a lawyer that solves crimes related to his work and clients
Rosario + Vampire,They canceled my zombie mom show so they’re dead to me forever!
Rosario + Vampire,"Yeah, I mentioned Amazon picked it up. I believe it premieres in a month."
Rosario + Vampire,hell the first mickey haller book is really a bosch book
Rosario + Vampire,"The trailer looked awful, along with the acting"
Rosario + Vampire,"the show is great, it breaks conventional storytelling"
Rosario + Vampire,I loved this show. Better than a lot of vampire shows
Rosario + Vampire,love is blind ranks higher than this? i dont think so. i loved this. also i think it should be around ares ranking.
Rosario + Vampire,Just watched this and looking for what people thought of it. Gotta say I disagree with literally everything written here. Great show and I'm sad that there's no season two.
Rosario + Vampire,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Rosario + Vampire,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Rosario + Vampire,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Rosario + Vampire,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Rosario + Vampire,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Rosario + Vampire,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Rosario + Vampire,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. 😪

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Rosario + Vampire,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Rosario + Vampire,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Rosario + Vampire,"I haven’t seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don’t like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don’t want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Rosario + Vampire,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Rosario + Vampire,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Rosario + Vampire,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Rosario + Vampire,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn’t to portray them in a good light...
Rosario + Vampire,"Ruchami’s boyfriend was everything her father wasn’t, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Rosario + Vampire,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Rosario + Vampire,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Rosario + Vampire,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Rosario + Vampire,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Rosario + Vampire,Insular*
Rosario + Vampire,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Rosario + Vampire,"I mean, there’s that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Rosario + Vampire,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Rosario + Vampire,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Rosario + Vampire,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Rosario + Vampire,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Rosario + Vampire,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Rosario + Vampire,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Rosario + Vampire,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Rosario + Vampire,"I’m talking about the “fundamentalist community” in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Rosario + Vampire,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Rosario + Vampire,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they’re depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I’m not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they’re depicting in the show are brutal

And it’s not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to “religion” and it’s no excuse

I would harken back to “big love” - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they’re still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they’re not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding “boo religion”? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Rosario + Vampire,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Rosario + Vampire,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don’t have to “escape” them as is shown in the show. Notice I said “flee” not “leave”. The story depicts an “escape” not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn’t mean either of them are “fiction”, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that’s what’s portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it’s “fiction” unless you’re her.

It sounds like you just can’t handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, “marriage”), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be “marrying the prophet” but it’s forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them “depth” of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today’s stories. So, it’s not an attack on religion, it’s an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute “goodness”. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we’re still holding reverence for “culture”. 

“Women in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex” 

“Well, that’s their culture”

Or 

“I had to have sex with the producer for this role” 

“That’s just how Hollywood is” 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we’re dismantling tradition as a source of absolute “goodness”. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for “traditions” that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it’s not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Rosario + Vampire,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect 🙄"
Rosario + Vampire,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Rosario + Vampire,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Rosario + Vampire,Well said!!
Rosario + Vampire,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Rosario + Vampire,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Rosario + Vampire,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Rosario + Vampire,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the “leaving/fleeing/whatever” people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That’s different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it’s not a reach.

**And it’s not “jackassery bias”. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn’t change that. That’s why I’m saying contemporary society will not tolerate “but it’s our tradition”, if it’s not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Rosario + Vampire,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Rosario + Vampire,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism 😬

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Rosario + Vampire,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Rosario + Vampire,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Rosario + Vampire,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Rosario + Vampire,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Rosario + Vampire,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Rosario + Vampire,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren’t raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don’t see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that’s just not “based in reality” and it’s all “my bias” 

**i’m against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god’s mistake**

This is exactly what I’m talking about, you cannot claim people are being “biased against a culture” when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn’t hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don’t give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Rosario + Vampire,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you’re doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn’t even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less “one dimensional” if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Rosario + Vampire,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Rosario + Vampire,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Rosario + Vampire,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Rosario + Vampire,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Rosario + Vampire,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Rosario + Vampire,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Rosario + Vampire,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn’t know how to support herself outside of her community? That’s the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That’s the WHOLE plot**

No one said “all” ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person’s story who are you to tell them it’s problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that’s not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it’s you who can “piss off”. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you’re fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn’t been so kind to others."
Rosario + Vampire,"The main character is jewish and she doesn’t seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Rosario + Vampire,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Rosario + Vampire,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Rosario + Vampire,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Rosario + Vampire,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Rosario + Vampire,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Rosario + Vampire,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Rosario + Vampire,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Rosario + Vampire,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Rosario + Vampire,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Rosario + Vampire,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
The Inbetweeners,"""Will from Inbetweeners, escape I must. """
The Inbetweeners,"I think the bigger problem is he plays the same type of character. He's not any different to Will in Friday Night Dinner, he simply lacks versatility."
The Inbetweeners,Still a briefcase wanker
The Inbetweeners,"Slightly off topic but Joe Thomas who played Simon in the Inbetweeners has done a good job of shedding the image he got from that show.

Plus watching/listening to him on Taskmaster and Off Menu showed how really odd he is. Like just properly awkward. Almost moreso than his character in the Inbetweeners."
The Inbetweeners,"I feel like he could be in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' reboot, in place of Rick Moranis."
The Inbetweeners,"**Simon Bird: 'I am, a man...'**"
The Inbetweeners,"he won't ever be able to escape it unfortunately, he's got that ""will"" vibe from everything he has ever done. Once he matures past 30/40 and some experience he maybe able to break that typecast."
The Inbetweeners,I can't decide if him being 36 makes me feel old or young. But it does make me feel bad.
The Inbetweeners,"I mean, he was in an EE advert with Kevin Bacon. That’s something!"
The Inbetweeners,[deleted]
The Inbetweeners,Do you think he'd be great in *Line of Duty* as a new antagonist?
The Inbetweeners,"""What a spastic badge!"""
The Inbetweeners,"Well, good luck with that Will."
The Inbetweeners,"Friday Night Dinner is the **MUCH** better show anyway 

tasty bit of squirrel :  ) 

and the neighbor is hilarious"
The Inbetweeners,"A mashup of Deliverance, Blair Witch, and an Inbetweeners reunion would be great. The cast get together for a hare-brained producer's idea of a reunion show. However, things go downhill and the actors, playing themselves, end up in a horror nightmare in which they all die."
The Inbetweeners,Briefcase wanker...
The Inbetweeners,"> They, quite rightly, feel that the whole point of the show was that these idiots are kids going through a phase of their life. The dynamic of having the four of them back together as men would be so different that it would no longer be *The Inbetweeners*. I think a lot of people would be disappointed

I reckon there's enough material in the concept of ""Inbetweeners reunion"" to eventually get a decent Comic Relief sketch out of it one day."
The Inbetweeners,"Personally everything I've seen him in he plays the same sort of character, maybe trying a different role will show his diversity. Although its a catch 22, as a lot of people hiring him want him to play an inbetweeners vibe. Must be frustrating."
The Inbetweeners,His career depends on having been him. Otherwise nobody would be interviewing his ass.
The Inbetweeners,Escaping who from the what? Who is this guy?
The Inbetweeners,I don’t even know who you are
The Inbetweeners,most people dont know what the fuck inbetweeners is
The Inbetweeners,Yea he's the UK Michael Cera
The Inbetweeners,“You have my word”
The Inbetweeners,I used to know him as the Vet from the Harry Hill movie
The Inbetweeners,Perhaps new glasses my man
The Inbetweeners,Neil's Dad is in Fate: The Winx Saga and every time I see him appear on screen I can't help but grin to myself at the bumder scene. I just can't take his character seriously.
The Inbetweeners,The inbetweeners was hilarious.
The Inbetweeners,"Feisty one, you are"
The Inbetweeners,"Have you ever been tested for anything? Like
Aspergers maybe?"
The Inbetweeners,Or he's only getting hired for that type of role. Maybe he's not so versatile in his young awkward guy comedy roles.
The Inbetweeners,Friday Night Dinner was still so very good!
The Inbetweeners,I was thinking the same thing. Pretty much same characters
The Inbetweeners,"And that's why they hired him and he had solid work for near 10 years from it. Who csn blame him?

Now he has to find something else and try to shed that typecasting. Won't be easy but I think he could surprise people."
The Inbetweeners,I think if he wore different glasses or contacts he'd be fine.
The Inbetweeners,"Next up we'll be bitching about Greg Davies being typecast as a lanky, bitter, monstrous old man."
The Inbetweeners,">Like just properly awkward.

He's a proper weirdo who doesn't know how to act around people and I love it."
The Inbetweeners,Has he? He played the exact same character in Fresh Meat and that was years ago now.
The Inbetweeners,"I’ve seen Neil in a few other things now: Todd Margaret, World on Fire, and Edge of Heaven. He’s been very different in each one!"
The Inbetweeners,Was he on season 10? Real...odd...dude?
The Inbetweeners,Yeeeah I was really excited to see him on Taskmaster but he was definitely off-puttingly weird.
The Inbetweeners,I sincerely hope they never make that reboot.
The Inbetweeners,"In his case, it'd be called Honey I Pooed My Pants"
The Inbetweeners,He's already 36
The Inbetweeners,I had no idea it’s been running that long. I think I only watched the first series when it was broadcast in the US.
The Inbetweeners,I could see him maybe playing a Harold Shipman type of smug psycho doctor who thinks he is too smart to be caught.
The Inbetweeners,Too young probably.
The Inbetweeners,"That would be interesting to see him try it lol would be a hard act to follow the likes of Stephen Graham, Keeley Hawes and now Kelly Macdonald."
The Inbetweeners,I'm still pissed their reunion wasn't a proper episode.
The Inbetweeners,"Well, yes, but he means his future career."
The Inbetweeners,"right? no hate here btw, but if you're a barely famous actor it might not be the best thing to distance yourself from the role that put you on the map"
The Inbetweeners,I still say this in that exact voice on a regular basis
The Inbetweeners,[deleted]
The Inbetweeners,He's taking the jobs and choosing to be one note though. James Buckley is no Daniel Day Lewis but he doesn't play Jay in every thing he is in. Maybe Bird is just not as talented as he would like to think he is and can't play any roles outside of what he is comfortably doing.
The Inbetweeners,"Didn't say it was bad just that Bird is still playing in the same vein as Will, maybe just Will after he left college and got a job."
The Inbetweeners,It makes him a good taskmaster
The Inbetweeners,Him walking in on Sian and Alex on that first team task...
The Inbetweeners,He also basically plays Simon in The Festival
The Inbetweeners,"I saw Neil (Blake Morrison) in a play a few years ago, with Les Dennis playing his dad. It was very good - both much better actors than you'd think.

Also saw Simon Bird in The Philanthropist and he played the same slightly awkward intellectual type as in the Inbetweeners. I don't think suitcase wanker was in the script tho."
The Inbetweeners,Neil is the one actor out of those guys who can play different characters. He was brilliant in that comedy where he helps people commit suicide. Night and day to Neil.
The Inbetweeners,I thought he was hilarious particularly as it doesn't seem to be an act at all.
The Inbetweeners,Well... I looked it up out of curiousity and there is a reboot: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11399224/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2
The Inbetweeners,Fucking hell......
The Inbetweeners,no..fuck right off? you have to be kidding me!
The Inbetweeners,He's the same age as Martin Compston (36) and a year younger than Vicky McClure (37)
The Inbetweeners,Its from the Inbetweeners
The Inbetweeners,James Buckley was actually outstanding in White Gold.
The Inbetweeners,Most actors don’t get to pick and choose what they do
The Inbetweeners,"I think its because he plays himself, when ever I have seen him in interviews he sounds and acts exactly like those characters."
The Inbetweeners,"Or when he sort of wants to wait on the top of that bridge with Alex.

Plus in his interview with Ed and James he was really odd."
The Inbetweeners,Got a link to that?
The Inbetweeners,His girlfriend Tara even follows him to The Festival 😂
The Inbetweeners,"According to Ed Gamble it isn't an act. Gamble was super excited for Thomas to be in Taskmaster do the world could see that he is ""the weirdest guy on the planet"" as he put it. 

Thomas himself admitted that the people behind Inbetweeners originally wanted his character to be the cool one but because he is so weird the character ended up the way he is."
The Inbetweeners,Because of course there is.
The Inbetweeners,The show likes having a gap in seniority between AC 12 and the suspect. So they typically cast older for the antagonist
The Inbetweeners,"Flipping heck, I've seen it like 3 times as well. Maybe I should get tested"
The Inbetweeners,Granted he was basically playing a grown up Jay.
The Inbetweeners,Not seen that but he has shown in Rock and Chips and Corporate he is not a one note actor even in other sitcoms.
The Inbetweeners,"Yes, they do. They have agents and managers that may make recommendations but they have to sign on to do the work. It's not like they are child labourers in a third world country here, they have a union on their side in the form of Equity."
The Inbetweeners,"[Yeah, seems like such a nice guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYY6hicR91M)"
The Inbetweeners,They're married.
The Inbetweeners,Yeah he is just bizarre. Also funny how Ed mentions that in the past as well how hilarious it is to see James meeting him for the first time.
The Inbetweeners,"This is true but at some point they'll have to balance out a bit as the main actors get older, depending on how long it runs for (most of the antagonists have been in their early to mid 40s). Although Daniel Mays was around 37 when he was in it as Danny Waldren and it could be an interesting dynamic for them to be similar in age."
The Inbetweeners,I think there’s more nuance to that performance than you’re giving credit. It’s a very sad character.
The Inbetweeners,"He absolutely was one note in Rock and Chips. He didn't act like a younger Del Boy at all, nothing shone through that made say ''yeah, that's Del Boy''. I imagined him to be more suave, but he never came across that way. I like Buckley, I think he's perfect at playing characters like Jay, but he just doesn't seem to be able to break out of that mold."
The Inbetweeners,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rock and Chips, was gutted when they cancelled it. I get why they cancelled it though."
The Inbetweeners,"Region locked for me, can someone make a streamable?"
The Inbetweeners,"Yes but that doesn’t mean they have to act together, and is counterproductive to him shaking the Simon typecast"
The Inbetweeners,"As was Jay in many ways, a sexually obsessed but socially inept guy projecting toxic masculinity to gain approval from his father and friends. It's easy enough to imagine Jay's bullshitting ending him up in sales and his continued sexual proclivities wreaking havoc with his home life. The biggest difference is that Jay had a cock like a McDonalds chip and Fitzpatrick was hung like a horse.

It wasn't said as a criticism, merely an observation."
The Inbetweeners,"Well the showrunner and head writer died, nobody want to piss on his legacy so they had no choice. Shame nobody felt the same about Ronnie Barker so we got shitty Open All Hours and Porridge reboots."
The Inbetweeners,The official video isn't blocked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NYEgDNEWUE
The Inbetweeners,"I suppose you’re right actually, Jay was a very stunted and sad individual underneath the surface and perhaps that White Gold character is a natural progression. But then again, it’s a very different stage in life, so it’s a very different performance."
The Inbetweeners,Yeah I'd rather they cancel it while it's still good than run it into the ground
The Inbetweeners,For me it is.
The Inbetweeners,Any show that can highlight 'buswankers' gets two crisps up.
The Inbetweeners,"It probably helps that Greg Davies (Mr. Wallace) actually used to be a teacher.

Apparently he hated it."
The Inbetweeners,"That  show was brilliant, iconic, a masterpiece"
The Inbetweeners,"Easily one of my favourite shows that I can (and have) watched over and over again and can never get bored of. Even the movies were good and had some great moments. 

I would also suggest the following shows as they are excellent as well: White Gold (so, so good!), Pulling, Friday Night Dinner (has its moments) and Fresh Meat."
The Inbetweeners,"Check out Fresh Meat next, for a similarly realistic take on late teens/early 20´s"
The Inbetweeners,I'm Irish. The Inbetweeners spoke so hard to my 2nd level experience. I watched most of it through my hands.
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"When this released on DVD, all of the original music was edited because every episode featured a cover song of a (sometimes) popular hit.

apologies for the quality, i know a better one exists but cant find it

Edit: The first cut off lyric is Shigeru Miyamoto ! Super dissapointing its not included in this mirror"
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,I appreciate that Fallon didn't go overboard with this one. He just let the music play.
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"HOLY SMOKES this makes me happy. 

I know everyone has their video game memories....but I was in 8th grade when I got the NES. I lived out in the country with a depressed mother and a sister who hid in her room nonstop. 

Super Mario was the BEST. I played it 8 hours the first day I had it...and nonstop the next few years. 

That song is maybe the happiest sound on planet Earth. "
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Where's Koji Kondo?
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Did anybody else notice they practically muted Miyamoto's guitar?

Here's Miyamoto playing again, apparently he also plays the Sitar and Banjo."
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"It's crazy to me that the Tonight Show, which is as mainstream as it gets, played the Super Mario Bros. theme. When I was growing up in the 90s, only ""nerds"" played video games. How times have changed."
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Awesome. Is there an interview with him too in this show?
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,The Roots really are one of the best live bands ever.

The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"It looked like Miyamoto's guitar wasn't plugged in or mic'd up. I couldn't hear his guitar at all, but it looks like he has excellent technique! I wish I could hear how he was playing it. "
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"That was incredibly satisfying. 

Glad Fallon didn't ruin it with some ott shenanigans "
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"Miyamoto is  better and more influential in his field than Einstein, Paul McCartney  and Michael Jordan put together. It's like he invented the theory of relativity, the slam dunk and rock and roll. Then stuck around for another thirty years to advise Stephen Hawking, LeBron and Maynard. He is on my top five list of people to have dinner with, living or dead. I would not be surprised if there is a religion called Miyamotoism that embraces the ideals of play and creativity 200 years from now. What agreat, interesting person."
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,The man is an absolute legend. 
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Miyamoto is still the best!
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Does he age?
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,Seems Nintendo are really on the ball with Switch promotion so far. Hopefully they can keep the hype up until March and avoid another Wii U situation.
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,really need to hear world 1-2 music now
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,I hope that at least one of those musicians is geeking out internally by playing the Mario Bros theme with Miyamoto on stage.

The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"My experience living in Japan has really reinforced how eccentric of a Japanese man Miyamoto is. That country is all about assimilation and standing out, and Miyamoto doesn't give a fuck. He plays the banjo, walks around measuring things, got a job at Nintendo by designing some wacky children's hanger. It makes me appreciate him so much more. "

The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!,"Here again is an example of why I hate that fuck Jimmy Fallon.

Let them perform. It's awesome enough for the viewer to experience the nostalgia and live music performance from the band and Miyamoto, and with TV suspension of disbelief you'd feel like you're sharing in the audience's experience of a cool live music performance.

Then that no-talent piece of shit Fallon has to shoehorn himself into the bit by walking across and doing some stupid shit to get a few laughs.

Sure, it's just a few seconds so I could ignore it. But the fact that he had to shine the spotlight on himself for absolutely no reason other than his ego is annoying as fuck."

Maya the Bee,"For a really long time I thought the Noozles was a fever dream, so glad someone else remembers!!"
Maya the Bee,"I often feel as though I’m the only person who remembers Puff the Magic Dragon. I still remember the theme song. I’m 46, none of my friends have heard of it.

I also remember a Saturday cartoon called The Littles. It was about tiny people (elves perhaps?) that lived in the walls of a house, maybe four inches tall. I have a younger brother who would watch Saturday morning cartoons with me and he doesn’t remember this show, nor does my husband, who also did time watching Saturday morning cartoons."
Maya the Bee,"Oh wow. Unico. I saw that ages ago as a child, I think maybe on the Disney channel? I remembered the puppet master one quiet clearly but everyone around me thought I was insane. I’m so happy some one else remembers this quite dark cartoon for kids. Just rewatched it not long ago (I found an old VHS on EBay) and it is still creepy as all hell. I love it though."
Maya the Bee,"I just nostalgia tripped on Puff the Magic Dragon myself a couple weeks ago, after not seeing it in probably close to 30 years. That was kind of nuts. It's very strange! I had no idea they made more than one."
Maya the Bee,The Noozles is actually also Japanese. The girl's father was kidnapped in Australian animal dimension. Humans were not welcome and the main character had to wear a disguise while there.
Maya the Bee,I just watched three episodes of Puff the magic dragon on YouTube. I recommend it. Barely cried at all over the abandonment of my childhood.
Maya the Bee,"Dear god. Doing research on the Noozles and I was right! This show did get dark!

""About halfway through the series, the show suddenly got more serious as Sandy visited Koalawala Land, the dimension where her friends and many other anthromorphic Australian creatures live and the show's plot grew so dark that by the end of the series, the fate of both worlds were at stake and the mystery of Sandy's grandfather's disappearance is the key to saving them. Oh, and the Koalas of Koalawala are basically human-hating Nazis that arrest and condemn humans to eternal imprisonment on sight."""
Maya the Bee,My mother positively hated Maya the Bee.

Maya the Bee,"It's a big deal that someone is doing it, but it's not a big deal if a kid sees it. 

If a kid notices it and asks a parent what it is, tell them it's a penis and it's an inappropriate place to put it and you don't know why it's there. Most kids will just move on from it and watch the show. If it's a kid that asks more questions that kids usually do, just act like it's a mystery you don't know much about and that they shouldn't go around drawing genitals on things like that. 

It's not like someone hasn't drawn a pair of tits or cock and balls on middle school furniture before. It's unfortunate that people do, even as adults, but to shield your kid from body parts seems a bit silly."
Maya the Bee,"omg. I was originally thinking ""nah it has to be one of those 'only people w/ a dirty mind would see it' scenarios but there's no doubt what that is."
Maya the Bee,"It's always an ""angry mother."" Never an ""angry child.""

Kids don't notice these things and they give 0 fucks. People should stop getting outraged over everything."
Maya the Bee,"Wow, shit that's not even subtle, lmao. I thought this was going to be one of those Hidden Mickeys where it doesn't even look like one."
Maya the Bee,I guarantee that is the first thing my nine-year-old son would have noticed 
Maya the Bee,"The funny think is that no child watching this would ever notice a detail like that in a trillion years, so really the mother who pointed this out is calling it to the attention of way more children than ever would have realized it was there."

Maya the Bee,"When I was a little kid I kinda had this problem...and it's not even that big of a deal, something like 8% of kids do it but whatever. For some reason, I don't know why, I'd just kinda sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks"
Maya the Bee,"I didn't care when I was a kid, but when you grow up though you are traumatized by them. For example, when I was a kid we had The Little Mermaid penis castles, and The Lion King spelling the word SEX in dandelion fluff.

Yeah...going to hardcore disagree on that one, antiheroes are as popular as ever"
Peaky Blinders,Answer: because Netflix didnt make it?????????????????
Peaky Blinders,"Well it’s not a Netflix show but it’s also a highly produced show that’s well acted and expensive and TBH the way networks are cutting shows and quality, we just need to appreciate what we have while we have it."
Peaky Blinders,"It's not Netflix's, that's why. Made by the BBC in the West Midlands"
Peaky Blinders,Oh ya im sure period gangster pieces will fall right out of fashion. We'll never see a period piece about crime lords ever again!
Peaky Blinders,God it's so annoying that people keep referring to this as a Netflix original. The BBC gets a lot of shit nowadays and this is one of the jewels in its crown.
Peaky Blinders,"Netflix didn’t make it firstly, and speaking on Netflix original shows. I’m surprised Netflix hasn’t had a big gangster tv show or police show. Or even something game on thrones esque. Just a bunch of teen stuff or rom coms here and there."
Peaky Blinders,Netflix?! It's a fucking BBC/screen Yorkshire coproduction. Netflix didn't have shit to do with it
Peaky Blinders,Boardwalk empire scratches the exact same itch in an American way it's an HBO show if anyone needs a lifeline with no more peaky.
Peaky Blinders,"Netflix never would’ve made a show like Peaky Blinders, because it’s a BBC creation. Also, when Netflix got involved in Season 5, they forced the crew to change the way it was filmed to shoot in 4K which resulted in it not looking quite as good IMO."
Peaky Blinders,Is it just me or am I seeing thousand of the same comments or replies spammed in this thread? Is it a glitch?
Peaky Blinders,How can they write an entire article and not do basic research and know this is not a Netflix original?
Peaky Blinders,It’s on Netflix but it’s not made by Netflix!
Peaky Blinders,"Firstly, this article has been posted before.

>In a world in which viewers have shifted away from the dark and violent sagas of antiheroes to heartwarming messages of light and hope

This is more popular than ever partly due to the overwhelming success of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones which feature morally questionable main characters.

Look at the current popular shows The Boys, Attack on Titan, Daredevil, Succession and Peacemaker.

Even shows like Better Call Saul, Euphoria and Bojack Horseman show people want dark lead characters."
Peaky Blinders,FYI. It's NOT a Netflix show...
Peaky Blinders,Not a Netflix show
Peaky Blinders,I kind of liked the first season but got lost in the second.  Is it worth finishing?
Peaky Blinders,Love the show but not feeling this latest season as much. Just feels like something completely different. A lot of the scene to scene dialogue is fantastic still though
Peaky Blinders,Warrior. *cough*
Peaky Blinders,"I don't have to read a single word of that article to know its horse shit!  
You're telling me people don't like Dramas with a bad ass anti hero? Not to mention a show with VIOLENCE, GAMBLING, CRIME, AND DRUGS? Oh yeah no one will ever make one of those again.."
Peaky Blinders,"I resent it being called “the Netflix gangster drama”... it isn’t a Netflix original it is a BBC original. Just because it has global distribution on Netflix doesn’t make it a Netflix show.

Hell BBC gets it months and months before Netflix does"
Peaky Blinders,"It is on Netflix, but it’s not a Netflix series lol."
Peaky Blinders,Wasn't it a BBC thing?
Peaky Blinders,BBC bitches!!!
Peaky Blinders,Just getting into! Omg I am like why didn’t I start this show sooner?
Peaky Blinders,"So let me get this straight. This article is saying Hollywood, famous for copying an regurgitating anything with even a little commercial success, is not going to do that anymore. Yeah...."
Peaky Blinders,BBC drama btw
Peaky Blinders,"Just want to vent. Without Polly, the show feels different. Dang I mis her. She is such a fantastic actress."
Peaky Blinders,Pretty sure it was actually a BBC production …
Peaky Blinders,"Probably because it was a BBC production, not Netflix, and Stephen Knight's moved on to other projects already.

He is what people claim David Simon (I believe? Dude behind The Wire and others) to be, only not an overrated writer with meh shows to his name like Simon is."
Peaky Blinders,"Typical Birmingham. Not one mention of the city in this article. We should have used it to market the heck out of the city, but no impact has been made."
Peaky Blinders,Is it because you couldn't understand anything anybody was saying?
Peaky Blinders,"Netflix gangster show? Lmao being on Netflix =/ Netflix produced, and I’m sure there will be a few more attempts at least considering its massive popularity. But I agree the quality could be hard to match"
Peaky Blinders,Overrated
Peaky Blinders,This show is so absurdly ridiculously over the top and I love it.  Won’t be surprised if Tommy becomes prime minister at some point
Peaky Blinders,"""In a world in which viewers have shifted away from the dark and violent sagas of antiheroes to heartwarming messages of light and hope,""

what a ridiculous statement. This person needs to watch The Boys and Invincible."
Peaky Blinders,"Oh no...anyway, just watch Boardwalk Empire, tbh I like it a lot more than Peaky Blinders."
Peaky Blinders,One of the few series endings that was actually good.
Peaky Blinders,"I have this on my radar, any good? Was about to start it this morning, but opted for something else."
Peaky Blinders,"My god doesn’t anyone read other comments before they post. 

Yes it was BBC first. 

And not Netflix original. 

Everyone knows this. 

Don’t need 60 comments sounding like they are breaking news."
Peaky Blinders,"Thank god for that. Hopefully we can get back to high quality crime shows like The Wire or The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire.."
Peaky Blinders,"TIL the guy who wrote Peaky Blinders also wrote the KStew as Princess Diana film. I will not be reductive and say that it's a money job so I have questions.

Edit: clarification"
Peaky Blinders,Best ending since Newhart!
Peaky Blinders,Banger of a show! Kept getting better and the ending was extremely solid imo
Peaky Blinders,"Oooh, rando’s opinion that everyone disagrees with, news at 11. Probably called themselves a “journalist” too. Loved Peaky Blinders."
Peaky Blinders,Ending was legendary
Peaky Blinders,"I know this is an unpopular opinion but Peaky Blinders fell off after season 2 for a number of reasons, most people conflate a very immersive setting with it being a good show. Its not. At a certain point the cinematography is the only thing carrying the show. If you really think about it, do any of the story lines from season 3 onwards make sense, particularly in the setting of the world? Does any of the dialogue make sense when you actually read it? Are the actors doing a good job or are they shouting their lines at each other? Are the characters actually smart or are they saved by deus ex machina? What the fuck is Tom Hardy still  doing in the show when he got shot in the face and was dying of cancer five in story years ago?"
Peaky Blinders,Big black cock make it.
Peaky Blinders,Cus it was shit?
Peaky Blinders,'Gangster drama'? I turned it off when it became a love story.
Peaky Blinders,"Good, let’s do something new. There’s plenty of original ideas out there without playing it safe and following market trends. Of course, they won’t do this."
Peaky Blinders,Hardly a Netflix series ffs

Peaky Blinders,"People have shifted away from dystopian and apocalyptic tales. Cause we get enough of that in real life.
Interesting character work is ALWAYS welcome.
I think station eleven closed the chapter on the former"
Peaky Blinders,I tried so hard to watch this show. I really really wanted to love it. I watched until season 3 and just couldn’t get into it. Maybe I’ll try again.
Peaky Blinders,Would be a shame…Peaky Blinders is by far the best series I’ve watched in years.
Peaky Blinders,I’m trying to catch on but can’t seem to. Should I keep trying?
Peaky Blinders,"For one Netflix didn’t make the show, but…

I also disagree in the sense that if it’s well-made and in a cool setting, you can sign me up for a gangster drama any day of the week. Will never tire of them."
Peaky Blinders,Um...I don't think the author of this article has watched any tv in the past 5 years.  Plenty of dark and violent anti-heroes out there.
Peaky Blinders,"Given that I've read the Shadow and Bone books and thus know what future seasons hold, I highly doubt that."
Peaky Blinders,"Peaky blinders was as good as it was because do the writing and amazing acting,it’s not going to happen again,because,well,the shows done lmao"
Peaky Blinders,"Antihero struggles are the best, everyones human and no one’s perfect, we all make mistakes and the lack of proper redemption arcs in todays media is a disservice to society"
Peaky Blinders,"I just started watching episode one. Im having a real problem with the modern music laying on top of the great set, costume, ect.

Is the rock and roll and other modern music removed anytime soon?"
Peaky Blinders,Just another example of a “journalist” being high on fucking crank
Peaky Blinders,Does this article contain spoilers?
Peaky Blinders,"I don't get it.. most shows even and especially scifi are darker than ever.. a reflection of reality.. most all the shows that have been popular as of late have a pretty serious overtone.. even comedy has to be a bit fucked to make most ppl laugh anymore.. again reflection of everything being so bleak in modern society.  

Humans seem to be most entertained by seeing shows based on situations worse than their own more so than the opposite now so yea.."
Peaky Blinders,I was bummed this season didn’t end with Tommy murdering some Nazis! The role of Mosley was so well cast. I despised him!
Peaky Blinders,"Because ""gangster dramas"" are inherently about specific events in specific times that aren't great fodder for long term regular show material. Boling point drama isn't a status quo."
Peaky Blinders,Bc of all the slow mo and bad music
Peaky Blinders,It costs a lot of money to make?
Peaky Blinders,"It's not a 100% ""gangster drama"" show but Animal Kingdom has been fucking phenomenal since it started. I wouldn't say it's a big leap for fand of Peaky Blinders."
Peaky Blinders,"First season was some of the best television I’ve ever seen.  “Already broken “, broke me."
Peaky Blinders,"I tried really hard to like the show, but at the end I gave up after a couple seasons.

I think the show is well made, but Top Boy is really more of my jam."
Peaky Blinders,Netflix? Put some respect on the BBC's name god damn it!
Peaky Blinders,I’ve never got into it but have meant to. Does it conclude well?
Peaky Blinders,5 minutes of research and this writer would know it’s not made by Netflix.
Peaky Blinders,Their broke Netflix losing customers to better apps.
Peaky Blinders,Well there’s Top Boy so that’s already not true
Peaky Blinders,"Lol, was just coming here to say that"
Peaky Blinders,The Netflix whitewashing is ridiculous. They do the same with Good Place and Star Trek.
Peaky Blinders,NeTfLiX OriGiNaL
Peaky Blinders,😳
Peaky Blinders,After watching the last season I’m surprised it wasn’t made by netflix
Peaky Blinders,Have they not been paying attention to the boys?
Peaky Blinders,That's a big lol take right there
Peaky Blinders,"And they have also never not been popular. They exist side by side with heartwarming shows/movies, and always have for as long as movies and tv has existed.

It is an extremely disingenous take that one necessarily needs to exist in place of the other. Different audiences, or maybe even the same audiences, are perfectly able to sustain both genres."
Peaky Blinders,"Ozark, Yellowjackets, literally a new show a week about someone dying in a horrible way looking at you Staircase, Girl from Plainsville, and Candy."
Peaky Blinders,"I do wonder when that shift will take place.  Trends come and go, and the antihero/everyone is bad actually stories have been going strong for a while and it's getting *exhausting.*  That kind of storytelling only works when it's pulpy fun or if it's really top tier television.


There will be parodies about how ""prestige television"" became synonymous with ""watching assholes."""
Peaky Blinders,Greetings from the boyz
Peaky Blinders,It has been chosen time and time again that people LOVE antiheroes of all stripes and colors
Black Mirror,"A rewatch has a completely different feeling than the first time you watch it, everything feels so much creepier"
Black Mirror,"That was not Kenny's wallet, it was Hectors. Your first point is correct though about him talking to the little kid in the restaurant, but the wallet is wrong. The older man who he met in the hotel room? The one who drove him to the bank and such? That was his wallet. He literally hands it to him and makes the comment that he will pump the gas if kenny goes in to pay and use his card. That is why he messed up putting the PIN for the card at first. It is not his wallet."
Black Mirror,That was not Kenny's wallet it was that other dude's wallet who was cheating on his wife.
Black Mirror,"The most genius thing about this ep is how it subverts the ""save the cat"" trope at the beginning when he interacts with kid. First viewing it's the scene that makes us like him and root for him the rest of the way, then afterwards you realize how sinister it actually was."
Black Mirror,That episode completely fucked with me.
Black Mirror,"Slightly off topic, but my issue with the episode was that the ""reveal"" doesn't really make sense. There's video of him JO, but it would be impossible to know what it was to."
Black Mirror,"I'm rewatching the whole series right now and I'm on Shut Up and Dance, came here to see what others think of the episode and one of the biggest conclusions I'm taking away is that, despite the overall unnerving and unsettling tone, Black Mirror's rewatch value is off the charts. You can watch the same episode 3x and have a different experience each time due to the plot twists and little clues."
Black Mirror,"And this episode is directly after Playtest which also opens with the main character (Wyatt Russell) talking to a little kid to establish them as a good person. They use the same move 2 episodes in a row. I do feel like it was intentional. It lets the writers keep that terrible post-episode realization about the starting scene, but also avoid suspicion early on about what Kenny is doing. It’s an anthology so surely people will watch Shut Up and Dance without having seen Playtest, but many people will have just watched Playtest and even savvy viewers won’t think twice about the opening being anything other than a reflection of Kenny being a nice kid thanks to Playtest doing some pre-episode conditioning."
Black Mirror,When she said they will show a simulation of how how ancient cities were built and then they showed a minecraft building video 😂
Black Mirror,"This show is almost as good as Belgian techno anthem ""Pump Up the Jam."""

Black Mirror,I can only handle 15 minutes at a time. It gets to a point where I get so irritated but it’s hilarious. Internal struggle.
Black Mirror,"One of my favourite Qunks (a Cunk Quote) is  “In the Middle Ages, did they know it was the Middle Ages, or did they just think, ‘this is now’? How did they know they were halfway through time?”"

Black Mirror,"The Ghengis Khan ""Mongoling free"" line nearly killed me, just thrown in there all casual like"
Black Mirror,I watched the first episode yesterday and found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. I was completely sold ten minutes in. The joke about how we can make breathtaking simulations of ancient ruins with modern technology... And then it's just Minecraft footage. Amazing.
Black Mirror,"I don’t usually go in for these shenanigans but this show is unique and edited so that jokes land with perfect precision.

When she was shocked in ep 4 (?) that nuclear weapons are still a thing and that Britain’s stockpile isn’t full of blanks, I was surprised the actress was able to cry so convincingly- your run of the mill sitcom actress couldn’t do it quite like this.

Are the “experts” actors or real experts? I’m almost certain they’re (coached) real professionals in their fields.

It really is a 10/10 show for its genre."
Black Mirror,"They created fire, prolonging their already tedious lives"
Black Mirror,What is this style of comedy called? The Daily Show did it…taking the piss while interviewing experts. Great stuff
Black Mirror,Soviet Onion
Black Mirror,"I just binged everything, I loved it. She's so dumb but with few notes of vulnerability towards the end, and the show often have interesting social comments while deliberately using terrible shortcuts and stupid shit.

I'm gonna try to find the Cunk on Britain one, and hope they do more on Netflix."

Black Mirror,"Is the she the actress who plays the clueless ditz in those ""Death to 2021"", etc, mockumentaries?"
Black Mirror,My mate Paul loves this show.
Black Mirror,I really hope it has Barry Shitpeas in it somewhere.
Black Mirror,I always enjoy Diane Morgan in everything she's in. She's perfectly deadpan in all the Cunk series'.
Black Mirror,I turned this on to have in the background while cooking and ended up bingeing the whole series in one night. The patience of some of these historians and scholars is something else
Black Mirror,"It rubs me a bit the wrong way that that headline is all about Broker. Without Diane Morgan Cunk would not be what it is and dn it, I want her to get credit, not just the man."
Black Mirror,"I didn't know anything about this woman, I watched the first two episodes yesterday and it was great. Also, I watched ""Death to 2021 &2020"". Equally amazing. How I missed that?"
Black Mirror,i like it a piece at a time. it has same effect of Cohen's or Ricky Gervais' comedy on me.

Black Mirror,"Philosophy is thinking about thinking, which sounds stupid, because it is."
Black Mirror,I'm six minutes into the first episode and I've already laughed more and harder than I can remember laughing at anything in the last 10 years sober.
Black Mirror,The trailer is not selling it for me...glad to read it's better than that
Black Mirror,It’s so good. I’m cracking up out loud at least 2-3 times a minute
Black Mirror,"And if you like this, you really need to check out Dianne Morgan's other series, Mandy."
Black Mirror,"Morgan and Brooker have always been pure gold with Cunk and it's hilarious as ever. Now do Wipe again Brooker, you oik"
Black Mirror,Laughed out loud at al-gebra and her discussion of the largest empires (with a very modern reference). I had to replay that segment. Laughed as much the second time.
Black Mirror,It's literally a laugh-a-minute. Loved this show.
Black Mirror,Pump up the jam for 45 seconds has solidified me watching the whole series .
Black Mirror,Managed to watch the first episode of this tonight.  Simply marvelous.
Black Mirror,I’ve watched half a dozen of these.  She’s kind of hilarious.
Black Mirror,Glad to see it's gaining traction! All of them are a laugh
Black Mirror,Wasn’t a fan of her shtick although seems to have landed well enough here
Black Mirror,How history should be taught
Black Mirror,"This entire show is summarized well by rolling stone-

What a ridiculous person is Philomena Cunk. What a very funny show is Cunk on Earth.


If you want to watch the show skip the article so it’s not spoiled."
Black Mirror,Charlie Brooker is funny. A Touch of Cloth is probably the most sorely underrated UK comedy in existence. The second had me absolutely bawling with laughter.
Black Mirror,Oh so this the show's clip I'm seeing on YouTube lately
Black Mirror,"She is hilarious in Frayed. Which was all I knew her from so far as an Aussie, had no idea she was behind Black Mirror."
Black Mirror,They knew?
Black Mirror,I love love love Philomena Cunk and have all her appearances. I even made a tribute to her by [reviewing a great history series in her style.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdoXCfSdjF4)
Black Mirror,I could only get through half the episode. Can’t imagine watching a whole season of it.
Black Mirror,I tried watching last night I couldn’t finish the first episode! Wasn’t my cup of tea tad on the corny side for me.
Black Mirror,Ali G and Mrs Merton level of intellectual pisstake comedy.
Black Mirror,I started watching it.  It's funny but I felt like I was watching some kind of blend of Ali-G and Daily Show.
Black Mirror,"It's a UK show, but it's not on UK Netflix.. figures."
Black Mirror,"Don't miss Cunk on Shakespeare, it's marvelous"
Black Mirror,"I love Cunk.

She would be perfect with a Royals expert to narrate the coronation. Interview a ""Royals expert."""
Black Mirror,"I really appreciate this show as a parody of these kinds of documentaries. Growing up I watched a ton of History Channel and now I watch a lot of old History Channel and BBC docs on YouTube. There is a kind of style to these programs and the Cunk episodes do a good job of spoofing them. I only just learned about her this week and have already watched “Cunk on Earth,” “Cunk on Britain,” “Cunk on Shakespeare,” and “Cunk on Christmas.” I would love for her to do a deep dive series on just the Tudors. I’m sure its success will prompt Netflix to cut a deal with her— I wonder if a series on just American history would work?"
Black Mirror,Ali G successor it seems like!
Black Mirror,“ Kind of like wiping a bit of dried spunk from Gwyneth Paltrow‘s eye”CunCK
Black Mirror,About a year ago some English people told me about the Cunk on shows. They used to have them all on YouTube. They still may. But man she is hilariously deadpan and I love it. Right up my alley.
Black Mirror,Tune in next week when we discuss the Bible and the Koran and finally decide which one is better.
Black Mirror,Watch this it takes a second for it to get funny but once you understand the humor it is absolutely worth it. I already rewatched.
Black Mirror,I’m watching through again-comedy gold. Can she do a stint hosting the US Daily Show?
Black Mirror,"Found cunk last year, and was so happy she's on netflix"
Beyond Scared Straight!,"This has been my favourite show for like 15 years. Whenever people complain about the weird release schedules for shows these days, I can just point out that Venture Bros has been around since 2003, and only has 7 seasons, 81 episodes including the pilot and specials. I believe it's actually the record for the least amount of episodes over time for a continuously produced show.

But it's worth it.

Whenever I think another show may be my new favourite, I watch a couple episodes of this and remember how fucking good it is.

I think I might do that now, actually."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"“You think you’re hot shit in a champagne glass, but you’re really cold diarrhea in a Dixie cup!” One of my favorite quotes ever."

Beyond Scared Straight!,Austin powers: Goldmember came out 2 years before this and the scene with doctor evil in prison with Mini-me feels like it could have been a scene from this episode of venture brothers so much so that i had a memory of the monarch singing it's a hard knock life.
Beyond Scared Straight!,IGNORE ME!!
Beyond Scared Straight!,"A big part of that is probably the fact that Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer do all the writing, directing, design, and a huge chunk of the voice acting themselves.

I believe there’s only one episode of the entire series that they didn’t write."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Same. Fan since the official first episode of Dia de los Dangerous. I adore this show and how weird it is. The only bit I'm kind of sad to see these days is how the latest season releases early online on Fridays instead of being on Network Television so everyone gets to watch it together.

Love the show so much I bought most of the DVDs and the art book when I never buy merch for a show."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I've watched it religiously since the year it debuted and never miss an episode. I was a college freshman then and now I'm 33. I can literally remember different periods of my life and put them in context based on what season of ""The Venture Brothers"" was playing. Oh, season three is when I got that job, season four is when I went back to school, etc. It's almost like that British docuseries that follows people from childhood into adulthood. Amazing that Adult Swim has kept it around this long."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I always get the T-Shirt clubs for each season, and at this point they're the only t-shirts I wear lol.  A lot of them are pretty obscure even if you do watch VB, so its always fun to run into someone who recognizes it.  (literally only 4 people over the past 10ish years, and one gay man who was just a big fan of spanikopita and didn't know the VB connection)."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"The Venture Bros literally predates the Iraq war by 2 months, if that helps put it into context. Still one of the best shows on TV."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Same. In a series filled with amazing quotes, from one liners to conversations, that little bit from Season 1 still remains one of my favorites."
Beyond Scared Straight!,I try to quote this at least once a month

Beyond Scared Straight!,"I thought that TWD was going to be this epic, gritty, realistic view on what would actually happen in a zombie apocalypse. 

I suppose that would have been more about farming and purifying water and dealing with disease and dead bodies than dodging zombies. 

Still... I'd like to see someone do a project designed to be super realistic. It would probably be depressing as hell though."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I wouldn’t be surprised if Robert Kirkman (creator) has a lot of prohibitions on where they can and can’t set the stories. He’s pretty dead set that it’s in the US, there is no discussion of international events, and we never ever find out how it started. 

The show actually made a reference in the first season to France and he was allegedly very angry (the whole sequence involving it was not in his comics)

I won’t give comic spoilers but there’s reasons on why a lot of your premise doesn’t jive based on how he ended things."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"It was sodding awful, slow, turgid shit.

I've seen the rest of TWD and FTWD. TWD lost its way, got good, but currently is in danger of being shit again. FTWD (in season order) was good, alright, excellent, meh, shit, and now amazeballs.

WDWB has such a slow pace. Every episode gives the teens some crap obstacle to overcome. My wife and I were laughing in disbelief when they decided to sleep IN THE MIDDLE OF A FUCKING GIANT TYRE FIRE with no ill effects, no coughing, barely getting covered in ash.

And the premise? The evil people (who I don't care about) after one of the teens because she's a super genius, so rather than asking her to join them (she doesn't know they're evil), they go and kill all her settlement, make her go on a giant cross-country trek with lots of death and stuff, then at the end say ""oh you've been shaped by the trauma, join us""?!?

IT'S. UTTER. SHITE.

The final two episodes were only slightly interesting because things actually happened. The plot moved forwards. The evil people had their motives revealed early on (""we're evil because we don't like competition"" - wtf?) in a scene which felt like it should have been from later in the show but hastily moved forwards to keep people interested.

I'll watch the next season, because I've watched the rest of TWD output, and it's limited to two seasons anyhow."
Beyond Scared Straight!,The characters are so annoying... and they are wearing way too much makeup.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"They should have done an anthology series called The Walking Dead: Year One/Year Zero/Outbreak/Whatever

Every season opens with a new cast during the first wave of the outbreak.  Hell, within a season they could still do time jumps and have cameos from other season or other series."
Beyond Scared Straight!,I was holding out for AMC Presents TWD:Miami.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I think its time we sorta realize how aimless and hard to work with the zombie show concept is. I mean the original TWD had such a lightning start. But it just meaders and drags on. It's just hard to invest in, especially since its not like a short form series, but seasons and seasons of content. The best thing about the show that made it work was its brilliant casting(especially Andrew Lincoln as a lead, that worked wonders) and its amazing production from the makeup , props and production teams. 

I just think Zombie shows are hard to work with, because the only ending you can go to, is either everyone dies, or things just settle down. Or a cure, but that doesn't fit Kirkman's universe. And if you are planning a season or two, ok its not bad, but when you are trying to fill more than a decade's worth of content, well its basically an impossible task."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I finally sat down and binge watched TWD: World Beyond over the past 2 days, and I feel like I totally wasted 10 hours. 

There was just no point to it, no climax or conclusion. It's 10 of hours of 'some stuff happens: the end'."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"They will, in Tales of The Walking Dead anthology series."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Its like this...

Walking Dead = Zombie Apocalypse in the South East

Fear the Walking Dead = Zombie Apocalypse in the South West

World Beyond = Zombie Apocalypse in the North West

I assume a show set in the North East would be boring.  Winter sets in, zombies freeze and become easy to deal with.   I can only assume that what the show really needs is...

a) How the virus started, was it man made?  Did a meteor shower bath the planet in a virus?  Give us some kind of flash back origin story?  Nobody gives a fuck about how people went from being normal to PTSD, we already know. 

b) How is society pulling itself up from the bootstraps?   Cant be all small groups of thieves and hunter gatherers.  We see a helicopter take Rick Grimes away.  We see Eugene and company encounter a group of ""storm troopers"" and instead of following up on that story, they make is sit through episodes of filler before they give us that followup and its weak sauce followed by more filler episodes. 

c) Why are people still fighting zombies hand to hand?  Nobody is making ethanol to burn entire herds? Nobody is making leather/wooden armor to prevent infectious bites.  Nobody is creating herd highways leading into open coal mine pits for easy disposal.  10-15 years into this zombie apocalypse, nobody has figured out how to make it easy to dispose of walkers without risking lives."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"The World Beyond had a good start with the introduction of the CRM. If you’re into the show like I was because of that, there’s just one more scene at the end of episode 3 or 4 which showed a little more of that group. Apart from that, the show is not good. You’re really meant to buy that these two teenage girls (sisters who don’t look like alike at all) can take on the most advanced society in the TWD world. It’s not worth watching all the way even if you’re a hardcore fan."
Beyond Scared Straight!,I mean it's mostly just for giving us more background on the Civic Republic. Mostly for the Walking Dead movie with Rick. And it's only going to last two seasons.
Beyond Scared Straight!,Maybe do something besides zombies?
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Idk Why I am even still watching this train wreck of a show, maybe because everything else made in 2019-2021 sucks balls.. political shit thought them one way or the other.. No imagination just indoctrination,  no art.. 
This show, wtf Alot of the main characters are over weight but were on the road searching and  Scrounging for food and water,  becoming jedi/ninja, with stone ,wired sticks, walking for days. Ok cool you were fat when you left, but you'd be skinner by now, not bigger in season 2.. I Don't care if somone if fat, don't get it twisted, but if ya want a believable show, maybe have some standards. Honest based off little over seens shit like that, the writers and directors, do not care about the story line and making it somewhat believable, just pushing bs out for a paycheck.. idk"
Beyond Scared Straight!,"yeah, it was so bad and the characters insufferable, the 12 year old girl on the main show is a better actress than anyone on the this one, and also as a survivor she would outlast any of these idiots"
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Yeah but this week's episode which aired last night or the night before was an Instant Classic. Getting to know Negan's backstory was bound to be full of emotions and it did not fail to live up to all the hype. 

That being said, I'm glad next season is the last season but I enjoyed these ""bonus"" episodes we got the past month or so and it gives me hope that the show will continue to redeem itself."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I liked TWD up to about the point of Woodberry. At that point they FUBAR’d the entire show up so bad.

The original Negan storyline was a bit of a revival but then Rick just went and fucked off and there went the show again.

FTWD has a chance to revive the series but messed it up.

The only hope to revive the series would have been a just pre and then just post outbreak focused series, ending maybe around the time of FTWD season 3 but that aint gonna happen.

I hope AMC can rebound with good programming again in 3-5 years, similar to the post Sopranos/Wire slump of HBO before GOT but I am not that hopeful."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"They already ruined the main show almost 10 seasons ago, there should be no expectation that a new show would be any better."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Terrible show, but at least they did a surprising trick of Hope being the main character instead of that disgusting Iris.  That was a pretty good misdirection and surprising."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I downloaded season 1 to watch over my 12 hour nightshift, having heard nothing about it.

Halfway through episode 2 I turned it off and went back to work because I legitimately felt more bored by the show than I do by my monotonous production line job."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"A while back there was a reality show called ""colony"" or something like that. Bunch of random people have to work together to make water and get food. No zombies, so a little more realistic. It was ok, not the most exciting thing ever since you know the show isn't really going to let them starve or get hurt."
Beyond Scared Straight!,Realism is boring.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"The Road novel has the depressing part down if you want somewhat realistic apocalyptic world. It's so bleak though that it's oftentimes tough to get through, so be warned.

I haven't seen the movie but I imagine it somewhat captures the spirit of the book."
Beyond Scared Straight!,[deleted]
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> I suppose that would have been more about farming and purifying water and dealing with disease and dead bodies than dodging zombies.

I mean, there was a brief flu arc in season 4 that dealt with this and it's one of my favorite parts of the show. Granted I haven't gone back and revisited it, so it might be shit, but still."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Read the original comic. It remained pretty consistent instead of making drastic changes at the behest of execs.

Ultimately it is about the people, but it shows more of what you are talking about."
Beyond Scared Straight!,Netflix black summer was what I want out of a zombie show.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Yeah I don't understand what is happening with the quality of TV shows, and movies the last 10 years. It's like they will give a budget to ANY piece of shit someone comes up with no matter how shitty. Job #1: Pay the writers, Job #2: check if what the writers came up with is any good. Seriously.. pay a teacher to grade movies & shows like a homework assignment. WTF industry!?!?"
Beyond Scared Straight!,">He’s pretty dead set that it’s in the US, there is no discussion of international events,

Any idea why? Seems unnecessary. Like it's fine if his stories thus far haven't gone international but I don't see a reason to be against it."
Beyond Scared Straight!,What are you talking about? There’s a whole novel set in Asia.
Beyond Scared Straight!,I doubt Kirkman has any creative control at this point.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Wait, is FTWD watchable again? I was so disappointed what they did to the show after S3. Even more than with TWD"
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Danger of being shit again? It was *one* bad episode, and these bonus episodes were made during the pandemic with hard Covid-restrictions. TWD has been excellent for two seasons now, and it will most likely continue that way in the final season. News from the set is that they’ve spent nearly two months just for making the first three (!) episodes. ""Here’s Negan"" is a living reminder of what they can achieve."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"TWD has been hit or miss for me too, but I dropped FTWD after Season 1 because I thought it was one of the worst shows I'd ever watched. I'm shocked to see that season 1 is considered one of the *good* seasons."
Beyond Scared Straight!,That sounds like the most repetitive anthology possible.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> They should have done an anthology series called The Walking Dead

I mean they will be doing that once the main show ends. It's called Tales of The Walking Dead. It will be doing episodes focusing on old and already dead characters as well as new original stories."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Yeah they fucked up by not setting a game plan for the plot, it was already dragging when Carl and Rick were still in the picture, now that they're not it's dragging even worse but at least it's ending now so oh well"
Beyond Scared Straight!,They better!
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> World Beyond = Zombie Apocalypse in the North West

Since when is Nebraska the north west?"
Beyond Scared Straight!,You raise an excellent point. No other series has the sheer quantity of episodes to show us what humanity can do to improve their situation and yet we just get larger and larger communities with basically the same problems.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> a) How the virus started, was it man made? Did a meteor shower bath the planet in a virus? Give us some kind of flash back origin story? Nobody gives a fuck about how people went from being normal to PTSD, we already know. 

That is not the point of TWD and never should be. It's not a story about the zombies or the virus. It's a story about the people and the world which happened to get overwhelmed by zombies.

That said there have been teases about where the virus came from.

Robert Kirkman once joked that it was a space spore that caused it and in E6 of TWD:WB a soldier mentions that there are rumors that it came from space.

> How is society pulling itself up from the bootstraps? Cant be all small groups of thieves and hunter gatherers. We see a helicopter take Rick Grimes away. We see Eugene and company encounter a group of ""storm troopers"" and instead of following up on that story, they make is sit through episodes of filler before they give us that followup and its weak sauce followed by more filler episodes. 

The Helicopter people otherwise known as the Civic Republic, will be the antagonist in the Rick movie trilogy, for which the first movie is supposed to start shooting thise year but with COVID and Theaters not getting as many people as they normally would nothing is certain.

The Stortroopers otherwise known as The Commonwealth will be explored in the Final Season.The reason these 6 recent episode didn't focus on that or further the plot is because the episodes, weren't meant to be a thing originally. They are bonus episodes created for the sake of us having WD content while the show can start normal production for S11, cause for these episodes, to keep the cast and crew save, they had to restrict it to only a few people per episode. Also due to the sudden decision to create these episodes, they were rushed in writing and shooting. They wrote and shot all 6 episodes in like 2 months. So that's why the quality is shaky.

>Why are people still fighting zombies hand to hand? Nobody is making ethanol to burn entire herds? Nobody is making leather/wooden armor to prevent infectious bites. Nobody is creating herd highways leading into open coal mine pits for easy disposal. 10-15 years into this zombie apocalypse, nobody has figured out how to make it easy to dispose of walkers without risking lives.

People are busy living their lives, or taking care of their communities by creating food, looking for food. They don't have the time or resources to deal with walkers on a big scale. Besides what's the point, the walkers are mainly a nuisance anyway. It's no different from having to deal with wild animals.

Also TWD shows are mainly focusing on small scale settlements with a few hundred people at most. Bigger communities might be doing stuff like that but they are not the focus of the story at the moment."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> a) How the virus started, was it man made? Did a meteor shower bath the planet in a virus?

offered with respect: How does this matter in terms of enjoying the narrative? Would watching TWD differ greatly if we knew for a fact ""there was a meteor shower, therefore **the dead came back**""? versus ""ISIS created a virus but lost control, therefore **the dead came back**"" or even ""the CDC was working on some vaccine but made some huge mistakes, therefore **the dead came back**""

Remembering this is designed to be a horror show, I'd submit to you none of these explanations is scarier than **""the dead came back and WE DON'T KNOW WHY**."" To paraphrase Lovecraft, ""the strongest emotion known to man is fear, and the strongest form of fear is fear of the unknown."" So leaving the cause of the ZombPocalypse unknown & even unknowable makes perfect sense"
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Robert Kirkman said when he first started the comic like 17 years ago that the question of how the virus started will NEVER be answered.

No one cares, it doesn't matter. It wouldn't change the story in any way. It's *completely irrelevant.*

edit- Didn't they do a whole thing where they start manufacturing bullets? Am I misremembering that and it was only in the comic? Eugene starts making ammo so they don't have to fight hand to hand all the time.

And fire doesn't work as well on things that don't feel pain, or need to breathe. You'd just end up with a walking bonfire that wants to hug and kiss you. Project Zomboid taught me that the hard way."
Beyond Scared Straight!,You can just watch TWD and FTWD if thats what you want. Zombies have became an after thought😂
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Yes, Negan's episode was well done. He's such an interesting, complex character."
Beyond Scared Straight!,What bonus episodes are you talking about? Is negan in The world beyond?
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I feel like, at this point, that opinion has become a meme.  The show is, and always has been, a pretty decent overall narrative with a smattering of dog shit episodes thrown in each season.

The majority of the time, the show is still better than the bulk of television being made."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Pretty sure anyone saying that hasn't watched the show in that long.

Or at all.

Besides that, this just doesn't make sense. Quality is not static on anything. Many, many things have had bad entries and then gotten better. *Most* things, even."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"The BBC did a series like that back in 70's called The Survivors, their were no zombies just a few people trying to survey in a wrecked would where the population was down to the last 3%.

They had a lot of episodes dealing with the sheer logistical nightmare barely surviving would be, especially as a large number of the cast were ordinary people with no knowledge of survival. They try for instance to simply grow food for one instance, only to realise none of them know anything about farming.

I'd recommend checking it out if you a realistic look at a post apocalyptic world."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Yeah, now instead of making it a survivor-esque show, make it a horror series where people die and add zombies. 

Who's in? I'll get my camera."
Beyond Scared Straight!,omg I LOVED that show even though it was so fake I liked alot of the survival aspects behind it and it was just fun and I generally hate reality tv shows.
Beyond Scared Straight!,that show was fake as hell though. Good idea if their wasnt a full production mingling with the survivors everyday
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Everyone has their taste. But I like my fantasy with a gritty, realistic base. It forces better writing. It forces writers to write for smart characters, which requires that they be smart as well."
Beyond Scared Straight!,The movie's pretty damn bleak too.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I feel the series would be boring or not based on how much the show focused on those things instead of using them as an motivation for the story. 

Group A murders incoming refugees because they're useless city folk. 

Group B takes them in and trains them. 

Group C takes them in and uses them as slave labor and soldiers. 

Resources for biodiesel could be the source of missions out past the green zone. Replacement parts, weapons caches, medical caches, communications equipment, power or water, construction materials, etc. Patrol and exploration, looking for specific objects or the capacity to manufacture them. And the constant threat of attack by waves of zombies. 

I mean, if you focus too much on the farming and defenses, it could get really boring. 

I also disagree that every group of survivors would essentially become feral or in some way messed up. You cannot sustain yourself from raiding in the zombie apocalypse. It's far more likely a surf level agreement would be reached, where farming communities would be beholden to warlords that would actually have to provide some security instead of take a bunch of things then leave them to fend for themselves."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"The thing is, it would be a very strong ""circle of life"" kind of feel. Within the first 30 days, the landscape would change, and each 30 days after that there would be new problems as old problems abate. And then the cycle would start all over again as you ran into enclaves that were wiped out or started taking casualties yourself. 

Survivors would develop their own language and signals. TWD started doing stuff like this but then just.... stopped."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"He’s been trying to keep it a pretty contained story in that you’re not supposed to know anything else, just what our characters do"
Beyond Scared Straight!,By Kirkman? I think his comic owner has finagled some side shit by others that he’s very not involved in
Beyond Scared Straight!,He did an AMA for Invincible a few days ago and he said he isn’t writing scripts for the show anymore but that he does review the scripts and he is always discussing things with the showrunners. I think his “exec producer” label is more than just a courtesy.
Beyond Scared Straight!,Just watch recaps of 4 and 5 and then start on season 6. Literally nothing happened besides Morgan crossing over.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Thanks to the ""amazeballs"" comment I watched S06 of FTWD.

I shouldn't have.  They made Boring Morgan's eyes bloody (episode 1) and then showed us actual shit (in episode 2).  That's about it.

The quality of the writing & production has not improved in Season 6.  The acting has taken a nosedive.  I loved FTWD S01-S03 - maybe even more than TWD. I really dislike the direction they have taken since then."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"It's certainly pretty good. At the end of season 5 the group (which is nearly completely different from the original group, or even season 3) is captured by a lady called Virginia and must work in her settlements, with Morgan being left to die.

In season 6, each episode is following a different set of characters and their lives, whilst plotting against Virginia, whilst Morgan remains a fugitive. It was pretty damn good stuff, and the best TWD content since the main series introduced the Whisperers. It was a decent level between how gritty and intriguing FTWD season 3 was, and good episodes of TWD."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Not seen ""Here's Negan"" yet but, in my opinion, it was 4 shit episodes out of the 5 bonus ones so far."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I can see two or three short seasons (and I mean like, 8 episodes at no more than an hour) coming out of that."
Beyond Scared Straight!,Season 10 was great
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Robert Kirkman discussed it in the media last week, so I’m hopeful it will happen."
Beyond Scared Straight!,The first few episodes mention cities like Seattle and Portland with communities.  So Mid West by North West I suppose.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"> offered with respect: How does this matter in terms of enjoying the narrative? Would watching TWD differ greatly if we knew for a fact ""there was a meteor shower, therefore the dead came back""

At least we would know, they already made dozens of flash back filler episodes going into great detail on a character and its starting to get boring.  We know why some characters went crazy, its a crazy world and crazy people will do crazy things to people, which turns them crazy as well.  Why not dedicate at least one episode about the origins of this zombie plague?  Dont tell me your not curious as to why this all started?  I sure as hell would like to know, at the very least lets break up the boredom. 

>Remembering this is designed to be a horror show, 

Doesn't feel like a horror show anymore, so many episodes are about the relationship of the characters, or back story filler, it really hasn't been scary in a long time."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Jagarippy, you are wrong that ""no one cares"".  lots of people i'm sure would like to know how the zombiepocalypse happened.    no one is saying that knowing that info would change the story but it's still something many people who watch zombie/infection films like to know (if at all possible)."
Beyond Scared Straight!,Just the end of the most recent season. 5 or so extra episodes.
Beyond Scared Straight!,Considering every season from 2 - 7 (which is where I stopped) had the exact same plot im not surprised people people say it was trash after the excellent first season.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"See, the issue I have with your last sentence is... Yes, it's better than the bulk of tv being made, by pure numbers, sure. But we've also been in a television renaissance for like a decade now. So when TWD fell off (personally that was near the end of Negan for me), all these streaming platforms have so much great content still coming out that I never go more than two weeks before something worth watching comes about.

So I feel like being just better than the bulk isn't good enough anymore. I'd rather watch His Dark Materials for all it's flaws and know that they're gonna complete that story at least."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"that's pathetic that know one really knew the basics of farming. Id say its even lower today given our generation of cellphone fucktards. Im 25 But I can acknowledge I had the privilege of having a great father figure that taught me how to hunt, fish, create/build, work, take responsibility, work towards my future, etc.) It wasn't out of fear of an apocalypse but more of a way to bond and give me the life skills to provide for myself in life. Im thankful to have a father like him because I look around at people my age and they all act like fumbling children when it comes to any problems in life. I dont blame them, though. I blame the media/elites for what they've done and society for letting themselves turn into what the media/elites want them to be. Mindless consumers who cant even wipe their own asses anymore without going to their phone for answers. So many are depressed, anxious, suicidal, lost with no direction, etc. It pisses me off what people have become. but again, i dont blame them."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"That show was on the cusp of something great, IMO. But yeah, it felt way too overly fake for me."
Beyond Scared Straight!,That's fair but also explains how repetitive and stale things can get if you're unwilling to expand the scope.
Beyond Scared Straight!,Interesting! I do think there is something to be said about that. TWD has many problems regardless but shows/movies/books really do shoot themselves in the foot sometimes when they start adding too much background or explanation for some things.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"No, but it’s official and been approved by him."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Good to know. I won't be wasting more of my time with it then, thanks for the warning."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"I definitely agree that most of them weren’t exactly the best, but two out of six (Gabriel/Aaron ep + Here’s Negan) were some of my all time favorites. And I believe that is impressive, considering only 1/3 of the usual crew were available."
Beyond Scared Straight!,The first season was only six episodes long and was an almost literal translation of the first few issues of the comic series.
Beyond Scared Straight!,"That is just wildly untrue, the generic criticism that gets thrown out every time is they go somewhere, someone bad attacks, they move on, rinse and repeat, but there was literally only one location that they stayed at for longer than a week (the prison) until they ended up in Alexandria. The same plot critique is so lazy, there are genuine issues with pacing, poorly choreographed action, and clunky dialogue especially in season 8. But the show definitely consistently had fresh ideas"
Beyond Scared Straight!,">after the excellent first season.

What do you people see in S1? I seriously do not understand  the love this sub has for it.

Outside of the first episode, which btw is already very similar to 28 Days Later, who copied who, I don't know, since the comic and the movie came out very close to eachother, but it's not a particulary original take on the zombie genre. It's suspenseful, and full with horror, and the atmosphere is great, but overall it's pretty fucking generic. Same goes for the rest of the season. Litterally the only good thing about it is the atmosphere. The plots are generic, the characters are stereotypical(Manly man(Shane),Nice Guy(Rick), Geek(Glenn), Old Man(Dale), housewifes(Lori and Carol). It's only in S2 that the characters actually feel three dimensional and interesting.

Also the main thing that bothers me about this season is the walkers.

# #not my walkers

They do not behave like the walkers later on, these ones are smart and fast, and while that might make for exciting TV, it's just not what the walkers should be like. This is an adaptation after all. If you want to intentionally change core parts of the concept of the show, maybe go and do your own zombie show, with full creative control.

I don't see what's the problem there. 

First of all, there is only so much types of story you could do in a zombie apocalypse. There isn't much else you can do other than find a place, fortify place, deal with walkers, deal with lack of resources, deal with humans who want what you have.

That's why the strength and the focus of TWD is and always will be on the characters. You can have much more varied characters than you can plots."
Beyond Scared Straight!,"Can you design a dress? Shape eyebrows? Color hair? Eat gay ass? Attack someone armed with only the knowledge of who they follow on twitter? You aren't any better than anyone else, you just grew up the way you did.  It really doesn't make you any better than people who grew up differently and are good at other things.  Somehow in 2022 we STILL aren't to a point where hunting and farming are relevant for 99.999% of our population. It's ok to say you value those things. It's ok to enjoy or even prefer them.  But to put other people down?  Bro the ENTIRE point of 10,000 years of civilization has been to have increasingly fewer people be increasingly good at providing food so that increasing majority of people can do other things.  It's literally what separates civilized humans from what we were before. It's a feature, not a bug."
Beyond Scared Straight!,What's really annoying is that you can go international without showing people that know what really happened. But you could show different stages better. Like a society that largely doesn't worry about zombies but then boom something goes wrong.

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,BIG THE CAT! BIG THE CAT! BIG THE CAT!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Sick of these stupid spin-off TV shows. If I wake up tomorrow and learn that they've given a spin-off to John Cena's character in The Suicide Squad I'm going to lose my shit.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I still find it hilarious and poetic that it was Nintendo and Sega properties that busted thru to make Video Game movies likeable.

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,A Knuckles miniseries? Please! For the love of God! Don’t let Ken Penders anywhere near this!!!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Sonic 3 & Knuckles. 

Here we have it folks, a TV show about a Monotreme guarding a rock on an island. Still better than the comics where he would fight fucking Nazis or something. Maybe the Chaotix will show up. Or that groovy Clan from the shite DS game with a good story."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Well, this is unexpected. The budget must be big for it to work."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"“With Sega Lock-On Technology, you can watch Knuckles or connect it with other Sonic movies!”"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Does this sh*t make a ton of $$$ in China and Turkey and overseas market? Who sits through this?

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I don’t know if it’s mostly just relief from the rework after the whole initial trailer debacle, or if it really does stand that well on its own merits, but I can say, with absolutely zero doubt…


They definitely did not need to make him floss even once, much less twice."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"You realize the public feedback likely made them 180 on their intended destination with Sonic and WE were ultimately responsible for the success?

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,With this news I’m 100% guessing we see him at the very end for the tease for the third movie! The movie is really fantastic btw if you love Sonic it’s worth the watch.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Don't forget about the Yellowstone spinoffs. I think Paramount is aiming for a series named after every year eventually.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"They saw Disney and HBO banking on nostalgia and went ham! 

Paramount has quite an exciting lineup. It's just too bad the app is actual dogshit."

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Probably pretty unlikely but there'd be a certain amount of schadenfreude if Ian Flynn was involved in writing it, just given how much Penders despises Flynn."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I thought those Ken Penders Archie comics told a decent story with its own interesting mythology.  It's a pity Ken kinda sucks though.  You had Knuckles, deep history of the guardians, a suddenly returned family, an evil technology cult, a former bad guy who was just a severed head, etc. From what I remember as a kid in the late 90s, it had a lot of cool ideas that in hindsight were probably just ripping off ideas from other media I hadn't seen yet.  Not exactly an unheard of thing with Sonic (ie. The Death Egg)."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"> Still better than the comics where he would fight fucking Nazis or something

Wildest thing about that entire storyline is that the echidnas are essentially the British Empire if they airlifted Australia into the sky to serve as their new home, but they're the good guys while *the indigenous people who they've displaced and oppressed* are the ones who become awkward Nazi stand-ins."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,what's your point?
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Do u no de wey?
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I agree! That’s 100% a solid critique. Definitely not a flawless movie lol just good fun. I went in with pretty low expectations so I’m sure that helped.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,You never know. Maybe it was a social engineering by the team.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,with the repetitive steel guitar solos in the background right?

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Not only can I hear this comment, I can see it."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Well there was the Super Mario movie in the 90s, but I assume Detective Pikachu is the one that actually worked. Of course, there have been anime movies for Pokemon for years so it's not like video game movies only started working recently."

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"There was also a bit about a cartoon bee dying of an LSD overdose. 

And also the thing about Knuckles finally meeting his asshole dad and saying he understood why he *had* to be a piece of shit to him and forgiving him for it.

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I see you've never played a Sonic game, since plot has never been a big factor in those, either, but they're still immensely popular and Sonic is still seen as an iconic character over 30 years after he first appeared."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"1) it's not like plot mattered in the Sonic-related media before

2) kids, gamers and Sonic fans exist in English speaking countries"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Pokemon is kind of its own thing. The Pokemon Company was a joint investment by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Nintendo owns about 10% of Creatures and Game Freak operates out of the same building as Nintendo does. 

So Nintendo has controlling share of Pokemon and it's never going to be released outside of their console but they don't own it outright."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"It's not bad per se, but it's not exactly good either. It's very much not traditional Mario either way."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Lemon Sundrop Dandelion. yeah, sure, lemme just take some Mango Despot Mammalian Agave and I'll be right with you.

I started reading Sonic the Comic myself. I am doing a video series where I go over the comics issue by issue. Making whack jokes."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I kind of figured. If they had full ownership they wouldn't have released the same game 50 times. Say what you will about Nintendo, they love to keep things fresh with their big IPs. The newest Pokemon game was a step in the right direction though."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"The one with Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper?  That is definitely a bad movie."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Yeah it’s very bad. Fun, but very bad"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I would give anything for this.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Please god
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.

The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,yes please
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I would be all in
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Yes! Do it! :-)
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I live for this show.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,And Billy Drago :(
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Same
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Just don’t have it on Starz
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,Same!
The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog,You don't know Jack
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Tom Ellis carries this show on his back. If you so not like his portrayal i wouldnt stick with it.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's a procedural cop drama with a fantasy twist. Reduce your expectations. It's fun, but it's popcorn, not Tolkien."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Who's overrating Lucifer?
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,S1 takes quite a lot to pick up but overall it’s a good show.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I find it improved the most in season 4 when it moved to Netflix. 

That said, it will never shake the goofy procedural romance thing, so if that's not enough, I don't think you'll make it that far."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Lucifer's a weeknight procedural drama with the twist that the police consultant is the devil (and he's misunderstood). He has various powers, but only two that he consistently uses: asking people their true desire (which they are compelled to answer truthfully), or to allow someone to see his true face (which scares them). He is also invulnerable to mortal weapons, with an important exception that's a plot point.

It goes more into the lore an backstory of Lucifer later in the series, but fundamentally it was kind of setup to be a cop drama with a twist.

It mostly rides on the charisma of Tom Ellis and Lauren German."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Its pretty good but I feel like it over stayed its welcome. Especially when it started using shitty soap opera tropes. 

Lucifer has an evil twin who wears sweaters all the time. Thats like 70s soap opera shit it cracks me up."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It's a procedural cop show trying to wear the skin of something more interesting.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Season 1 and part of season 2 were pretty good imo but then it got repetitive and they tried to give break off stories to under developed characters I just didn't care about at all 

""DETECTIVE!!!!"""
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's a terrible adaptation of an AMAZING comic book, I suggest reading that instead.  


(Not saying its a bad show, just a terrible TERRIBLE adaptation of the source material)"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Honestly, for all the procedural shows with a supernatural aspect, Lucifer deals with the fact that's he's the Devil far more than most.  A lot of shows would just forget that aspect and run with a Sherlock clone and then have a little story part at the end to deal with him being Lucifer. But the show actually writes it into the cases and ongoing storylines pretty well. And it comes into play more and more as the show becomes more about that then the individual cases.

Just remember you're watching a network procedural show so the network built it to be a ""case of the week"" show and, like all shows built on that premise, they'll keep it episodic for as long as possible so new viewers aren't alienated by an ongoing serial that they needed to tune into each week to understand."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It has its ups and downs. I felt the first and last two season were much better than the middle ones, and the final episode closed things off reasonably well.

If you're looking for badassery all the time (it has some, when Tom hulks out), it's probably not your kind of show."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,its a fun show and i enjoy it but yeah you might want to temper your expectations. Its pulp fiction not high drama
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Season 1 is great and thought out but the rest is drama rittled with plot holes
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"One of my favourite shows tbh. It gets even more interesting, introduction of new characters, interesting story lines. But mostly it's just gonna be a procedural cop show. It does get brighter colour grading wise)"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Keep watching until 9 and 10.. If you're not hooked after that, drop it.

Season 3 is a bit of a let down - too many fluffy (live, die, repeat) episodes. The rest I really liked."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It is fun. It's nothing amazing, but it is a fun procedural about a devil cop. If you like Tom Ellis' portrayal of Lucifer, you are gonna enjoy the show, he is the driving force behind it.


oh, and season 1 is probably the most off in tone - season 2, they do a semi-soft reboot and embrace the campiness


Going into the 6th season, just know it was tacked on - netflix ordered it at the last minute, after they had filmed everything except the finale.


personally, I would not binge the show - just watch it when you want something fun and mindless on screen"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,it gets much better than much much worse than great and then mediocre
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's really weird. I fucking hate it. It is one of my favourite shows of all time. A lot of lost potential.  Tom Ellis is amazing and carried the whole thing. The humour is mostly great, in my opinion. Plus the soundtrack is really good."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,This show started as a procedural but morphed into something else. I feel like it got stronger as it went along.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Good show
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"S1 was amazing and that's how it got to highly rated

When the show was a metaphor about someone literally with a crazy power trip finally meeting someone they can't seduce or bribe and metaphorically coming back down to earth it was great

It was like an antihero story, the secondary characters get ""stuck"" and Lucifer uses his ""power"" (either literal or influential) to fix the problem, learning to be a better person in the process

S2 and s3 were alright too, they still had most of the elements that made s1 good but the quality drop is noticable, especially in the villain

Without spoiling too much, the main villain of s1 was a human, so it was quite tense seeing an otherwise godlike being who punches his way through problems be unable to get rid of someone who he could literally snap his fingers and kill

It was like a low-key good superhero arc

In s2-3, the villans are other being with divine power, and while it's a lot of fun to see callbacks and easter eggs about mythology and religion, being basically omnipotent means there can be a lot of deus ex from either side, which doesn't test the protagonist morally or in terms of powe it's just...how can I force fix this problem

From s4 it becomes a romantic and family drama and it is awful, I mean absolutely dreadful to watch

The audience focus was completely shifted to low iq viewers who cheer for big set pieces, cgi, and romance and it's honestly insulting

There are some good mythological reveals in the final season but the pathetic drama is so painful to watch that your reaction will be ""finally, something interesting"" instead of it being this massive payoffs after seasons of buildup

Bottom line is I rewatched season 1 like 3 times but that's about as far as I can recommend the show"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"found it rather bland, honestly. Like I'm tired of evil characters being good guys in disguise, that's hella boring, what about being evil and loving it, he's Lucifer for gods sake. And Tom Ellis constantly dead stare became a kind of an annoyance"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It’s reminiscent of the show Angel.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I loved almost all the episodes and I am glad netflix picked it up for the last two seasons. Of course there are some parts I wanna poke my eyes out but hey, it's not as bad as it could be. 

The last two seasons are nice to finish out the show. 

Also, remember lucifer is a DC hero so you saw him on Legends of Tomorrow with Constitine."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,unfortunately the devil aspect of it is more of a gimmick half the time. i think when they moved to netflix the show started focusing more on the myth aspect. but for the first seasons it's basically just a cop show and it happens to have a supernatural twist to it. it'd be like if something like csi had a team member who is psychic
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I love that show
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,The will they wont they bullshit gets extremely irritating but other than that i liked the show
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Lucifer is in essence, a direct sequel to the events of what will be S2 of Netflix's Sandman. The show unfortunately is a police procedural, which is somewhat lame. It barely replicates only some of the material it's based on (characters created by Neil Gaimen, Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg). But if you watch S1E4 of Sandman, same Lucifer, same Mazikeen. There is also (on I believe Legends?) a crossover between Tom Ellis's Lucifer, Matt Ryan's John Constantine (also a show that didn't make it past one season) and the rest of the Arrowverse cast on CW)

Netflix's Lucifer owes its existence to Tom Ellis, otherwise the show would have stayed canceled on Fox."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I thought it was okay, until about Season 2. From my viewpoint Lucifer is hyped up by a lot of women and gay men because they think the lead dude is hot."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,My Southern Baptist family watches it it must either be good or bad
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It is one of the better shows of the last 20 years start to finish.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's crap. 

It's especially crap when you realise the actor who plays Lucifer is perfectly cast the same way Constantine was but this strays so far from the source material and ends up being this insanely gay show that has will they won't they romance thrown into it for the entirety of the show and more often than not, the show falls flat on it's fat arse. 

Watch it and get pissed off with every direction they go in and mishandle."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,As far as crime procedurals with a whacky side kick go it's pretty good but don't expect anything more than a crime procedural with a whacky side kick.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I could not get into another cop show where the gimmick is to partner a cop with a gimmick partner (android, woman, ghost, dog, vampire, devil, socialist, Elf, etc).  Gave it 2 episode and then moved on."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"This being *supposedly* based on the brilliant Lucifer character from Neil Gaiman's ""The Sandman"", I was incredibly disappointed and repulsed by the fact that they had the nerve to turn the rich source material into a stupid cop procedural.

To illustrate for people who don't know the comics: 
Imagine you had the rights for a Gandalf series - and then make a cheap Jackass clone where he gets punched in the balls all day and has explosive diarrhea. Only less funny."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I found him to pretty, Lucifer should be scarred by millennia of fighting"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It fades in quality significantly towards the end…it wouldn’t be the first time it has happened after the two leads become romantically involved. Tom Ellis is also significantly better than the surrounding cast and you start to notice more and more as time goes by.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Season 1 is significantly worse than the rest. I skipped most of it and read a recap.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Depends.

If you want a show that's comics-accurate (Lucifer from The Sandman comics gets bored of running Hell and decides to open a bar in LA) then it isn't for you.

If you want a generic police procedural that happens to feature a stripped-down version of the comic character as a sidekick then go for it."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It is mindless fun but not great.

If you want a good ""devil"" show, try Evil.
Give it until Season 2, Season 1 is a bit all over the place."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Its an entertaining time killer.  That's it.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,If you're a pervert and love that kind of guy humor you will love Lucifer.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"The latter.

Go watch Good Omens instead."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Trash
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,This Lucifer exists in the same universe as Neil Gaiman's Sandman if that helps
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It's ok. Not great not terrible.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,The actor playing Lucifer is great but I grew bored of the procedural nature of the show and stopped watching somewhere around Season Two.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I liked it at first but MAN did it go off the rails...
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I hate it when shows about eternal beings becoming private investigators in become unrealistic.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s one of those shows where some seasons are fantastic and some terrible. There’s no inbetween. 1, 2 and 4 are the best of the lot."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Depends on what you want out of it.

As a procedural detective/cop drama it is probably better then its peers.

If you are familiar with the character from Vertigo/DC it is a bit dissapointing.

THAT Lucifer scammed his way into making his own creation as a way to thumb his nose at his Dad.  THIS Lucifer (from the show) has the power to know your deepest desires.

The two don't really compare."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"If you have seen Castle, it reminds me a lot or that, just a different theme. Have reasonable expectations and it can be a fun watch. Don't expect to come away with a more profound view of life or anything though."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"S1 and maybe 2 were ok, then there was a season with the smallville guy which was terrible. then there was the season with inbar lavi which was really good, then it went back to being bad from what i heared."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Both
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It’s a show to watch when you just want to shut off your brain and go with it. Watched it all the way to the final season then got tired of Netflix
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"We finished binging it recently and enjoyed it. It’s not too-tier drama by any means, Lucifer’s story arc ends up being satisfying and enjoyable."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's a stupid premise with terrible acting, but the lead guy is hot and has a British accent so it gets to remain on the air. 

Not a good show, check out any other show on IMDB's Top 250 TV Shows instead"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s a “fun” show and I watched it mainly for the main character. I found the detective less interesting and her acting a little stiff. Lucy, though, is quite fun."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It had slow episodes, but I greatly enjoyed it overall.

But then . . . I like ""big secret reveals"", whether it's Lois Lane finding out Clark really is Superman, M.J. finding out Peter is Spiderman, or the characters in Lucifer finding out . . . ""oh no, he wasn't lying, he really is 'the' Lucifer.""

Some of the reveals make the in-between slogging worthwhile.

I also like ""redemption"" stories.  And some of the side characters ""Lt. Dan"" and Mazikeen . . . have some real turn arounds.

Plus, (I know, I know, it goes against pretty much the entirety of Christian teaching), but I like the idea that God holds out hope for ALL of his children, even Lucifer."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I liked it a lot. Sometimes the whole “I’m Lucifer” and no one believes him gag gets old but has some nice pay offs.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,My wife and I enjoyed the entire series.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I don’t normally like shows with angels and demons. But I liked this one.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's one of those shows that I'm glad I watched. It had a satisfying conclusion after a satisfying set character developments.

Even the Patricia Helfer stuff. I like her, but I'm just sick of seeing her in everything. In this one, she had a great story.

Keep in mind that the final season was produced by Netflix, so it had a slight change of tone and some production changes. They managed to keep in on the rails though.

The best thing is that they stayed true to the in-world rules."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It started good when Lucifer and the demon were actually kind of threatening, but they soon became all creampuff and dumb."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's weird, and full of magical nonsense thinking but It has some very entertaining episodes.  The actors do a great job playing in this silly show.  I loved the George Thorogood and TLC.  Musical episode cracked me up."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It’s basically just a cop show with some supernatural elements. If your not a fan of detective/ cop shows then you might have a hard time enjoying it. The actor who plays Lucifer is the main draw of the show. The episodes are mostly self contained unlike a lot of modern sci-fi/fantasy shows. That can be a plus or minus depending on what you enjoy.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,I liked Reaper better.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Good Show falls off after Season 3 but still enjoyable
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"First few seasons weren't bad, but it quickly got worse. It quickly became noise in the background while I played PC games. I had to force myself to watch the last season just to finish it out."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"it's more like Librarians meets Charmed, if that makes sense, and I liked both of those shows and therefore liked Lucifer, it's not everyone's taste and it doesn't have to be lol"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s fun, pulpy, silly, and melodramatic at times. It’s perfect for a glass of wine and a carton and Ben and Jerry’s."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s a crime solving dramady with the devil…. A less witty, less funny version of psych."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,You should probably stop watching it then.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I watched it a bit and honestly I can't really even tell you the basic premise of the first season. 

Like all I remember is the black angel brother knocking up the woman and Lucifer going back to hell. I don't even remember anything about the female cop"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Later
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Vertigo Lucifer, it is not."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Just going by the marketing, imo, it like the Spartacus of vampire tv shows."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s a good entertainment, campy, sexy, has suspense and emotion. I loved every minute"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Not sure if you were just looking for a new time filler show but I recently started watching Elementary on Hulu and it has been great! Cop dramas are all over the place but I think this was a really good take on a modern Sherlock Holmes.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,You got about as far as I did.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Fantastic first 5 seasons. Last season sucked
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I don't think anyone would ever describe this show as overrated. I liked it, but it was generally hated on here."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It’s fun.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's a damn masterpiece but looks like it was made on a budget at times, but the story is great and Tom Ellis is perfect for the role."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,Watch it and make your own decisions.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It depends. Do you want to fuck Tom Ellis?
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"If you think Lucifer being a good guy and owning a club sounds interesting, then I guess you'd like it."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's an insanely unremarkable show with an absolutely fantastic lead who is killing it. You're watching it to see Tom Ellis chew the fuck out of every scene he's in.

The second lead is so boring that I've watched four seasons and couldn't tell you her name. Chloe, maybe? Doesn't matter. She's a cardboard cut out of a human being.

Later there's a WAY more interesting romantic interest but she gets ignored because she's not the *intended* love interest."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Awful. if you've read the comic, unforgivable."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's okay, and then it's kinda great, and then it's barely clinging on and just limping home."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I'd call it a romance show over anything. If you can deal with 6 seasons of will they, won't they, they did, sike, now will they, won't they. Continue."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,It's just Castle but with the Devil instead of a crime writer.
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's probably my favorite show of all time. I'm maybe on my fifth or sixth rewatch. Despite Reddit's protests, it was one of Netflix's best performers."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"Its pretty fun, but its not that deep. [Even Lucifer himself would agree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXIRt0uG3D0)"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s nothing special, if you don’t like it, don’t continue."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It's been said in here a dozen times, but I'll say it again-

Tom Ellis might as well be Atlas with how hard he carries that show on his back."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"I liked it well enough for most of it's run. But I did binge it after it was all over.

It will drag in places early on since it started on network TV and thus has a lot of episodes to get through."
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"See the comics about it, they were the original version and are so much better it’s not even funny"
The Devil Is a Part-Timer!,"It’s a TV 14 show about Satan. Don’t expect to much, it’s not going to be greatly compelling or complicated. But if you like the lead actor and maybe feel good episodes then you’re in the right place."
Halt and Catch Fire,I don’t want to forget Mad Men. That shit was great.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Incredible show, wouldn’t put it above Mad Men however. With that being said I always felt, and recall, that it was just marketed poorly."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Halt and Catch Fire was a very overlooked show.

But it was not better than Mad Men.

While critics can be wrong, in this case, the overwhelming praise Mad Men received was deserved.  ""16 Emmys and five Golden Globes. The show ... receive\[d\] the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning the award each year of its first four seasons.""  Mad Men dominated its era.

Halt and Catch Fire had a few nominations and a couple wins from lower awards.  It was very good, but not Mad Men quality."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Forget mad men?

Breaking bad and better call Saul were both on amc…"
Halt and Catch Fire,"Halt and Catch Fire is fucking amazing, and Mad Men is one of the greatest."
Halt and Catch Fire,Halt and Catch Fire is incredible.
Halt and Catch Fire,How to be wrong twice? By putting two shows that aren't Breaking Bad in this headline. They are all great shows though.
Halt and Catch Fire,I love HaCF but it has nothing on Mad Men. Mad Men is the superior show by a good degree IMO.
Halt and Catch Fire,Wouldn’t Breaking Bad be their legacy?
Halt and Catch Fire,Rubicon didn't have a chance
Halt and Catch Fire,"If you have even a passing interest in the computer revolution, early internet gaming, and the tech industry, this show is absolutely captivating.  And it's a solid 4-season arc that ends as planned. VERY bingeable.  I just restarted it after first binging it during lockdown a couple years.  This show flew under my radar, as with most people, it seems.

Oh, and the cast is absolutely incredible.  You'll recognize the core 4-member cast, most of whom are stars now in their own right."
Halt and Catch Fire,It had one of my favourite intros!
Halt and Catch Fire,What about Breaking Bad…
Halt and Catch Fire,"Absolutely fantastic. 

The way it progresses and changes every season, is like watching the characters grow up.

I bawled my eyes out in the last season. I don't think any other show has affected me this much."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Loved that show. Lee Pace, Scoot McNairy and Mackenzie Davis make a great main cast. It did character growth really well too; they all evolve into totally different people by the end, but in a natural and believable way. And the ending is really satisfying too.

I don't know about better than Mad Men, to me they're close (and I like them both better than BB)."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Rubicon was awesome, it was never give a chance"
Halt and Catch Fire,Love this show. The intro song is a jam too.
Halt and Catch Fire,"the pay off you experience following the characters into the end of season 4 is *chefs kiss* 

one of the best series i have ever seen. it's not ""better"" than mad men but it's worthy of sharing a spot"
Halt and Catch Fire,I thought Counterpart was a fantastic show.
Halt and Catch Fire,"So very sad that they ended it after 4 seasons. 

This show gave me the biggest cry I’ve ever had in any tv or movie. Just bawling. Cried about it going for a walk the next day."
Halt and Catch Fire,Soundtrack is one of the best ever as well.
Halt and Catch Fire,I enjoyed it but it was so frustrating at times.
Halt and Catch Fire,I agree! Love this show
Halt and Catch Fire,"Maybe if I watch it just one more time, Cam and Donna will finally realize they're a couple."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Ryan’s note in season 3 is so damn good, I have watched this show probably 5 times, very underrated."
Halt and Catch Fire,Mad Men was high quality but man just seeing Don Draper be a piece of shit from beginning to end was real drag. I loved the character arcs so much more in Halt and Catch a Fire.
Halt and Catch Fire,I would rank Halt and Catch Fire in the top 5 television series in history.
Halt and Catch Fire,Laughable.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Both fantastic.

The scene where they’re dancing to Velouria by the Pixies had me close to tears."
Halt and Catch Fire,I had buy a dvd player at goodwill and had to rent the seasons on DVD from my library to see it
Halt and Catch Fire,Disagree about it being better or more legacy defining than Mad Men but Halt and Catch Fire is fantastic and deserves more praise.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Hell yeah. The characters were just beautiful, brilliant souls."
Halt and Catch Fire,That first season was fire!!!
Halt and Catch Fire,Halt and Catch Fire was great
Halt and Catch Fire,How to write a title that will get clicks 101
Halt and Catch Fire,LOL. Obviously Mad Men and Breaking Bad are the true legacy.
Halt and Catch Fire,That's a bold statement! Maybe time I check it out then
Halt and Catch Fire,One of my favorites. Not better than MM. And Joe's storyline shit the bed.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Why do we need to rank these shows against each other? Watch them both. They are both amazing. 

(I realize the answer is because they need stupid content to publish)"
Halt and Catch Fire,"Definitely a criminally underappreciated gem, but I would not put Mad Men below it."
Halt and Catch Fire,Both are amazing shows. Not everything has to be a competition.
Halt and Catch Fire,I love half and catch fire and hate that nobody I know has seen it. But it’s the fourth best AMC show.
Halt and Catch Fire,Expected to hate this. One of THE best series we’ve seen in years.
Halt and Catch Fire,I remember watching it as it came out and fell off after season 1. I liked it but i was bogged down by stuff and dropped it
Halt and Catch Fire,"Great show, 100 times better than Mad Men. I related to the characters more and I’ve loved Lee Pace since Pushing Daisies."
Halt and Catch Fire,silicon valley's darker big brother.
Halt and Catch Fire,Am I the only one who thought Mad Men was boring after about season 3? The plot never moved past him having another affair with some woman. All the characters seem to be stuck in place. The few times they devoted any energy on people actually trying to create compelling ads it was interesting. That however was 5 percent of the show. The other 95 percent was daytime drinking to excess and sloth followed by another formulaic affair.
Halt and Catch Fire,My second favorite show ever… right behind The Leftovers. Pure brilliance.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Yep this has been my favourite show, long before things like Silicon Valley.   I can never get anyone to watch it though."
Halt and Catch Fire,As a middle aged dude this show emotionally touched me like no other. Highly underrated and did not get the credit it deserved.
Halt and Catch Fire,I loved both shows.
Halt and Catch Fire,"I put it higher than Mad Men too.

I loved Mad Men but it felt like there was an extra season worth of filler in there with the agency getting bought again and the ending was kind of unsatisfying to me with how it tied up Peggy's storyline and such. It didn't feel like it had a clear destination but more ran out of steam. It definitely had exceptional high points though.

For HACF, I bumped on the first season, just a bit too fractious for me but it just got better and better for a tight four seasons and wow the connection I made to those characters and the love it's messages about failure, loss and reinvention.

As a software startup dude, I could reflect on my weaknesses as shown in the characters. I bawled non-stop through the final two episodes which was so surprising and cathartic to a non-crying stoic. Mad Men entertained me but HACF unlocked things. That's what proper art can do."
Halt and Catch Fire,One of my favorite shows. But most people haven’t even heard of it.
Halt and Catch Fire,"Well that's certainly a provocative title that's sure to earn some new viewers. 

Source: me. I'm a new viewer lol. Loved Mad Men. Felt like it was a classic novel, or perhaps novella, each episode with the depth of the story told and untold. So if you say something is better, I'm gonna give it a couple episodes."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Thought it was good and declined with each season.

Not sure how it can be AMC's greatest legacy and not Mad Men.

Mad Men for me was the far superior show."
Halt and Catch Fire,"It was a *decent* show, hardly a legacy. They could only go so far having a sort-of stand-in for McAffee without reaching his level of crazy. The Walking Dead, Beaking Bad are at the legacy level, chart-breaking spinoffs are still being spawned."
Halt and Catch Fire,I can’t recommend this show enough. One of the best shows I’ve ever seen.
Halt and Catch Fire,Yes
Halt and Catch Fire,"I loved it but the ending dragged out for 3 episodes. I'm glad it got a proper send off, though."
Halt and Catch Fire,Tried to watch it but just couldn't get into it
Halt and Catch Fire,"Or would be, if they didn't ruin it the last 6 episodes."
Halt and Catch Fire,I’ll do nothing of the sort.
Halt and Catch Fire,Where can I watch it?
Halt and Catch Fire,hell no
Halt and Catch Fire,I watched the whole series and only really liked the first season and a few parts of the rest. Similar to 6 feet under I can appreciate it but don’t personally think either deserve the amount of praise I see on here
Halt and Catch Fire,lol huh. Never even heard of this.
Halt and Catch Fire,Halt and Catch Fire was a fantastic show. But Mad Men and Breaking Bad (BCS probably also in a three-way tie) are undeniably the cream of the AMC crop.
Halt and Catch Fire,You watch your mouth.
Halt and Catch Fire,"I loved Mad Men, The Americans, Breaking Band, Better Call Saul and this series here. All good."
Halt and Catch Fire,The concept of the show had me hooked immediately personally I put it up there with breaking bad as far as consistently great TV shows.
Halt and Catch Fire,I was one of the 10 people who was watching that show week to week.
Halt and Catch Fire,HaCF has one of my favorite TV theme songs as well.
Halt and Catch Fire,That show was fire
Halt and Catch Fire,IM A LET YOU FINISH BUT BREAKING BAD WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME
Halt and Catch Fire,...breaking bad though?
Halt and Catch Fire,That posture is hurting me
Halt and Catch Fire,"Hey it’s great I know, but why forget Mad Men?  Who is pinning these series? Why is everything a fandom battle now"
Halt and Catch Fire,Such a great show!
Halt and Catch Fire,My favorite show of all.
Halt and Catch Fire,Both are great shows.
Halt and Catch Fire,God I loved this show!
Halt and Catch Fire,Who the fuck writes these headlines
Halt and Catch Fire,"I have such mixed feelings about this show. Some great episodes, and then became SO strange and seemingly unrealistic for some episodes. A really inconsistent show, imho."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Halt and Catch Fire is one of my favorites. I personally like it more than Mad Men, and maybe if every season of HaCF was as good as it’s final two I’d agree with you, but overall Mad Men was a better show. 🤷‍♂️"
Halt and Catch Fire,Both are great. Halt and Catch Fire destroyed me in the final season. Superb.
Halt and Catch Fire,"I'd like to watch it again. Strangely enough, the first season was my favourite."
Halt and Catch Fire,Love it or hate it AMC's legacy will always be The Walking Dead.
Halt and Catch Fire,"I love period pieces and especially the 50s and 60s and found mad men too boring to deal with. 

Halt and catch fire is amazing though."
Halt and Catch Fire,Breaking Bad is the best show AMC ever made or will ever make.
Halt and Catch Fire,"I don't know if it's better, but I definitely put it in the trinity of great shows with Mad Men/Breaking Bad (let's lump BCS in with Breaking Bad)"
Halt and Catch Fire,Def loved watching that show every week. amazing cast and some great storylines. always recommended it. but no way it’s better than Mad Men
Halt and Catch Fire,"I could never get into Mad Men for long. I liked H&CF much better, but I am an older computer guy."
Halt and Catch Fire,Breaking Bad >>>> both
Halt and Catch Fire,Lee Pace is such a babe
Halt and Catch Fire,"Every time I think of Halt and Catch Fire, I simply want to start watching again from the beginning.

When I first finished it I jumped right back to episode 1 and it all felt fresher and more real than the first viewing."
Halt and Catch Fire,Agreed!
Halt and Catch Fire,How about you don't drag the show that most people consider one of the greatest tv dramas ever just to get people to watch the other show that nobody saw?
Halt and Catch Fire,"I liked the show but I HATED the Cam character, she was insufferable."
Halt and Catch Fire,"Fucking yes, it's probably my favourite show of all time. Great cast, great era, great storytelling. 

It's kind of like Mad Men without being up it's own ass half the time because it knows it's Mad Men, you know? It just tells a good story with lots of complicated and flawed people."
Halt and Catch Fire,I need to go back and rewatch this
Fullmetal Alchemist,As someone who lost their brother. I couldn’t finish it. Good anime but holy fuck you gotta like having your soul stepped on
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Brotherhood is closer to manga. I will admit, watching FMA first made Brotherhood more enjoyable."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The first adaptation gave an alternative character arc to Lust which was great, did a very good job with showing the horrors of war and handled better Maes Hughes and Nina and Alexander. In the Brotherhood version their story arcs were rushed while in the 2003 version we spent more time with them and did a better job at making me care for them.

Also the Brothers theme is an awesome piece of music and one of my fave anime OSTs."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"It was a really great show. The problem was plot holes. The remake of Brotherhood fixed that, but lost much of the panache, and watching Brotherhood after the original, much of what's going to happen is already known. 

But high marks in creativity, originality, and sheer soul crushing depression. 8/10"
Fullmetal Alchemist,I liked that Edward was actually willing to kill in the original.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"My SO and I just started rewatching FMA Brotherhood and even though I like Brotherhood better overall, I always find myself missing the way the original hits the ground running as well as a couple of other interesting plot points

So I searched all my streaming apps (Netflix, Crunchyroll, Funimation, etc.) and I was sad to find that the original cannot be found in any of them"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"It's definitely the better choice until the plot diverges, Brotherhood's pacing kinda assumes you've seen it and don't want to spend too much time on the beginning"
Fullmetal Alchemist,I always say watch the original for the understanding of the brother's relationship and how much they truly love and will sacrifice anything for each other. And then I watch brotherhood for the better overall story.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I watched the original version when I was in my teen.  It made me feel so sad and depressed about the whole story.  At that time, the original version was so dark with that philosophy, gain something and lose something at the same time. It was really only for adults as I looked back.

When I watched the reboot version, I felt the whole concept was brightened.  The whole story was expanded and developed more.  It was much suitable more for underaged group."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I always preferred the original anime. The much darker, even bleak, tone really shows just how much Ed and Al (especially Ed) tried to stick to their morals as alchemists. The phrase ""Alchemists: Be thou for the people"" rings true to them. When they see the horrors of the world and what other alchemists are willing to do it makes Ed's character arc in particular stand out. And it all comes to a climax when he deals with >!Dante!<, who turns his entire world view on alchemy on its head and tries to prove to him that the idea of Equivalent Exchange is false. Something that Ed and Al had to later admit was true. Al in particular realized that the idea of Equivalent Exchange was incomplete and needed to be worked on until it became true. 

I also have to say the first anime also dealt with human transmutation a lot better than the manga/second anime did. It's very odd that when Izumi and Ed and Al are going over the results of their experiments years later they only now realize nothing happened. As if the possibly decades of other alchemists doing the same thing couldn't clue them in before hand. Or the fact that they didn't check their work at any point afterwards to see what the results were until this crucial point in the story. For scientists that's a very big thing to miss. The first anime shows that human transmutation does indeed result in something awful happening and that alone helped form part of the story and even Izumi's character arc."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I unironically think that the original Fullmetal Alchemist nails the somber tone of the source material more than Brotherhood. Brotherhood is the more bombastic, exciting shonen/adventure series... but something about 2003 is consistently so quietly sad, atmospheric, and personal."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I actually prefer the first one over Brotherhood when I watched them both back-to-back. So did my brother who watched with me. For me, Brotherhood is a tightly written but a typical shonen story, however, the original goes into themes and plot points that I haven't seen any show go into. The connection with the real world was something I loved that I felt was very original, and I much preferred the Conqueror of Shamballa film over the Brotherhood film. Are there plotholes in the OG? Yes, some, but it also has storylines that I felt were unique and original that I loved, which is a type of magic that Brotherhood didn't do which made it fall flat for me. Maybe that's just me as a history nerd who generally doesn't like too much shonen, but that's what I prefer. I also much preferred the serious tone of the original as compared to the funny tone of Brotherhood, especially cause a lot of the jokes felt very inappropriate for me in the situations they were in. Nina's plot hits much harder in the OG as well cause you get to spend multiple episodes with her before her >!death!<.

 I also much preferred Dante as a villain over Father. No demon who wants power, no god, only a human who is afraid to die and wishes to stay young. There’s something cold and horrifying about the idea of generations of bloodshed and horror happening because of one human’s narcissism and fear of her own mortality. There’s something so existentially real about that idea as compared to Father who was kind of evil just for evil's sake."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I’m glad so many people itt still love and appreciate the original adaptation after all these years. I remember being personally very disappointed with Brotherhood but it could’ve been that my experience was heavily painted by 03’s take. Sure Brotherhood sticks “closer to the manga” (not counting all the subtle/small/practical changes they actually made but closer =/= better) but its is less interesting for it imo, almost sanitized. 03 changed a lot because they had to and ended up taking the story in a far more complex and morally grey direction that more fully explores the catalysts and consequences of the characters actions with a focus on the themes of fate, loss, and (ironically) brotherhood that I felt were central to the heart of the story (I may be biased in that regard). The endings perfectly epitomize what both adaptations focus on;

Brotherhood: exciting, flashy, clean, happily ever after, tightly wrapped up

03: grim, harsh, complex, sorrowful, left open to interpretation

At the end of the day the three (Manga, 03, and Brotherhood) really just offer different experiences built on the same premise, each one will take the idea in its own direction with its own charms and faults."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I usually tell people to watch it first then watch brotherhood.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I have a real softspot for FMA 2003, it's the show that got me into anime in the first place. Real fond memories of a school friend telling me to go to this new website called ""Youtube"" and watch it on there with the episodes split into 3 parts.

A lot of people ask which version of FMA they should watch, and I think the answer to that is ""Both of them""."
Fullmetal Alchemist,[deleted]
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I love that both version offer completely different experiences.

Nostalgia wins for me, as I think FMA is superior to Brotherhood. Yes the ending is wonky but I love the character development of the homonculus and all of the personal relationships made by the brothers.

Brother is stunning visually but having seen FMA first I had trouble getting into the later story."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I'm old enough to remember watching the original each week when it aired.
It does deserve more respect. It is better up to a point. The 'ending' of the original is terrible."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Tbh I've always seen FMA and Brotherhood as one experience. I watched both back to back and I got everything I wanted.
Fullmetal Alchemist,Original Hellsing too with that dope intro song!
Fullmetal Alchemist,So glad to see people finally putting some respect on the original's name.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I much prefer the original and it's lower burn over brotherhood. Also the extra evil and grinnesss the show has especially with all the parts involving the sins.


Buuuuuuut brotherhood had a much better ending that didn't feel nearly as "" Ok shit how do we end this "" as the original did."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"What is with this content mill where we’re constantly told X show/movie from the past “deserves” “more” “respect?”

What do those words even mean in this context? Why does a piece of media deserve respect beyond what it’s currently getting based on the number of people who remember it fondly? How do you even respect an old show or measure the amount of respect it’s getting? What even are the stakes if we don’t somehow show more respect for some show?

I just feel shit like this is so lazy. You’re basically just trying to get clicks by saying “DAE remember this show?” It’s a long form version of that YouTube comment asking if anyone is listening to this song in 2022."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I honestly prefer the original, maybe nostalgia but it was so special to me and I didn’t feel the magic of Brotherhood as much."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I like both but the original is more emotionally tasking. The stuff with Wrath is really upsetting to me.

But the ass kicking Mustang gives to Pride is absolutely righteous."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. The original is definitely darker/more plot-driven and more into elements like horror, dark fantasy, and intrigue. And the ending was probably better. However it meanders a bit towards the end, and stuff like Wrath/Bradley were handled poorly compared to the manga counterpart.

The manga/brotherhood is much more a conventional shonen series, is more optimistic, but undoubtedly has a ""fuck yeah"" draw to it, and the main villain is better. I probably emotionally like Wrath vs. Scar more than anything in the 2003 series.

I watched the original anime when it first came out all the way back in 2004 at like 15 years old, watched Brotherhood when it came out too. I still can't decide which is better."
Fullmetal Alchemist," I have to agree. 03’ FMA was what really got me into anime. So much to the point that when the series ended I sincerely didn’t know what to do with my life. Brotherhood is more faithful and the story is better, but I feel the original series has a great charm to it. It wasn’t afraid to be dark and then jump to silly before going back to a serious plotline. I feel I actually cared more for all the characters in the military because they were shown more. 

Brotherhood felt rushed when it came to scenes that happened in the original. Like they wanted to acknowledge them but at the same time be like “yeah you’ve seen it all before on to the next plot beat”"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I prefer fma than fma:b, because of the homunculus justification individual."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I much prefer the tone and pacing of the original. I like the more serious vibe they use when the story is getting dark, it just feels better matched. Events in Brotherhood, like the Nina arc, just don’t get the time they need to be quite as impactful as they were in the original.

I’m also not personally a fan of when anime jumps to the overly cartoonish, bubbly style to express strong emotion (idk what that’s called), and FMAB does this noticeably more often.

I will say the animation in FMAB is stunning and the overall plot is closer to the manga, so it isn’t without its merits."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I will die on this hill that the original FMA is better than Brotherhood. It’s darker and more mature and I really appreciated the slow burn
Fullmetal Alchemist,I could have done without the movie with Hitler and the A bomb.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I'm in the minority, but I prefer the original to Brotherhood.  For me, what makes the series great is the focus on the two brothers relationship, and how they mature and grow over the course of the series.  Brotherhood (especially towards the end), ends up as much more of an ensemble piece, and that relationship loses a bit of focus.

The original did a much better job of humanizing the homunculi, Lust's arc especially was fantastic.  The brothers confrontation with Sloth as well.  The manga/Brotherhood tended to use them mostly as super-powered obstacles, which made for some amazing action sequences but missed out on some of the depth that made them so memorable in the original.  

And I know this one will be a controversial opinion, but I will die on this hill.  Dante is a significantly more interesting big bad than Father.  Father was a well executed take of your run of the mill ""I want to be a god!"" shounen villain that pretty much every other anime in the genre ends up dealing with.  In contrast, there was just something so refreshingly real about Dante's entire motivation being driven completely by fear of death.  It's far more relatable as motivation, and makes her feel more real as a character.

That said, the original wasn't without flaws.  There are definitely some contrived plot points (especially towards the end), and it also has a fair amount of monster-of-the-week type filler episodes early on to pad out the source material.  

Bonus points: The original has a better OST, and a significantly better colour pallet.  The subdued yellows and browns fit the tone so much better than the bright primaries of Brotherhood."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I still believe the best experience watching FMA is watch the original up to the diverging point, and then switch to Brotherhood.

Even when writing Brotherhood, they knew that no matter what they did they wouldn't be able to top how good the original show was as an adaptation, up until the diverging point. So they didn't even bother, and just rushed through all that stuff. 

I'm honestly surprised that people who've only seen Brotherhood have such a high opinion of it. But I guess that can be explained by they don't know what they're missing, up until the original series diverges, that is."
Fullmetal Alchemist,The original Fullmetal Alchemist manga on which both shows are based deserves even more respect still.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I vastly prefer the themes, characters,  and general ""war is bad"" message of the original."
Fullmetal Alchemist,The ending to the original was one of my favorites and the homunculi were handled better in my opinion it made the story's even deeper and darker and the way the gate of truth was handled was alot better in my opinion
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I will say, the only way the FMAB felt so much more complete (imho) is because I was already familiar with the original anime. I doubt i would feel as fondly for Brotherhood if I hadn't had already watched the original."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Yes the original FMA hit stronger. The whole Nina scene was much more impactful in fma than fmab
Fullmetal Alchemist,They’re actually both very good
Fullmetal Alchemist,I absolutely loved both.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"This is making me want to watch it after I ignored it for all these years. My planned fma brotherhood rewatch may turn out to be a ""finally watching fma 2003"" after all"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I watched the original about a year ago. I’m working my way through brotherhood now. I tend to binge things pretty hard so I don’t always retain much info once I’m done. 

I immediately noticed the pacing of brotherhood was way different. The story was generally the same through 15 episodes or so. But I got to a point where some new characters were introduced and I was like “is this even the same story?” 

I went in thinking they would be largely the same with a couple of differences, but Brotherhood diverges from the original completely. Didn’t find out until after the fact that the original series had to essentially make up their own story since they caught up to the manga. 

That being said, I think I enjoy the tone of the original more. And I feel like it took a more serious approach to some of the interesting philosophical and ethical themes. 

Love both though. Should finish brotherhood this week and looking forward to see how it concludes."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"It absolutey does. It's a fantastic show, and I love that the scale of the central conflict is much more intimate than the sweeping epics that are the manga and *Brotherhood*. The personal relationship with the Homunculi has always really appealed to me, and the connection to ""our world"" was a real stunner at the time.

I do love *Brotherhood*, but this show remains quite special to me."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Unpopular opinion: I preferred the original to Brotherhood
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Brotherhood is more fun, original is more character driven. Arcs move a lot slower, action scenes are shorter and more brutal. It’s much more about two kids learning the harsh realities of the world."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I’ve always preferred the original to Brotherhood honestly. The original adaptation felt far more grounded, focusing more on the characters and themes, and things are given ample time to develop and breathe. The central idea of “everything has a cost” runs through every aspect of the story, right through to the ending, which always stuck with me even after almost 20 years.

Conversely, Brotherhood feels more like your typical battle anime, albeit a very good one. For me, Brotherhood is an example of how “more” is not always better. Brotherhood features more characters, more locations, bigger battles and higher stakes, but it also feels far less personal and the themes feel more superficial. I very much enjoyed watching it, but it didn’t really stick with me like the original adaptation did."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"It absolutely does, it was a great show and I stand by the fact that even after it diverged it remained pretty damn great."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I mean, it's alright. Brotherhood is still way better and it's not even close"
Fullmetal Alchemist,Doesn’t it get an insane amount of respect?
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I love the Mustang, Hughes arc in the original way more, also the Chimera Arc, but i suppose none of those hit as hard as they do the first time, i just feel like Brotherhood goes over them to quickly."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I’ve always agreed with their decision to make the kid Sin of Wrath and the Führer Sin of Pride
Fullmetal Alchemist,It got a lot of respect and enough
Fullmetal Alchemist,Does it? I'm not in to anime and even I have heard of it's praise and adoration. Seems likes it's generally adored and r /espected by everyone who has watched it. Am I mistaken?
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I always strange when an adaptation begins before the source material is finished. Brotherhood ends with a guy trying to become a god, while the original ends with a lady trying to become immortal, the multiverse existing, and the Elric brothers trying to stop WW2."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Who actually watched brotherhood
Fullmetal Alchemist,I thought FMA was always pretty well respected
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I think people tend to forget that FMA was being made as the manga was being made. There was a point int FMA when it had to be completely original. FMABs introduction is so short because of FMA. Basically If FMAB never happened, FMA would be considered worse. But if FMA never happened, then FMAB would most likely have the fleshed out introduction it needed."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I only saw the 2003 version and thought it was cool. Will probably check Brotherhood out too though.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The Shou Tucker/Nina scenes in the originals are far more impactful then in Brotherhood. Brotherhood’s emotional moments just don’t land the same way as they do for me in the OG anime, though it’s still an amazing show in its own right. Never read the manga."
Fullmetal Alchemist,The atmosphere in the first one was darker I enjoyed it more. Brotherhoods atmosphere seemed to light to me. I would like to see the series redone with the atmosphere of the first one
Fullmetal Alchemist,"ppl always say to skip it but FMA handled the beginning arcs way better than Brotherhood, which is the case with most remakes"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The mother's death in the original is always sad to me. If you haven't watched it, don't read it, but the fact that these homunculus retain some of their old memory, so when the mother die again, she embraces them one last time. Every death feels more meaningful, even the villains. MOST of them don't just die because they deserved to die, most of them feel redeemed before passing."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"While I wasn’t a fan of the ending of the original anime, I really liked some of the other changes. Nostalgia probably has a part in this though since it was my first anime 

I enjoyed both honestly"
Fullmetal Alchemist,It is a little weird how little it gets talked about. I think it's the best long anime I've ever watched.
Fullmetal Alchemist,This anime was traumatizing for 11 year old me. The chimera episode is right up there with the “Return the slab” episode of Courage in the cartoons that ruined my childhood.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I love the darker tone of the original & the fact that the homunculus were born from people attempting to bring people back from the dead(idr if that was apart of brotherhood). I also loved how Wrath was teachers kid, with Ed’s missing body parts and that Envy were Ed & Al’s older brother from hundred of years ago"
Fullmetal Alchemist,The music in the first adaptation is unmatched.
Fullmetal Alchemist,I still have trouble distinguishing why there are two different ones. I watched FMA not Brotherhood. Should I watch Brotherhood? Am I missing out on something?
Fullmetal Alchemist,Isn’t it widely considered to be one of the best animes of all time? I wasn’t aware it needed ‘more’ respect - I think this and Cowboy Bebop are the two most commonly listed ‘best’ mainstream animes?
Fullmetal Alchemist,Nah brotherhood is the better one of the two sticks closer to the manga
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Brotherhood is way better. The ending in the first anime was absolutely trash and totally cucking, brotherhood definitely does a better job all around"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The original will always be my favorite. Brotherhood had a tighter plot and better action, but 03 characters resonate with me more."
Fullmetal Alchemist,The first two seasons of S.A.C. deserve even more respect
Fullmetal Alchemist,Who the fuck hasn’t been respecting FMA ‘03? This is pure weeb clickbait
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Both are great, but I felt something was missing in the original series. Plot holes? Or maybe a lack of a proper resolution. Not sure. 

Brotherhood, after watching the original first, made SO MUCH SENSE and it was all tied together."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The original FMA is superior to Brotherhood, fight me.

(I mean not really fight me, I'm boozed up for the first time in a long time and trying to sleep, but...)

Like goddamn Hellsing Ultimate, ""Here let's add some chibi shit and pretend it's more edgy and mature."" (The abridged version was better than base-Ultimate.)"
Fullmetal Alchemist,Brotherhood may have an epic finale and canon second half... but does it have [TINY MINISKIRTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJUlTg3mfTo)!?
Fullmetal Alchemist,Didn’t they get ahead of the manga and just make up their own story from there?
Fullmetal Alchemist,">Jackson notes in their article, “Its characters end up essentially back   
where they started, miserable, and the show doesn’t even have the   
decency to explain how or why it was worth it to watch them emotionally   
stand still.” But this feels like an unfair critique of a series that   
spends the grand majority of its duration exploring emotional turmoil.   
In fact, if I was being harsher, it is emblematic of the way television   
has conditioned audiences to want happy endings instead of nuanced   
storytelling. Every mildly ridiculous thing FMA does in its 51 episode run (and its sequel film Conqueror of Shamballa)  
 contributes to a larger understanding of these characters, their   
emotional journey, and the philosophy they find themselves questioning   
along the way. Its willingness to get dirty while exploring all of these  
 things, and its not-so-clean-cut finale, are simply reflective of the   
way we, and its characters, approach reality. 

I agree with this.

>As cliche as it sounds, it’s not about getting to the end, it’s about the journey itself. FMA is at its best when exploring dense material, rather than sidelining it for jokes and action the way Brotherhood does. And it deserves to be seen. 

And this. This article makes a lot of great points, thanks for posing it."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"My biggest gripe is they didn't bring over some of the FMA OST music into Brotherhood. The music is still carved into my brain some 17 years later. 

I loved them both but one thing that always bothered me about Brotherhood was the more ""anime"" tropes like the tiny Panda and the midget girl. They're so cringey in an otherwise fairly adult show."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I feel like some people on this thread are remembering the original through pretty rose-colored glasses. Yes, FMA does handle a few plot points better than Brotherhood, and yes, I can definitely understand how some people would prefer its darker, more introspective tone... but Jesus Christ, there's a lot of stuff in FMA03 that's just terrible.

Remember Frank Archer, [the random side villain who is brought back to life as a cyborg](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/9/99/Gallery_49158_1458_38168.jpg) and stomps around for half an episode before promptly being killed again?

Remember all the ridiculous filler episodes, such as the one where Ed and Al meet a cat burglar and help her steal money so that she can keep a hospital from closing down? (Yes, that's actually real.) Or the one where Mustang's crew think a warehouse is haunted, but it turns out to just be a dog? (Again, also real.)

Remember the insane ""big twist"" that [alchemy draws its power from holocaust victims through a magic portal to WWII-era Germany?](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/c07b1662-ad9f-42dd-a6fa-62c6a9900f29/d306dfa-8e95c98c-2b51-4fe8-a6ba-eaab5d22e38c.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2MwN2IxNjYyLWFkOWYtNDJkZC1hNmZhLTYyYzZhOTkwMGYyOVwvZDMwNmRmYS04ZTk1Yzk4Yy0yYjUxLTRmZTgtYTZiYS1lYWFiNWQyMmUzOGMuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.RJsai8-ytpjbFQxNztgEre3QVN-nkoSnnYFhydlPch4) I mean, ""fanfic-tier"" is an understatement - it's one of the most stupendously asinine twists I've ever seen, and it makes no fucking sense after even the slightest thought.

A lot of people say that they prefer the ending of FMA03 but I feel like they're just remembering its nihilism and assuming that makes it ""deeper"". Personally, I found the final ~5 episodes of FMA03 to be confusing, arbitrary, pseudo-philosophical clusterfucks. Sure, tonally they're pretty edgy and cool, but in terms of storytelling they're totally incompetent.

Brotherhood has flaws, but I don't think it has any that seriously jeopardize the quality of the series as a whole.

Bottom line: if you want to experience the story in the best way, read the manga!"
Fullmetal Alchemist,Absolutely based.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I will argue with anyone that wants to that even the ending of the 1st anime is much better.

In the manga/brotherhood, the protagonists discover the true villain behind everything - some alien creature from an extinct civilization or something. They fight it and win and get their bodies back.

There's not really any lesson there. Their original mistake in trying to resurrect their mother was having the hubris to think they could break the rules and get with no consequences, but in the end it turns out they can do exactly that. The typical Shonen anime message - work hard and you can do anything.

In the 1st anime, Edward discovers that his entire quest has been hopeless. There's no perfect way to get their bodies back, because alchemy in every form, not just philosopher's stones, relies on blood magic. They've just been repeating that same mistake they made when they tried to bring back their mother - messing with things they didn't really understand.

So Edward does what he always should have done - he faces the consequences. Now he's stuck in a world with no alchemy. He still has hope in science, but he's going to do it the right way from now on, with no shortcuts."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I think a lot of the love for the first adaption is nostalgia. I watched again and the main villain’s motives are so lame compared to Brotherhood.
Plus Brotherhood is how the story was actually written."
Fullmetal Alchemist,No it doesn't. The second half was fucked up trash.
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Brotherhood had a better ending, but the original is a masterpiece and irreplaceable."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Agreed, but not the movie"
Fullmetal Alchemist,Fma 2003 is the dark and mature version where nobody but Al has a happy ending
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I only remember one thing clearly about FMA: When they finally animated the canon episodes, it wasn't as good."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The start of the original is better and homunculus creation is very interesting but brotherhood is superior overall. Its almost perfect from start to end. Brotherhood also has my 2 favourite characters Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong.

Imo If someone has time then they should watch both."
Fullmetal Alchemist,ED…WARD?
Fullmetal Alchemist,I made a comment that fma 2003 was better than brotherhood on r/anime  and got downvoted to oblivion
Fullmetal Alchemist,"I love FMA and FMAB but I think FMA did a better job with the Homunculi, while I may not have liked Wrath I liked how he had a connection to Izumi, same thing with Sloth and the Elrics it made defeating the homunculi more of a personal struggle"
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Really great show, but little bro overshadowed it too much"
Fullmetal Alchemist,The pacing in the original was better.
Fullmetal Alchemist,I prefer this version over Brotherhood by a mile
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The original is a great show. The problem is, it’s not as great as Brotherhood. I always tell people to watch the original first, because if you watch it after Brotherhood, it just feels like an inferior knockoff. If you watch it beforehand though, with nothing to compare it to, it’s an absolutely fantastic but of television in its own right."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The first half of the first season of the original anime is the single best iteration of the series out there, including the manga. Imo, while there were great moments after that, the writing and story declined heavily. Then the ending of the first series was really bad. I still enjoy it because I grew up with it, but when I switched to the manga, it felt SO good."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Big brother?
Fullmetal Alchemist,I genuinely preferred the development of some characters in the original anime.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"This last weekend I watched the first three seasons again, and I was sad that we are not going to see many more episodes.

I hope they can also reacquire No Reservations."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Well hot damn. Time to eat dinner, watch some nextflix and then be starving again by the end of the episode. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Just started watching after I heard the news of his passing. I had never really watched or read anything by him so I decided to start watching Parts Unknown recently. Holy shit, to my surprise it isn’t just about eating food. It’s actually a fucking powerful ass show about culture around the world. Much respect for the guy and may he rest in peace"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"So glad about this, although I’m too sad to watch it again just yet. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Only available in US, just an FYI international brothers and sisters.

Edit - apparently some countries still have it available, Canada does not."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Honestly, his death made me want to never watch his shows again, because I'll just be sad about it.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the notion of celebrating what he did in life, but I'm still going to be sad watching him and knowing that he killed himself and won't be doing this anymore."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,[deleted]
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Any word on when seasons 9, 10, and 11 are coming to Netflix?"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"
His suicide hit me hard. *Hard*.

I'm not a big food guy. I like *eating* it, but I hate *making* it. I have only become decent at it thanks to Reddit.

I enjoyed the way he looked at life. I never had the exact same addiction issues that he did, but I share some of his problems. I like my drink. But I knew through him that a passion for life goes a long way.

I'm pissed with him, but at the same I miss him. We had far more in common than I'd like to admit.

RIP Anthony."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I just started watching Parts Unknown a few weeks ago. It was my first encounter with Bourdain and it made me really sad to hear the news. I'm glad they're extending the run, if anything to let more people see the world as Tony did with an open mind and heart."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I wish they brought The Layover back. That was a great show of his (didn’t last very long) but it gave a good overview of the “must go to” spots in major cities all over the world if you only have 48-72 hours to check out the local grub spots. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I've never watched Anthony Bourdain, and I have Netflix. Anyone have a recommendation on episodes I should watch first?

EDIT: A lot of varied responses, thanks a lot! From the discussions and votes I think I'm going to start with Tokyo, Iran, and Scotland."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,honestly I am still in shock about his death. it's not sinking in. I am having trouble with it. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I have certainly been watching some episodes this week. Let them roll for awhile please. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,The Christmas episode in Manila is just brilliant.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"He lived several lifetimes. He lived a full life, saw more of the world than most."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"yeah i just ...cant do it 

too much sadness for me to watch this shit right now 

maybe in 6 months. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Watched a few episodes over the weekend, hearing him go into the deeper meanings of life with people from all over the world really strikes a deeper chord now."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"normally i would say ""oh look corporation cashing on on celebs death""

but here... he was such an inspiration to so many... i think we need a little time to process and say goodbye in our own ways"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"God damn it, Netflix.  We're so sick and tired of being treated like  a second class streaming citizen up here in Canada.

You guys never even gave us Parts Unknown!  Can't we have the same library of flix to choose from as our American counterparts?"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I'm sure this is going to not be a popular opinion, but I think they should keep the show going. They can call it ""Anthony  Bourdain's Parts Unknown"" and have celebrities continue the series. A new one each week. Or even regular people who are open to experiencing a new culture. This would keep his legacy alive and keep informing the populace about other countries in an entertaining way."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Binge watched this on the weekend.. That Episode when Tony was in Italy, where the host was throwing frozen octopus and a bag of frozen seafood pretending to have a secret fishing hole still makes me cringe up to this day."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Everyone should watch the Russia episode and get a great laugh

Edit: [specific clip I was referring to for a laugh](https://youtu.be/wL8VsH8Xb_I)"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I hope they put the rest of the series on there, right now there's only like 8 seasons."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Watched this all weekend, this one really hit me harder than most. 

Watched the Mass episode where he talks about the opioid epidemic as only an addict could. The Tokyo episode on the other hand is hysterical. He was the best at showing a place exactly as it is. and having a beer in his hand in every scene hah"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"God has a sick sense of humor, he takes away Anthony Bourdain and leaves us with Guy Fieri. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Bring it to Netflix Canada Damnit! 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Started watching his show with the reacent news and I was surprised by the creativity shown in each episode. My favorite example is in Season 5 where he went to Korea and it was all edited and written to go in reverse order. The show is very creatively refreshing when compared to today's regular daytime television. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"*I took a walk in this*

*Beautifuuuuuull woooooorrrld*"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"The premise seems a little out there. Does he have a ""Parts Well Known"" where he travels to various chain restaurants in the Midwest? I'd love to hear his take on Chili's fajitas."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Ashamed to say I never watched this but I’ve always liked Bourdain. I’ll start it tonight!
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Kinda related I guess? , but anyone know if there’s anywhere you can stream The Layover? We have Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"We love him in Canada too. How about we get that neibourly love, Netflix."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Will they have the infamous LA episode with David Cho?
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I can't bring myself to watch his work right now. I don't know if I'll ever be able to again. I'm just shattered that THIS GUY committed suicide. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I will never forget the time he tried to feed some hungry kids in Haiti and started a riot. He expressed sorrow at leaving that kind of footprint trying to do something good. 
He will be missed and I will no longer hide my depression to make those around me comfortable. "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Some fans have noticed that Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown was scheduled to come off Netflix US on June 16. As of today, we’ve extended our agreement that will keep Parts Unknown on the service for months to come."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Everybody... I'd like to share my weird story.  I never really was a big fan of him, always had a snobby air to his personality and the show was one that my friend's mom would have playing in the background.  After all the news about his death, I figured ""hey, everyone on reddit adores him, he must not be that bad.  I'll check him out tonight"".  So I randomly threw on an episode, completely random, one of those you scroll blindly and select just to make it fun from being random. Anyways, it was a Buenos Aires episode (S7E8 - Parts Unkown) and just wow.  The whole episode is a cry out for help; it was even centered around the theme of psychotherapy.  Now, in retrospect, had I seen that episode before he killed himself, I would have thought ""Bourdain is trying to get views from mock therapy episodes. Ass..."" But knowing what we know now, it's crazy that no one ever mentioned his issues.  I recommend all of you fans check out that bizarre ep.  Also, again, it was completely random. First intentional watch of his show after hearing the news and it was quite the coincidence.  P.S.  I really like it now that I'm older and I plan to run back all of his shit. RIP"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,He was a pretty cool dude. I'm sad to hear of his passing. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Still can’t believe he’s not with us anymore :( 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I feel like this is a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation for Netflix.

If they removed the show, people would take it in poor taste.

If they announce they're giving the show an extended run, people might think they're capitalizing on someone's death to get more people watching."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Just continued watching where I left off on the Buenos Aires episode where he talks to a therapist throughout the episode. It ends with the therapist telling him to explore the happiness in his life and make that his focal point though he lives such a great life. That was rough to watch and hear
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Too sad to watch him anymore. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"My husband and I spent the weekend watching No Reservations and Parts Unknown - it's one of the few shows we both loved (love) - him for the cooking and me for the travel.  What an amazing person - he was a true artist and I'm just so sad - I truly don't know how to put it into words...  

I love how authentic and real he was - we just re-watched the episode in Sicily where the guy on the boat was literally throwing dead octopus in the water and any other show they would have edited that out or tried to cover it up but he was totally up front about how pissed off he was and proceeded to get fall down drunk that night.  I miss him already - what a treasure he was.

Edit: Spelling mistake"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Ok. I’m finally going to comment on this. I watched 3 episodes of Parts Unknown with my GF this weekend.  Beyond that, we also watched the single episode of Archer where he guest stared.  

In the three episodes of Parts Unknown, he mentioned suicide once. These were handpicked based on her locational preference, as I’ve already seen them.  He talked of hanging himself from the rafters in Parts Unknown. Beyond that, in the single Archer episode he also mentioned suicide.  This sucks and it seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I’ve came very close to doing that myself, very, very close.  Thoughts become words, words become actions, actions become who we are.  I’ve personally been hit pretty hard by this, especially since it almost was me a few months prior. 

Miss you Anthony.  Truly is a shame you had to go out this way.  At least it was on your own terms.  I can safely say we all wish you the best on your journey. It’s a shame we cannot come with you, as we could with your television shows.  "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I've found that show a bit hit and miss.  Some episodes I'm really into, others are kinda meh.  Anyone have a good recommendation for a particularly interesting episode or two?"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,yOu GuYs doN’t UnDErSTAnD hOw cOntrActS woRk
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Anyone else love the show's theme song as much as I do? I'm glad it will all be around longer now.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I hadn't watched it previously and just started - it's really good!
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"not in Belgium though, we only get season 2 of the layover and thats it "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Does anyone know how a Canadian Netflix user can get American Netflix? Would love to be able to watch parts unknown.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I immediately started rewatching the show for the tenth time. I'm still Bent!
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"My small connection to Anthony Bourdain (outside his tv series) is going to Rakuichi Soba in Niseko, Japan based on his recommendation. Amazing restaurant, and when I got there the owners of the restaurant spoke about how they didn't know who he was when he went there but after his visit they were suddenly inundated with tourists ! 

RIP, going to be too sad to watch his shows from now on :("
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,As a Canadian this doesn't affect me at all
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Bring it to the UK Netflix catalogue!
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I apologize if this is a taboo question, but I have to ask: has there been anything said on why he committed suicide? For me finding out possible reason is kind of part of the process.

If asking about that is a taboo issue please let me know."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,A Cooks tour was his finest most raw work
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,If we kill buffy maybe Netflix will bring her back
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"To those who are going to be rewatching it, go watch the South Korea episode. He has a scene where he talks about negative emotions and it's pretty enlightening to see what was going on in his head."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,And they should add No Reservations!
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,It still doesn't feel like he's really gone. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,This picture is from a Korean BBQ with him having some soju shots. Good times. Thanks Anthony 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I don't know, really. Some people feel better when they see this, but to others it just reminds them of people they loved who died. Suicide is strange. I have most definitely thought about doing it, but I never will, certainly not in an abrupt way. I'm not totally sure how I feel about this, but it does seem like a Netflix grab. Ugh."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Extended permanently I hope
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I watched the last season on Netflix when I found out he died. Gonna miss this fucker 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I can't quite bring myself to rewatch the series just yet. 😟
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Partly for memorial
Mostly to profit off of his death"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I've been watching it lately and he makes a TON of jokes about killing himself in the show, notably once he said he'd kill himself in he had to watch Nickleback. Makes me sad every time he does"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I'm really gonna miss this guy.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"he killed himself over asia argento and her free affair with that other guy he saw on the news.he took it hard is what it looks like.

damn boy.....musta been some hot ass love he cooked up with her. 

too bad her idea of a free relationship was bullshit for tony. of course the guys old enough to be her daddy, which is odd enough...

but heres your motive folks. love saves, but then kills.

tragic really. asia, you are one hot pocket. and ive seen those nude pics man...."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Wait is this a cash grab or homage?
*pitchfork trembles*
"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Season 1, Episode 1.

You may know it as Myanmar, but it'll always be Burma to me. 

A little Seinfeld before darker questions.

How many from this episode are dead? How many Rohinga in the background or otherwise, how many dissidents and collaborators?  It would potentially be a great project to interview those who can be identified, and see what took place afterwards of allegedly an early offering into Western media from a closed nation."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Gotta make that money. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,The Sicily episode is hilarious.  He gets really shitfaced after a sham dive session and doesn’t remember dinner.  Fav quote if the episode “Brain dead and heart still beating...just like name any Kardashian”
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"""Meanwhile y'all can't get enough of Anthony Bourdain, & he seems like the kind of dude who would be mean to dogs, so I don't understand what is happening! What does he do? 'Ah, I put on Rolling Stones t-shirts & tell food courts they suck.' Come on, man!"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6zuii2OLI
"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Anthony Bourdain's not dead, he's in the middle of filming the ""6 Feet Deep"" episode of Parts Unknown.

He's perfectly fine.

:("
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"""oh man, someone died, how can we make money off of this?""

>runs their work into the ground by ruthlessly  circulating it everywhere until everyone is sick of it"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,[deleted]
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,[deleted]
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I thought the show was just... okay.

Honestly he kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  I wouldn't want to hang out with someone that smug."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,[removed]
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"This is wonderful. I knew it was leaving soon so I was trying to watch my favorites again, but they were gone yesterday for some reason so I figured that was that. Awesome news. I'll resume my watching shortly (with a nice steak for dinner). "
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I met him a month ago at a cars and coffee meet in Malibu CA. He was filming there and his cameraman had his lens pointed at our group as he talked to us about the cars. I really hope that video comes out. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Yeah, cash in on his death, and play the coy sympathetic tech company. Whatevs. RIP Mr Bourdain"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"So.....If he wasn't depressed, is this a case of crossdressing auto-asphyxiation? That his friends covered up?"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"And I noticed Netflix finally added ""skip intro"" to the show only after his death."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,[deleted]
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"I will give it a shot once I’m done with my final exam next Monday!

Correction, I would give it a shot if I could find it on Netflix. Is it not available outside the US?"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,All the morons saying that our voices didn't mean anything: Suck it. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Yes!! I seriously have an email drafted I was going to send them to beg them to do this, I just didn't know where to send it. Thank you Netflix <3"
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,I've been rewatching some episodes since his passing and I've noticed that he occasionally jokes about depression and even made a suicide joke in one episode. It's ashame that he was able to experience so many cool things and still feel down throughout it all. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Is this on UK Netflix?
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,You’re welcome. Keep it moving.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,There was only season 2 of parts unknown on Canadian Netflix . We get so fucking shafted up here. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,It'd be nice if they just extended it indefinitely. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Been watching a lot of No Reservations on Pluto TV the last few days. Forgot how much I liked it. Makes me sad now. Sad and hungry. 
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Strong team with a great project.
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Good news. Just started watching and was sad it said it would be removed on the 16th
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"Heh. Yeah. Not where I live.

Netflix has become garbage after they started to wage war on VPN."
Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,Huh. I downloaded the CNN app just to watch the WV episode last week. The more you know
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[removed]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[removed]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Rat King is coming
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[removed]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[deleted]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,We gonna get the rat king.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[removed]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,[removed]
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,And more golfing
The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Americas Book of Secrets,"That’s because two episodes of Boba Fett were episodes of The Mandalorian. Not even a crossover, clearly episodes of The Mandalorian. Not bad episodes, just in a different show."
Americas Book of Secrets,Book of Boba Fett was so bizarre?? Like the showrunners lost interest in their own show halfway through and just decided to do Mandalorian season 2.5 instead.
Americas Book of Secrets,"Book of Boba Fett was so fucked up. Not only did it take a character who people have wanted solo-adventures with for decades and make him stand around and talk sternly to people for 90% of his screentime, but it also decided it made total sense to dedicated two full episodes to being *a different TV show*

Even if you expect that *most* of your viewers will likely watch both shows its still dumb as hell narratively to put vital information in the middle of a different show.

Also, hot take, I wish they had ended the Grogu storyline with Season 2. Felt like a cool way to end it, truly starting a new arc"
Americas Book of Secrets,"I keep seeing people say “it’s not a big deal, just watch episode 5,6,7”, but Disney has got to learn that general audiences can love something, but not have any knowledge of spin-offs. Those who just love Mandalorian could be turned off by feeling like they missed something crucial, even with a “recap” of things they didn’t even know happened"
Americas Book of Secrets,"I remain of the opinion that Favreau and Filoni probably wanted to just make the third season of Mando be BOBF (who is also a Mandalorian, so the title still would work) but Disney wanted another title to put in its lists of D+ exclusives."
Americas Book of Secrets,The best part about the comments is people collectively reliving the trauma that was The Book of Boba Fett
Americas Book of Secrets,"What if we watched Boba Fett, didn't like it, don't remember anything, and don't want to watch it again?"
Americas Book of Secrets,"Honestly my excitement has entirely whittled away at this point. I thought the end of season 2 marked a new direction, and we’d get to see a new side of Mando without needing to serve as the caretaker role constantly, and to see the show be able to stand on its own without over relying on the “grogu is cute” effect. But it’s like they had zero faith in their ability to keep the casual fan base entertained without having grogu make baby noises at the screen 30 times per episode so they steal 2 random  episodes of an entirely different show to justify season 3 being more of the same"
Americas Book of Secrets,It's basically a PG rated kids show. I'm sure most people can fill in the missing pieces
Americas Book of Secrets,"The whole Book of Boba Fett debacle began as soon as the Boba Fett character appeared on The Mandalorian. What started as a cool cameo soon became a problem that the writers needed to solve. And quick. 

You’ve got a fan-favorite character who has been presumed dead since his last (chronological) appearance in Return of the Jedi suddenly appearing (alive, gasp!) with no explanation as to how he is still alive. So… cool! That’s so cool that he’s still alive! But… how? How will the writers explain it?

Do they just explain it in a couple throwaway lines in an episode of The Mandalorian? That might be satisfactory to people who aren’t die-hard fans of Boba Fett, but will that be enough for super fans (and super fans who are now writers for Star Wars)? Probably not!

Do you spend a whole episode of The Mandalorian focused on Boba Fett’s backstory to explain what happened to him after he fell into the Sarlacc pit in that movie from over 30 years ago? What if Mando fans don’t give a shit about this Boba Fett guy? What if Boba Fett fans don’t think one episode is enough time to tell the story?

Do you give the character his own movie? Just to explain where he’s been and how he survived? How about his own spin-off show? Can that premise justify a movie or whole new show? How about a limited series? Maybe.. a limited series that still involves the main characters from the show that reintroduced him! The Mandalorian! That could work! 

But then they shit the bed. Because by teasing Book of Boba Fett with an after-credits scene of Mando season 2, that meant that Boba would be getting some screen time before we got to see Mando and The Child again. So, if you were excited to see Mando, or Baby Yoda, or Boba, again… you would have to tune in to whatever Book of Boba Fett was going to be. Boba Fett’s and Mando’s stories were always going to be intertwined after that. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, right?

Wrong. By forcing themselves into writing and shooting and releasing a limited series about Boba Fett before season 3 of The Mandalorian was released, the writers gave themselves very limited time to make sure that the story of Boba Fett’s survival from the sarlacc pit and subsequent years and adventures would be a worthwhile story to tell. It felt rushed, boring, and unnecessary. The best parts were the episodes that focused primarily on Mando and Grogu. You know… those characters from that show we all love that had a cameo from that one character who presumably died in that movie from over 30 years ago? Maybe that guy should get his own show, too! 

Wait a second…"
Americas Book of Secrets,"I liked baby Yoda, but disappointed we aren't getting a solo Mando season. Personally,I wouldn't have mind a season of just him being a bounty hunter with no crazy overarching plot either. Just a bunch of loosely connected single episode serials."
Americas Book of Secrets,"Ugh great, more ""you must watch X, Y, and Z to enjoy A"" content from Disney."
Americas Book of Secrets,I'm sure there will be a recap before the episode starts.
Americas Book of Secrets,"Well, I was plannning to pick the mandalorian up again at some point.  If youre gonna get all mcu on it ill just drop the whole thing instead.

Rogue One and Andor are enough."
Americas Book of Secrets,"Do I hafta watch that again?

Love Star Wars but that was a slog..."
Americas Book of Secrets,"Such a bad move on their part, Boba’s show sucked ass aside from the Mando episodes."
Americas Book of Secrets,"Yeah no shit, they basically made the Book of Boba Fett a poorly disguised ""Mandalorian Season 2.5"" instead of what people actually wanted from the show when it was announced.  I mean most people like the Mandalorian, and for good reason, but that was some bullshit and we all know it."
Americas Book of Secrets,"To the folks who feel the need to complain about this:

_I understand._

Even though I enjoyed most of _Boba Fett_ and feel it was worth watching, I can't even ***BEGIN*** to imagine how crushed I would feel if _Mandalorian_ season 3 somehow tied into _Obi-Wan._

I sure as *F* wouldn't watch the rest of _that_ trainwreck."
Americas Book of Secrets,I couldn't get through the first ten minutes of that garbage. I'll take my chances going in to S3 cold.
Americas Book of Secrets,"PSA: You don't have to watch the entire 'Boba Fett' season to catch up with 'The Mandalorian', just watch episodes 5 and 6."
Americas Book of Secrets,So it's just episode 5 and 6 right? Ain't watching the rest of that shite
Americas Book of Secrets,Well I ain't gonna
Americas Book of Secrets,What a fucking ridiculous decision. Can I just watch the two mando ones or do I have to watch the whole shit show?
Americas Book of Secrets,Andor proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that you can reward longtime viewers while also telling a great story that requires zero previous viewing. Meanwhile Mandalorian season 3 spends about half of its runtime trying to reanimate the corpse of something that had a heroic end. Sounds a lot like Disney.
Americas Book of Secrets,Nothing happened in BOBF. It was boring and had maybe one episode worth of actually story. The rest is just the camera looking at people walking And reaction shots.
Americas Book of Secrets,"I just rewatched those two episodes 

Dam they are so good, too bad they could not give boba Fett as good of episodes"
Americas Book of Secrets,"> ‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Probably Won’t Make Any Sense Unless You’ve Watched ‘The Book of Boba Fett’

Naw, I don't buy that bullshit. The Mandalorian story just isn't that deep."
Americas Book of Secrets,Andor made a mockery of those shows it was so good. They’ve set the bar now.
Americas Book of Secrets,I think it would have been so much more tasteful if they left it with grogu deciding between the saber and the shirt. Leave the answer till mando 3.
Americas Book of Secrets,They couldn’t do a five minute “previously on” to catch people up?
Americas Book of Secrets,"People were bending over backwards to defend this nonsense in the Star Wars sub, telling me it wasn't a big deal, that everybody would watch both, that a recap would be fine. That's laughable.

Core, major story developments for the Mandalorian, which were left unresolved at the end of season 2, occur in those Boba Fett episodes. Anyone who cares about the Mandalorian's ongoing story is going to want to watch them. They may or may not know about them however. 

And they may or may not  care about the book of Boba Fett, a lesser show with a significantly worse reputation amongst audiences and critics alike.

People are going to be tuning into Mandalorian season 3 and getting very confused by what's happened in between seasons, and possibly annoyed at inadvertently having the resolution of certain plot lines spoiled for them."
Americas Book of Secrets,Which episodes do I have to watch so it will make sense? I have the feeling I'm not going to want to watch all of it.
Americas Book of Secrets,Why would you punish people like this? Just use YouTube to get a recap.
Americas Book of Secrets,"Intercontextually has completely ruined multiple Disney franchises for me now. I don’t want to do homework and research just so I can enjoy your mediocre show/movie. 
“Want to see Dr. Strange? Well you better had seen Wondervision, bitch.”
It’s just all bull shit. It’s like having to be force fed raw potato just so I can have a chance at enjoying French fries, that are probably soggy anyway"
Americas Book of Secrets,Am I the only one who finds it annoying that you have to bounce between titles for any of them to make sense?
Americas Book of Secrets,"So everyone waited until the fucking day that Mandalorian comes back to put this info out there?!

God dammit now I have to watch Book of Boba, as I simply never got around to it because I had heard it wasn’t very good…"
Americas Book of Secrets,This is why I’ve just stopped most marvel and Star Wars shit. You gotta keep up with too much filler shit.
Americas Book of Secrets,Oh well. Guess I just won’t watch any of them.
Americas Book of Secrets,"I’ve got friends who are considering dropping The Mandalorian over this. They’re not hardcore Star Wars fans, most had only seen the original trilogy, but I convinced them to watch The Mandalorian and they loved it. Then I convinced them to watch Book of Boba Fett, which they hated (can’t blame them). Now they’re worried they’ll have to watch a thousand shitty shows just to understand what’s happening in the one show they care about."
Americas Book of Secrets,I’m not watching either
Americas Book of Secrets,"Honestly, they need to add those 3 episodes to the Mando seasons. Call it an interlude between seasons 2 and 3."
Americas Book of Secrets,"BoBF is referred to as Mando S2.5 in our house.

Just such a weird choice"
Americas Book of Secrets,"Which is why I gave up on both shows. Mando was good but then decided it would develop itself in different shows. Boba was so bad I didn't finish and I disliked what it did for both stories. 

People who say ""it's only 2-3 episodes"" clearly don't understand that doesn't mean it's worth it. I'd rather throw on the movies."
Americas Book of Secrets,"Which is unfortunate, because it fucking sucks"
Americas Book of Secrets,Mandalorian was the only reason I watched TBoBF. TBoBF has no sense and no logic.
Americas Book of Secrets,Disney continuing to kill star wars I see
Americas Book of Secrets,"Having seen mandalorian season 2.5, this is the dumbest decision.

I liked the book of BF, even. But the amount of mandalorian plot in it was too much to make sense - supposed to be a different series with a cameo not (basically) an ending that’s plot heavy for another series entirely. Someone who has not seen the mandalorian can’t enjoy the book of BF. Makes no sense."
Americas Book of Secrets,The Book of Boba Fett was horseshit.. sigh..
Americas Book of Secrets,"That's a bummer, 'cause Boba Fett sucked. They can take their New Wave scooter gang and shove it."
Americas Book of Secrets,Or the 10 minute YouTube video someone makes to solve that problem.
Americas Book of Secrets,That sucks because the Book of boba fett stunk on ice. Source: it was physically impossible to watch past the first half of episode 2.
Americas Book of Secrets,You mean book of boba fett: the mandolin season 2.5?
Americas Book of Secrets,"* while taking a hit *

Bummer…this is a bummer, man. That’s a…that’s a bummer."
Americas Book of Secrets,"""Somehow Baby Yoda returned"" isn't the worst way of putting it."
Americas Book of Secrets,Which is a terrible thing. Why can't they just tell a coherent story without having to intervine both shows? I mean I get why but it's lame
Americas Book of Secrets,"Great! So the investment of my time finally pays off!

I am kidding, I enjoyed Book of Boba."
Americas Book of Secrets,"*probably*?? Lmao

Just the biggest plot left by s2 got resolved in BoBF, alongside an introduction to the new plot of s3"
Americas Book of Secrets,"That's ok, I just won't watch The Mandalorian anymore."
Americas Book of Secrets,Yeah nah
Americas Book of Secrets,That's why I dropped Daredevil. Do not make people obligated to watch spin offs
Americas Book of Secrets,This is why we can’t have nice things
Americas Book of Secrets,I think the show should’ve ended with Luke taking grogu. It just felt complete at that point
Americas Book of Secrets,"I got that impression after the Book of Boba Fett bailed on its main character to just focus on the Mandalorian for a few episodes.

They needed some way to make people watch this awful series and so shoehorned plot critical story lines from another show"
Americas Book of Secrets,"I watched it, but I don't remember a thing about it."
Americas Book of Secrets,It's fine. I will watch it without sense. Like most other star wars universe movies.
Americas Book of Secrets,Ok but i won't waste my time with Boba Fett show
Americas Book of Secrets,The Book of Boba Fett aka The Mandalorian season 2.5
Americas Book of Secrets,But what will make The Book of Boba Fett make sense?
Americas Book of Secrets,Thanks for the tip
Americas Book of Secrets,I always considered The Book of Boba Fett to be season 3 of the Mandalorian.
Americas Book of Secrets,"Slow news day, variety?"
Americas Book of Secrets,What if you watched the whole series but remember nothing outside of scenes when The Mandelorian or Luke Skywalker were on the screen?
Americas Book of Secrets,I hate multiverses. Stopped me from watching any Marvel TV show.
Americas Book of Secrets,"Aw man , I couldn't get past the desert grunting episodes , I'll go in blind"
Americas Book of Secrets,"That's a shame, because I loved the Mandalorian but stopped the Book of Boba Fett midway through the second episode, because I hated everything I had seen so far."
Americas Book of Secrets,They're still trying to get people to watch Boba Fett?
Americas Book of Secrets,Id rather gouge my eyes out
Americas Book of Secrets,That’s silly
Americas Book of Secrets,Just watched the first episode. Mando needs to do a thing. Needs a droid to help do a thing but droid broken and so needs a part to fix the droid to help him do a thing. Absolute genius writing. Reminds me of one of those point and click games like ‘day if the tentacle’ but not as funny.
Americas Book of Secrets,The Book of Boba Fett doesn't make any sense even if you watch The Book of Boba Fett.
Americas Book of Secrets,"What a way to lose viewers, though.  Fucking crossovers..."
Americas Book of Secrets,"They should just have a character explain, ""Somehow Grogu returned."""
Americas Book of Secrets,“If you want the good show to make sense you have to watch the bad show.”
Americas Book of Secrets,Knew this was going to happen
Americas Book of Secrets,The only way to get someone to willingly watch BoBF
Americas Book of Secrets,Disney is so brave for thinking I want to watch the book of boba fett???? I don’t give two shits about that I just want to see Pedro pascal and baby yoga
Americas Book of Secrets,"I watched 2 episodes of that B.F. trash I'm not watching anymore. I don't really expect star wars stuff to ""make sense"" anyways."
Americas Book of Secrets,That sucks.  Cuz that show Suuuuuuucks.
Americas Book of Secrets,"For those of you who missed BOBF, grogu decided to return to mando off screen, then Luke “I will give my life to protect him” Skywalker sent him in an Uber to one of the most dangerous planets in the galaxy during an active gang war. Then, grogu had a campy instead of emotional reunion with the mandalorean in the middle of a battle. A battle where grogu uses the force in a way that establishes that there where no consequences for quitting his training. Then the two literally fly off into the sunset. "
Americas Book of Secrets,I'm done then.
Americas Book of Secrets,they tried this with captain marvel before end game as well.
Americas Book of Secrets,so I have to watch some garbage show to keep up with a show that I like? F that.
Americas Book of Secrets,I find that season 1 of the Mandalorian doesn’t make any sense.
Americas Book of Secrets,"I remember that when I first watched the Revenge of the Sith, suddenly you were supposed to be familiar with the Clone wars to know the bad guy. 

In the Mandalorian’s previous seasons they also referred to some characters and items (the black saber ) from different shows."
Americas Book of Secrets,The only episodes of the Book of Boba Fett that were good were the Mandalorian ones.
Americas Book of Secrets,Anyone else here rather be confused going into Mandalorian Season 3 than watch Book of Boba Fett?
Americas Book of Secrets,I’m just getting tired of having to watch so many shows just to understand another one personally. I’m busy and don’t have the time but I love The Mandalorian.
Americas Book of Secrets,Clickbait article is clickbait.
Americas Book of Secrets,"lol, Lucas Films need to get their act together. The script writing for Book of Boba Fett was so bad that the producers had to shoehorn in Manolorean season 2.5 to fill in the gaps. And now we need articles like this to explain it all so casual fans don't get too confused."
Americas Book of Secrets,"They should have recast Boba Fett. Temuera Morrison is great, but Boba should be a fit 40 year old, not a visibly old man. It made no sense. Ming-na Wen was a little better, and i guess her character is supposed to be older than Boba. And it would have been a better show without the Mando stuff. I rewatched the finale where Boba talks about the people depending on him and it would have been nice if they had used some of that time showing us that."
Parks and Recreation,Yeah when pitching parks and rec as viewing material I always refer to it as having a “pilot season” instead of a pilot episode
Parks and Recreation,"To those that want to watch only part of the series...

Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing. - Ron"
Parks and Recreation,"I'm so glad you found it and enjoyed it. It is my all time favorite show.

I love that underlying sweetness and optimism. That has made it such a great one to revisit during the pandemic. It's really nuanced and layered in ways that make re-watching rewarding too."
Parks and Recreation,"It's my ultimate feel-good show. The show is the perfect balance of great characters, friendship, feminist rhetoric, Obama-era optimism, while also being a love letter to the weirdness of conservative middle America. The great achievement of this show is the tone never seems all over the place, but finds a way to fit all these things together in a way that says it can all be great.  Even though Pawnee is obviously insane, it's not portrayed in a horrible light and is even celebrated and loved for how insane it is. I think the secret is if someone as brilliant as Leslie Knope can embrace the crap out of this town instead of running from it the minute she turned 18, why can't we? ""Parks and Recreation"" is a great show, and just got better and better."
Parks and Recreation,"Parks and Rec is one of my all time favorite shows. If you like the feel and tone please, please watch Ted Lasso. It’s my new addiction"
Parks and Recreation,"First season is meh

Gets better after

Ron Swanson is a national treasure"
Parks and Recreation,I liked the earlier seasons
Parks and Recreation,"I'd like to remind anyone who is new to P&R, the first season can be kinda dry.  
I almost stopped watching b/c I didn't think S1 was that great.  
But by 1/2 way through S2 I was a believer.  

Just wanted to make that known."
Parks and Recreation,"While I love the clips I see I have never been able to get into it, I've started a few times but season one, I can't get through it."
Parks and Recreation,"At the time, people kept saying it was just a worst 'The office'. Never really understood why, as I could never really get into that kind of humour."
Parks and Recreation,"I've never made it through the first episode.

I've had a few cracks at it because its so beloved but I just don't click with the first episode and go do something else o_o"
Parks and Recreation,"Yes, yes, yes! It has my second favorite ensemble casts for a comedy, right after The Simpsons. So many great side characters."
Parks and Recreation,Too much screaming and not enough Ron and April
Parks and Recreation,"Parks & Rec is one of my Top 5 TV shows ever. S1 maybe is not a cup of tea for everyone, but it's an amazing TV show from S2 to the end. Probably the only one that can make me cry hard and laugh a lot in the same episode."
Parks and Recreation,when you need a pick up in life parks is a great one. Everybody needs Leslie in their life every now and then
Parks and Recreation,I think what give P&R an edge over The Office is how it commits to fleshing out all of the characters in a way that makes you care about them in such lovable ways.
Parks and Recreation,A friend is turned off by the amount of episodes but I honestly prefer that to short seasons. Parks and Rec is such a delight that the length doesn't seem as daunting or drags with too much filler. I wish some would give it a go.
Parks and Recreation,Overrated show.
Parks and Recreation,Never call a TV show a gift. It's a monetary device nothing more. But yes the show is good. Better than The Office by far.
Parks and Recreation,Are you excited for the Parks and Rec crossover with Duncanville?
Parks and Recreation,"I know it's not the best season or anything, but I truly enjoy the first season."
Parks and Recreation,"Office is basically the same. The first season Michael is so much worse and the whole show has a slightly different feel a little closer to the British version.  
   
It change that in season 2"
Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, in a way it was a pilot season because they produced it all in one go rather than doing the pilot then following it up months later with the rest of the episodes."
Parks and Recreation,Drops off once rob lowe becomes a regular
Parks and Recreation,"Same experience here. Started watching season 1 and couldn’t get into it so I stopped watching for a little while, but I finally continued it when I got bored and it’s sooo much better"
Parks and Recreation,If the first season is kind of dry then the last season is 10 grit sand paper. Rough.
Parks and Recreation,"It gets so much better after season 1, which is really short. S3 onwards hits its peak imo."
Parks and Recreation,"It's worth sticking with it. Things get even better in season 3. 

I've pretty much got it on constant rotation. Still makes me laugh even after 20th time."
Parks and Recreation,S1 isn’t like the rest of the show at all. You could probably just skip to the start of S2 and be fine.
Parks and Recreation,"Yeah season one is pretty bad, season 2 gets better by a lot, then season 3 it has really found it's groove and just keeps getting better from there!

Totally worth it!"
Parks and Recreation,Try starting with season 2 episode 1 everything you need to know is covered in the recap. Season 1 isn't good or needed and seasons 2-5 are some of the best tv of this century
Parks and Recreation,"Honestly, just skip the first season. It’s largely not necessary to the rest of the show. The story from the first season, while interspersed throughout the rest of the show, is not important for the following seasons. The character change from the way they are in the first season and it goes from being an Office copy to its own space of wonderfulness.

Skip the first season, give the second season the first three episodes."
Parks and Recreation,Season one is such trash in comparison. I highly recommend sticking through it or at the very least just start with season 2.
Parks and Recreation,"First season wasn't great tbh.

Start with season 2.

 They kind of changed the characters anyway (Leslie and Andy characters were kind of mean and unlikable in S1, became much nicer people from S2 on), so honestly you're not missing anything if you skip s1."
Parks and Recreation,Username says otherwise
Parks and Recreation,I bet you're fun at parties
Parks and Recreation,"Me too. I felt the same way about The Office, as well. I never understood the hate for those seasons. Sure, both shows improve after their first seasons, but I never thought those initial seasons were so terrible that they should just be skipped. And if I’m being completely honest, I might just like the first season of Parks and Rec more than the final season."
Parks and Recreation,Fun fact! That is LIT-erally not true. At least not according to Dr. Richard Nygard.
Parks and Recreation,Chris traeger is hilarious
Parks and Recreation,I don't think it dropped off but I also can't stand that character. I put up with him tho
Parks and Recreation,"Yes, He was not funny."
Parks and Recreation,would it be weird to start at season 3
Parks and Recreation,I’ve never been able to get into it. I tried watching until season 4ish but to me it was trying to use very similar humor to the office without pulling it off as well. The characters are all such caricatures compared to the early office seasons imo.
Parks and Recreation,I'll give it a go
Parks and Recreation,Brandoquitz is awful season one and improves to boring in season two.
Parks and Recreation,I think OP's comment was supposed to be sarcastic but no one picked up on it lol
Parks and Recreation,stock insult
Parks and Recreation,"Both first seasons are more cynical and pessimistic on the characters and story then their respective following seasons.

The first season of the Office much more so than PnR though.

It always surprises me though how much people dislike that first season (even sometimes 2) of PnR.  I'd take the first season over the last few any day... to me a show where everyone is ideal and things always works out for everyone, all the time, becomes dull and predictable.

I personally think the first season of PnR (maybe the 2nd) is the best one... and started to feel rather let down by the show going 'soft' on its characters."
Parks and Recreation,"You can definitely skip season 1, but I would try to start with season 2."
Parks and Recreation,"Rob Lowe and Adam Scott show up for the last two episodes of season 2, so it’s not that weird to start there.

There are a lot of small recurring bits that start in season 2, but if anyone wants to skip to where Rob and Adam show up, they won’t really be lost."
Parks and Recreation,I'd maybe start with the last 2 episodes of season 2. They introduce 2 characters that become part of the main cast for season 3 and forward.
Parks and Recreation,"It would. As hard as it is, you should probably just slog tru S01 (only 6 episodes or so)."
Parks and Recreation,"Honestly, I don't think so. You could easily skip at least season 1 and just start at 2. Season 1 feels so out of place and slow from the rest of the show."
Parks and Recreation,"I would go even further and start with the episode where Ben Wyatt is introduced. That is near the end of the second season, but it is pretty much the point in which everyone has their characters established and the show fully hits its stride.

If you like it after that, you can always go back and watch the first season and the first part of the second season later on."
Parks and Recreation,"Ah yes, because your reply was so original and thought provoking"
Parks and Recreation,I like to start with the first Ron and Tammy episode when i rewatch (I think it’s season 2 episode 8 or something?)
Parks and Recreation,I agree. It doesn't take that much time to get through Season 1. Season 2 really picks up the pace and Season 3 is when it starts to get really good.
Parks and Recreation,Nope just an observation
Parks and Recreation,Also fantastic in a bit part on the West Wing playing [Marion Cotesworth-Haye of Marblehead.](https://youtu.be/80mHu_nRLms?t=58)
Parks and Recreation,"As Ethel Beavers on “Parks and Rec,” her most beloved role, Slayton-Hughes’ often cranky, deadpan court stenographer served as a hilarious foil to Amy Poehler’s eager, cheery Parks director."
Parks and Recreation,Rest in peace. She was very funny in Parks And Rec.
Parks and Recreation,"[Goodnight, you animal](https://youtu.be/Y8T1az5Ubt0)"
Parks and Recreation,Started in Hollywood at age 50.  It’s never too late to follow your dreams.
Parks and Recreation,"I liked her in Arrested Development.

""Oh GOB, you could charm the black off a telegram boy""

Narrator: Okay, she's the one that dies."
Parks and Recreation,Loved her as Agnes on Burning Love as well
Parks and Recreation,One helluva lay! Pouring one out for Bill Murray’s  greatest lover.
Parks and Recreation,https://i.imgur.com/kgljp8J.gif
Parks and Recreation,"No, she was so good as Agnes on burning love!"
Parks and Recreation,That's her real name? They must have wanted her specifically for the Marion Cotesworth Hay character on West Wing.
Parks and Recreation,RIP Adopted Grandma Who Is Super Awesome At Dating 😞
Parks and Recreation,"""Do what you want"" I still say that all the time."
Parks and Recreation,Ethel's eulogy of Mayor Gunderson was one for the ages. RIP
Parks and Recreation,I’M MARION COTESWORTH-HAYE!
Parks and Recreation,the fact that she didn't get her first credit until 50 is wonderful. never too late to go after what you want.
Parks and Recreation,Heh she was great in Parks & Rec. Rest in peace!
Parks and Recreation,Was also on Burning Love.
Parks and Recreation,ETHEL BEAVERS!!!!!!!!
Parks and Recreation,She was in True Blood too
Parks and Recreation,"Eat glass and di... RIP, tramp!"
Parks and Recreation,RIP Ethel Beavers
Parks and Recreation,….. I’m Marion Coatsworth Hay!!!
Parks and Recreation,Loved her so much! She brought a lot of joy to many
Parks and Recreation,She cracked me up in new girl rip.
Parks and Recreation,Actor?
Parks and Recreation,Dead at 92? Who could have seen that coming?!?
Parks and Recreation,Good
Parks and Recreation,I'm sure she's known for better things
Parks and Recreation,Not grandma! RIP Ethel Beavers!
Parks and Recreation,"Goodbye, you animal."
Parks and Recreation,Noooo Ethel Beavers!
Parks and Recreation,Sad news. Her PnR character was awesome. Hell of a run though!
Parks and Recreation,"Since no one else has said it yet, apparently Peter Dinklage is her first cousin once removed."
Parks and Recreation,"I remember her as Agnes, the retired dental hygienist from Burning Love."
Parks and Recreation,Rest easy. Tell Little Sebastian he’s still got shooters down here.
Parks and Recreation,Great in It 2
Parks and Recreation,Was that the Grinch’s mom?
Parks and Recreation,CJ losing her shit laughing at this is brilliant.
Parks and Recreation,CJ’s snort gets me every time
Parks and Recreation,"I taped the episode when it aired and I must have rewatched that scene about 85 times just laughing my ass off every time. Her line delivery is so perfect. On every line but especially ""I am Marion Cotesworth-Haye!""."
Parks and Recreation,Perfect trans Atlantic accent
Attack on Titan,"Just in case people are wondering. 

Yes, this should actually be the end of the series. No more parts or editions, this is the end."
Attack on Titan,"They keep using the word “Final Season”, but I don’t think they know what it means."
Attack on Titan,This title looks like all of my ‘final’ premiere exports.
Attack on Titan,"Having read the manga, I cannot wait to see how people who haven't yet will react to the ending. 

I've been really loving this ""final season"" though, so I hope that the wait will be worth it."
Attack on Titan,Fuckers. I was hoping for may or June. Season 4 “the final season” came out in 2020! Three and a half years later it’s still going.
Attack on Titan,"Yeah but what about Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition): The Final Part (for real this time, we fucking mean it), the penultimate season?"
Attack on Titan,Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition): Part 2: Eren’s Revenge: The Conclusive Ending - 358/2 Days (Taylor’s Version)
Attack on Titan,"Stupid and silly title aside.

What a fucking episode.

i am more positve towards the narrative/plot points of the ending (but i dislike the pacing and dialogue), but if the anime expands and makes some extra scenes like this first cour did, then i will be more than happy with the end result."
Attack on Titan,Attack on Titan 4.0+3.2 Your animation studio cannot rumbling
Attack on Titan,Hasn’t it been on the final season for a really long time?
Attack on Titan,Jesus Christ. Wrap it up already!
Attack on Titan,why you guys make the same joke every time. its just a fucking title.
Attack on Titan,"This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.

Part 3 Part 1 was just a 1 hour episode..... now it's back to a 7 month wait. Damn. They are really hurting this show. It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio."
Attack on Titan,"I gave up on this show a while ago. I’ve read the manga and just, no."
Attack on Titan,"So I always wanted to binge watch this show ever since it was announced.... kinda glad I did, it's been what, 10 years? Is the anime follow the manga closely?"
Attack on Titan,"I think I'll just wait until part 2 of the finale is out to watch it. This would've been great as a full feature, rather than two separate parts."
Attack on Titan,Everybody needs to cut it the fuck out with this half a season at a time shit.
Attack on Titan,"These titles are crazy. ""The Final Season (Final Edition) [But it isn't the final part]""."
Attack on Titan,*Copy-of-Copy-of-final-report-2013-(1)-rough-draft-(copy)-(1)(2)-final-2023-(3).docx.pdf*
Attack on Titan,"I just finished the 25 episodes on Netflix. Is it worth continuing? 

I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth a Crunchyroll subscription ."
Attack on Titan,Ok but what about the ‘Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition)’: Part 2 **Super** edition
Attack on Titan,They're really stretching this final season as much as they can lol
Attack on Titan,"Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition) Final Part - The end of the road, begins"
Attack on Titan,"Remember how Team Four Star got an entire new generation or two into DBZ, increasing the awareness and love of the brand, and then did a single episode of AOT Abridged & were told told they better not do anymore? 

I remember."
Attack on Titan,"I know its petty and v 'first world problems' but I'm so annoyed by the release timeline of this goddamn show. 

- four year gap between season 1 and 2: ok, fine.
- breaking season 3 into 2 parts: I'll bregudgingly accept it

but release something called 'the final season' and it should **be the final season**.

Dividing it into *four* chunks over **three long years**... It feels like an intentional slight. 

I don't know if theres a good reason for the delay, if there is I would be less annoyed. I cant imagine what one would be as covid alone can't be it. But if theres not the fans should each be presented with the person responsible and be allowed to yell at them for a bit."
Attack on Titan,Kingdom Hearts 3: Attack on Titan - The Final Edition of the Final Season Finally.
Attack on Titan,"Meh, wasnt that good after the first season imo. Disappointed!"
Attack on Titan,[removed]
Attack on Titan,I feel like the final season shouldnt have a part 2...
Attack on Titan,Why and how can it possibly be so far from now?
Attack on Titan,I don't mind if they keep extending it as long as we get new intros. Never been a bad one.
Attack on Titan,Rebuild of Kyojin 1.11: You Can (Not) Shingeki
Attack on Titan,SAYS WHO
Attack on Titan,And here I was expecting the Final Mix version
Attack on Titan,"That means the studio can get back to work on Dorohedoro Season 2! I've never been into anime before, I watched the few episodes of Cowboy Bebop then fell off, but Dorohedoro was fucking amazing."
Attack on Titan,Unless….
Attack on Titan,"A lot of stuff is getting its final season, because attack on titan is actually ending, I may have to finally get around to watching it. sometimes I don't feel like watching an anime because I'm so far behind or it's so long running of a series it'd take forever to catch up."
Attack on Titan,They'll finish with a three hour movie. Released as a trilogy.
Attack on Titan,I'm still confused lol. How many more episodes after this one? Just one and that's the end?
Attack on Titan,I will finally be able to watch the whole thing. I've been holding off for so many years.
Attack on Titan,We've heard that before.
Attack on Titan,These motherfuckers will make at least one movie to milk AoT as long as possible.
Attack on Titan,"Yeah OK, I've heard that shit before. I'm waiting till the series has beem ""finished"" for a year or goo

This is what the 4th or 5th ""final"""
Attack on Titan,Don't tempt them
Attack on Titan,Maybe some bonus OVA as a treat
Attack on Titan,"Thank you. I've been waiting to watch this entire season until I knew when I reached the end, it would be the end."
Attack on Titan,"""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
Attack on Titan,It's about as final as Final Fantasy
Attack on Titan,Attack\_on\_Titan\_Final\_(Final\_edit)\_2.avi
Attack on Titan,Haha as a fellow editor this got me good
Attack on Titan,"I don't even use the word anymore. ""Cut 8"" please."
Attack on Titan,It's gonna be like witnessing a kid realizing there's no santa.
Attack on Titan,They changed something from the manga in the episode that aired yesterday.
Attack on Titan,"With how this episode came out, yeah they can take their time till Fall."
Attack on Titan,Pandemic fucked everything up...
Attack on Titan,The Penultimate Season doesn't sound very final

Attack on Titan,[from the vault]
Attack on Titan,"I feel most people manga fans will agree with you there. I have a fairly negative opinion on the ending, but improving the dialogue and pacing will definitely make the experience much better. They did an amazing job with the first cour (especially with Hange) and I hope they continue to improve."
Attack on Titan,Pretty good one but the sequels... You cannot watch... You have to wait... And my favorite... You thought this was it.
Attack on Titan,Since 2020.
Attack on Titan,Clearly because it’s a ridiculous title lol
Attack on Titan,Why are you mad? It's just jokes.
Attack on Titan,Because it's fucking ridiculous that they can't manage to just fucking make the ending and keep making these stupid ass titles because even they don't *know* if they've actually ended it or not *somehow*
Attack on Titan,fr. hahah the final final final final final season part 78 part 5 part 7!
Attack on Titan,"> It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio.

Agreed the committee did a pretty bad job with the naming convention of the seasons and the release schedules, but the change in animation studio wasn't really that bad. MAPPA has done a great job for the time they were given & the direction of the previous seasons."
Attack on Titan,"> This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.


""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title now I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
Attack on Titan,"They know the ending is bad so theyre milking the build up for as long as they can. Honestly, Todd Howard should hire them all. Impressive stuff."
Attack on Titan,Yeah the ending is straight ass
Attack on Titan,the show levels up massively with the second half of season 3 onwards. if you were even like 60% interested/invested in the story after finishing season 1 then its worth watching.
Attack on Titan,"Yes. And don't listen to other people's opinions on this there's a lot of bitter manga readers out there who didn't like the ending and have since made it the mission of their pathetic lives to shit talk and hate on the entire franchise whenever possible.

While the very end is controversial, there's been near consensus among fans that the rest of it only gets better and better and is peak fiction. I don't think a bad ending changes that. Why should what would eventually be one bad episode dissuade you from consuming 63 incredible ones?"
Attack on Titan,Season 2 is really good and the second half of season 3 is peak TV.
Attack on Titan,The second half of season 3 and first half of season 4 is seriously 10/10 TV. The other stuff is still a solid 9/10 but those parts are just incredible.
Attack on Titan,"As someone who took a while to get into it and then really fell in love with the series is it worth it?



No.



After a certain point the story becomes incredibly rushed and the ending is honestly dog water I reread the final chapter 3 times thinking this couldn't be it that it was just some joke but nope it's all legit and it ruined a really good series. You're better off watching the goofy spinoff series where there chibi's and in school cause at least that's more satisfying to watch (it's also pretty good)."
Attack on Titan,"the content in the very last parts of the manga are pretty insane. basically the final battle has an absurd amount of shit going on. they probably were planning on releasing it all in march as a 2+ hour movie but it got too much. 

someone somewhere high up decided itd be better to still release something in march to keep discussion goinf"
Attack on Titan,Says Paths.
Attack on Titan,Says there only being 60 to 90 minutes of source material left to adapt.
Attack on Titan,Only Ymir knows..
Attack on Titan,That OST will live in my head rent free for the next decade.
Attack on Titan,im sadly like 90% sure its just not gonna have a 2nd season
Attack on Titan,First half was amazing but I felt like it really lost steam and they didn’t know where to go with the plot
Attack on Titan,"The studio (MAPPA) already handles big names like Vinland Saga, God Of High-school, Chainsawman etc, and according to reports they picked up One Punch S3 as well, so i would keep my expectations low"
Attack on Titan,"That's where I've been with this one. Too many episodes to make it through if there isn't a finale ready, because I have too much on my list to just re-watch it in years when the finale comes out."
Attack on Titan,"Until the final segment of that trilogy gets split into two parts. 

Imo that is the worst thing that came out of the Harry Potter series. The 2 part finale film."
Attack on Titan,"Yup, another long episode like the one we got today."
Attack on Titan,"No, we haven't. And we've known where it's at in regards to the source material the entire time. This is the end"
Attack on Titan,It is legitimately the end. There is no more material to adapt after this.
Attack on Titan,"Probably would've been more appropriate to title ""the final season"" differently. There's a pretty big time jump between season 3 and ""season 4"". Basically like going from Naruto to Shippuden. Except it's about 1/10 as long"
Attack on Titan,"doubt it's anything copyright specific, the studio wouldn't own the copyright for the show much less the title. They just love using dumb names"
Attack on Titan,"Yes, the new studio is much worse than the old one in quality and animation"
Attack on Titan,It's about as final as Terraria last update.
Attack on Titan,[deleted]

Attack on Titan,Attack on titan is so damn weird it premiered when I was in highschool and I thought it was cool and even got a movie with very little content out and then it took waaaaaaay too long for a second season and I lost interest even though looking back now there’s not that much content for it to take like 10+ years to cover in an anime
Attack on Titan,We don't need 80% of the comments saying the exact same thing

""Painfully"" because I've been a fan for over 10 years, and hated to see my favourite show take such a sharp nosedive. S13 & 14 were shakey, but 15 was woeful compared to S1 - 12 imo"

Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"I’m so glad this show is going strong, especially these days with people being outed or controversial content causing cancelation it’s nice to see these people having fun doing what they love with no issue. 
Shows like this, Curb your Enthusiasm, and South Park give me hope that there may actually be some wholesome creators out there who can still push boundaries while respecting the existence of them in the first place."
Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"I love the show, but I honestly had a hard time looking at them last season, except for Devito. They've all had such jarring plastic surgery. If they addressed it in character I think it would be hilarious."

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,This show desperately needs an HD remaster.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Weyoun 4.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Watching through the best bits of the show again right now. Currently on Season 5.

The show is still a masterpiece. Characterization is great, everyone has shades of gray. Pretty much all the characters grow and change significantly during the show. You have story arcs that span seasons, flashback episodes covering the occupation, and excellent action episodes around the various wars.

Many episodes are poignant, thought-provoking, and/or touching.

By far the best Trek series for me."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"lol She was great. Forgot how good all the beeps and sound effects were in DS9, theyre soothing"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"what a show, still in my top five ever. Loved every character, even the ultra boring discount Fiennes Vedek Bareil"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Best Trek there is. I can’t believe people don’t like the ending. Sisko owed them that and more!
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"This info about the Jem Hadar is meant to make them seem badass. But it really reveals a crippling weakness in their military design: almost nobody is all that experienced. A Star Fleet battle commander might have 40 years of experience.. across hundreds of situations and facing numerous types of enemy.  JH: We can fight at age 3 days. Yeah, I'm sure you're super effective knowing absolutely nothing and having practiced using no weapons, tools, ships, gear or studying the enemy."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Sadly, that's a lot more difficult because DS9 was the first Trek show to extensively use CGI. So it wouldn't just be a matter of rescanning the original film and reediting it (already not a simple task), but many of the space battles would have to be remodeled. Some of the assets involved might even have to be rebuilt from scratch, due to changes in technology. 

They did a few scenes for the documentary ""What We Left Behind,"" which looked great, but it was apparently expensive."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,The TNG remaster didn't really sell that well so that ship is sailed
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Eh. I'm old enough to have watched when originally broadcast, but recently bit the bullet and did a full rewatch a couple of years back.  

After awhile I didn't really care about the fact that it wasn't remastered.  DS9 is a masterpiece as-is, as far as I'm concerned.  TNG, DS9, Strange New Worlds, Voyager and fuck everything else except for TOS."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Unofficial ones exist.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,When AI gets good enough you'll see all these older show get remasters en masse.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Fun fact: Jeffrey Combs was so good in this role that they invented the concept of the Vorta all being clones specifically to justify bringing him back after they'd already killed his character.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"> everyone has shades of gray

That is the best thing in shows. That's why I loved Stargate: Universe so much. Everyone was grey, there were no black/white characters. Black/white is such boring storytelling to me. Unrealistic."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Nothing like [warp core sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oobIAEhXuU) to soothe the soul.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"They're bred to know how to fight, so they can already shoot, punch, and strategise by day 3, which was shown in one DS9 episode. Their limited age is also a control mechanism: by dying earlier, there's less of a chance of them rebelling against the Founders. They remain loyal for the duration of their short lives and never question orders because they never have to learn that questioning orders might be in their favour. 

It's important to remember that everything the Founders built into the Dominion was about controlling solids. The Vorta were originally marsupials living in trees that were genetically altered to serve the Founders and the Jem'Hadar were made chemically depedent on ketracel white to the point where they would die without it. The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,if I were a billionaire I'd bankroll the hell out of it
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Selling them for 80 bucks a season might well have had something to do with that.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,A DS9 remaster is probably the one thing that could get me to sub to Paramount+.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,I was hesitant about SNW and i still cant believe how good it was. Every episode I was afraid it eas gonna fall off the rails and it just didnt. I love anson mount and ethan peck
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Lousy upscales don’t count.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Only of certain episodes and scenes, right? No one's ever done the whole series afaik"

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"That's not going to happen till someone figures out how to train the AI to understand 2D pictures as 3D scenes. Without this, all sorts of weird 2D artifacts will constantly pop up everywhere."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"He was great on DS9.  I loved him in The Frighteners, too."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Jeffrey Combs is by far the most underrated Trek actor. He played at least three different iconic characters (Weyoun, Brunt [FCA], and Shran), plus a bunch of others, but was never a main cast member.

Wikipedia says Shran might have become a main character if Enterprise had gotten a fifth season, and now I wish Enterprise had gotten a fifth season even more than I did before."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Got a hotspot on my damn tv because I put one of those 12 hour ""Engine Core"" youtube videos on in the background for a week straight before bed. Then I figured out how to turn the tv screen off and leave the volume on. Ahhhhhhhh yeah. Soothing."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Punching is actually not that useful in a galaxy that has beams and torpedoes that destroy ships with thousands of troops on them in a few hits. And, ya know, guns. 

I didn't get the sense the Jem Hadar were all that loyal, at least not as we were told. In fact, Weyoun even admits this outright the ep that we meet him. If they were so loyal, there'd be no need for the White. But there is a need, isn't there? And we see entire units of Jem Hadar that did rebel in two separate episodes. On two other occasions we see JH defy their orders/superiors and do what they want. 

*The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug.*

Yes, I know. But that doesn't mean it was a sensible feature to add. It wasn't. It was fantastically stupid and self-defeating. Even in the 21st century, you don't win wars with legions of inexperienced, ignorant brutalists who are great at punching and stabbing or even shooting. Effective militaries of advanced societies have commanders that are experienced, knowledgeable, educated, and part of a free society that encourages and rewards independent thinking, creative solutions, etc., It has troops that are trained and taught by those with decades of experience. It ensures loyalty by having a society that values and nourishes them, respects and supports them.. not enslaves and degrades. The Dominion likes to take the long view, what happens over centuries or millennia. You know what inevitably happens to societies like the Dominion over time? They self-destruct like Soviet Russia, or weaken and shrivel into irrelevant, obsolete isolates like NK.   


The Ketracel White is also an exercise in incredible stupidity. The Dominion obviously has to produce this stuff, and produce it in absolutely massive quantities. The Dominion has to protect these factories at all costs... if their enemy takes them out, it's game over. I wonder who would be defending these facilities? Oh yes, we know, Jem Hadar would. All it would take to massively imperil the Dominion is one rogue JH group to take control of a facility, raid its warehouses, or destroy it out of spite. The White makes the Dominion more fragile, not stronger. Because the founders are arrogant morons who apparently have cultural PTSD. Right up to the very end they're convinced of nonsense about ""solids"" that isn't true, despite their massive and completely effective espionage and infiltration.. they remain ignorant fools, unable to understand the most basic things about the solids."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Wait seriously?
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"There’s a full edition that’s AI-upscaled that isn’t horrible, but since it just used the existing releases as the source it can’t be as good as the scenes that the *What We Left Behind* remastered by getting the original film out of storage."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Re-Animator.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I loved him on Star Trek Enterprise.  Whenever he is in Star Trek, he brings this magical charm."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"It's hard to call him underrated when he's so rightfully celebrated across the fandom. Still, any credit headed his way is deserved, pinkskin."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,He was also the guy who Jonathan Frakes beat out for the role of Commander Riker on The Next Generation.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"> cultural PTSD

Well, yes. That's the point. The Founders distrusted all solids and quite literally wanted to subjugate the galaxy. They're not thinking of it from a 'hey, maybe we should give Jem'Hadar the ability to think because they'll be better strategists if they learn' because, to them, that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall. All solids weren't to be trusted and had to be controlled.

It's also fair to say that the few Jem'Hadar who rebelled, much like that one that had mutated to no longer need ketracel white, were the minority. They killed their own over disloyalty. 

It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"That was the original retail price, they went on sale for about 40 or 30 pretty quickly after release, but if you wanted to be a fan who supported the project, yeah, you were paying absurd prices at first."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I guess it isn't cheap, or they thought superfans would pay it.

Either way I think the whole thing failed for them the second they were put on Netflix and company and no one had to pay those insane prices at all, even if at streaming quality."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Perhaps. But he is extremely underrated as an actor in general.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," *that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall.* 

Yeah, except that they did that anyway. They did that the very second they decided their entire security and military apparatus would be 100% dependent on solids. You can't have it both ways. You can't have a force that is incredibly powerful and sentient and also have a force that can never harm you. That isn't how reality works. 

*were the minority.*

Probably so. But this might not matter at all. The Dominion uses several control mechanisms we see: genetic programming, hardcore indoctrination/socialization (""victory is life""), and ketracel white. You know why lots of mechanisms are necessary in the Dominion, but not necessary in, say, Star Fleet? Because the threat of loss of control is very real- and that's according to the Dominion itself. The problem is all of these mechanisms can and do fail. It makes no difference at all if it's a minority of troops because the Dominion has made itself so incredible vulnerable in many ways. It has a centralized population apparently on a single world. A single Dominion dreadnought, taken over by rebels even momentarily could annihilate the entire Link in minutes. A single group of rogue JH could destroy a White factory or warehouse... which then leads to a shortage, which leads to thousands or millions of troops being executed or going mad and turning on the Dominion. And since the Dominion decided to invade and make enemies of nearly every humanoid race in the galaxy, guess who's coming to pay a visit when catastrophe weakens their military strength? Everyone. 

*It's not stupid to the Founders,*

Nothing is foolish and self-destructive to the person or people who choose it. That doesn't mean it wasn't foolish and self-destructive. Hitler thought invading the USSR was a great idea. Japan thought bombing the US and half the pacific was a shrewd move.  They each had their reasons. They were still incredibly stupid or ignorant or both for not understanding the consequences of their actions of important facts about their situation and other civilizations."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,">It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc.

And the prophets, tbf. They were instrumental in hamstringing the Dominion."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Very much agree. And also mad that he's not had a new character in the present live action shows. He could play an older Shran or his son in SNW!
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"True. Though this is a bit just to further that story element and Sisko character development, not really an organic narrative element of the Dominion war. That said, the Dominion still would have lost. You simply can't wage war against an entire quadrant. Imagine 30 different worlds all locked in an existential battle, all of them working together and pouring R&D and resources into anti-dominion tech and weapons. The Dominion couldn't even manage to control Cardassia, a single race. Rebellion and sabotage bloodied its nose and tripped it up. They resorted to genocide, but this is a losing strategy.. you're destroying an economic base of billions meanwhile your enemies are deploying their own resources in full."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"The most important character in all of Federation history is in DS9

Union Man Miles O'Brien"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I like DS9, but it's routinely cited as the best or second best Star Trek series. Not exactly ""underrated."""
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"The best supporting cast in history of TV: Garak, Weyoun, Gul Dukat, Rom, Brunt, Grand Nagus Zek, Vic Fontaine, and countless others. Insane amount of well written, well acted characters. And they're not even in the main cast."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9’s longer serialized storytelling and arch’s have aged incredibly well.  It’s like it was made for binge watching.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"""You punched me!?, Picard never punched me!"""
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,‘Underrated’ hahaha by who? It’s always been ranked among the top for Trek series.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"My rule on DS9 was its kind of rough to get into, but once they changed the uniforms to the fancy ones with very limited colour, and Sisko got a goatee and shaved his head, the series got really frigging good"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Hello childhood, loved this show."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Everything about DS9 is just incredible. I only got into it a few years ago, but I've watched it start to finish a few times now. It may not have the same 'iconic' characters as TNG, but everything else is what makes it great.

The storytelling/writing is Shakespearian - the character arcs, the subtle tensions, love/hate relationships, murky grey areas of life, love and politics - it all paints a truly believable world, filled with hope, turmoil, and everything in between.

Nog's story arc may be the best character development in the history of Star Trek - from petty thief to war 'hero'. The Dominion War is one of the most incredible story arcs I've seen on TV... it all starts from a single off hand comment in S2E7 about 'doing business with the Dominion' - and then not even bringing 'Dominion' up again for a bunch more episodes. Hell, even the costumes tell a story - when Bashir was replaced with a changeling, everyone on DS9 changed to the new style costumes (including the changeling imposter), but Bashir himself was wearing the old style costume in the prison. Also - Dukat is one of the best 'villains' on TV - and I love how close they came to making him likable in certain episodes.

The whole series is just filled with small details and nuances that make the whole thing feel truly alive. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen, Star Trek or otherwise."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Is DS9 ""underrated"" in the classical sense, or the Reddit way where it means ""something I want to talk about""?

DS9 it's widely regarded as the most mature and plot driven of all the Star Trek series."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"It's Starfleet at the frontier of the federation. This isn't the liberal utopia of the core worlds that Rodenberry envisioned. It's more like our own because the place is messed up. There's lingering political upheval, racial tension, money, corruption, religion, and a cold war enemy that isn't going to be bullied around.   It's ""Dark Trek"". And while it easily resonate with more people who know all about dysfunctional systems, it's.... not the bright optimistic portrayal of ""how to do things right"" which is what I really like about Trek.

They probably should have touched more on the problem of keeping starfleet personnel on the station. People only sign up for starfleet because they want to. There's no pay or rewards. It's just prestige and altruism. Which is in short supply on the ass-end of the map.

I went to a smaller sci-fi convention recently. The demographic is really aging. None of my younger co-workers have even seen Trek. ANY of it.  And it hit me. The younger generation is a bunch of depressed doomers, partly, because they've never even seen an optimistic future of how everything could work out. Trying to think of non-dysfunctional families in modern media is hard. There's no cpt. Planet telling us how we can save the forests. There are no stories out there where of course the government would step in and do the right thing. That's almost laughably unrealistic.    

Even all these new Trek shows aren't exactly optimistic. Picard centered around how Starfleet changed for the worse. There's so much wrong with STD. Lower Decks is nice. I like it. Funny. But it certainly shows Starfleet as being way less competent than pretty much any other series. SNW is really damn good though."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,All Hail Quark
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Always thought Sisko was the best captain.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Question is, is there enough of a resurgence to warrant remastering the series?"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Underrated? By who?
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Of all the TNG era Star Trek, I’d say DS9 has to most solid writing, because after a shaky start, they were telling a defined story. Yeah you had filler episodes, but there was an overarching main story going on. Sisko as the Emissary, his part to play in Galactic happenings vis-a-vi the Dominion War. 

Everyone got a chance to shine! The actors were all brilliant. The stories gripping and surprising to see certain characters grow into fan favorites. Nog joining Starfleet and his motivations for doing so, followed then by his maiming in the war. Motherfucking Garak, there’s never a bad time for him. Bashir’s reveal that he’s an augmented human. I also enjoyed the showcase of Sisko, O’Brien and Worf as differing images of fatherhood. Major Kira as the BEST first officer in the franchise. Odo as the beat Cop who knows every inch of every bad deal going down and how to nip it in the bud. 

Goddamn I loved that show…everyone should give it a spin at least once."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"People saying DS9 isn't underrated clearly weren't watching live back in the 90's. It's also weird that modern Trek is obsessed with Voyager, the worst one, and not DS9, the best one."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Easily my favorite Star Trek, and probably show, of all time. 

It’s one of those shows that when I start a rewatch, I’m on the sixth or seventh season before I even notice. And while there are some groan worthy and skippable episodes early on, even some of the worst are “absurd and fun in a way only ds9 can be” instead of unwatchable. Move Along Home is the exception here and should not exist. 

That documentary they did a few years ago is an incredible watch too, even with the crazy blue facial hair on Behr. 

It makes me extra sad that we have lost so many main cast members early."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Don't believe DS9 was ever considered underrated. The later seasons with the Dominion War story arc formula was phenomenal and well liked. Two episodes off the top of my head (The Siege of AR-558 and Far Beyond the Star) are two of the most renown Trek episodes out there.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9 was in the A class of Star Trek series.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Massive Trekkie here. I love the shows and movies, especially TNG, but DS9 (especially seasons 3-6) is by far the best Trek I have ever seen. So glad people are discovering it now. It was far ahead of its time, and has some of the best writing and characters in television, let alone sci-fi."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9 is definitely not underrated.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"DS9 has some gems but A LOT of filler.  I’m rewatching now and there is a lot of Quark episodes.  I like quark but its a lot.

Just watched the episode where Ducat is leading the Pa Wraith cult and Kira is just pulling her hair out at how stupid the followers are.  Seemed familiar….  I mean the baby was Cardassian!  Also Ducat has to be one of the scummiest TV characters out there."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,A whole article without a single word justifying the premise. What resurgence?
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Its great to see it get the love and respects it deserves. DS9 was too different at the time and a lot of people hated that. Now, its being rediscovered and people appreciate how good it was."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Best Star Trek series ever.  It took a couple seasons to find its stride, but once it did, it was amazing."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Underrated? Don't think so. ST: Enterprise was and should have been given a bit more room to grow. They gave all the wiggle room needed to Voyager despite it focusing far too much on the hologram room and an ahole who wanted to build a sooperdooper fast space car but the terminated Enterprise without thought or care.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Stop it. Who has been saying it’s bad? Or underrating it? It’s constantly held alongside B5 as the best of 90s scifi and foundational to some of the tv we got in the 21st century.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9 swapped to non-episodic content after Babylon 5 showed them how it was supposed to be done.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"ITT: people confusing ""underrated among Star Trek fans"" with ""underrated in overall pop culture"""
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9 was a good show but it has become so overrated by fans these days.  Like most Star Trek there were good episodes and stinkers.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"""We're running a little low on entertainment content this month. Can you find some random entry in a legacy series and write an article about it how it's underrated regardless of the actual critical and audience receptions?""

""Yeah, I think we've only done 621 of those so far this year. We're still good for a while."""
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,One of my favorites Star Trek series
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Babylon 5
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,DS9 is my favorite.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Kai Opaka > Kai Winn forever
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I have nothing to say besides DS9 is one of the best tv shows of all time, let alone of ST. When I see the abyssal difference in quality besides this and Discovery or Picard I go medieval, and strange homicidal thoughts invade my brain"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Loved that show.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"It’s not underrated? It’s just as popular as TNG, underrated would be Enterprise since nobody even talks about it.."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I’ve watched next gen, ds9 and voyager. Ds9 is definitely the best of them imo"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"It was really good, then it got great when they shaved Avery Books head and he got to be Hawk in space. I suspect very few will get this reference."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Babylon 5. 

The two shows were on at the same time, B5 blew DS9 out the water. We were a firm trek household but DS9 just didn’t cut it. Still not been able to do a rewatch! 

B5 has aged terribly from a VFX point of view, but everything is else was strong. 

If DS9 wasn’t a trek show it probably would have moved out to the margins."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I admit I am not a Star Trek guy, but is DS9 still underrated? A lot of my friends and social media mutuals are big Star Trek fans and they talk about it all the time - and have been doing so for probably a decade now."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,I wish it was wide screen. It’s what we call in our house a “square show”. I do enjoy it though.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I've never watched more than a few episodes of DS9.  

I'm saving it for a special occasion, like a bottle of wine.  I like knowing that it's there for me to experience fresh when the time is right."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Is DS9 really underrated? When I binged all the 90s Trek shows during lockdown, I had to look up info on the shows since I'd never watched them growing up and just about every place I looked rated DS9 rated as the best of the 90s shows (Voyager and Enterprise seemed evenly split as the worst, though I ended up liking both better than Next Generation 🤷🏾‍♀️)."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Cool, let me know when it’s B5’s turn."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I had a friend who was adamant that I watch DS9 from the first season all the way through, and he was right.  It takes a little while to find it’s footing (and for the good writers to roll off of TNG) but the character development throughout is just incredible.  Going from absolutely hating Quark to becoming my favourite character says a lot in itself, but they did such a good job playing with our built in allegiances and insinuations, bringing depth and humanity to Garak, Rom, Gul Dukat and many others.  The interplay and evolution of the main cast was truly remarkable as well."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"DS9 isn't underrated, but it was ahead of its time in plenty of ways. It's got dark politics, morally gray characters, moral characters who break down in war and lose their purity, an overall fog of doubt, and verisimilitudes (approach most characters and every scenario with doubt about the truth or how people appear).  

The first season is sometimes weak, and the show has plenty of weaker episodes that I skip on rewatches. But overall, it's a gem and one well suited to current geopolitics."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Best Star Trek Ever.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Yeah I'm almost done a full watch of DS9 for the first time and as really surprised how relevant it is today. Some of the things it tackles in early seasons are:

- The moral plight of dealing with refugees.
- The rise of religious nationalism. 
- Trans issues
- Sexual harrassment

And it goes on."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Watched and finished it in about like during the second and third month of the first lockdown two years ago honestly in my top 5 tv series of all time
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"Great, can't wait to watch Move Along Home again."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,The long running Dominion War storyline is why that show became so good. If the writers had stuck to self-contained episodes like the original series or TNG it never would have come into its own. It proved the value of long running story arcs and buildup.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,">underrated

mhm

that being said it's probably the best Star Trek gets, sure its not true to Roddenberry's vision but it has some of the best character development and story of the entire franchise"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,Best star trek series there's been
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"DS9 is second only to TNG and, even then, barely so."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"I’m waiting on the sanctuary districts of mid 2020s to become a reality that they predicted. We might not quite be there yet, but it sure feels like we’re headed in that direction as a society."
The 100,"It is cheesy as hell.

If you can handle that it's pretty entertaining for a while. 

If you can't, stay away."
The 100,"It's fun the first few seasons. Characters do a lot of dumb stuff, if you can get past that then sure."
The 100,It starts off extremely cheesy CW teenish but really finds itself and turns into pretty good scifi with some pretty dark themes. I think its worth watching. Watch the first season and if you don't have the desire to watch the 2nd season then dont. Though season 2 is by far the best.
The 100,"Season one is good enough and it gets better for a while, in my opinion. It's entertaining and it has a riveting development until season 5. I would have ended there (it was a great finale), I didn't like the last two seasons."
The 100,"Yes

first season is tough but after good"
The 100,"yes, really good after first season"
The 100,If you like CW production quality mixed  with dumb kids doing dumb things. Absolutely
The 100,"Yes, yes yes."
The 100,"It’s very fun for its first few seasons and has moments of thoughtfulness in there.  It’s also bat shit insane at points and can be a lot of fun. The last three seasons, especially the last two are garbage and horrendously awful."
The 100,"Yes, it’s one of my favorite shows!"
The 100,honestly no. it did start off cheesy and then got pretty good for a while but it spins its tires for like 5 seasons repeating the same betrayal storylines before it gets.. weird and ends stupidly. i enjoyed a lot of the show but i wouldn't recommend spending 7 seasons on it.
The 100,"Seasons 1-5 are great, I don’t rewatch many shows but this one is always in the back of my mind for a re-watch. It’s basically a more action/violent version of the Lord of the Flies."
The 100,"Yes, it's a fun show that surprises you in how it develops. The first few episodes are rough, but then it gets gradually better and goes to some surprisingly dark and interesting places. At times, it can be a bit repetitive and the characters are more driven by plot than the other way around, but it is a thoroughly entertaining show. I personally don't find it to be a cheap-looking show (some people seem to be really down on CW shows), but they do have a limited budget and don't look as glossy as a high profile streaming drama.I think they do well with the limited budget they have.

Generally, I would recommend you to watch the show:

\- if you like sci-fi

\- if you like characters doing questionable things

\- if you enjoy plot-driven shows

\- if you like survival drama

\- if you don't have bias against shows that are produced on a television budget rather than a movie/streaming budget"
The 100,Is anything worth watching?
The 100,"The show makes a drastic tonal change after the first three episodes so watch through then.

The first couple seasons are good, it takes hard right and left turns every season, if you feel like it's just getting too absurd after a couple seasons quit.."
The 100,"Takes 3 rough episodes to get extremely good, last two seasons are not ideal, I would watch through the season 5 finale"
The 100,For the first ... 3 seasons or so? Maybe 4. Absolutely. It unravels after that though.
The 100,"The 100 is a brutal story about teenagers learning about having to make life and death decisions in an impossible situation.  It is violent and tragic and deals with the outcomes of both and their effects on the people involved.

The main cast gets killed off one by one over the course of the series.  And while there are romances, they exist mostly to cause increased pain when one of them dies or betrays the other.

The show tells seasonal stories.  Each season wraps up a story, then the next season gets bigger - expanding the world and the problems they face.

So you can stop at the end of any season and be reasonably satisfied."
The 100,"starts weak like every typical CW show but finds itself before the end of the first season and is actually pretty good until the last season or 2 where it's pretty weak again.

I'd say it's worth it"
The 100,"S1 episodes 1-3 are typical CW-level cheesiness and YA love triangles.

S1 rest of the season you realize the showrunner started out with that YA nonsense to get the show made on the CW but in reality he had a bigger idea in mind, and he started to execute it, and it starts to become good tv

S2 through S5 - great tv. Consider S5 the end of the show

S6 and S7 are like a re-boot, and its bad. Skip it. But, if you really care, just watch the last episode of S7 to see how the characters end up."
The 100,"For me it was a nice teenage tv drama but nothing outstanding. If you are into not expensive and kind of simple (in terms of graphics and visual in general) shows that are certainly made for teenagers and filled with teenager characters than you could give it a try. Don't get me wrong it has its own charm and when I started watching it I got really involved in the story. However as a teenage drama ""The 100"" has many emotional teenagers going through emotional stuff but sometimes it really lacks logic and solid story behind all of it. Plus for me the closer the show was coming to an end the worse it was getting, I watched the last season just because I've already watched everything before it."
The 100,"Season1 isn't good. Season2 is great. The final season is bad...

If you love Sci-fi, give it to a try!"
The 100,"First few seasons were great, but it trails off after that."
The 100,"NO, It is just so terrible. I found it to be CW garbage from start to finish."
The 100,"Jesus Christ i haven’t seen this show in years, but it’s my greatest guilty pleasure

I’ve dubbed it the best bad show ever made

The first three episode’s are unbearable. I would suggest watching them and letting yourself laugh. Don’t take it too seriously, because that’s impossible. But at the end of the 3rd episode there is a plot twist that I think sets the tone for the rest of the show.

If you finish the third episode and you don’t want to know what happens next, that’s fine, just stop watching. But I have given this three episode rule to everyone I recommend this show to and they always keep watching. 

It’s always a little cheesy, but what you stay for is the incredibly fun characters and that ever expansive world building. It’s insane but SO cool at the same time

It’s a fun show! I hope you like it!"
The 100,"No.
Edit: it's only worth it for Lexa (+Clarke but she's mostly a doormat lol)"
The 100,Was a cool concept wxecutuon was terrible
The 100,"The first season started off pretty cheesy, but I ended up really enjoying the show by the end of the season. Season 2 was even better, and I genuinely thought it had some truly gripping moments. But then I thought the season 3 premiere had this weird tonal shift that really turned me off, and I just never bothered to continue with it. I heard the later seasons go up and down in quality, so I don’t have much of a desire watch the show all the way through at this point."
The 100,"This is coming from the self proclaimed leading The 100 expert in the field, a title that’s way more of a burden then an honor. 

If you get enjoyment out of taking the shit outta a show but also want something that has a bit of self respect, it’s the perfect show. It’s very dumb but has a lot of surprising quality to it and pulls some shocking moves you don’t see on TV often.
It’s also pretty fun with alcohol in the system. Just saying. 
Just stop watching on season 4 if you end up having any attachment to the characters, because they get wrecked to high heaven in the writing department."
The 100,"They do a full reboot of the show in the final three seasons, mimicking Stargate of all things.   Ascended beings, immortals gods/royalty, A.I. threat, and actual stargates to other planets.  Ending is meh."
The 100,This.
The 100,I thought s2 was some seriously good tv
The 100,This is the best take…I agree.
The 100,"If they skip the last two seasons, they miss out on the amazing development of Murphy."
The 100,I really enjoyed the first two seasons and then it went off the rails for me.
The 100,"I enjoyed the show up to its end. Say what you will about the final three seasons, but they were not quite as repetitive as the conflicts that kept repeating themselves in the first four years. The body-swapping and time-jumping reinvigorated the series in my opinion. Season 5 also introduced Diyoza, who was one of the best characters in the entire series, and I found the Blood Reina stuff also fairly interesting. What I personally liked about The 100 was that the show was always willing to get very dark, whether that's characters committing genocide or eating human flesh.

The Bellamy thing in the final season is likely impacted by some behind the scenes stuff with the actor, same way as Lexa had to die when the actress became unavailable. Personally, I also wouldn't say that The 100 was a character-driven show. It was primarily a plot-driven show. That is why characters like Bellamy shifted alliances various times through the series, not because it made sense for the character, but because the plot required it."
The 100,"The sky people vs grounders conflict kept me invested for the first half of the show. When that conflict resolved my interest started to dip. 

It was almost like the creators thought there had to be 2 warring factions at any given time. Oh grounders and sky people are living under the same roof? Here's some space prisoners. Space prisoners and former characters escaped earth together? Here's some body swappers."
The 100,"The last episode was crap, but otherwise I enjoyed all seasons."
The 100,"We've seen the seasons leading up to prima fyre.  We started the season after that with the prisoners crashing to Earth.

This season feels too much like a reboot.  Like most of the past doesn't matter anymore and they are wholesale introducing new characters.  I've just lost interest."
The 100,"The 100's greatest sin was how it killed off some of its biggest characters 


Spoilers ahead, I get that Lexa's actor had to be killed off because she got a leading role in Fear the Walking Dead and couldn't do both parts, but the way it happened was not good. The same goes for Bellamy. He died for no reason and it all ended up feeling like a very cheap way to shook the audience


The first season was a bit too much teen drama for my taste, but the show kept me interested throughout all its seasons. The final season didn't go down in history as the ""best final season ever"", but it was good enough. 


The 100 is also some of the darkest and most brutal shows I've seen om American network TV. I don't know how they managed to keep the TV-14 rating on all the episodes. Some of them had some seriously mature content"
The 100,i didn't make it past season2 IIRC. it started strong but i feel that they took a left turn with the concept
The 100,I would say to the end of season 5 was fine even if this season wasn't up to par with the rest. Season 6 was the nail in the coffin for the series with the Sanctuary storyline. The final episodes tried to fix the last couple of seasons but by this time it was to late. Was the final eradication of the valley a Earth apocalypse or just the valley? If it was the valley only why not travel somewhere to the other side of Earth?
The 100,"The first season was increasingly good as it went on, season 2 was excellent, and then it completely fell apart in season 3 with horrendous writing full of plotholes and characters not acting according to their established characterization, forcefully writing in scenes purely for shock value regardless of how it hampered the plot or wrote them into a corner, expanding worldbuilding in spots only to fail in filling it out afterwards, leaving it shallow and at times nonsensical. It only got worse from there on out, even after they rebooted and effectively gave themselves something of a clean slate. It somehow managed to even get worse instead of them figuring out how not to repeat past mistakes.

It's not surprising when the behind the scenes stuff leaked that the showrunner's grudges were ruining the writing room's work, with Rothenberg sometimes axing whole scenes last minute, cutting out all the lines for some characters even if that material would have made the scenes worthwhile, etc. (one clear example is Ricky Whittle's character Lincoln, but there have been other characters impacted similarly)"
The 100,[deleted]
The 100,"Eh I loved pretty much the entire series, despite its flaws lol.  I generally felt s6  was better than most of s5. The ending was dogshit, to the point that it was almost comical lol.  Still one of my all time faves tho."
The 100,"The 100 was my favorite CW show until Season 5. The heart of it was them dealing with the Grounders, once they all became one tribe it was all downhill there.

Season 5 was bad, especially when it came to Octavia. Season 6 was good but it should’ve ended with the Primes going away and them truly getting a fresh start to end the series. Instead we got Season 7 which was a real disaster, that finale was one of the worst I’ve ever seen.

I need to rewatch it soon and I like those later seasons better now."
The 100,Every subsequent season of this show miraculously made the previous season look genius by comparison..
The 100,"too long; didn’t read

But I did watch six seasons and it was a complete turd. Truly the worst thing I’ve suffered (and often laughed) through."
The 100,"Was that the show where they were literally killing people off in the first episodes on the planet, where everyone had lots of things like assault rifles, and where their ""survival"" for even 24 hours was in question because they were so useless and at war with each other from the start and didn't have the brains to properly defend and/or move?

I got pissed off with it very quickly, because it was similar to a story I'd had in my head since I was a kid, and it started off (for a very short time) as really promising and pretty much the same story, and within literally one or two episodes (less than 24 hours of ""real"" time) it just was about blowing each other away and being in a war that was totally avoidable.

I couldn't work out if it was a kid's thing or a teenager thing or an adult's thing.  It was too pathetic for any one category in any given episode."
The 100,"Up to season five, the show was fine. It declined after season 3, but it was still serviceable. And they could have stopped it there. There was even a nice ending for it.

But then season six happened, and I wanna die. That season (and season 7) were so abysmally terrible that I cannot for the life of me recommend them to my worst enemy."
The 100,This is true for most cw shows
The 100,[deleted]
The 100,I didnt like some bits of it but overall was good
The 100,"I read a few of the books - which were good.
I watched the first few seasons but stopped. I saw prima fyre and then stopped watching."
The 100,"I also enjoyed it, but I think it went the same way as other sci-fi shows. Gets better each season, peaks, tries to switch up drastically to keep audience engaged but ultimately fails. In the end, it embraced the wackiness and went off the rails, but it remained good fun."
The 100,"I actually really enjoyed the entire thing. I can recognize that people will find the final season controversial. But for me it drove home the themes of the show and wrapped up some of the dangling threads from earlier seasons. It's not a perfect show, but it took risks. And I'll take that any day over a show with a writing team that just phones it in."
The 100,The last season still makes no sense to me after a few watches
The 100,The last two seasons were just a crappy Stargate SG-1 ripoff.
The 100,"Season 4 was the perfect ending but thankfully the later seasons didn’t ruin the earlier ones, like some other shows…"
The 100,[deleted]
The 100,Lasted too long
The 100,"What!? Some pople actually liked The 100?

Whats wrong with you?"
The 100,"That’s pretty much exactly where I bailed on the show. It mixed teen drama, post apocalypse, and sci-fi pretty well. You’re absolutely right about it treating the audience like adults."
The 100,More and more I’m just watching the first season of something and then moving onto something else
The 100,"I don't like season 5 but season 4 ending was not a proper ending for the show, season 5 ending was the perfect point even if the season itself was lackluster.

Though, even though I don't like the real ending of the show I find it admiring. It is such an anime/manga ending, it was refreshing on that regard. Western shows don't go that crazy with their endings usually."
The 100,Never watched it because I was and still am pissed about The 4400
The 100,"Five was fine, they should have quit while they were ahead. I’ll defend Book 1 all day and say Book 2 needed to be all about Cadogan and more spaceship visiting those colonies without portals. Spin-off attempt was a mistake, couple critical errors in B2 means it’s never getting watched again, again"
The 100,I feel like this can be said for majority of The CW shows they are great or good for about 1-5 seasons and then they should have ended or been canceled.
The 100,I’ve been trying to finish it up but it just keeps changing directions.
The 100,"I enjoyed it to until Season 2 or 3.  I forget which.  It started very CW teen drama show, then improved.  Then I felt became way to teen drama again.

But it was good for a CW show.  Shorter seasons really helped."
The 100,My people
The 100,"Huh? Some of the best moments in that show were way after Season 2 and I think the reviews reflect that.

Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8rPw2V_Vg)."
The 100,I'm pretty bummed they didn't pick up the prequel
The 100,"Its the CW. 

nothing else to add.

I both happy and sad they didnt pick up the B5 pilot."
The 100,"God awful????? What are you smoking??? Smallville(although didnt start on cw), Arrow, flash, legends of tomorrow, supergirl, the 100, Nikita, supernatural, originals, TVD, charmed, beauty and the  beast, izombie, black lightning, containment. All great shows!!. 

Ones that were great that sadly cancelled/ended too soon are: frequency, Valor, tomorrow people. 

As for the 100 id more so say it got bad mid season 6+"
The 100,"Um you could maybe say that season 7 was a step back but everything up to then was awesome. I am one of the  less heard parts of the extremely toxic fanbase that actually thinks that season 5 would have been a terrible place to end the show. There simply were way too many plot points and un resolved character conflicts (Octavia and Kane/Abby) for the show to end there. Same with season 4, you can't tell me you didn't want to see what happened to those in the bunker. I think ultimately the reason why the very vocal fans scream that the show should have ended after season 5 is because of the tonal shift away from the central themes of 1-5. 6 is still dark but it does feel like a slightly different show with how colorful Sanctum is, but just it's different does not make it bad. The main conflict went from being Clarke and friends against some big bad and ended up as Clarke and friends against each other because of the shifting priorities in season 5. And this bled into seasons 6-7.

Also, the fandom is what creating the shipping. This is not nor was it ever about who gets with whom. This was a survival, sci-fi television show. Frankly the shipping in The 100 fandom drove all of us non-shippers insane. We actually got to discuss interesting topics about life, ethics, and morality before all the shipping took over everything. 

Season 7 was still good. There were just some writing decisions I didn't like. As for Bellamy's death, I honestly couldn't see his story ending any other way. All the death and violence around him really messed him up. He thought he was saving his friends, and he was, and he did. Also I applaud you for mentioning him dying because of Madi, but Madi gave herself up without knowledge of how far Cadogan would go. Clarke shooting him was for the same reason she left him to die in season 5, he chose his priorities over his promise to protect Madi."
The 100,"I enjoyed the whole show. From start to end. I was actually depressed when it ended, after that many season I was fully invested."
The 100,Season 7 episode 4 might have been the best episode tho
The 100,"Same sentiment for me, I watched those first two seasons eagerly week to week and was pleasantly surprised again and again. Season 3 hit and I struggled to keep up but eventually sat down and finished it after it aired but it was a grind. A couple of episodes in to s4 I couldn't watch anymore, just felt like a drastic drop off when compared to the first two."
The 100,"I totally agree.  I honestly watched it because it was mostly filmed 20 minutes from me , which I found cool , and the leads were hot.  But it was a good story and interesting , I kind of wish , now , that I stuck with it for a bit longer after hearing some stuff about it."
The 100,After season 2 it became soft core porn.
The 100,I wholeheartedly agree
The 100,"The minute the AI showed up at the end of S2, my expectations tempered for S3. I was subsequently disappointed by s3, held on until s4, and finally gave up. It was apparent it was going to keep hitting the same beats over and over again. Should have stopped after S2, when it peaked."
The 100,I love how the slow time planet got used as a prison. Like the same cabin could serve hundreds of years worth of sentences and never have two groups there !
The 100,Diyoza was a wonderful character and I sincerely hope that actress gets more work. She helped create someone you hated for a season in a half and then became an empathetic individual.
The 100,"Yeah, though there are character based reasons for Bellamy shifting loyalties so much. Most of the vitriol toward the show is because the fans perceived his death as pointless because Clarke killed him over Madi's sketchbook that she didn't end up getting (the running out of ammo thing was a bit tropey) when the whole point was the tragedy of shifting priorities. After season 4, their whole dynamic was totally different because they were no longer on the same page"
The 100,"The last season was pure ""fuck it hold my beer"" and I appreciate that"
The 100,"I know, the show felt like a reboot after season five, that killed my interest in the show. A thing about the show that bugged me, was previous major characters who died not matter to the characters or the show anymore, there a few exceptions like Lexa, Lincoln, Monty, and Jasper But I think Roan and Gabriel a king and the man who introduced the anomaly (a confusing plot point in season 6), who are both leaders who did what was best for their people, would be remembered and celebrated by the characters but by the next episode they are just forgotten about, like their choices didn't help the characters."
The 100,"Bellamy died for the same reason Clarke left him behind, he chose to put himself between Clarke and her priorities after he had already betrayed her twice. It's very consistent with her character and it really messed her up. Do you wish we could have gotten more time to see her deal with that though."
The 100,"This was true for me too. My sister in law recommended it to me and my wife. From the start I found the show tolerable at best, but my wife enjoyed it. But I started finding the show just worse and worse as the season progressed. They turned the most level headed character into an incredible irrational idiot until it got him killed. Then the whole plot line with the mountain people was just dumb. Why hold the people captive? Why not ask for volunteers for the marrow, or whatever the hell it was they were trying to forcibly extract? Sure it would take longer to reach your end goal, but you wouldn't have to be an evil bastard in the process.

After the season was over I told my wife I was done."
The 100,"I agree completely with it being good through season 5 and then falling off a cliff. One of the best qualities about The 100 was its ability to not look cheap despite being on a CW budget. Season 5 was the first season where you could tell there had been cuts or they had stretched their budget too thin but the overall storyline was good enough I could get past it. 

Then of course you had seasons 6 and 7 that seemed to have sets supplied by a dollar store and the story was garbage, there was no coming back from that."
The 100,The valley was the last green place on Earth
The 100,The Eartb was pretty much dead and gone after season 4. Just the valley. After season 5 there was nothing left. Add in the time dilation from the black hole in season 6 and 7 as well as the 125 year time skip in cryo and you cod see how it might possibly be back to being livable again.
The 100,The only thing we actually have evidence for is Ricky Whittle. Everything else is conjecture
The 100,Just because your expectations were subverted in season 3 doesn't mean that it was done for shock value
The 100,"Tbf, the only people who did transcend were those who weren't main characters. Except for Madi, every living main cast member chose to be with Clarke knowing full well they would be going to their eventual death."
The 100,"wanheda on the red button again, killing immortal space jesus. :D"
The 100,"Your last sentence fully contradicts the entirety of the rest of your comment before it.

You started with: “all the later seasons are garbage.”

And then ended with: “I like the later seasons better now.”

So are they garbage or do you like them? And how could you like them better now if you haven’t done the re-watch you want to do yet?

And yes I realize this is an ~7-8 month old post."
The 100,Um no? They didn't have weapons past knives until like episode 8 when they had already established comes with the Ark and were told about a weapons stash that was in a bunker near their location.
The 100,What happened with 4400?
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Glad for you. I would like to forget all about it and then re-watch it. So many different emotions and everything. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Not an anime guy either, then I made a deal with a buddy that if he watched Breaking Bad I would watch Brotherhood. I was hesitant at first but got sucked in and finished it in 2 weeks, now I have a whole new appreciation for the genre"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"A tank went into reverse when going against king Bradley!

A TANK!!

IN REVERSE!!!!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I lost interest in watching anime for a long while, but this show got me back into anime after hearing people recommend it. After this I watched Hunter X Hunter and Attack on Titan. Now I'm back into anime and enjoying old and new shows that I've never seen.

Edit: Most of the anime I've watched or am currently watching since last year: Cowboy Bebop, Ajin, Megalo Box, Made in Abyss, Killing Bites, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens, Death Note, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, My Hero Academia, Seven Deadly Sins, Drifters, World Trigger, and The Saga of Tanya the Evil. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Man fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, I'm on episode 44 and I don't want it to end.
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Note watch samurai champloo, cowboy bebop and trigun"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Love this series and have watched it a ton of times. Had to fight my husband because he wanted to name our kid Hoenhime. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,It’s all about Greed.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"It's one of my top three anime. The other two are Gurren Lagan and My Hero Academia. You should watch both if you haven't already. For MHA, you're going to need to give it a little to get going because the main character starts off a little annoying but man, it gets so good. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Yeah, it was my gateway drug into other anime.

By the way, if you're looking for another great series, although not on Netflix I don't think: The Last Airbender is what  got me to eventually watch FMA."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"A lot of people dump on the first adaptation since FMA:B adapted the *entire* manga, but the first adaptation spent more time on character development. It’s worth watching both. And reading the manga."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Most people aren't anime fans until they actually watch one...
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Great series. My 2nd favorite slightly behind Steins;Gate.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Did you see the episode with the dog? And the girl?... we don’t talk about that one. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,[deleted]
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Hey why don't you come join the weird cult known as JoJo's bizzare adventure. It's pretty great 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,You should also check the 2003 versión of Fullmetal alchemist it's starts the same but the story diverges from the original in a really dark and fucked up way 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"IMO FMA:B is the gold standard for television. The pacing is perfect: there's no filler, and the story is continually developing at such a rapid pace that every episode feels like it drops bombs. By the end of the show, the whole world of FMA: B feels completely different than what it was in the beginning and yet you can't exactly put your finger on where the story changed. It was always changing. Not only that, but I don't think there was a single character that was stupid. Every character seems to make smart, calculated, and strategic decisions (Flame Alchemist in particular.)

I felt the same way you do when I saw it (although I'm not sure I like the ending as much, but I don't really fault it.)"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"If you liked brotherhood and haven't watched avatar: the last airbender. The reason I watched brotherhood was because I did a rewatch of avatar and really needed something similar to take the pain away from it being over the legend of korra helped but this and avatar are the two shows I re watch at least once a year. They have great moments that make you think, laugh and cry and are just done so beautifully. The writing, character development, voice acting, drawings and music make two timeless masterpieces."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Oh hey, did they finally add the last episodes?"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I have a few complaints but overall this show was amazing and has less flaws than most shows I have seen. Scar and Mustang ended up being two of my favourite characters oh and Riza, Greed, Edward and Ling. So many of them were good."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"You should check out Cowboy Bebop. It's typically regarded as one of the best anime ever. Very digestible for anime newbies and is better in English. Also, it's soundtrack is exceptional. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Great! Welcome. Now watch hunterxhunter. You're welcome.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I would recommend you to watch the original FMA too , at least the episodes up to The Nina Episodes , those are a fair bit better than Brotherhood mostly because they didn't want to take long on an already animated part of the manga "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I don't really like most shounen anime, but I LOVE FMA:B! It truly is something special! I'm more into darker, more thought-provoking and slower-paced anime like Steins;Gate, Monster or Serial Experiments Lain. You should watch those too if you're into these kinds of anime!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Brotherhood is a masterpiece. Amazing from start to finish. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"So funny to see this cause I've been rewatching it recently. Absolutely my favourite anime, possibly my favourite tv show in general.

While the first adaptation is great too, imo I feel like it loses steam towards the end. I never truly liked the villain nor the ending, but Brotherhood on the other hand. It had so many great villains that you couldn't help enjoy.

I so wish I could forget about it just to watch it again. So many great scenes. When Ed finds Al's body - oh man.
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"The original anime, *Fullmetal Alchemist*, is also pretty amazing. It follows the manga for the beginning, so many of the earlier episodes are pretty much the same/similar between the two anime, but then veers way off course. The story is still pretty good though, and the movie, *Conqueror of Shamballa*, is worth watching after the end of the series.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend *Hunter x Hunter*, but it is pretty popular around here."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"> Its a long involved story arc with plenty of fascinating characters who truly change and learn and grow over time. The character development is top notch.

Then you'll love this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Galactic_Heroes#Anime"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I watched the entire FMA anime series before brotherhood was a thing. Should I check this one out too, or is it mostly the same?"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"> only started wathcing this accidentally as I am NOT an anime/manga fan. Know next to nothing about the genre as it overall doesn't interest me that much.  
but holy shit this was good!

It sounds like anime *does* interest you. Anime by itself isn’t a *genre*. It’s a *medium*. Saying “I don’t like anime” is like saying “I don’t like movies,” or “I don’t like art.” Yes, there are rare cases of people who legitimately don’t like these things as a whole. But the vast majority of the time, it simply means that they haven’t given it a chance, or they haven’t found something that clicks for them personally. If the only TV shows you ever saw were Barney, Teletubbies, and Blues Clues, you’d probably be saying that you don’t like TV. You simply need to find a genre of anime that matches what you’re looking for, and I’m sure you’ll grow to like it. 

Yes, there are common tropes that bridge different anime styles and genres. Many of them [are](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/luffy_blubber_fixed_4736.jpg).[focused](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/rsz_colorfailsaturated_857.jpg).[on](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jDfXy.jpg).[expressing](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/beach_guy_speechless.jpg).[emotion](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3a/bd/38/3abd38c1b9b6bab7d933c14de982a16d--yandere-simulator-minecraft.jpg), since it’s difficult to express subtle facial emotions on a drawn medium, like actors are able to do. So instead of being subtle or nuanced, they often go to an extreme and *exaggerate* emotional responses. But there’s also a lot that doesn’t span across the different genres, and it’s important to remember that a collection of tropes doesn’t make or break a particular medium. If it did, I’d never be able to watch movies without raging about the fact that the roads always look like it just rained, (because film crews will hose down the roads, to make it more visually interesting.)"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"FMAB and other one are my only 11/10 animes, they are the best for me

people said is exaggeration or that anything is perfect or 10/10

while i could agree, i always said, ""NAH they are 11/10 perfect""

-it has secrets, and they were revealed in a epic way

-excellent character development (a lot of good animes fails in this really bad... even the most popular ones because at some point the story nor the characters had anything else new to offer, in FMAB this shit is original constant... amazing, in other words while the protagonist are GOOD GUYS you cant really predict how they will act)

-excellent plot/sotry and transition of it during all series

-while is a fantasy story, it never feels forced things happens and not everything is about the protagonist, they are part of something

-good not half baked secondary characters

-NO FILL

-everything is answered (talking about the secrets and explanations)

-THE MOTHER FUCKING SOUNDTRACK

-the end was amazing (a lot of good animes fails in this miserably)

i feel bad for you if it was your first anime because, you saw one of the best and now your standards are pretty high lol"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,[removed]
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,[deleted]
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Wait a few month and then watch the original anime for another fix.

Ot starts of very similar to FMA:BH but has more character development and a completely different explanation for the main plot and characters motives and history. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,FMA:BH is easily in the top ten greatest animes. IMO
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Currently watching for the first time! About to finish part 3 on Netflix. Can’t believe it’s taken me this long to watch brotherhood after growing up watching the original show. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,It's a terrible day for rain...
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Have you tried Berserk?
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"What a love about it, is it has a beginning and an ending. It didn’t drag on like DBZ or Naruto. 

I wish there was more because it’s such a good story but an even bigger and greater “universe” inside of the story. Like how awesome would it be to see Ed take the test to become an official Alchemist. Or even more about the Flame Alchemist and his crew. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,I haven't watched it. Is it dubbed or captioned? I can't do captioned too often.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"It makes me so happy to hear about people watching this for the first time! I agree, even if you don't ""like"" anime it's worth it to give it a try. It's definitely in my top 5 favorite things I've watched. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I personally prefer the first series. I feel the first show was better written, better paced, and overall more mature. Brotherhood, by comparison, didn't impress outside of some of the action scenes. But I know my opinion is in the minority.

Its nice you enjoyed the show so much, even if I don't share your enthusiasm for it."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Better late than never. :)
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I've watched FMA about 3/4 the way through, can any body inform me on the difference between the original and ""Brotherhood""?"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"It is the only anime I got my wife to watch, she would catch stuff here and there and got into it so I started it over and we watched it together."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"How did you find the early episodes?

When I watched it (after having watched the 2003 series and read part of the manga) I thought it introduced too many characters and glossed over some events at the start too much to work for someone experiencing FMA for the first time with that show. I love the show otherwise, though."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Seriously so good...
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Yeah now you gotta watch some other anime! If you want to cry but also watch an amazing anime, check out Grave of the Fireflies. It will make you cry so hard. It's about the aftermath of the atom bombs in Japan. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist was/is one of my favorite anime of all time. I haven't watched brotherhood, but I've heard so many good things about it that I might watch it tonight. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Avatar: The Last Airbender (books 1-3).

That's my list of animated series folks should see.  All are great even for folks who don't like animation

Honorable mention goes to Sword of the Stranger, as it's got some cool fight scenes."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Mustang popping off on Envy is still one of my fav moments in anime
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Its either this or DeathNote. I suggest you watch this one next.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,wait.till you watch death note
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Watch Cowboy Bebop. I think 99% of anime is garbage (doesn't stop me from trying to watch it though), but Cowboy Bebop, like Fullmetal Alchemist, is a masterpiece."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,yeah it's one of the best anime ever
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,[deleted]
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"> The Trump russia thing is weirdly parallel to a major plot line in FMAB, I couldn't help but notice

Jesus, you had to go there, didn't ya?"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I mean I can understand why people like it and the world + basic story sounds really interesting, but the weird tonal shifts, the two leads (do they really get better?) and the super cliche Anime humour (lol he hates milk and he is short XD!!!1) really put me off. Also characters don't have to tell the viewer their motivation 2-3 times each episode. Maybe it gets better later but I dropped it around ep. 20. I enjoyed some movies and shows in the past, but this one I could not sit through. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Try out Gurren Lagan on Netflix. It isn't very long, but it's a fucking amazing emotional journey. Hunter x Hunter is one of my favorites as well. Ajin on Netflix is short and sweet with a unique story. Code Geauss is similar to death note, but it maintains its tempo the whole way through, fantastic show. I like these because they have pretty much no filler episodes and all come to an end. Hunter x Hunter sets up for future episodes, but the writer has been in poor health for a long time. I would give so much to continue that, has some of the most badass fight scenes, character development, intense analysis of the human condition, and gives me chills just thinking about it. A lot of it reminds me of Yu Yu Hakusho, also a great show. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I had a hard time liking Brotherhood because I was really attached to the original FMA anime. Sorry, but the original series just has way more heart IMHO."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Cowboy Bebop should definitely be on your list to watch.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"It's a really great anime, very rarely do you get an actually complete well planned out anime series + it doesn't drag on either and doesn't use the typical annoying Shounen tropes (friendship power, ridiculous fights etc.) and doesn't have any pandering (no sexualized female characters, harem bs etc.)

I generally don't like most anime either but FMA:B is special "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"""Congratulations! You've beaten me!"""
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"That show had me in tears more times than I care to admit. 

Did you watch it with original voice over or dubbed?
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"One of my go-to shows I watch annually. The masterful storytelling. Gripping characters and moments. 



The show just gets so many things right."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Envy by far best character great voice acting and by far not the character I thought I would get emotional about when he/she died 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Thanks for posting. Will search it out due to your post.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"This show was really hyped for me but I have to say, it got wrapped up a bit too neatly. It just didn't feel right to be honest. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I didn't really grow up liking anime, but FMA:B hooked me after like a couple episodes and I binged it over the course of a month back in college.  I loved it and try to watch anime more often now."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Yes! An absolutely phenomenal series! I'm glad you enjoyed it.

Also, anime isn't a genre, it's a medium. It's comparable to saying I don't like television because the genre doesn't interest me.  Also, I think you'd like My Hero Academia, it's very good"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I considered that anime to have the most perfect plot ever from character development to story. Heck, Edward grew taller and you can see it slowly in each episode."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,I was blown away how philosophical elements were sprinkled throughout the whole series. Can't believe it came from a cartoon. If Hollywood ever makes a live action henry cavill with mustache should be Bradley or Tom Selleck
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"""Mistakes can be made again. But do them better next time."" 

Ed's choice regarding Alphonse, and the brother's choice regarding their mother at the outset is a type of love this world so desperately needs more of. Such beautiful, innocent, defiance in the face of mortality and such devotion and sacrifice. Who would not do anything they were able to save a loved one? Deep deep feels from this story and these characters. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist is one of my favorite mangas/animes. Glad you enjoyed it. There's another FMA anime along with an animated movie and a live action one as well. Also, try out the manga."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"In one of the manga the artist talks about speaking with veterans to get a better idea of how to write the soldiers. One of the people she was asking how it changed him looked down at his hands and said ""I don't watch war movies anymore."" You definitely get a great feel for the characters and insight into their reasons. Could probably make an ethics class using it as a series of examples."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,I remember watching it when it first aired on Adult Swim. Was only in 4th grade at the time and had only known about it because my sister would record episodes of it. Easily in my top 3 for TV shows.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"This series was one of my influences to join the military, one of the best decisions I’ve ever made."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Late but lucky you got to experience it for the first time with no spoilers. You'll be chasing this feeling for the rest of your life
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"One of us, ONE OF US!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"FMA: Brotherhood is my favourite ever show hands down! i wish i could watch it for the first time again, glad you enjoyed it!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,No Ghost In The Shell love in the comments?
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I'm watching my boyfriend watch it and it's amazing. Also, I loooove this adaptation. I would recommend watching the original series (knowing that they caught up to the author's publications and they had to write the rest of the series before she finished formulating it) and then the movie ""Conquerer of Shambala"". I really enjoyed them as a young fan! "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Akame ga kill!!!  Give it a go, you will be hooked.  "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Brotherhood was really amazing, but it left some really dark moments. The ending though... Oh ho the ending. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,I watched both series back to back Brotherhood first and they both have so many legit emotional moments its amazing.  Hughs' daughter asking where her daddy is broke my heart this time watching it as a father gave it a whole different feeling.  Same with the Tucker storyline it is rough watching the two brothers reactions when they find out what he was capacble of.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I'm glad you stumbled upon it. What moment in the show convinced you to keep going? 

It's my wife's favorite story of all time, in any medium. Everything is so well used and the characters are so vivid and robust. Something really cool to watch for: movement.

They use movement so effectively in this show. I was watching it last night and I noticed how they don't give you too much movement at any one time. But they use that little bit of movement really effectively. Until the fight scenes happen. Then they use movement more, but still trying to keep your eye focused on one thing at a time."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,">The Trump russia thing is weirdly parallel to a major plot line in FMAB, I couldn't help but notice

Oh god, he brought politics into it. Can't wait to see what the ""sort by controversial"" comments will be. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Dude get on Hunter x Hunter, same genre and fucking amazing."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Its like the best one ever made. Wish they made more like it. Bunch of other ""good"" ones are just ridiculously gay "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Now you have the key to watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventures.

You'll thank me. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Great anime, in my top with Monster and Black Lagoon
"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"I don't want to sound like I'm forcing anime onto you, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but this is why I love anime. It has the visual appeal of cartoons, but it tells some very deep, intricate, and serious stories with some incredible writing. I hope you can find other anime to intrigue you!"
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"In the middle of watching it right now, on season 4 of brotherhood. I watched the original series awhile ago, and I have to say that brotherhood is much better. While it doesn't explore some of the things that the original does (like the episode where the Elric  bothers interact with the unfair mine), it does go much further than the original if my memory servers me."
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Glad you enjoyed! Just wanted to point out that anime/manga is not a genre, but both are mediums that cover many genres. Just like how comics aren't a genre but a medium. :) "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"You might be enticed to watch the first series Full Metal Alchemist. Don't. Although I really liked how they expanded some back stories, it lacked much of the philosophical aspects of Brotherhood. It's the same story told a different way. "
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Hunter x hunter just as good
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Fma is sooo goooood. Theres a reason it sits at the top of animelist. Its so wonderfully refined 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,Try Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,"Do yourself a favor and at least try Attack on Titan.  It's similar in that the setting is very European-inspired with a fantasy element, but leans a bit more towards monster/horde-horror than action sometimes.  Corruption, spies, government conspiracies, a faceless enemy...  There are so many unexplained mysteries that are still completely unexplored in this story even as Season 3 is starting to air in Japan. But most of the first season is just about survival."

You make me wanna persevere with the Leftovers, I stopped mid-season 1.

Of course The Wire, The Americans, Breaking Bad and SFU are honorable mentions."
Stromberg,Is it weird that I loved Buffy and was bored out of my mind by Firefly?
Stromberg,I always find myself doing a lite-binge watch of Gilmore Girls every few months or so. The more I do it the more I realize how terrible some of the characters are ie. the 2 leads.
Stromberg,"How can a show be ""objectively better"" ? It's all subjective"
Stromberg,"Fringe never got much mainstream popularity but I'm happy to see it on several people's top 5 of all time here, it's def on mine."
Stromberg,I really enjoyed Fargo season 1 with Billy Bob. The remaining seasons were ok but they didn’t hold up imo
Stromberg,How could I forget the Peaky fucking Blinders?! I may have to change my list…
Stromberg,"The Leftovers, Mr Robot and The Americans are the holy trinity post-Breaking Bad imo. Top-tier 2010s shows."
Stromberg,"It’s the most emotionally charged shows I think I’ve ever seen. The story perfectly tugged at our deepest questions about life and the struggle 
between religion and science. The music unmatched as well!"
Stromberg,Married With Children I was maybe a little too young to appreciate but damn I can still remember that intro soundtrack so perfectly
Stromberg,Utopia (UK) is a 10/10 masterpiece. It is by far the best cancelled show I've ever watched. I think it had a huge potential to be critically acclaimed as Breaking Bad-tier if it hasn't been canceled too soon.
Stromberg,Glad I'm not the only one who thinks the shield deserves more love
Stromberg,Atlanta is a fantastic show.
Stromberg,"How the hell is the Simpsons your favorite series?? You haven’t even watched a full season, nor seen any episodes in years?!! Yeaaaaarsss?!!!!


Edit: the only episode you ever mention is the one where Bart fails at school lmao"
Stromberg,"I feel like there's such an emphasis on serialization despite the majority of tv history being episodic, and I do generally prefer serialized shows but there's a lot of pluses to episodic television and honestly I think the good wife is the ultimate lesson in how you can blend really compelling serialized storytelling and punchy episodic stories to make something unique"
Stromberg,"I haven't watched Mad Men yet, but it is on my watchlist.

> You make me wanna persevere with the Leftovers, I stopped mid-season 1.

Most people agree that The Leftovers S2 and S3 are way better than S1. There are many people who didn't enjoy S1 that much, but they loved S2-S3 (example: [read this top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/t8u2ox/the_leftovers_deciding_to_stick_with_it_or_not/hzq4u18)).

All three seasons are VERY different from each other btw. In my opinion, seasons 2 and 3 are two of the greatest seasons ever made."
Stromberg,Yes. :)  But there were also tons of folks who loved *Buffy* and couldn't watch *Angel* and vice versa.
Stromberg,"Most people are terrible. Amy Sherman-Paladino's characters are human. They make mistakes, they are selfish and quirky, but they're lovable. I also appreciate being able to portray women of different age and socioeconomic status truthdully. Having said that, I do find the many, many mistakes they make along the way irritating. And I'm starting to feel more for Emily. That's what getting old must be like."
Stromberg,Couldn't Agree More.
Stromberg,"Top comment! 
Time may prove it, but Succesion and BCS will be considered in the same sphere as them."
Stromberg,"I find it interesting how they're less popular than other show of the era in terms of total viewers, but have very strong fan bases"
Stromberg,"I was too, well boarderline I did enjoy it, but its only after rewatching some a few years ago I realized how much I missed. Bit like when you rewatch the simpsons. That got me thinking of the top 5 cartoons of all time: Metalocalypse, venture bros, sealab 2047, aqua teen hunger force, King of the Hill."
Stromberg,I didn't know the original was so highly acclaimed until I opened this thread. I can't wait to watch it.
Stromberg,"Cmon man, you just can't admit that simpsons is better than southpark"
Stromberg,"Agreed! It's hard to have the patience for episodic storytelling these days but it can be so worth it! TGW def started off very case of the week, but it kept levelling up until it was a masterpiece. I especially loved the eps like Decision Tree and Mind's Eye, where they visualized the characters' thoughts and potential paths. Oh and the score was next level."
Stromberg,"Well, The Wire was not a popular show either (probably even less popular than Mr Robot and The Americans), but it is highly praised as one of the greatest of all time."
Stromberg,I've never seen a single person who thinks the Amazon remake is anywhere near the quality of the original show.
Stromberg,"Pivot lol 

Svar på det jeg sier lol har du sett en eneste sesong?? Lmao"
Stromberg,"I probably could have been clearer. I'm not surprised it's better than the remake, more so that it's listed on quite a few ""Top 5 Shows"" in this thread"
Stromberg,"Er på sesong 7 nå as lol, faller av etter sesong 9 da tydeligvis"
Stromberg,"Nah, you were clear enough in your first comment, I'm just saying that the remake is anywhere near the quality of the original."
Stromberg,Fr har du sett 7 sesonger? Wasteman
Stromberg,Oh gotcha. It's a shame they keep peddling these shitty remakes.
Stromberg,"Bra show mann, you missin out"
Stromberg,"Har sett det lol is some family trash, eller første sesongene er decent"
Stromberg,"Tbf, you need to have quite a high IQ to appreciate and understand the simpsons"
Stromberg,"The Office is a rare example of a foreign show translating well to the US. Many have tried, many have failed."
Stromberg,All countries already have SOAPs. What exactly would doing 90210 in France bring to the table?
Stromberg,cries in skins
Stromberg,"I mean it does happen. House of Cards is another good example of something that was a success until... You know... and there are plenty of game shows which are sold into different markets.

But there are many shows which try to remake the original and fail, to the extent the series *Episodes* is based around it. Fawlty Towers, Red Dwarf, Life on Mars, Cold Feet, Absolutely Fabulous, IT Crowd, Coupling... The Doctor Who movie which was a backdoor pilot for an American version was a car crash.

I don't really know why American networks like to try to remake foreign shows. Just share the original, there's a reason they are liked."
Stromberg,"I think it works best when they just take a couple of the broad elements of the British show as a concept, and then develop it from there as an American show, rather than copy the storylines too much. 

Veep for example was a spiritual successor the British show “the thick of it” but it had to be adapted since the eccentricities of the British government that were mocked were much different from the eccentricities of the American government. There was a pilot for a much closer American copy of the thick of it, but it bombed.

In your house of cards example, they did copy a lot in the first season, and the first American season was very good, however, it left them in a place plot-wise that they were going to have trouble keeping it good in the later seasons. The British series was much shorter (3 seasons of four episodes), so it made sense to rush him into power so they could get to his downfall quicker. But the American show was supposed to go for 6 seasons apparently, so they should’ve left him with more time scheming as a congressman. Also, in the British series, Claire was a smaller character in general, which translated to Claire being a smaller character in the American first season as well. But if the show runners wanted Claire to be equal to frank in terms of prominence in the later seasons, it would have been better for Claire to be equally prominent in the first season as well"
K-On!,"Loved Louis' awkward wave and smile when he's being introduced at the beginning of the show. And ""$600 on the me, me"" feels like a clip from his FX series."
K-On!,That was the longest most boring SNL sketch I have ever seen.
K-On!,"I'm surprised no one posted a link to his charity:

https://www.fistulafoundation.org

You can even play a Jeopardy-like game and help earn money for the charity."

K-On!,They never say comedian in Louies intro.
K-On!,"thank you for this.
"
K-On!,"""But you wanted the song!! haha""

""NO."""
K-On!,You just bought yourself another week.
K-On!,Great how the CNN anchor doesn't know her Supreme Court justices...not like they've been in the news a lot recently...
K-On!,"As they go to the commercial break at 10:00, the other two contests are clapping and chatting to each other, and Louis is just staring straight ahead with his arms crossed.  
  
Perfect."
K-On!,"It's good to know Louie is genuinely informed and knowledgeable. I mean, the fact he does brilliant comedy kind of vouched for the intellect, but not necessarily general knowledge. Not that the questions were massive stumpers or anything, but still.

Louis C.K. for President, I say. Any man who'd say that voting for Trump is like voting for your own cancer gets my vote."
K-On!,They really dumb it down for celebrity jeopardy. I felt pretty smart though for getting so many right
K-On!,These power players games have been a mess and hilarious entertainment. I love them like a bad movie. 
K-On!,"1. Yes they go easy on celebrity guests. The goal is to raise money for charity in the end.

2. Journalists really should know more than this. Although if we ever need coverage of a hot new broadway show, we know where to look.

K-On!,"Would love to see Bill Burr on this, with profanity laced guesses/descriptions of the right answer."
K-On!,"Only Louie C.K. could make me watch a full episode of Jeopardy. 

I don't know how I should feel. "
K-On!,Jeez does Alex Trebek age?
K-On!,"Well, that was fun. And Kate Bolduan is super cute."
K-On!,"That was fun and impressive. After Trebek announced the ""Louis, Louis"" category you can hear Louis, seeing the easy joke getting a big laugh from the audience, mutter ""Yeah""."
K-On!,were these questions easier then the usual? I actually knew the answers to the majority 
K-On!,My wife thought he was making a joke when he said his charity was the Fistula Foundation.
K-On!,Dang just got a lady boner seeing Louis CK all dolled up like that 
K-On!,">The fistula foundation is group of people who help woman in poor countries who have been injured in child birth help get the medical attention they need.


For a second there I thought he was setting up a fisting joke, had to look up that word.

>An abnormal connection between the rectum and the vagina.

K-On!,"OK, I'm voting for Louis C.K. in the primaries now.  Where do I register in CA?"
K-On!,"I'm not familiar with this show..why do they keep saying ""What is"" before their answer? "
K-On!,Who thinks a caiman is a mammal? 
K-On!,So Louis himself has given up on being called Louis?
K-On!,"These are the people that bring you political news folks. Beaten by a comedian with slightly above average intelligence. But I love Louis C.K. for who he is, and I'm glad he won."
K-On!,Louis C.K. pwns noobs
K-On!,"Would have been funnier if he was announced as ""And this Asshole"" Louis C.K."
K-On!,Was it just me or were these answers relatively easy? 
K-On!,"you have commercial breaks every *five* minutes over there?? holy buttfucking christ, how in the name of hell do you put up with that?"
K-On!,"You can totally hear him say ""god damnit"" when he forgets the movie Bullet"
K-On!,"That moustache is epic

Edit: Does he have a white goatee and a red moustache? If so, even more epic. (This is why I should just go to sleep.)"
K-On!,Judging from the thumbnail I think he was on with Dr. Phil. 
K-On!,"I think most people think comedians, especially stand up comedians, are just dumb class clowns. But in actuality if they're any good at their job they're likely very intelligent. You have to be in order to make quality humor that people can associate to and find enjoyment in. I'm glad he did well in Jeopardy."
K-On!,THanks for not spoiling results in title as well
K-On!,"I love how Louis kinda can't take anything seriously.  He's like the typical class clown.  Every time the camera cuts to him, he's wearing the definition of a shit-eating grin."
K-On!,"His quiet ""God damnit"" at 11:22 mark was hilarious."
K-On!,Nerf ball questions. 
K-On!,Damn if i knew it was in DC i would have tried to go. Does anyone know if they do tapings in other places?
K-On!,[deleted]
K-On!,OMG he's wearing a suit!
K-On!,"I can't believe none of them knew ""the first casualty of war is truth"".

I'd have like 400 points at that point but at least I would've gotten that one."
K-On!,Those were the easiest Jeopardy questions ever
K-On!,He actually won haha
K-On!,Kate's final jeopardy guess was shockingly bad for someone in her position.
K-On!,"This really does illustrate that Anchor ""journalists"" don't do much other than regurgitate what they have been told to read.  
""What is Dilute!? Ill take I don't pay attention for 4,000!"""
K-On!,"The funniest thing of the whole show is how ""Kate Bolduan"" goes from chatty and playful, when she is leading and doing well, to being cross-armed and pouting by the end, when she is in last. 

Also was anyone amazed about how many *basic* current event questions the news anchors whiffed on? That dude got Chile and Argentina mixed up. "
K-On!,"Appropriate post:

"
K-On!,Is it just me or is celebrity jeopardy easier than normal jeopardy? I knew a lot of these and normally I know very little (almost Jon Snow levels) on jeopardy.
K-On!,Thats the cleanest I have ever seen Louis.  
K-On!,"Damn, Kate Boluand is fine. "
K-On!,"Why are people surprised by Louis CKs intelligence in the comments? Have you guys seen his show Louie or Horace and Pete? Both of those shows prove that he's a brilliant writer, director and auteur. Honestly, he's one of the smartest artists of his generation. Even his comedy act, which can be crass and raunchy, is filled with intriguing insight and unique perspectives that showcase an intelligence far beyond average. I'm not surprised at all that he was the smartest person that night on jeopardy."
K-On!,"Somehow I knew he was going to own that shit.
"
K-On!,I've never seen Jeopardy but are the questions normally this easy or do they dumb them down for the celebrity editions?
K-On!,Anyone else wondering why they had two reports/journalists/political commentators and then Louis C.K.? A bit of an odd choice putting those type of celebrities on there. 
K-On!,Wow he crushed it. That was awesome.
K-On!,I think I can say confidently that everyone on this thread was rooting for Louie.
K-On!,how long is this show usually with commercials?
K-On!,I instinctively tried to fast forward past the commercials and skipped some of it 
K-On!,Thanks for this! Just looked everywhere for it and gave up to visit reddit and bam!
K-On!,"Wow he did really well, good job Louie!"
K-On!,I was there!
K-On!,This feels like a Louis episode.
K-On!,Perfect bud 💯 
K-On!,"As a first time viewer of this show, why do they have to say ""what is"" or ""who is"" before giving the answer? It's weird. "
K-On!,Oh Alex...I'm NEVER in for a bad time with you...
K-On!,"Funny, smart and a bloody lovely man."
K-On!,Holy shit what a weird thing this is.
K-On!,"Off topic, but Norm McDonald  made it all the way to the million dollar question on celebrity Who Wants to be a Millionaire."
K-On!,"Newscaster is not the first thing that comes to mind when I hear someone say ""genius,"" no."
K-On!,Louie is the fucken man!!
K-On!,Weird seeing Louie in a suit
K-On!,"Am I the only one who thinks that Constituion hall looks like the house from fresh prince of bel air?
"
K-On!,"Pretty sure they make these special celebrity jeopardies a lot easier. As someone who watches a lot of jeopardy, These questions weren't very hard."
K-On!,Huh. He wasn't so hot in [Black Jeopardy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWuJHbVZBQg)
K-On!,Is it me or did they spell his name wrong???
K-On!,"Wait, seriously? Or is this a coordinated trick?"
K-On!,So much witty banter. So little hardcore trivia.
K-On!,I love Louis' double jeopardy guess. Like he just pulled it out of his Nixon hating ass.
K-On!,two very well educated people get beat by a guy who barely graduated from high school....  love it...
K-On!,"I have no idea who the guy is, but it was entertaining."
K-On!,I like how they introduce him as everything *but* a comedian...
K-On!,"*Jeopardy!*'s like politics: the ""joke"" player always does surprisingly well."
K-On!,"wow I knew the answer to almost every question they sure tried to make it easy for these people
The same thing used to always happen on celebrity who wants to be a millionaire"
K-On!,The two journalist people or what ever they are didn't know the first casuality of war is the truth shows so much about our country.
K-On!,I don't know Louis C.K. but I love him.

Hellsing,The new Attack on Titan episode is absolutely amazing. The first 15 minutes of the episode is some of the best tv I have seen in a bit.
Hellsing,"Three seasons into “The Expanse”, and the scale of the show is just incredible. Haven’t been this hooked in a show in a very long time."
Hellsing,"I’m rewatching Winning Time right now and it is incredible, there is no other show like it. Its definitely my favourite series from last year and that includes shows like Severance and HoTD. 

Anyone know when season 2 is supposed to release?"
Hellsing,I’m so glad Party Down is back for a third season. They’re knocking it out of the park so far.
Hellsing,"""Shrinking"" on AppleTV+ is phenomenal. Burned through all available episodes in one sitting."
Hellsing,"Re-watched Breaking Bad after 10 years and I appreciate it so much more this time around. Helps that I had forgotten a lot of details, apart from a few major ones.

Brilliant fucking show! The acting, the writing, the increase in overall quality as the it went on. Easily my favourite for now.

Btw, I too was on the Skyler hate train back then, probably because I was a teenager who didn't know better. However, I totally understand most of her frustrations and reactions now. She was the one who was actually trying to protect the family. The Walt that was doing it for the family died long ago. Drowned by Heisenberg. 

Wondering if I should start Better Call Saul immediately or give myself some time. Have never watched it."
Hellsing,"Deadwood Season 1 is really as great as everyone says it is, half way through."
Hellsing,"Just finished Rome. It genuinely had the potential to be one of the popular greats, if only it was given at least one more season. As it stands, it’s still amazing, and I didn’t find the second season to be that offensively rushed.

Before Rome, I watched Deadwood, which was also amazing, but got cut early too, and didn’t even try to wrap things up, minus the movie which was pretty good, albeit unnecessary.

I think I should finish the cancelled HBO trifecta and start Carnivále soon."
Hellsing,"Finished the first season of Severance thanks to a recommendation from here. I can't wait for the second season, what a great show."
Hellsing,"I watched all of **Barry**.

Not as funny as I expected it to be, more of a smile and chuckle show than a laugh out loud one, but still very good.

The characters are almost all interesting complex people, the action is surprisingly badass and the plot goes to some legit dark places I didn't expect. 

An easy entertaining watch."
Hellsing,5 seasons into **Bosch**. Goddamn I love this show
Hellsing,"**Mayfair Witches** – I didn't realize it was only 8 eps, but I guess I'm done with S1. I love ""witches"" as a genre, but I was disappointed by this, I think mainly because I did not find the main character likable.

**Extraordinary** – On ep 5 and realllly liking this. It's genuinely funny and such a light, breezy watch.

**Poker Face** – I was mild on this series, but the most recent episodes have really elevated it. Excited for the finale this week."
Hellsing,"Legion- season 1 - not sure why I haven’t heard of this one before. I usually absolutely hate superhero stuff but this was fantastic! so artistic and well done. Did not feel like a marvel thing at all, very cerebral. A bit of mind trip. Its like a mix between maniac and inception feel. Also Aubrey du plaza is awesome in everything.

Up next - Black Sails as I’ve heard good things here"
Hellsing,Started watching Daisy jones and the six on amazon prime. I didn't like the book but the TV show is entertaining so far
Hellsing,Watching Pachinko atm and it's pretty good so far (finished 2 eps out of 8 in this season so far).
Hellsing,"I loved The Expanse, and am sad that it's over. Anything else like it out there?"
Hellsing,I watched the first episode of *Cunk on Earth* and it is absolutely my kind of show. I can’t wait to watch the rest!
Hellsing,Finished all 6 seasons of Line of Duty and I am so sad it is over. The show just does what it does so well and it captivated me every episode and I only want more of it. I hope they do another season or some special episodes because I dont think its completely wrapped up yet
Hellsing,Titus Welliver as **Bosch** doesn't get nearly enough praise in my opinion!
Hellsing,"Perry Mason! somehow way more gritty than season one, can't wait."
Hellsing,Besides all the currently airing shows....started the West Wing for the first time last week or so.  Just finished season 2 last night.  Super good so far.
Hellsing,"**Star trek Picard** is almost really really good, still not completely sold on a ten hours star trek movie but for now it's good, and ffs can the camera stop shaking and can we have a little bit more of illumination?"
Hellsing,"I feel like my entire comment history the last two weeks has been about **Party Down**, but I’m so thankful to have it back on my screen again and I honestly think this ranks amongst the best comedy revivals I’ve seen (so far)."
Hellsing,"I had never heard of ***Party Down***. After looking it up on IMDB, seemed to be something light and funny. The cast seemed great.

Anyway, I started watching it last night and I've just been binging it. It's really funny."
Hellsing,Halfway thru S1 of Big Little Lies. Reese Witherspoon plays the ultimate bitch and I'm living for it.
Hellsing,"I really admire The Connors for sticking to its ongoing dedication to outlining how hard it is to be working class in this country and recently - how one unforeseen crisis could threaten to undo aall the progress they have made.

Its not as funny as Roseanne at its peak but its funny enough and it seems like John Goodman has perked up a bit recently and having fun playing Dan again."
Hellsing,"i think i found the problem with Hello, Tomorrow! it’s that it’s just really fucking boring and nothing happens"
Hellsing,Finally started Mr. Robot. I tried it when it came out and never gave it a fair enough chance. Maybe I’m just in a better headspace now who knows… but I fucking love it (only 4 episodes in but 100% hooked).
Hellsing,"**Outer Banks** is fucking absurd. Ridiculous. Every other scene you're throwing your hands up like WHO WROTE/EDITED/APPROVED THIS? Even the basic continuity of one scene to another is often botched (the train robbery is a good example). But it's a lot of fun imo. First couple of episodes this season were borderline unwatchable but it picked up. Fun show, recommend if you can deal with how stupid it is. Binged most of it in a night so that's more than I can say for most shows these days."
Hellsing,"Back to back Star Wars paid off this week, with both the new episodes of *The Mandalorian*  and *The Bad Batch* being great.

Mando was good all around. I was surprised they got to that part of the story introduced last week, as I thought it was going to be a big buildup to Mando's quest. Spoilery thoughts on the episode. >!Bo-Katan was great in this, and had some fantastic character development. It looked like they were setting her up to be an antagonist to Mando because he has the Darksaber, and even comments that she is going to finish this when she thought he was coming back to see her. Upon seeing Grogu, dropped everything to rescue him immediately. She showed that she knew how to wield the Darksaber properly, and was an all around badass the entire episode. When giving the tour with Mando, she was at first mocking the old ways, but still was helping him because all she wanted was to bring Mandalorian people back together and help them when in need. The arrival of the motherfucking Mythosaur was awesome. If there is one thing that can truly unite their people, it is that.!< Other than that, Grogu is cute as hell.

But not the be outdone was another high quality episode of *The Bad Batch*. This episode touched on a lot of what they have been seeding into the series as of late, what would it take to make a clone turn on the empire, even with their inhibitor chips. Looking forward to what they bring to the remaining episodes."
Hellsing,"I finished the first season of Breaking Bad for the first time today and I have to say I wasn’t expecting it to be this funny, I’m having the time of my life. Such a well done show."
Hellsing,"**Daisy Jones & The Six** - I watched the first 3 episodes Friday night and loved it. I picked up the book this weekend and I'm already halfway through that. I usually avoid reading source material in close proximity to release of an adaptation because I like keeping these things separate in my mind as a viewer. But I was so drawn into the show, I just had to see how the story plays out from here.

**Poker Face** - The latest episode featuring Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a banger.

**Farscape** - Rewatching this for the first time since it aired. I finished season 1, just started season 2. But I'm only subscribed to Peacock for Poker Face, and as soon as that's done, I'll be canceling. The re-watch will be paused until Peacock draws me back with something else."
Hellsing,Upright - Finished season 1 in one sitting. This show is freaking awesome. A recommendation from here. Thank you.
Hellsing,"Watched Attack on Titan 's Special episode and it was one of the greatest hours of TV. I mean, first 10-15 minutes are imo best representation of apocalypse and it's absolutely haunting nature. This episode was so far the best of the year and just waiting for second half for this beautiful series to end with absolute bangg."
Hellsing,"Im watching Wednesday right now and its about to end, im really enjoying it. Is there any similar shows?"
Hellsing,"Daisy Jones and the Six is pretty good. If you like Almost Famous, this show has similar vibes."
Hellsing,Eight episodes into **Andor** and I’m loving how dark and mature it is compared to the other Disney+ shows.
Hellsing,I need something with great writing. Unexpected twists and suspense that keep me hooked. Been hearing a lot about Mad Men. Would I like it?
Hellsing,Rewatching Red Oaks on Prime. Still the best prime original show.
Hellsing,"**Star Trek Picard** I expect every week to be disappointed but instead this third season is fucking great and every new episode is better than the previous. I stopped care about the franchise after Discovery and the start of Picard but I must admit... they are doing great now, they really changed direction and Picard, Strange new worlds and Lower desks are fantastic. Let's hope they close the discovery fiasco with dignity.

My only problem with this show is that is one of the darkest thing I've ever seen, I really tried everything but I have to wait for after the sunset to see anything."
Hellsing,Not as excited for The Mandalorian as I thought I was going to be. The short episodes are a drag and it's just not speaking to me like the earlier seasons did.
Hellsing,"Just started Last of us and it’s amazing. As a fan of the game, this is a very faithful adaption. Loving Pedro as Joel and the show looks absolutely stunning"
Hellsing,Just started watching The Leftovers. On episode 2.
Hellsing,Has a show ever improved as much between seasons as Picard has from season 2 to 3?  It’s like someone behind the scenes stepped in and said “This isn’t working.  Throw everything out and just make a fifth TNG movie.”
Hellsing,**History of the World Part 2** - Hulu.. been waiting on this. Loaded to the gills with the best comedians of our time.  Not seen the first one...is it good?
Hellsing,**The Responder** - how is this so slept on??? I'd think a show starring Martin Freeman would have more people talking about it. Really enjoyable and addicting.
Hellsing,"After hearing so many good things I finally got around to watching **The White Lotus**. I watched the first season over a week and then binged the second season pretty hard. I had to sit on it for a few days to collect my thoughts because the show is a roller coaster of emotions. I feel like ""dark comedy"" is the best description for it. Truthfully, this type of show usually doesn't align with my tastes and there was a bit too much second-hand embarrassment/awkwardness for me at times (especially in the second season), but despite all of that I still really liked it.

It didn't really suck me until I was a few episodes deep and then season one was pretty consistent from there. All of the storylines for the different characters are so interesting and the acting is just amazing across the board. Even though the series as a whole is so... gloomy, nihilistic kinda?, there are at least some hopeful and dare I say happy moments in the first season. Season two made me feel mostly uncomfortable and at best the characters ended up in a ""good"" place, but only after navigating a huge shit storm to get there.

Alexandra Daddario was a standout for sure, and Murray Bartlett was endlessly entertaining. I actually found Sydney Sweeney's character really intriguing and when >!she had to leave the room to break down and cry after being mostly emotionless for the first five episodes!< it actually caught me off guard and hit me pretty hard. As long as the writing remains consistent and they keep casting competent actors then this show seems to have limitless potential to keep going."
Hellsing,I know Jack Ryan isn’t plausible and feasible and that the story line isn’t amazing however it is such a good show to watch when you just want to suspend all beliefs.
Hellsing,I finished Station Eleven last week and can't stop thinking about it. It's an incredibly well made show. So layered.
Hellsing,"The Americans. One of my top 5 favorite shows. Actually it's my second watch.

Nurse Jackie. It doesn't get a lot attention but I love it. Edie Falco from The Sopranos is great.

Came here looking for my next watch."
Hellsing,"**Daisy Jones and the Six** \- The book was outstanding and I recommend it too: it is something you can't put down. The show is perfectly cast exactly as I pictured these characters. It came out on Amazon Prime today. I'm hooked after one episode. There are going to be tears.

That and, **The Last Of Us,** but that needs no mention. Last week's ""Left Behind"" episode is going to be the one that I'll remember years from now."
Hellsing,"**Shrinking**. 

I love it. It’s about a shrink whose gone through some trauma and he switches up his techniques for helping people. 

I cannot get over Harrison Ford being in this show. Every scene with Harrison Ford makes me say “That’s Harrison Ford”"
Hellsing,"Poker Face keeps getting better and better. Just when you think it's falling into a formula, it flips you upside down and slaps you in the face. I wish Peacock was worth subscribing for otherwise. If you're lucky and your family has an account like mine, *please* watch this show. It is fantastic."
Hellsing,"Loved Derry Girls.  Every episode is a single distinct story so they never really follow up on most of the story threads.  The situations were over the top in a fun way and the reactionary expressions of the cast was perfect.  I also loved the 90s music.
The last few episodes were more emotional with stories of love, death, and the Good Friday Agreement."
Hellsing,"Alright, you guys were right about Dark. Watched the first 5 episodes in a row, it hooked me so fast"
Hellsing,"Daisy Jones & the Six! So far, so good, looking forward to listening to Aurora when I have time."
Hellsing,Party Down episode 2 was so good. It's all great but the female cast are blowing it out of the water. Funniest thing on telly rn
Hellsing,"I'm into classic TV shows of the last decade lately, so I started watching Lost (kinda late, I know) and I love it so far."
Hellsing,Just finished the first part of Ozark season 4. Fantastic stuff!
Hellsing,Watching the Mandalorian. Decided to watch it as a standalone because I do not know anything about the Star Wars timeline or various stories except certain characters names. Favreau is very talented.
Hellsing,"Animal Kingdom 

Re-watching for the first time since the series ended last year. Highly recommend if you are looking for a fast-paced, fantastical crime epic with just enough drama to keep it grounded."
Hellsing,Latest episode of Picard was incredibly good. I don’t know what they changed behind the scenes this season but it’s a remarkable turnaround.
Hellsing,"**Party Down** is back and it hasn't missed a beat.

Few shows can get as much actual laughter out of me as this one can."
Hellsing,Rupert Grint is amazing in **Servant**.
Hellsing,"I got bored with southpark when the whole tegridy farms started, but they've been nailing it in the last & newest season so far."
Hellsing,"Mando Season 3
Party Down
Severance 
Suits
Last of Us"
Hellsing,"Going through Drive to Survive S5. That team principal meeting was gold.

Also, Zak Brown with a light-ish beard reminds me of depressed Hank Schrader."
Hellsing,What episodes of boba fett do I need to watch before s3 of mando?
Hellsing,Just started That Dirty Black Bag on AMC. It's....interesting
Hellsing,Thanks to everyone who recommended I watch Boba Fett eps 5/6/7. I’ve watched 5 & 6 so far and it’s shocking how they literally are Mandalorian episodes. Incredible to have a titular character completely absent like this.
Hellsing,"I just finished happy valley s2 and I understand the praise it has gotten. Solid British crime show. I am so glad I never watched it before and now binge a really good show.

On to S3 now."
Hellsing,"After watching season 5 Episode 12 of the Sopranos, I need every single character to go to prison because I have no sympathy left for anyone except the children (even though AJ has also continuously gotten worse). 

At this point the only people Im actually rooting for are Meadow and Melfi."
Hellsing,"**Eureka** - there's something about this show that I find appealing. It's cheesy, trying to make sense of the science is a fools errand... But I just enjoy it. 

**Extraordinary** - great little flick, didn't expect much going in but came away eagerly looking forward to another series!

And then, as many others here.. The Last of Us.
I also want to get back to Handmaid's Tale, now the new season has wrapped up - but as of right now I can't be dealing with slow walking montages. 

I am really craving something new that I haven't seen. I crave something that I enjoy / get invested in as much as I did with Mr Robot, The Expanse and 12 Monkeys."
Hellsing,"Almost finished watching the Following. This show is filled to the brim with people getting stabbed in the stomach. Nine times out of ten it's an instant kill, except, of course, when it's a main character. Lazy writing, mindless serial killer fun."
Hellsing,"Chapelwait ( Epix/MGM) 2021 - horror series, mystery, based on a Stephen King book. Quite interesting."
Hellsing,Episode 9 of Poker Face is really good!
Hellsing,Is Homecoming with Julia Roberts on Prime any good?
Hellsing,"I’m absolutely thriving in TV world right now

Currently watching
- **Poker Face**
- **The Last of Us**
- **Abbott Elementary**
- **Survivor 44**

Poker Face, The Last of Us, and Abbott all fantastic as usual. Survivor 44 I think has potential to be a fun train wreck. 

Just finished
- **Yellowjackets season 1** rewatch

Such a great show, and even better on a rewatch. Can’t wait for season 2.

Coming up soon
- **Yellowjackets season 2**
- **Ted Lasso season 3**

Also think **Extrapolations**, **Love and Death**, and **Daisy Jones and the Six** have potential to be good too. And obviously **Succession season 4** coming up. Still haven’t watched any of it yet, but literally everyone I know who’s watched it says the show’s a fucking masterpiece. So I’m very excited to have four seasons to watch!"
Hellsing,"Thoroughly enjoying **Cyberpunk: Edgerunners**

Looking for all recommendations similar to this 🤝"
Hellsing,"I am loving network TV right now.

**So Help Me Todd**

 **Fire Country**

 **East NY**

 **The Neighborhood**,

**Animal Control**

 **Abbott**

**The Rookie**

 **The Accused**

**Ghosts**

**Not Dead Yet**,

**Young Rock**

**American Auto**

(Tell me you are a boomer without telling me you are a boomer.  Well, the joke's on you.  I am a Gen Xer.)"
Hellsing,"As a whole, **Reservation Dogs** exceeded expectations. Great characters and I love the magical realism. The season 2 finale was so good. 

First episode of the new **Mando** season was almost shockingly bad. Hope it gets better from there. 

As a big fan of the game, the David episode of **The Last of Us** was one of the best episodes of anything I’ve ever watched. They really nailed my favorite part of the game. I’m really looking forward to the finale, but don’t want it to end. 

Trying to watch **Stargate SG1,** but about halfway through S01 it’s slow going. I’m not sure it’s grabbing me enough to continue. 

On a suggestion, I think I may give the **Taken** miniseries by Spielberg a shot soon."
Hellsing,"S4 of Better Caul Saul

Picard S3 - highly recommend.  This is so improved over last season and great callbacks to prior shows.  Something happens in the third episode which made me very excited that at long last we will get a followup to >!Deep Space Nine.    The big bad of the season is changelings and the Dominion War is referenced.   Thr actor who played Odo is passed away but his character nonetheless got a mention by Worf.!< 

South Park

The Last of Us - could do with a little more action but otherwise I'm so happy with this adaptation of one of my favorite games."
Hellsing,"Finished Paul T Goldman a few days ago and loved it. Such an original show! It is a documentary that include dramatizations with the subject of the documentary starring. Made me laugh out loud hard every episode, which--while I watch plenty of comedies that I find funny-- doesn't happen with a ton shows.  


It's definitely odd and I think if you don't like it after a couple episodes then you won't like the show as a whole. Though I will say that Paul's story does get reframed in last episode (which is hinted at and everyone should be able to see coming anyways)."
Hellsing,"**Last of Us** Not much to say that hasn't already been said, happy to be past the DLC episode.


**Party Down** So happy it's back. Really good so far but really wish Caplan could've been involved.


**Cracker** Great old British crime drama starring Robbie Coltrane. Waited way too long to watch this.


**Vera** Comfort TV for me at it's finest.


**The Capture** Really enjoying season 2 even though the deep fakes are hard to wrap my head around sometimes and keep up with what's actually real."
Hellsing,"Things I've enjoyed lately I don't see on here all the time:  


The Consultant. This show is riveting and pretty funny in some places. It kept me guessing. A dark comment on the world of business. 8 eps.   


Mayfair Witches. I guess the season has concluded at 8 episodes? For fans of Interview with the Vampire series. It hasn't gotten a lot of traction and maybe I'm biased because I read the series as a kid, but I enjoyed it overall.   


Welcome to Chippendales. This was so entertaining, and the arc of especially Kumail Nanjiani's character is just... This show is a knockout. It starts funny and gets real dark and it's so well put together and acted. Really good.  


Looking forward to: Mayor of Kingstown. I'll check this out once the season has concluded."
Hellsing,"For some good Canadian content, I suggest PRETTY HARD CASES. Cop show with humour along with quasi-serious topics. 

First episode of the new series PLAN B was good IMHO. Time travel involved and the main character isn't a terrible human."
Hellsing,"Breaking Bad Season 4 Episode 6. >!Just completed the ""I am the danger"" scene!<.  Can't wait to complete this and start BCS

Halt and Catch Fire. Got to know about this show through this sub. Watched the first ten minutes. I did not know that Mackenzie Davis was in this. Looking forward to continuing it.

Arrested Development. Heard a lot about it in this community. Watched the first episode. It was alright.

Looking forward to watching:-

The Last of Us once it's done

The Wire"
Hellsing,"I finished Mouse which started off strong, got messy in the middle but loved how it ended."
Hellsing,Watching Arressted Development season 5 before it leaves Netflix. I don't know of a show that took a bigger nosedive. It's just so unfunny and worst of all boring. It's a shame because i'm of the opinion it's one of the greatest comedy series of all time.
Hellsing,Poker face and shrinking are at the end of their seasons but both just keep getting better. I did not expect it. Delightful surprise.
Hellsing,I feel like the first two episodes of mando could have fit in 1/2 of one episode. So many scenes to progress so little in the story.
Hellsing,"**From** - On MGM+, formerly Epix.

Has anybody watched this show? Obviously nobody has MGM+ so I did a 7 day trial and we binged this show instantly. It is a really good, horror/suspense/sci-fi show. I hope more people get into it, second season starts in April. 

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDHqAj4eJcM)"
Hellsing,The last episode of The Last of Us was absolutely brutal. Holy shit balls.
Hellsing,"I just finished one of the best miniseries I've ever watched: **Anne (2022)**.

It is probably on my top 5 best miniseries of all time, maybe even top 3 alongside Band of Brothers and Chernobyl.

It is a British miniseries about Anne Williams, mother of one of the victims of [Hillsborough disaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster), a tragedy where more than 90 people died during a football match in 1989.

Maxine Peake as Anne Williams is one of the most emotionally powerful performances I've ever seen. And the show is way more heartbreaking and devastating than I thought it would be. I cried every episode.

This show deserves more recognition. Top-tier acting and writing."
Hellsing,**Daisy Jones and the Six** you guys
Hellsing,"Watched

* **Witcher: Blood Origin** \- Okay, >!enjoyed seeing Jaskier!!<
* **Military Prosecutor Doberman (Kdrama)** \- Started off interesting and progressively not great writing sadly
* **A Dream of Splendor (Cdrama)** \- Great! Didn't see a lot of hype around this. Writing stayed consistent and fun characters. Historical dramas are fun!
* **Mob Psycho III (Anime)** \- Loved! Will miss this show!
* **Physical 100** \- Fun Korean reality fitness competition show!

Currently Watching

* **Spy x Family Part 2 (Anime)**

To Watch

* **Lockwood & Co**
* **The Last of Us**"
Hellsing,"Thoughts on Daisy Jones and the six? 



Finally catching up to the last seasons of hunters and Jack Ryan."
Hellsing,"Two episodes left of the last season of Servant. 
How sure are you they're gonna answer all the questions? 
I really want it to be good, but me heart doubt it."
Hellsing,What am I supposed to watch as my comfort show now that **Arrested Development** is coming off of netflix?
Heartland,It's basically a murder she wrote for the new gen with added bonus - she has a superpower.
Heartland,"I started watching Murder She Wrote as a result of watching Poker Face, and I love it! So clever and cozy - like putting on a warm blanket."
Heartland,"Natasha Lyonne really makes the show.  She is practically doing an imitation of Columbo.  

There are a few big differences between the two shows, that makes me think the writers for *Columbo* were much better.  

Charlie is not a detective, so it's almost mystical that she arrives somewhere, and instantly gets involved in a murder that wouldn't have been investigated if she hadn't intervened.

So far, the audience knows who the murderer is early in the episode.  With *Columbo*, the audience wouldn't know until the big reveal.

So far, Charlie naively puts herself in grave danger at the big reveal.  Columbo always had all the angles figured out.

I hate to say it, but this is a case where a gender-swapped remake would be entirely justified.  Natasha Lyonne, as Columbo, could recreate the original episodes with updated dialogue.  That would be a phenomenal TV show."
Heartland,Poker Face has a chance to become a classic if they play their cards right
Heartland,Watch Columbo NOW
Heartland,">Piker Face

D'ye leke dags?"
Heartland,"With Columbo, we did see how it was done in the beginning. We just watched him unravel it on his own."
Heartland,"Most Columbo episodes start with a guy comitting murder though, how many episodes did you watch and how long ago was it?"
Heartland,"With only 3 channels back then, I watched a bunch of episodes.  I only watched them when the episodes originally aired, so maybe I've got it wrong.

I wasn't a big fan of Columbo, because he was rumbled and boring. Rockford Files and Banacek were much more engaging."
Heartland,It's not uncommon for 20 year old to have kids.
Heartland,You are overthinking this….
Heartland,"i came across this show once, it looks like the most museum like ""ranch"", even their clothes are super clean , not like people who live on a working ranch"
Heartland,"The grandfather character is 49 or the actor is 49? If it's the latter, actors play characters who have a different age all the time. Actors in high school shows can be close to 30.  In the movie Cocoon, Wilfred Brimley played a senior citizen at 49 and was 26 years younger than the other actors also playing elderly characters."
Heartland,"Grandparents is 49
Mom was 46
Grandpa was a father at 3"
Heartland,"Okay, so people have been screwing with the descriptions of the list of episodes on Wikipedia. The episode titles may not be the same, but they are within one or two episodes."
Heartland,">The Woman In The House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window 

that's a damn long title"
Heartland,Interesting! I imagine Resident Evil must be on the chopping block for sure.
Heartland,still pissed they cancelled archive 81
Heartland,Where is Arcane on this list? Or did you start on the new year
Heartland,Where's Heartstopper? That seemed to be much more popular than many of these shows and was defnintely in the top 10 for weeks
Heartland,I mean I wouldnt have minded seeing the worldwide numbers
Heartland,"It's a parody show, so the title is intentionally very long. I loved it and found it hilarious"
Heartland,It's doing ok but if it has a high budget maybe that's not enough.
Heartland,As dumb as it was it was fun and I made my way through all of it. Prob one of the few people hoping for a S02. Def not holding my breath for it though lol
Heartland,"I started the week after Arcane's last appearance on the list, but it would only have 2 points"
Heartland,Nobody cares about cartoons
Heartland,It did better worldwide than in the US
Heartland,"That’s a shame, it’s a really good show"
Heartland,"pretty much. She does leave the show, ( I don't remember exactly which season ). And she comes back briefly in season 10 I believe. Just stick with the show, It's worth the effort of putting up with her character. "
Heartland,"I've only watched 4 seasons on Netflix, she didn't get much better. I actually prefered her as a kid rather than a teenager..."
Heartland,"What a stupid article. This show was pitched, approved, shot and edited before the election was decided.

Want to write this article and have it be something more than Hollywood industry navel gazing about how important they are in this political landscape, *prove* that **more** people are watching *because* Trump won. "
Heartland,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Heartland,Hooch is crazy

Heartland,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Heartland,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Heartland,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Heartland,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Heartland,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Heartland,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Heartland,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Heartland,that's a lot of content
Heartland,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Heartland,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Heartland,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Heartland,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Heartland,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Heartland,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Heartland,[deleted]
Heartland,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Heartland,Any specific dates to go with this?
Heartland,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Heartland,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Heartland,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Heartland,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Heartland,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Heartland,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Heartland,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Heartland,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Heartland,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Heartland,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Heartland,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Heartland,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Heartland,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Heartland,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Heartland,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Heartland,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Heartland,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Heartland,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Heartland,[deleted]
Heartland,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Heartland,*holds up lighter*
Heartland,Thanks man you're awesome
Heartland,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Heartland,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Heartland,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Heartland,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Heartland,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Heartland,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Heartland,It’s pretty genius
Heartland,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Heartland,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Heartland,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Heartland,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Heartland,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Heartland,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Heartland,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Heartland,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Heartland,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Heartland,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Heartland,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Heartland,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Heartland,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Heartland,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Heartland,That’s pathetic
Heartland,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Heartland,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Heartland,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Heartland,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Heartland,[deleted]
Trigun,"The original is one of my favorites, so I’ll give this new series a fair shot. But I’ll be honest…the trailer from a bunch of months ago didn’t give me much confidence. It didn’t seem like this show will be what I want from a Trigun reboot. 

I always enjoyed the dub of the original though, so it’ll be nice to hear that same old Vash again."
Trigun,"Man, so far people here are hating on the Madhouse adaption and also the new Orange adaption.  Feel the odd one out since I really enjoyed both."
Trigun,"Call me old, but I don’t understand how anyone can think this animation looks good. It’s so clean and sterile. For comparison, has anyone seen that new dbz legends thing? That is a fucking orgasm for your eyes. I’m sure it’s much more labor intensive but goddamn, I couldn’t get enough of it. This new cgi anime is just so boring to me, idk"
Trigun,What did they do to my boi!?
Trigun,They really jacked up Vash's haircut.
Trigun,The art is terrible
Trigun,Stop trying to make cg anime happen. Its not going to happen
Trigun,Zoomie badly rendered Vash does not inspire confidence in me.
Trigun,Sprinkles on a turd.
Trigun,"The original Trigun was the most disappointing anime I've ever watched. Vash was just, meh. Story was just, meh."
Trigun,Went in with the same attitude. First episode was not very good.
Trigun,I thought it would be trash but really enjoyed it. Although the Pixar animation is an adjustment
Trigun,It looks like it's trying to do it's best to make the Berserk remake look like a masterpiece.
Trigun,"*record scratch*

People are hating on Madhouse' Trigun? Where are these blind and deaf people?"
Trigun,"Nah I agree. While the quality of 3D anime is improving, it's still miles behind actual 2D hand drawn anime. There's a level of freedom that drawn animation gives you that 3D never will."
Trigun,"I mean it's already happening everywhere. It's still not great, but to say it's not happening is just wrong."
Trigun,"It is possible to make good CGI anime. Houseki No Kuni is incredible and its cgi. Granted i can thank of absolutely 0 more examples, but at least one really good one does exist so it can happen."
Trigun,Your opinion is invalid
Trigun,Crazibouncer also wears jorts
Trigun,"I feel like it wasn't really bad either though. Kinda just *OK*. It's pretty different from the original in a lot of ways. Who knows, could end up being good by the end of it."
Trigun,Cinematography was good but I felt like 80% of the changes were pointless. But that's based on one episode...
Trigun,Nah the animation on this is leaps better than berserk 2016.
Trigun,Knights of sidonia (imo at least).
Trigun,"They handled it pretty well with Dorohedoro (damn it, season 2 when?)"
Trigun,Same studio btw.
Trigun,"I mean I guess it's cheating because it's so abstract, but I really liked the 3D use in that first Evangelion rebuild for [Ramiel](https://youtu.be/GCe-D6sTLoc?t=127), combined with the sounds it made. Don't normally like it though - I think they hand drew the Evas in the first movie (even if they weren't it was far subtler), then progressed to CGI by the final film which I wasn't crazy about."
Trigun,You fundamentally do not understand the nature of opinions.
Trigun,"I don't think I liked how much they revealed about Vash already. The mystery around him, Knives, and Rem was really intriguing in the original."
Trigun,"From an animation standpoint it looks good. The movement and facial expressions conveyed a lot of character that made it enjoyable to watch.

...Unfortunately after one episode that's where my praise ends. I'm okay with a re-imagining of Trigun, we don't need to do the first anime over again, but the show didn't need to tip it's hand on almost every in the very first episode. It did just way too much telling and far too little showing. 

Hell the new character replacing Milly is one I already can't stand, 1) because he's replacing a beloved character and 2) because he seems to be ""Exposition"" the character. Instead of letting both the audience and Meryl discover things from the problems to the town, the situation of the world, and who Vash is, he just says it. He too knowledgeable and jaded to be interesting.

I know it's only one episode and the story can go in a million different directions to redeem itself, but this first episode really dampened a lot of my hopes."
Trigun,That show came out of left field for me and was such a breath of fresh air.
Trigun,But what if that's their opinion on opinions? Are you saying that their opinion is invalid?
Trigun,Yo I heard this dude hates dogs and rainbows.
Trigun,No u
Trigun,"Don't listen to Crazibouncer, he doesn't wash his feet"
Trigun,Animation good. Art style - doesn’t feel quite right and not in a way I imagine the director intended.
Trigun,"I miss his old hair, *sigh… it was an iconic silhouette which is character design 101, now he’s so modernly generic."
Trigun,The animation takes some getting used to if you’re not accustomed to it. Some shots do look cool though. Glad to see the Typhoon return.
Trigun,"Call me an old head but, I really don't like this CG animated stuff. -_-"
Trigun,So has it started airing? The original design for Vash the Stampede might be the coolest looking anime character of all time so of course a slightly altered version would still be good.
Trigun,"Just watched it—I actually don’t mind the visual style, but they’re taking a very different approach to the story. Not sure how it comes across for a new viewer but if you’re familiar with the story they’re revealing stuff in ep1 that was final act plot development originally. Interesting choice, kinda weird."
Trigun,Look how they've massacred my boy...
Trigun,New Vash looks like a fuck boy and I will never get over that.
Trigun,yeah the art style is not my jam.
Trigun,Boomers mad their 90's trend anime pretty boy is now a 20's trend anime pretty boy
Trigun,Did a fucking teenage fujoshi write this? Whoever wrote this fucking article keeps saying cutie. That to me screams they’re more concerned about him being a bishounen fuck boy than the story.
Trigun,"What, have we travelled back to the 90s again? I didn't know there was a new Trigun."
Trigun,Idk that new art style is something else.
Trigun,There’s no way Vash is a top.
Trigun,"Its the second damn week of the year, let em cook"
Trigun,What the fuck is with the tone of this article? Rarely are multiple uses of the word “cutie” included in media reviews.
Trigun,The art style is too much like… Disney vibes. Looks like a lost treasure children’s movie.  Doubt I’ll be able to watch it much more
Trigun,"I watched the first episode today. I'll give it some time but I was not digging the animation at all. The original was so cool and the opening scene made sure you knew Vash was a badass. Everything felt so rushed, I notice that about a lot of anime, slow down, and build some atmosphere. The mood of the original was not there. Maybe I need to stop comparing the two, but I'm a huge fan of the original. 

They made some changes to Vash I wish they didn't, his hair didn't bother me that much but one thing they changed that annoyed me that I'm sure most of you don't care about is Vashes gun. Vash used a unique and iconic 45 Long Colt break open revolver. The design is not a real one, but it made sense. Now they have him using this stupid .22 that looks like some spacey shit. I know that probably doesn't bother most of you, but it annoyed me. 

But I will continue to watch and see if the new version grows on me. I'm open to some changes, and if I like the direction, they take it, then cool."
Trigun,"I guess this is what passes for journalism now lol. His zoomer redesign is terrible, there's no grit anymore"
Trigun,I haven’t started watching the new one yet - but he doesn’t look so extremely different than old Vash.
Trigun,It’s like watching Jared Leto play joker
Trigun,"uhh at least originally he looked like an adult.  eh whatever.  some good shows are getting ruined by these new renderings.  GitS, Seven Deadly Sins come to mind."
Trigun,Saw the 1st episode. Very hard to watch. The animation is not really good. DBZ Playstation games have better graphics.
Trigun,I just hope it leads to reprints of the manga coming back.
Trigun,Animation is a little wonky to me… like the character movements are “sluggish” if that makes sense?
Trigun,Feel like that’s kinda the point. It’s more modern to reflect the time it’s released. Vash was always a pretty boy Bishōnen.
Trigun,My only problem is I hate the Computer generated Anime. It looks wonky. I’d have loved a “trigun movie” quality animation.
Trigun,"One day in the future it'll hit that sweet spot but for now, we suffer in agony lol"
Trigun,First episode was today.
Trigun,I like his new design. Some people “don’t like that he’s suddenly a pretty boy” but as I’ve said in other comments he’s literally just a backstreet boy who accidentally wandered into being an anime protag it’s always been that way.  A huge chunk of the Vash depictions in the manga are happy-go-lucky Labrador-vibes boyband himbo and not the sudden change in demeanor you see sometimes when things get serious.
Trigun,"And, I'm sorry maybe I'm being nitpicky but I reeeaally wish he had his old sunglasses. The new ones are a bit much"
Trigun,"Wait when did old Vash not look like a backstreet boy who accidentally wandered into a manga?

It’s honestly fitting for his character - he’s got a [crouching moron, hidden badass / obfuscating stupidity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass) thing going on. The pretty boy aspect I feel like just plays that up like he’s just good for his looks, just a young gunslinger who claims to be lucky."
Trigun,Old Vash looked like a fuck boy I will and have gotten over it.
Trigun,Vash has always looked like a fuckboi but what a fuckboi looks like has slightly changed
Trigun,"Keeps saying? I did ctrl+f for 'cutie' and 'cuties' and there was 1 hit for each word.

Where are you finding all these other 'cutie's?"
Trigun,I don’t know man. I genuinely think it’s gotten the sweet spot right now.
Trigun,"Seriously though, the spiky hair, round spectacles and flowing trench coat are all 90’s as fuck. Vash’s design was 100% of his era so it’s only normal for the reimagined design to be 100% of this era. This coming from someone who discovered anime and Trigun in the 90’s and dropped out of anime soon after (aka never really kept up). Just saw the trailer and looking forward to it. One thing I can’t image them topping though was is the soundtrack. That shit was amazing."
Trigun,"Search for cute. You also read the fucking article, it’s nothing but her gushing over his new looks."
Trigun,I actually got that soundtrack on CD to listen to in my car lol. It was one of the things that made the show for me.
Trigun,"The trench coat was more steampunk/western-y though, along with the glasses. It wasn’t a Neo trench coat.

His new look is just lame, generic zoomer. Looks like he’s gonna tell you to listen to his sound cloud rap or something."
Trigun,Literal backstreet boy made into anime protag.
Trigun,"I did, here's the hits:
Searching for 'cute' -
>Now, he’s back and cuter than ever in studio Orange’s reinvention of the classic sci-fi Western, Trigun Stampede.

>In the end, it leads him to be a lot more approachable, and also crushable beyond his cute looks. 

>he new Vash brings fresh life to a decades-old character, as he returns to us vivacious as ever and ready to capture our hearts as one of 2023’s most memorable anime cuties. 

>Given its history of work, it doesn’t seem so surprising that Orange can deliver our next star anime cutie.

Seems there were two more instances than what I found initially.

In 1,141 words, there are 4 instances of cute or some variation."
Trigun,"She wrote the word cute 2 times in the first paragraph. Once is enough, let alone 4 times."
Trigun,Trigun?! Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time
Trigun,Okay but...where the fuck is Milly Thompson? I'm willing to give this version a chance but how do you replace her with a character who comes off as another straight man role that Meryl already fills? Even the change from Insurance to Reporter I'm okay with but there's a dynamic that Milly brings that bounces so well off the other 3.
Trigun,Vashes hair looks so lame in this reboot. No Milly is not good.
Trigun,Imagine going back in time and asking your 1996 self to borrow their burned Trigun discs because the remake from 28 years in the future somehow has worse animation.
Trigun,Johnny Yong Bosch could save this.
Trigun,This style of animation is ugly as hell.
Trigun,it's that new 3d style anime. not a fan of that crap
Trigun,Is this just a remake?
Trigun,"Man.... All the characters look too young, vash and wolfwood especially."
Trigun,"On the plus side - this looks cool. I'm genuinely quite excited.

However - where is Milly?!?"
Trigun,"I don't like how so many anime fans treat source material as sacred. If you want to see the most faithful version of ""Trigun"" possible, just read the manga.

This is clearly not a faithful retelling. It is using the characters, setting, and themes to tell a unique story. A ""remix"", effectively. Isn't that way more interesting than just a straight-up panel-to-screen conversion? Doesn't this give us the opportunity to be surprised, or to explore new ideas?"
Trigun,"People are shitting on the animation, but I kind of like it. It's definitely not as bad as people are making it out to be. That's for sure."
Trigun,Is this supposed to be the “Brotherhood” to the original Trigun where they redo the ending to match more closely with the manga?
Trigun,"I love it, but I don't think I'll ever stop hating 3d animated shows that'd look great as video games but look shoddy and cheap as shows."
Trigun,It's been a while since I've read the manga or seen the original but doesn't Vash hide his robot arm?
Trigun,"This looks terrible…Maybe it’s because I adore the original series, but everything seems off compared to what came before."
Trigun,Where Milly?
Trigun,"They've made him look like a kid. A big part of his character is supposed to be that he's a man that acts like a child. 

Now he's just a child."
Trigun,"It's on Netflix. I have read the mangas, but I don't get the hype."
Trigun,She's got a couple of dynamics bouncing around that will be missed.
Trigun,"It also looks too clean, the original had a sense of grimeyness/destruction in it's aesthetic. Look at Vash's coat and how well put together it is."
Trigun,"Yeah, I hated everything about it. Why do people say studio Orange does cg animation well? I think Jimmy Neutron had more natural character animation than this."
Trigun,"If he doesn't do the English dub I will be extremely disappointed. He was one of the reasons why Vash came across as so loveable to me. That sweet, goofy voice."
Full Metal Panic!,I made this parallel to my parents and they called me a fucking weeb. 10/10 would FMA again
Full Metal Panic!,"I really enjoyed the original fma anime. I mean when I watched brotherhood it was definitely much better, but I still felt the original made sense and was enjoyable. I also don't remember much controversy when it came out, but then again I wasn't really looking online at reactions."
Full Metal Panic!,A big difference is that the FMA source material got finished eventually
Full Metal Panic!,I still am partial to FMA over Brotherhood myself.
Full Metal Panic!,"It also shows the problem with game of thrones...FMA did not force an ending that was proper to the Manga but was improper for the Anime.


Several times during the bad seasons of game of thrones...things from the book(at least the things that were forshadowed in the books) were not proper for the show characters.


Daenerys leaves meeren...in the books, this would have been the culmination of an arc where Daenerys realizes that she is a conqueror...and to not change her personality to please the people. In the book drogon was in danger of being killed by an angry mob and Dany realized that in terms of priorities...Dany would always choose her children over the common people. And her being kidnapped by the dothraki would have reintegrated her blood lust. When she returns to meeren she forces the masters to change their slavery policies or have their entire cities destroyed. This makes sense in the book, but in the show the dothraki, sons of harpy, and the internal conflict between Dany love for the people and her love for her children are botched and completely ignored. The show Dany hasn't had a real arc in meeren, there was no real point in meeren. In the books meeren demonstrates that Dany would choose her dragons over her subjects.

tyrion killing his father...in the books, this murder happened because Jaime told tyrion that tysha...the only real woman tyrion has ever loved, really did love tyrion and that tywin made her look like a whore for shits and giggles. Tyrion becomes so pissed that he vows revenge on cersei and Jaime, he also tells Jaime that cersei slept with lancel lannistor. Shae also regretted betraying tyrion and when she begs for tyrions forgiveness, tyrion still kills her and than kills tywin after he called tysha...not shae...a whore. This doesn't work nearly as well in the show because shae is a petty bitch to the end, tysha has no real significance, and tyrion kills his father for no real reason.

Jon snow is another ""this works in the book but doesn't work in the show"" problem. In the books, Jon snow is much more rough around the edges, harboring resentment and dreaming of becoming lord of winterfell(in the show...Jon is Christ like in the beginning and doesn't harbor resentment nor dreams of becoming lord of winterfell...although dreams of being a stark). In the books Jon is constantly torn between his duty and his desires...and show Jon starts to go downhill after being elected lord commander of the nights watch. In the books, Jon takes hostages from the free folk and threatens to murder the hostages if they act out of line. orders sam not only to go south but forces sam to replace gilly's baby with mance ryders child so that the red woman doesn't kill mance baby. The plan would be that Jon would inform her that gilly's baby was not mance's before the sacrifice so that both babies would survive the ordeal(Jon is killed and therefore it is unlikely if not impossible to guarantee the safety of gilly's baby, not to mention the wildling hostages that are now in control of the traitors in castle black). But as we know, it is very possible that the red woman not only kills gilly's baby, but also realizing her mistake burns shireen while the nights watch slaughter the hostages. This failure in leadership only happening because Jon snow was angry at a letter Ramsey sent to him and wanted the wildlings to march south with him to kick ramseys ass. Realizing that he could not swallow his pride and failing to save the hostages, gilly's baby, or shireen. A ressurected book Jon snow would be utterly unable to conceive of trusting himself to ever take a leadership position ever again and would likely spend most of the remainder of the series trying to make sure Dany sits on the throne...not because of ""she is my queen"" but because of ""I want her to sit on the throne because I don't like responsibility because as lord commander hundreds of kids died because of my direct orders"".


FMA 2003 would have fallen in the same trap if it tried to force Edward, envy and all the other characters to do things that their Manga counterparts had done in the Manga because the characters as presented in 2003 are massively different from the Manga counterparts on a thematic and even character level."
Full Metal Panic!,"Uhm Wrong! The FMA deviation and conclusion was actually well received and loved unlike GOT. If anything, it's one of the best examples of how to properly deviate from the source material."
Full Metal Panic!,Handmaid's tale season one was great. It was based on the book. Season two was average. Same deal.
Full Metal Panic!,"> TV shows writers were forced to come up with an ending for the series.

I believe GRRM told the GoT people how his books would end. They had to connect the dots, but the ending is his. 

The REAL comparison, in my opinion, is that FMA took the correct approach by starting over! The GoT people, could, if they wanted to, remake season 8. It would be a bitch to do, and cost a bunch, but they could do it. The audience wants it. HBO wants it. The money is there for them. But they have moved on.

So the real lesson from all of this is follow the FMA approach and re-do it!"
Full Metal Panic!,"> Anyway thought the parallels were interesting.

But, there really aren't parallels. Anime series commonly take place while the series is going. One Piece, Attack on Titan, Hunter X Hunter, Toriko, you name it and if a manga has an anime, it probably isn't complete. There is a big difference between the two though.

In the case of Game of Thrones, the problem lies more on George R. R. Martin. Outside of book five releasing almost immediately after the series started, the series never continued. If you average it out, he took about three years between books, though the last one had a difference of six years, so it was reasonable to conclude he would give additional content over the series run so they could adapt it accurately. 

This was the case with Full Metal. Just giving the series a casual glance, it released as intended (it was a monthly series), so the source material would eventually be there and could be adapted. However, this doesn't seem to have ever been a thought during the anime process. The first episode apparently aired on Oct. 4, 2003 and it ended on Oct. 2, 2004. The anime had 51 episodes, so it seemingly just ran for one week or two days short of a literal year, meaning they always intended for it to go this route. 

This is a stark contrast for Game of Thrones, as I don't think anyone working on the series thought that they'd have to come up with their own content some six years later, but they also can't just stop either. Between contracts, overall demand and desire to do other things, they had to go this road, where as FMA could've done less episodes, filler or countless other things, something that was even common place back then. 

So, yeah, I wouldn't say there really is a parallel as much as one situation kind of matches if you ignore a bunch of details."
Full Metal Panic!,"I love both endings, to FMA that is.

GOT was disappointing on several levels."
Full Metal Panic!,So we will get Game of Thrones : Brotherhood whenever the books are over (so probably never) ?
Full Metal Panic!,"I don't remember the 2003 anime being controversial at all.  It still works individually, even if the story is completely altered midway."
Full Metal Panic!,"The big difference with FMA was that very early on they realised they would overtake the manga, so with the authors blessing they basically wrote a different version of the story,the second half of original fma has absolutely nothing to do with the manga.

Got on the other hand most likely has followed the same general major plot points of the books, but executed them in a shitty way."
Full Metal Panic!,"This is not true though? Original ending did not receive the same hate that Game of Thrones did, people were okay with it mostly. I watched original FMA when it was airing, there was no reaction like this. 
>In both cases the ending the writers came up with was hugely controversial, with the fan base imploding and battle lines being drawn and fighting breaking out.

This is simply not true. After Brotherhood people started to take sides but even then it is not like Game of Thrones at all. It is disingenuous to compare reaction to original FMA to Game of Thrones, people were very forgiving with original FMA compared to GoT. There was no imploding or battle lines like GoT."
Full Metal Panic!,I would love to see an animated remake of GOT
Full Metal Panic!,"Unpopular opinion: with the exception of the movie, I liked the ending of FMA more than Brotherhood. I felt like FMA did more to treat the homunculi as real characters and to explore the psychological cost of using alchemy as a solution to life's problems, where the manga/Brootherhood took a more traditional shonen battle series approach of ""all problems can be solved by punching the right thing hard enough."""
Full Metal Panic!,Original FMA still the goat.
Full Metal Panic!,[deleted]
Full Metal Panic!,Interesting thing is that Fort Briggs in FMA (manga and FMA:B) took inspiration from ASOIAF
Full Metal Panic!,"As someone who only started watching FMA and FMA: Brotherhood (before finding out the latter was a 'reboot') would you recommend I watch both?

If so, would you recommend I watch them in a certain order?"
Full Metal Panic!,"Fullmetal Alchemist 03 was ridiculously popular in its day. People's opinions of it only really changed after Brotherhood came out, and now it seems to be changing again."
Full Metal Panic!,"> In both cases the ending the writers came up with was hugely controversial 

In case of GoT I don't know if it was the reason. It was controversial for some because they were rooting for Daenerys and Jon, but for many, me included, it was worthless not because of content, but because of the quality of writing. It was on CW DC superhero show level when they make their worst episodes"
Full Metal Panic!,It’s not like there are that many fierce defenders of the Game of Thrones ending.
Full Metal Panic!,"Can someone tell me why a continuation of the series can't happen?  Say based on Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring?

The show runners  had the licence of the existing books. How can they have rights to content that does not exist? 
What's to stop GRRM selling the rights to the remaining books once they are done and make a show titled something other than A Game of Thrones?"
Full Metal Panic!,Hahha nice parents you have
Full Metal Panic!,"There really wasn't much controversy. Even the original manga author came out and said she thought they did a pretty darn good job, and praised some of the narrative changes (Apparently she regrets killing off Shou Tucker so soon and likes that the 2003 version did so much more with him)."
Full Metal Panic!,What the fuck.....
Full Metal Panic!,damn..
Full Metal Panic!,"I will say The Homoculi and their entire story in FMA was way more interesting than in Brotherhood, though overall Brotherhood was the better anime."
Full Metal Panic!,Same. I think Brotherhood did plot better but something about the characterization in the original that I prefer
Full Metal Panic!,Howwwwwwwww? I'll never understand people who prefer lower quality everything.
Full Metal Panic!,"The biggest problem with Daenerys is that they whitewashed her character and arc too much to the point that she became a “badass feminist icon”, and they didn’t have the guts to challenge the audience’s perception of her because she was so popular, but still needed to give her the same ending as her book counterpart. 

Martin has flat out said that she works as an allegory for US interventionism and foreign policy. The show scrapped that and turned her arc into an orientalist’s wet dream by only having her harming one-dimensional brown villains and glossing over the wide-scale death and destruction she’s caused as well as her capacity for cruelty.

The show acted like eradicating slavery in a society where it had served as the main economy for a millennia was just a matter of having the right attitude. Meanwhile, book!Dany ended up not only allowing a flourishing slave market right outside the gates of Meereen, but also profiting from it because she needed gold. Book!Dany enforced slave labor, had her Unsullied kill Astapori children age 12 and up for the sins of their parents, led a bloody conquest of Meereen and pardoned every crime including rape and child murder, had innocent girls tortured in front of their likely innocent father etc. 

Even Mirri was made to look worse to whitewash Dany’s burning of a slave who was gang raped when in the books Dany literally admitted that Jorah unintentionally killed her son by carrying her into the tent against Mirri’s advice, and that Mirri wasn’t to blame. The decision to burn Mirri anyway was shown to depict how good Dany was at twisting reality to make herself the hero of her story, and how her dragons (vision to birth them) would always take priority over everything else."
Full Metal Panic!,[deleted]
Full Metal Panic!,how did that book end?
Full Metal Panic!,"> I believe GRRM told the GoT people how his books would end. They had to connect the dots, but the ending is his.

It's not really fair to say it's GRRM's ending when they cut massive parts of the story. (f)Aegon, Stoneheart, and Victarion never even make it to the show; neither does most of the magic found in the books."
Full Metal Panic!,"If you want to redo the show to follow the books, you need to remake more than S8. From S4 onwards, there are massive changes in the show that make it pretty much impossible to have the same story."
Full Metal Panic!,"> But they have moved on.

most importantly, the actors moved on.

and i  think its really sad to go and ask them to redo it, emilia did some of her best acting on season 8, like it or not. how can we tell her that she should ""delete"" that and do it over again?"
Full Metal Panic!,"I would’ve loved the ending, because it was unexpected but if their was build up to what happens and how she becomes mad it would make sense, from the writers perspective I could write a better fucking ending in an hour than the shut they wrote."
Full Metal Panic!,well first you say George left the writers note but then you say they had no plan.
Full Metal Panic!,"That is interesting, do you have a source though? That would have appeared around 2005-2006 in the manga, and I honestly find it a little hard to believe that Hiromu Arakawa was familiar with an obscure fantasy series from the US that wouldn't get a TV adaptation for another 5 years."
Full Metal Panic!,"If you're going to watch both, FMA and then Brotherhood. The first half, which in both cases is adapted from the source material, is better in the first FMA series, since Brotherhood kinda focuses on the differences and sometimes it seemed like they assumed you watched the first series. If you only watch Brotherhood you probably won't notice the missing details.


If you're only gonna watch one of them, then there will be a debate. Personally I think FMA is better than Brotherhood, but Brotherhood is actually the true adaptation of the source material. But really, no matter which one you watch it's one of the best animes ever made."
Full Metal Panic!,"FMAB is the ending the OG author wrote and is considered an all time classic. 

you can watch either one in either order, it does not matter really."
Full Metal Panic!,"Because no one wants to watch a version where all the actors they identify with the roles suddenly switch to different people with their own vision for how to bring the character to the screen. Acting is as much of a creative process as directing or script writing, and someone else's Arya Stark is not going to be the same as Maisie Williams's."
Full Metal Panic!,"It was an expensive show and it would likely be a hard sell to get the budget for it and to convince enough people to watch ""Game of Thrones but with a good ending this time we promise"" for 8 years. It's way easier to do that with an anime that ran for 50-60 episodes."
Full Metal Panic!,[deleted]
Full Metal Panic!,It's because FMA took time with characterization while Brotherhood assumed you watched FMA first and so didn't bother.
Full Metal Panic!,"I mean, there are some pretty clear advantages:

1. The entire first cour of Brotherhood is a really bad adaptation - it's both much worse than the first anime's version of the same material, and a pretty poor adaptation of the manga on top of that. They're trying to get through the content that has already been animated at lightning speed, and it shows. I remember watching Brotherhood as it first aired - if I'm remembering correctly, it was a fairly early example of same-day streaming, which was a big deal at the time - and I stopped watching during the first cour. At the time I couldn't have told you why, but I just couldn't get invested, which was strange, since I had watched and loved the first anime and was reading the manga. I've now rewatched both series multiple times, and the beginning of Brotherhood is always a slog. It's terribly paced and bafflingly ordered, starting with an absolutely unnecessary filler episode, then switching the order of Liore and the Elric's backstory flashback, which kind of completely misses that the narrative purpose of Liore in the manga (and first anime) is to introduce us to the characters and universe - the beats don't really work when you already know Ed and Al's backstory from minute 1. Ed's entire speech about scientists being closest to being Gods doesn't work when we already know he doesn't actually buy into what he's saying - the entire point is to create a set of expectations that are eventually subverted when we learn what Ed and Al have gone through. This first chunk of material is also where the first anime wisely emphasizes Hughes role in the story. In the original manga, Hughes is actually a fairly minor character, whereas the first anime he is one of the pivotal characters - indeed, his death literally marks the series' halfway point. Hiomu Arakawa actually expanded Hughes importance in the manga as a result of the character's popularity in the original anime adaptation, eventually leading to a prominent place in an extended flashback to the Ishval Civil War (which Brotherhood also fucked up adapting, spending only a single episode on what was an entire volume of the manga). Brotherhood foolishly not only chooses to remain faithful to the early manga's sparse utilization of Hughes, but in fact compounds on it in it's rush to clear through previously adapted material.

2. The villains in the first anime are better. The Homonculi have more varied motivations and are more dynamic characters. Father's generic quest for power at any cost is just much less interesting than Dante's smaller, pettier aims and means. And the military is an awful organization without the top brass needing to be literally signed on to kill the entirety of their citizenry. The evil is more mundane - and that makes is a lot more real.

3. On a similar note, the story is more grounded in something resembling realism. There aren't magical solutions to massive problems. You can't stop chaos and violence overnight. And while there may be people who are exacerbating these issues behind the scenes, the world is always going to have suffering - it's not something you can solve in a 13 episode fight sequence.

And I could go on. Of course Brotherhood has its advantages - the first anime has a few individual episodes that are just complete misses (Scar, we're going  to have you reconcile with the Elrics over some stupid story about a blind lady, but then they're immediately going to try to hunt you down, and you're immediately going to encounter a situation that sets you right back in murder-mode, just to ensure that the entire episode was a waste of time - or we can try to stop Matt and T.K. from committing identity theft, your choice), and even at it's worst, Brotherhood is at least forwarding the plot. It also has a lot fewer rough edges in general - Arakawa knows how to build spectacle and keep things moving - and every military character finding themselves just sort of hanging out at the Rockbell house because the writers didn't really know where to put everybody would have never happened in the original manga."
Full Metal Panic!,What’s your purpose here
Full Metal Panic!,"Maybe some people disagree with your opinion, and feel the first series is high quality."
Full Metal Panic!,"That is the issue...book Dany ending doesn't work for show Dany.


It is brutally telling that the most popular ""game of thrones fix up"" video that has 5 million views on youtube is also the one where Dany sacrifices Jon and her dragons to save the world from the night king and becomes queen in a world without magic.(by the youtube channel ""think story"")


Because it makes perfect sense for show Dany's character....and forcing the book ending when it objectively didn't work anymore was a bad decision.


The issue is that D&D forced Luke(show dany)to become Vader(mad queen Dany) when a more emotionally damaged anakin(book dany) would have made more sense for that role."
Full Metal Panic!,Nope...the dragon just sat there waiting for Dany as the people were sorrounding him.
Full Metal Panic!,"Martin didn’t even give them the *story* of the ending, he gave them a few *plot beats*. He doesn’t write with an outline. He doesn’t know how he will get to things, he gets there as he discovers the story (this has become his problem in writing such a huge narrative, but that’s a different conversation). He told them broad things like, “Shireen gets burned, Hodor is created by Bran fucking around in visions, Dany indulges her bloodlust, Jon is a Targ, Bran becomes king,” but he didn’t give context to how these events transpire because he doesn’t really know. All of these plot points will be better handled in the books because Martin won’t throw it out there like Cliff’s Notes the way the showrunners did. Once you factor in the cut material you mentioned, it’s pretty much inevitable the books, if they are ever finished, will be a massively different narrative."
Full Metal Panic!,Thanks. I am going to try to watch both.
Full Metal Panic!,Thanks for the reply.
Full Metal Panic!,What the fuck.....
Full Metal Panic!,Only in the beginning though.  It doesn't take long to catch up.
Full Metal Panic!,"I'm trying to understand even though it seems impossible for me, hence the 'howwwwww?'"
Full Metal Panic!,"Not really, if we're speaking in terms of characterization. If I'm remembering correctly, everything about Izumi takes place around episodes 27-30ish in the original show, including her past, and Brotherhood doesn't go nearly in detail about her backstory."
Full Metal Panic!,You know how you think FMAB is better?  It's like that but the opposite.
Full Metal Panic!,"The only Fullmetal Alchemist that's actually inferior is the live action one.   
   
No one's asking you to understand why someone likes something you don't, we're wondering why are you being a condescending asshole about it?"
Full Metal Panic!,Izumi has a significantly different past in the 2003 anime and the manga/Brotherhood though.
Full Metal Panic!,"You right, you right. I'm moreso alluding to how you have to get about halfway through the first anime to get to the point where you know the characters well enough such that the team of the second show feels comfortable not dedicating time in FMAB to them. If you see what I mean.

There's so much more time in FMA dedicated to spending time with the initial cast that Brotherhood skips, since it assumes you understand the personality of everyone. Hence the characters in FMA feeling stronger. Basically what I'm saying is in an emotional, character driven sense, it DOES take a long time to ""properly"" catch up."
Full Metal Panic!,"I feel like Nickelodeon came up with the tween concept with SNICK. Clarissa Explains It All, Alex Mack, etc.

In the 90's, for the most part, Disney Channel was mostly cartoons and black and white movies (Elvis)."
Full Metal Panic!,Dear Diary
Full Metal Panic!,">Point is, I feel like there has always been kid of a lack of a between ""Kids stuff"" and ""Teens stuff"" in media, and that ""tween"" over time, just started becoming an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers.

LMAO that you're singling out girls. Beyond that though, your post - for all its effort - feels rather ignorant; the ""tweenage"" target audience has pretty much always been around, what corporate calls it shifts every few decades because marketing to children, more so than any other group, shifts radically with their social interests.

When you're making something for kids, basically everyone knows you have to stratify it more intensely than other age groups because the minds of pre-adolescent (or tween) children vs. a kid in the early and middle stages of childhood are vastly different. Shit like ""Nanalan'"" made for kids still going through early childhood, might appeal to someone still in the middle stages of child growth; but isn't likely to offer much to a preadolescent who, by then, is going to want something more directly stimulating and engaging to their mind.

And yes, it's largely just a naming scheme to better market to that specific group. What do you think does better in reaching their target audience? A TV block aimed at ""preadolescent children"" or ""Hip Tweens""? And you get it in every age group, not just the tweens. A lot of teenage media is focused on treating the viewers how they want to be treated; with respect, like they're small adults capable of making their own decisions and that their parents are just boring and don't get them. That kind of shit flies way better than ""cartoons for adolescents""

The in-between stage of development between childhood and adolescence is literally pre-adolescence, that 9-12 demographic who are at that point in their life where they do tend to be leaving their old toys and games behind and rushing towards more ""adult"" interests as their personality starts to shape and bodies and minds develop. When you complain that it's just ""an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers""; my dude, that's literally what most preadolescent kids want - to be older and treated like they're older because they're starting to feel like they're not a kid anymore, while simultaneously not quite being *there* yet. It's why media aimed at them tends to be soft ball versions of more ""adult"" media - sitcoms and the like."
Full Metal Panic!,Disney basically took what Nickelodeon was doing and combined it with something like Saved By The Bell.
Full Metal Panic!,Great writeup!
Full Metal Panic!,Nick got the concept started. But Disney effectively built an entire network around it that eventually became one of the company's biggest cash cows in the mid-late 2000s.
Full Metal Panic!,"Loved it, absolutely loved it.

A philosophical breakdown of my favorite TV series (yes, including live action) of all time.

This show is everything to me and he nails it - especially the conclusion of the whole series: (spoilers) that the ultimate truth behind truths is that humanity can be above the scientific law equivalent exchange and, by sacrificing a piece of themselves, creates something of greater value for the other. Thus, the cynical nature of the world's premise is replaced with one of potential altruism - an ever-expanding and evolving world built on the empathy of its citizens and their working together."
Full Metal Panic!,"It's without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever made. This is including its own genre (The one anime imo that is equal to this show is Cowboy Bebop and both are my top favorite shows). It's a life long goal of mine to eventually show both of these shows when I teach a media/media literacy class!

You nailed the complexity and the deep core of this fantastic masterpiece. Well done! If I had gold I'd definitely give it to you!"
Full Metal Panic!,Very cool.  I went down this rabbit hold a few years ago.
Full Metal Panic!,"This is incredible! Thank you! A few years ago I started looking for an anime that aired on KTEH during this period. I was into Tenchi Muyo! and tuned in on what I think was a Sunday night expecting to watch it. I was around 12 and ended up seeing the ending (last 10 to 20 minutes) of a series or movie that's haunted me since then..

I've been going through this list, looking up episode synopses and going through episodes that are up on Youtube, but I'm not finding what I'm looking for so far, and there are things I've ruled out due to watching them as an adult.

I was wondering how much knowledge you have of the anime on this list. If I described those final scenes, would you possibly be able to tell me if you recognized what it was from? This has been bugging me for decades now"
Full Metal Panic!,Thanks for putting in the work!  Helped me nail down the specific dates for the recordings I had.
Full Metal Panic!,I happened to stumble upon this looking up KTEH. It will be 20 years since the last anime on KTEH/KQED in about 2 months. Crazy time flies by.
Full Metal Panic!,That's amazing. I remember watching a few these shows as a kid.
Full Metal Panic!,I'm willing to try or can ask around!
Full Metal Panic!,Happy to help!!
Full Metal Panic!,Happy to bring back fond memories!
Full Metal Panic!,"Thanks for your willingness on top of all the work you've already done! I appreciate it immensely!! 

I'll start from the final scene because it's probably clearest in my mind.  

A spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere, and you see a group of very early humans in a field - I think with spears and loincloths - looking up at it in confusion or awe. I remember what was possibly a voiceover (or someone on the spacecraft?) saying something along the lines of how people are getting a second chance with this new planet and basically not to destroy it like they did the last one. 

I'm pretty sure after that the credits rolled. 

The part before that is a bit more confused.

When I turned on the TV I remember seeing a girl (preteen or teen?) in some sort of institution or school surrounded by a serene forested area. It was evening and the whole atmosphere was pretty dark. She was outside and I think she was doing some sort of chore or may have come into contact with a young man.

Suddenly some sort of disaster begins to take place, something like an earthquake or sounds of explosions, and I saw that the natural forested environment was actually contained either underground or inside a building, sort of Truman Show style.  The disaster happening is originating on the outside of the walls of that enviornment. I remember something like fire bursting through vents which were, I think, previously disguised to blend into the natural forest scenery. There is wildlife fleeing. The girl is frantic and trying to find an escape then somehow gets through to the other side of the walls - I don’t remember if it was through a door or some kind of ventilation system. On the other side there was a very modern looking city with skyscrapers that was being totally destroyed. I think it's on fire or being blown up.

Then there was a spacecraft with some people on it that leaves the planet. I don't remember whether or not the girl was on it, but the next scene is the first one I described where the ship enters Earth's atmosphere. 

This all happened very quickly, probably in the final 10 to 20 minutes of the anime. My impression at the time was that it was a movie because the ending seemed to have a finality to it, but if course I could be wrong. 

Thank you so much for reading all that. I hope it made enough sense.  I'm still going through the doc you posted but so far I haven't found it!"
Full Metal Panic!,I totally appreciate it
Full Metal Panic!,Can't thing's just be different?
Full Metal Panic!,"Disagree. Video is great, but music is not of my liking at all.

Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,. Mare of Easttown seems inspired a lot by Broadchurch.  It's like someone saw Broadchurch and tried to Americanize it.
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"Do you think that yourself watching it over 2-3 days (I'm guessing) makes you view it differently than other people who watched it week to week?

Personally, i waited for the first 4 episodes to be out, then caught up and anticipated the last three. Enjoyed the show, but not anything groundbreaking from HBO (even though it has way better developed characters than most netflix garbage).

Edit:
also i agree sharp objects was more engaging, never jumped on little fires everywhere"

Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"But True Detective season one didn’t follow this formula at all. There are a lot of examples of amazing mystery shows that don’t follow this formula and that’s what makes them stand out.

The OP was saying Mare of Easttown doesn’t stand out in this way like true detective did. So it’s silly to compare them.

The show is being acclaimed by people, so it’s subject to criticism. But when people criticize it, it’s not fair to say “well it’s just a murder mystery” as if that makes it immune to criticism."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"> Yes, that's how murder mysteries typically go.

I think I forgot to use the word ""typical"" in the post but that's my point exactly... it's typical."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"> Do you think that yourself watching it over 2-3 days (I'm guessing) makes you view it differently than other people who watched it week to week?

Not at all. But I imagine those who watched it weekly got a great deal of hype and anticipation. 

> not anything groundbreaking from HBO

Yepp, the most typical HBO series i've seen since Crashing. Not a ounce of originality to be found here."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"> The characters and performances are the point

But is it too much to ask for a refreshing, innovative, non-formulaic murder-mystery?? We have gotten them in the past, True Detective for instance is the go to example. 

And no I wouldn't say characters and performance are *the* point... it's apart of the point of course, but the murder-mystery is still there, and subjected to be critiqued. 

> That's like saying Brooklyn Nine-Nine would be a bad police/crime show if it weren't for the great jokes and funny actors.

Not at all. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a sitcom, it's not trying to be a crime show. It's comedy first, whatever crime there might be comes second. 

As I told someone before in one of my write-ups, I have to take into consideration what a series is trying to do before I even think to critique it... then critique accordingly. The murder-mystery is a big part of Mare of Easttown... it's literally the foundation. Whatever crime or mysteries there might be in an episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is of little importance. So if I was to critique Brooklyn Nine-Nine, it'll be based off jokes, delievery, comedic timing etc.  

And of course I'm not taking nothing nothing away from the performances and characters in Mare of Easttown... it got a ""7.0"" because of tbe acting and character work. 😄"
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,Wow what a shit take. Most kids in fact do care about their parents being together
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"No, not at all. If it comes off that way I didn't mean it to I was just vaguely addressing this one post I saw. 

As u/DontPokeMe91 said, this is a board for discussion and people have different opinions, I'm just giving my take. 

*Uggggh! Why does no one get me!!* 😩

Edit: I can't believe I'm still getting downvoted for this. 😂😩 Just to clarify I usually take shots at popular opinions I see online in my posts (even in the previous one), without explicitly mentioning where I saw it of course.

Im not taking shots for the sake of taking shots, it's more ""*I have a different opinion than this popular opinion (being the contrarian I am lol)*"", and not ""*I'm right everyone else is wrong*"" like /u/Exitoverhere assumed. I really hate when people get the wrong idea from something I said."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"True detective is brilliant but its also character wise not case wise. It's not that unique plot wise other than jumping in time which really isn't rare.

I'm never sure what people expect when they watch these shows. Like it's about a murder it can only be so unique as long as it's good I don't care."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"TD season 1, particularly the resolution, was pretty by the numbers. Expertly done though.  Had they actually gone into the cosmic horror they hinted it, we'd be having a different convo but everything about the resolution didn't exactly elevate it outside great acting and directing.  Still, it's probably the best at what it set out to do, even with the limitations of a genre where we've seen these stories 100 times.  Just my (subjective) 2 cents."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"I said typically because there are rare murder mysteries that break that mold. That said, there's many more examples of that kind because again murder isn't really that complicated most of the time, and then the big difference in quality is going to be performances.

The Killing, The Undoing, The Sinner, Big Little Lies, 13 Reasons Why, Hightown, Safe, Perry Mason, Sharp Objects, Broadchurch, the list goes on and on and on. The difference in how good this type of show is almost exclusively going to be on the acting.

That's not a problem, it's not lazy, and it's not necessarily boring; it's just a function of murder not actually varying that much. There's only so many different combinations of motive, setting, characters, etc. so what makes a realistic murder mystery stand out is most likely going to be the acting."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"> But is it too much to ask for a refreshing, innovative, non-formulaic murder-mystery?? We have gotten them in the past, True Detective for instance is the go to example.

The fact that the conceit is centered around the characters rather than the mystery is exactly what makes it refreshing and why people cared so much about it.Also True Detective did the exact same thing? The end of season 1 basically slaps you in the face and tells you the mystery doesn't matter, it's about the characters. When it moved away from that in season 2 it was shitty, and Mahershela Ali's performance and the character development for him are the best parts of season 3.

>And no I wouldn't say characters and performance are the point... it's apart of the point of course, but the murder-mystery is still there, and subjected to be critiqued.

Go ahead and critique it, and it's fair if you didn't like the mystery, but that doesn't mean you aren't missing the point. I don't know how you watch seven hours of a show and not realize that the central themes revolve around the characters and community and not a whodunnit.

>Not at all. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a sitcom, it's not trying to be a crime show. It's comedy first, whatever crime there might be comes second.

This is literally the exact point I'm making. Mare of Easttown is a character drama, the crime comes second. Characters first, crime second."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"Not where I'm from.... or maybe they do idk. As a child from ""a broken home"" myself I can honestly say I've never given a shit. It could be cultural difference? For instance in the U.S., I imagine black folks having more of a ""mind your fuckin' business"" attitude towards their kids than white parents do? 

But nah where I'm from you won't see kids going around being all upset and shit that daddy or mommy is fuckin' someone new. That little kid needs to mind his fuckin' business. 😂😂"
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"Undoing, Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, and The Sinner all don’t belong in this because they all are complete upturns on the formula that you’re defending. I’ll say some without spoiling.

Big little lies is a mystery where we don’t even know if it was a murder that happened or how many victims or who the victims even were until the end of the final episode.

The Sinner isn’t a whodunit at all. We see who at the beginning. It’s a Why-dunit.

True Detective season one only superficially solves the mystery of one of the cases the detectives are working on, but it’s more for character closure and leaves the real mystery unresolved."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"\> Mare of Easttown is a character drama, the crime comes second

There's absolutely no such thing as a ""character drama"" and you know it lol. I rate character work in every single show I watch... it's an essential part of every series.

Mare of Easttown is ""character-driven"".... but it's still a crime-drama... it's still a murder-mystery and as I said that part of the series is subjected to be critiqued just as the characters are.

As another example, let's take for instance romance-drama. Most romance dramas are character driven to an extent if we're being honest... but if the main relationship lacks chemistry or a great dynamic or plays out in very typical fashion as most other relationship dramas do, then I have to critique it as such, Most romance-dramas are the same, but you can have original, creative and innovative romance stories."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"I mean 13 Reasons Why is about a suicide, but my point is the details don't really matter, even if it isn't a straight whodunnit, there's a mystery of who, what, and/or why some murder-y thing happened, usually with red herrings and feints that cause the viewer to guess different suspects, motives, etc. and then ultimately the truth is revealed. The acting is going to be much more important than the plotting in this type of material.

Like I don't understand why this is controversial. OP is like ""acting is all that sets Mare of Easttown apart from it's peers,"" and my point is that's almost always the case, acting is a major factor in how good a TV series is most of the time. There's certainly factors of novelty that sometimes come into play, but most mysteries, and more generally most TV shows, are going to be differentiated on their acting."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"But the whole point of this entire post is that those plot points do matter. Mare of Easttown is a straightforward mystery with good acting and characters. Don’t expect it to subvert the genre like True Detective season one did.

Some people don’t care to watch Kate Winslet limp around in no makeup while doing an accurate Pennsylvania accent if it’s just going to basically be a straightforward mystery."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"I guess my point was just that originality doesn't matter as much to other people as it seems to OP. 

Mare of Easttown is the highest rated English language mystery TV series since True Detective. For all their many, many differences I don't think it's unfair for people to compare them, just due to that. The realism and the acting on Mare of Easttown is head and shoulders above most of the genre, and while I would never call Mare of Easttown a successor to True Detective, Mare of Easttown is clearly the most audience acclaimed show of the genre since it."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,">originality doesn't matter as much to other people as it seems to OP

It's not like I didn't already know this though. But of course as I mentioned many times in my post (think I need to make it a disclaimer) originality and creativity are the basis of my write-ups. It's what I personally look for in shows. Sure something can be refreshing and innovative and still miss it's mark, but I'd still take that over something plain and typical.

As for the other comment you made saying acting is a major factor, that could be what you look for in shows... for you that could solely be what determines whether or not something clicks, but to me that's only 1 essential part of a series. For instance here are the scores I gave Mare of Easttown:

    originality/creativity: 3/10 
    writing (plot & cha): 8/10 
    writing (dialogue): 7/10 
    acting: 10/10 
    visuals/cinema: 7/10 
    production: 7/10 
    rating: 7.0 out of 10"
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"You gave The Serpent a 9.0/10. I feel like that's pretty hard to justify, and out of step with the general public and professional critics.

I'm standing by my opinion that you think about TV differently than most people and my original point saying that expecting originality from Mare of Easttown isn't reasonable given the nature of the genre."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"What's wrong with The Serpent? lol. 

> you think about TV differently than most people

Of course I do. Most people don't put much thought into it at all. Look at how popular Who Killed Sara? is. And that's only a 5.7 in my eyes. 

> expecting originality from Mare of Easttown isn't reasonable given the nature of the genre.

I expect originality from everything I watch.... everything. As I said it's almost like the basis for these write-ups. Most shows, don't have much of it, and when that's the case... when it feels like something I've seen a million times before, I censure. Even when it's a case like Mare of Easttown, where it's admittedly good... but just lacks originality. That's how you get a post like this. 

Unreasonable given the nature of the genre? I dont even know what this means... there have been crime dramas with creative and innovative murder mysteries in the past you know. I can't just gloss over such an important part of the show's foundation, ""*oh well most crime-dramas are like this so i'll give it a pass*"". Nah man, when I see some typical shit I gotta call it out, because typical does nothing for me."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"I think The Serpent was totally fine, but I haven't seen almost anyone rate it as high as you.

Most reviewers found the non-linear structuring unnecessary and distracting, which I completely agree with.

My biggest personal problem with The Serpent was that I found it overly long, but that's a common problem I'm having with TV shows lately. I typically am finding myself wanting something that's 13, 12, 10, or 8 episodes to instead be 6 episodes or maybe even a 1.5-2.5 hour movie because most stories seem to languish in the middle and don't really make good use of the extra hours.

It's totally fine placing originality as so important, for you, I'm just saying that for most people, myself included, overall execution seems to be more important.

I think this comes down to an agree to disagree kind of situation where it's mostly opinion. All I've tried to do here is say that I think you are in the minority in your opinion about Mare of Easttown, because while ""typical does nothing for [you],"" exceptionally well executed but typical seems to do a lot for most people.

Sometimes we don't need to reinvent the wheel, just resurface it. Also I happen to think a more gestalt approach to reviewing things is necessary instead of just averaging different categories; a lot of things are greater or worse than the sum of their parts. I understand wanting to take a systematic approach, but that's just not how almost anyone seriously reviews media because it doesn't work particularly well."
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"> Most reviewers found the non-linear structuring unnecessary and distracting

Yea that's right. It can be confusing and takes a while to get use to. It doesn't elevate the plot much either it's really just done for convenience and to make room for twists and reveals. But I wasn't too overly concerned with that, as of course originality is the basis of my posts.

> overall execution seems to be more important.

Originality and execution are not necessarily different things. I'll elaborate on my premise a bit further, I rate shows based on their originality, creativity and innovation in style and execution (check out the comment section in my pinned ""Top 25 TV Shows of 2020"" post I explain it more). Mare's execution was precise... adequate... not original nor creative nor innovative. 

But you're right most people don't care much for originality... in fact most shows that hit, has a great abundance of familiarity. But of course idgaf about most people I'm just giving my take lol. 

> a more gestalt approach to reviewing things is necessary instead of just averaging different categories; a lot of things are greater or worse than the sum of their parts.

I never post the full scores because my system works better in my head, how I break down and rate each category... which is something that just won't be understandable when I post it and I can't bother to explain the process everytime... but it works. Sure there have been shows that I really enjoyed that ended up getting 6s or 7s because the acting or visuals suck but most times it accurate sums up my feelings. 

> that's just not how almost anyone seriously reviews media

Again you keep saying ""*most people don't care about this*"" ""*No one does it like it*"" and I keep saying I knooooooooooow and don't care. Lemme do me man.... lemme do me. 😂😂 It works for me. You look for approval from others a lot in life don't you?"
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,">You look for approval from others a lot in life don't you?

Not at all. 

I do appreciate the ""wisdom of the crowd"" though, likely much more than you do.

There are obviously exceptions, and you can definitely find things that are review bombed, manipulated, etc. but generally large groups of people loving or hating things are at least somewhat predictive of how any given person will feel about something.

It's rare that something with a very low average critical and user reviews will be something I like, just as it's rare that something with a very high average would be something I dislike. This isn't because I just go with the crowd, or have average taste, it's just that individual taste doesn't vary much.

Obviously things scoring more in the middle are going to be less predictive for an individual, and then there are things like the “Napoleon Dynamite” effect where there are certain genres and aesthetics that are more polarizing, but again for extremely disliked and liked things it mostly just works.

>I have a different opinion than this popular opinion (being the contrarian I am lol)

I guess my whole point is that thinking differently, just to have done so, isn't something I usually respect very much. Sometimes people see diamonds in the rough that others miss, and sometimes they have valid criticism of things other people enjoy, but most of the time someone disagreeing with a clear majority is just doing it for their own personal enjoyment of ""look at me!"""
Sherlock Yack - Zoo Detective,"\> I guess my whole point is that thinking differently, just to have done so, isn't something I usually respect very much.

This is not what I'm doing, just in case you got that impression. If I fucks with something, I fucks with it, If I don't, I don't. 🤷 I'm just giving my honest take, but I do like to hear other people's takes too don't get me wrong. 

Also, never reply to something I said with the laughing emoji or ""lol"" behind it in a serious manner because it means I'm joking.

Samurai Champloo,"Without context it’s not terribly anxiety inducing, so only those of us who watched the show could feel anxiety, and we kinda remember, on account of it being an especially iconic scene even in a show that seemed to built out of iconic scenes.

Samurai Champloo,"Best anime ever for me, I’m not a giant anime fan but damn I absolutely loved this show. RIP nujabes"

Samurai Champloo,"Always feels weird comparing an English dub to a Japanese dub as an english only speaker. Can't pick up on inconsistencies, slight tonal shifts etc since I don't speak the language. I will say though, Japanese VO does have a way with expressing extreme anger/sadness that has always been interesting to me."
Samurai Champloo,"Aside from subjective disagreement in the main here, Bebop's creator does not prefer the US dub- his only ever comment on the matter has been wildly exaggerated. The first time he heard it, he said when asked that he didn't speak much English but it sounded 'good' (when the US ADR director was in the audience, and journalists were noting down his comments).

He's been consistent in praising and re-using the Japanese cast he hand-picked and voice-directed himself (singling out Faye's VA as a highlight as recently as last summer), and also has episodes shown in Japanese/subbed when screening them abroad.

u/tdog_93 in case you're interested."
Samurai Champloo,"I dunno, even in this clip the girl's scream at the end still has that dub feel where the actress is clearly reading the line as she thinks it should be read rather than actually feeling the emotion herself. If that quality of acting were in a native English show it would be rightly ridiculed."
Samurai Champloo,"While I've only ever seen Cowboy Bebop in English, I did not know that Champloo also had a favorable English dub. Have been meaning to rewatch it for years, absolutely loved it. Now I have another reason!"
Samurai Champloo,The brothel episode was funny as hell.
Samurai Champloo,"Usually it does. But in those particular examples, the dub is just beautifully done, the actors fit the characters perfectly and it's clear that no one involved in the process has phoned anything in.

  


Purists are so quick to dismiss dubs that they end up missing some great content. And with bebop in particular, when even the creator said that it's the best way to watch it, purism becomes just petulence when you won't even give it a shot."
Samurai Champloo,I have the same opinion. The scenes with anger and grief are a lot different in Japanese dubs than English dubs. No idea why but it is.

For anyone, young and old, I highly suggest looking up this show, it's great! If you haven't heard - and you enjoy music - do look up Nujabes. Extremely influential late producer. Did great tracks and mixes of styles. Worlds End Rhapspdy, Luv Sic, etc etc."
Samurai Champloo,thats how i feel with cowboy bebop
Samurai Champloo,"on a similar note, one of the only opening theme songs i ever listen to every time is Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex."
Samurai Champloo,Nujabes - Battlecry. Instantly in my head when saw the post. Love this show.
Samurai Champloo,I love this anime so much. Its the first anime i wish i could watch for the first time. The soundtrack was also soo good. I have listened to Nujabes so many times while studying.
Samurai Champloo,"This is how I feel about the opening to [Mob Psycho 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-5Lka7gPE). Not only is it catchy as hell, but its also visually stunning. And to echo OP, start watching this show because there's none like it."
Samurai Champloo,Love Samurai Champloo. RIP Nujabes.
Samurai Champloo,I'm pretty sure it's illegal to skip either beginning or end credits of bojack horseman....
Samurai Champloo,The English translated end credit song is one of my favorites.
Samurai Champloo,Feel the same way about Carole & Tuesday. That soundtrack absolutely slaps.
Samurai Champloo,"Sucks that they never made more than 1 season, I don't get how an anime this damn good only got 1 season and yet there are so many terrible animes that have been running for decades"
Samurai Champloo,I do the same and I've watched the series several times. It's so good.
Samurai Champloo,"Same, I never skip them."
Samurai Champloo,"I miss Nujabes.

Grew up listening to his music, and then he died. Hugely influential to the lofi hip hop genre"
Samurai Champloo,"Right there with you.  The second I hear it, I have to binge the whole series...it's so nostalgic and magical and unique.  It's the only show that I've bought dvds of.  If I could only watch one series for the rest of my life, it's Samurai Champloo."
Samurai Champloo,Arguably one of the best end credit songs. Shiki no Uta is just so great that I'll never get sick of listening to it.
Samurai Champloo,"agree agree agree, i put that song on almost every single mix CD i make for my car"
Samurai Champloo,"I like watching the credits to Party Down so that I can find out how they say ""TREE"" at the end."
Samurai Champloo,"RIP Nujabes, the dude had such a bright future ahead of him :("
Samurai Champloo,"If you've never watched Overlord, season 3's OP is on my regular playlist of songs because it's that great."
Samurai Champloo,I mean how many times has Auraurian Dance and Who's Theme been posted to r/music. Good stuff.
Samurai Champloo,Ride on shooting star tho?
Samurai Champloo,"Some live some die, in the way of the Samurai."
Samurai Champloo,"Bebop and Champloo are my first two recommendations to anyone who asks. 

So much style, heart and pure action. 

I'm a full grown man and these shows make me cry like a baby sometimes. 

Poor Ed."
Samurai Champloo,"Kids On A Slope is great. Its a slice of life set in the 60s where a classic trained pianist teen gets into Jazz after moving to a new school. 

Terror in Resonance is interesting as well"
Samurai Champloo,"Nujabes is an absolute legend, it's a tragedy that he died so young."
Samurai Champloo,Honestly I always though that Samurai Shampoo was Cowboy Beebop in the edo period. Cowboy Beebop will always be my favourite.
Samurai Champloo,"Yeah, it's basically a crime to skip that intro."
Samurai Champloo,Also it’s now on HBO Max
Samurai Champloo,I was always annoyed with Netflix for skipping the end credits. I realise you can turn that off now.
Samurai Champloo,The opening guitar riff!!
Samurai Champloo,Hell yeah Shiki No Uta is my jam.
Samurai Champloo,Knowing when to properly end a story is a rare skill. Respect that they didn't try to milk it.
Samurai Champloo,I just want a movie.
Samurai Champloo,"Watanabe knowns to leave a story alone when it's done. I don't think he's done any project that had multiple seasons outside of Space Dandy, and that's because it wasn't so much about the overall story but about the batshit insaneness of each episode"
Samurai Champloo,Bit hardcore for me. Nonetheless its a Jam!
Samurai Champloo,"Yup, might be blasphemy but Kids on the Slope is probably my favorite of his after Samurai Champloo (yes, I put it above Cowboy Bebop, freaking fight me)"
Samurai Champloo,"Steven Blum, the english voice actor for Spike in Cowboy Bebop, also voices Mugen."
Samurai Champloo,"Exactly - it's limited run was actually a strength of the show, in my opinion."
Samurai Champloo,"I'm not saying they should have milked it like DBZ but a handful of seasons would have been nice, but I get it. The ending left you with this bitter sweet sensation, amazing story with a beautiful ending leaving you longing for more"
Samurai Champloo,"If you watch the anime it makes more sense than just the song, but the OP is great by itself. I'm glad you actually listened and didn't just immediately turn it down. Cheers."
Samurai Champloo,"A new story in the same universe, with different characters could have been interesting. Old characters make an appearance from time to time."
Samurai Champloo,"The crazy laugh in the middle is such a nice touch... I just wish the anime did more with the characters, they have cool designs and powers but a lot of the time it's so slow it verges on boring for me."
Samurai Champloo,Overlord makes zero sense.  One of the features of the story is a magical force that zaps all sexual desire from the MC if he gets horny.  It is one of the stupidest goddamn shows I was ever bored enough to sit through.
Samurai Champloo,If your only interested in the harem aspect there are many animes to choose from. Overlord is the villain aspect of isekai.
Samurai Champloo,I know what it is and I was just expressing my strong disapproval of somebody pushing it in a thread about an anime as prolific as Samurai Champloo.  It's unseemly.  At least recommend something similar to the series being discussed.
Samurai Champloo,"I was talking about the OP music in season 3 to begin with, nothing more."
Samurai Champloo,Probably one of the best OST in an anime alongside cowboy bepop.
Samurai Champloo,I always liked the contrast of order and chaos in Jin and Mugen's characters. Fuu always seemed like a relatable medium- not wild like Mugen but not rigid like Jin. I miss this show. 
Samurai Champloo,The ending song is amazing. It's my comfort song.
Samurai Champloo,"🎵""Sharp like the edge of a samurai sword the metal blade cut through flesh and bone""🎵

IMO Battlecry is one of the most perfectly crafted songs in ever and it came from the intro to Samurai Champloo. Shing.02 is a very underrated rapper and Nujabes was one of the greatest producers to ever live, he did a lot of the music on the show, R.I.P."
Samurai Champloo,"This was one of the first anime series that I watched completely, and damn was/is it good. Samurai Champloo and Code Geass continue to be my markers for great anime when starting a new series.  "
Samurai Champloo,For a sec I saw Samurai Shampoo. Wanted some really bad.
Samurai Champloo,The show genuinely surprised me and introduced me Nujabes which is life.
Samurai Champloo,This was the show that made me discover my favorite artist [Nujabes](https://old.reddit.com/r/Nujabes/) in 2005. 
Samurai Champloo,"I was a huge anime fan when this came out. This sounds weird, but I literally quit watching anime after I watched it.

In my mind it was perfection and to continue watching anything else would never live up to my expectations.

I watch the series at least once a year."
Samurai Champloo,My sister didnt like the happiness  (without going into spoilers) of the ending.  She did like the anime though.
Samurai Champloo,Man I really wish Space Dandy was a little bit better... It has a lot of great pieces but falls shorts of Champloo and Bebop. 
Samurai Champloo,Same- that and Who's Theme are works of art
Samurai Champloo,What's the title of the song ?
Samurai Champloo,"I've been meaning to start that one, would you say it's still worth the watch?"
Samurai Champloo,Shiki no Uta
Samurai Champloo,"Yeah it’s worth watching, there are some really good episodes."
Samurai Champloo,"Space ghost coast to coast was a god send

Edit: Ooh, mama, am I nervous. Sweatin' like a Trekkie. I smell like oil of Olestra. "
Samurai Champloo,So basically 15 years ago today was the most important day for adult cartoons in history.
Samurai Champloo,[deleted]
Samurai Champloo,The Eric Andre show could exist nowhere else  
Samurai Champloo,"Great write-up! 

Also, for anyone who's interested, Home Movies is back on Adult Swim starting next week."
Samurai Champloo,"Damn, I really miss Metalocalypse. We need to bring brutality back to TV."
Samurai Champloo,TL; DR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkup4zo97E0
Samurai Champloo,"""The medium amount of reefer smoked by 18-34 year olds during the program was considerable."" Best quote of the article. "
Samurai Champloo,"as a 26 year old, I always thought of adult swim as way pavers. I remember falling asleep on the living room couch of a 4 room, 700 sq ft apartment instead of in my bed so I could watch some samurai champloo before bed at 11 at night as a 14 year old. I even vaguely remember flcl and even after all these years, the one thing that stood out was the fu-ri-ku-ri television robot. 

are millenials the generation of nostalgia? have we progressed to quickly? "
Samurai Champloo,"I'll never forget that fucking April Fool's Day. 4 years ago.

Midnight, seeing what Adult Swim had in store for this April Fool's. Steve Blum apparently made a vague random tweet earlier that day. But I didn't see it.

Soon The Room played. Again, like last year. but then suddenly *boom*. Motherfucking TOM. Then Bleach started playing. Thought it was a good joke. Then the bumpers played. ""No way."", I thought. Then I was watching the end of the Cell Saga. Holy **SHIT.** Then it was Gundam, then Trigun. Goddamn. 

Ironically it was one of the highest ratings Adult Swim got in years. A month later, Toonami was back. It went through a bit of rollercoaster of ratings. A few duds(Casshern, Samurai 7) but also a few golds(Kill la Kill, Space Dandy, One Punch Man).

Now, Toonami is going to give us a new season of Samurai Jack, and new season of FLCL, a new Production IG series(people who made IGPX), and (next month) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
"
Samurai Champloo,"I am privileged to have been born at a time when I was old enough to be able to stay up and watch [as] and, also, young enough to be able to stay up and watch [as].  :)"
Samurai Champloo,I was in a really bad place 15 years ago and this late night spot gave me smiles as a preteen. Lots of laughs and some great anime. It really brightened up my life till college. I actually met my husband on the adult swim message boards. He still watches some of the shows :) 
Samurai Champloo,You didn't mention Robot Chicken. The Star Wars specials are some of the most priceless stop-motion gems ever.
Samurai Champloo,"Awesome post.

I tried to think of why they would cancel ATHF, and I now believe that it has to do with the fact that Adult Swim is stronger than ever. That makes me feel confident that they will bring back ATHF when they need a boost in ratings. The show needs to recharge for a few years.

Master Shake and Carl are two of the greatest characters in the entire Adult Swim lineup."

Blood Lad,"I enjoy it very much, but that might just be because i loved dexter.

Personally i dont think he will train Harrison, im thinking it will turn out harrison is a monster and hannah didnt die of cancer."
Blood Lad,I’m having too much fun with it man it feels different but the same
Blood Lad,"I agree that its moving at a snails pace. These are not new plot lines, its just Dexter sneaking around new people.

I think what I and a lot of other people want to see is Dexter finally being caught, actually arrested, the whole trial, the media coverage, family and friend’s reactions, revealing his true self and rejoicing in it. maybe visited in jail by old characters. Then maybe a clever escape in order to kill someone to protect Harrison. All ending with Dexter dying and Harrison living on with control of his dark passenger/ or he goes on to repeat the cycle."
Blood Lad,"> So these are plot elements that strike me as utterly predictable

If you want to call a spade a spade, I could've guessed these things *without* even watching the series. But, like most series, predictable plots are not as important as the things that come with them.

> I love a slow burning show as much as the next person but I just don't think these narratives are compelling enough.

For example, earlier episodes that focused on whether Harrison has a dark passenger, which is basically confirmed at this point, gives an idea of what might come. Even if Dexter decides to teach him a code, it's strongly suggested Harrison will not listen to him and this could lead to a bigger question of whether Dexter will honor his code and end Harrison if he becomes a monster or will he listen to his heart and possibly end up being destroyed by it. 

This is just one example, but the story can head in interesting directions. No clue if it will, but that is the whole point of watching a series."
Blood Lad,"It's not so bad, got caught up with it last night."
Blood Lad,"I watched the first episode and literally guessed at least five of the plotlines as they were happening.

Super, super predictable."
Blood Lad,I'm super enjoying it.  Of course a lot of the plot is predictable.  It's Dexter.  We've seen tons of it before.  Don't care.  I look forward to it every week.
Blood Lad,Only if we get to see gimple return to the character by having him team with Rick grimes as a 45 year old safety patrolman
Blood Lad,The amount of effort you put into that cast list....
Blood Lad,the fuck is fillmore?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"In India, each channel had their own dubbed versions. The Nickelodeon was the most funniest."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"i remember watching that shit lots of time in CN, they be scheduled them frequently and i had to watch it bcz CN literally the only thing i watch back then when i was a kid"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"It was so odd flipping between Disney Channel and Nickelodeon and have both play at the same time. 

I think Totally Spies and Mr. Bean also aired on two of those channels, Disney Channel I'm sure of and Cartoon Network?"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I have heard of this show, but have never seen it; my understanding is that everywhere it airs, with the exception of my native United States, it does MASSIVE numbers with its audiences."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Something similar, but a friend commented that Miraculous Ladybug was on Netflix, Disney+ *and* Amazon Prime, although you had to buy the latter. It started airing on Netflix originally and Disney were the ones to air the dub in most countries."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"This needs more context.

The original cartoon is a form of silent comedy like tom and jerry. Nickelodeon hired voice actors and dubbed them by giving them voices of bollywood actors and adding local pop culture references.

It became so popular that they created an india specific episode."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Additional context. Nickelodeon's voice acting of bollywood actors and pop culture references was based on specific actors. Oggy's voice actor was parodying a particular actor, his brother was this other guy. Etc. It was extremely popular. Oggy and the Cockroaches was known for that voice acting and references. 

When Cartoon Network did their own broadcast they redubbed it with different VAs, but had to stick with playing the same Bollywood actors as the base because of the popularity.

Even Zig and Sharko was like that."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I think it was shahrukh khan and sunny deol who are like the most mimicked guys in all of india.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."

Oggy and the Cockroaches,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
Oggy and the Cockroaches,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Yeah, but did they hire any good writers?"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Can they add some new writers?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Mance!
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Good actors but no thank you.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
Oggy and the Cockroaches,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,How wasn't this cancelled
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Just cancel it already
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,That show is dead.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
Oggy and the Cockroaches,how'd this trash get a second session?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I cannot wait to fall asleep to this show. The first season was better than melatonin.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Did they add new writers
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Presuming middle guys an elf, ladies a hobbit, and old mans a teenage elendil? Calling it now"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
Oggy and the Cockroaches,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,So the flop continues....
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Are they hiring better writers?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Long haired elves or GTFO
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Did they add any new writers
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Great stuff!!
Oggy and the Cockroaches,We needed Bill Burr though.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Is the Show good?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Mance effing Rayder
Oggy and the Cockroaches,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"More majestic horse rides, please."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Siiiiigh
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Reddit's obsession with this show continues to blow my mind. Even the people who love it don't care about it as much as the people who hate it.

Don't you all get tired of saying the same thing over and over again?"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Won't change the writing.
Oggy and the Cockroaches,Maybe the story will be better
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
Oggy and the Cockroaches,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
Oggy and the Cockroaches,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
Angelo Rules,It's nice to see television that doesn't rely on shock value. 
Angelo Rules,That felt so much like later seasons of The Wire. When Nick walked away from the beeper I half expected to hear Way Down in the Hole. 
Angelo Rules,"They really did their research when it came to the diner scene at the beginning of part one. The old Saw Mill Diner really did have a jukebox in that exact spot. There was plenty of Springsteen. The only difference apparent was that the seats and backs of the booths were red and the tables were a horrid fake wood linoleum-type creation.

Mannions - was actually never a good steakhouse. But in actuality, it was probably one of the few places with steak on the menu at the time in Yonkers. No offense to the Mannion family. I grew up with one of their sons. It was your typical Irish pub.

Jim Belushi really does look like Angelo Martinelli.

EDIT: The scene of Wasicsko's win was shot at Rory Dolan's http://www.rorydolans.com/

I am like 98% sure it wasn't there yet."
Angelo Rules,"I think it's pretty great.  The lead actor is great and all of the other performances are believable.  The main story is engaging, well-written and easy to follow.  I don't really know how the Hispanic lady and her kids play into this, but I'm sure she will become important.    

People think of NYC as this super liberal place, but even they had to be dragged kicking and screaming into integration.  "
Angelo Rules,"Interesting stuff.  I'm Australian so I have no knowledge about the real story (and am resisting Googling it to keep it a surprise) or American race-relations in general, and Simon's work has been a great way for me to get a take on this stuff.  Liked all the main performances, and I can definitely see why Isaac keeps popping up in everything; dude's really watchable.  The editing/pacing was great too, lots of jumping around between characters but I could still follow everything.

My only question: the judge is federal, right? That's why he's able to dictate what the Yonkers politicians should be doing?

Oh, and was that Orlando from The Wire playing the NAACP member that Sussman was talking after their meeting in part 1 ?"
Angelo Rules,"My first impression, this miniseries feels pretty lighthearted. The amount of Springsteen just makes this show feel good."
Angelo Rules,Pretty interesting take on a complex issue. Looking forward to seeing where this goes.
Angelo Rules,"I'm a landlord in Yonkers. It's interesting to see how things shaped up now. A lot of investors are now looking at low income housing as money makers, as the government guarantees part of the income. Affordable housing is now a viable investment.

Currently, a lot of money is going into west Yonkers, along the riverfront. This is not affordable housing, but nicer stuff for people priced out of Manhattan. A lot of the outside scenes were shot in east Yonkers, what I (and others), call the tree streets. Walnut, Elm, Oak street, etc. There is some government money to revitalize parts of it, but it's slow going. Honestly, I avoid it.

Yonkers map:

https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yonkers,+NY/@40.941847,-73.8709982,13.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c2c0080943afa1:0xbe967384a4d8daa2

Southwest is the border with the Bronx. Some nice stuff there, as a lot of Jews are priced out of Riverdale (part of the Bronx). Southeast are the tree streets if you zoom in.

If you look at the train stations along the waterfront, the 3rd from the top is the Yonkers station with Amtrak. It's actually *very* nice there, and that's where a lot of the private money is going."
Angelo Rules,"Never heard of Oscar Isaac, but that guy has ""it.""  

Never heard of Ms. Carla Quevado either, but she seems like a pleasure to watch so far.  

Weird seeing Belushi, but I think this looks like a show that is building.  "
Angelo Rules,Is there anything Oscar Isaac isn't in these days? Couldn't be happier for that guy. Also this cast looks pretty fantastic though I'm obviously skeptical of Belushi. 
Angelo Rules,One of the characters looks like a werewolf lol.. 
Angelo Rules,Who am I supposed to root for?
Angelo Rules,should have advertised it as 'starring jim belushi'. whether true or not.
Angelo Rules,"Reserving my complete comments of this until the end. I'll focus on the accuracy etc, until then. This is my hometown and I lived through this. Know most of the players personally. But I was extremely impressed by Oscar's performance. UNCANNY depiction of Nick. I mean, not an easy portrayal at all. This is gripping me and I know the outcome. Job well done.

I'm really excited to see the rest of this. "
Angelo Rules,"Was Sarah Palin in the 2nd episode?  

The lady in purple yelling at the counsel meeting.  "
Angelo Rules,So did wasicsko actually cheat on his wife or was vinni just trying to start trouble with him and his wife? I feel like I missed something 
Angelo Rules,and I missed it...now I have to wait for the West Coast feed because I'm an idiot who didn't set her DVR.
Angelo Rules,"I'm a couple of minutes in, but as a Yonkers native, Oscar has the accent nailed. But young Charlie Cola looks nothing like actual Charlie Cola."
Angelo Rules,Can't wait to see this story get the David Simon treatment.
Angelo Rules,"The wife of a protagonist works now as a Programmer Analyst Desktop Applications for the city:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/naywasicsko

>Interfaces with system users to trouble shoot problems with City webpages;reviews and rectifies various issues with software submitted by users; reviews, logs,and corrects problems as they occur in daily processing; test programs to ensure they are functioning properly; reviews procedures for computer applications against such factors as computer capability and prepares detailed program specification of input and output processing; and liaison with BOE as we transition to merge various resources within the City of Yonkers.

"
Angelo Rules,"It's not compelling in the way The Wire was - the characters are not as colorfully drawn (probably because The Wire characters are fictional and I presume all including the housing project folks are based on real people), but within the first two hours it really drew me in, and now I can't wait to see what happens, although I could very easily find out by doing an internet search."
Angelo Rules,"Isn't it a better idea in the long run to get more high paying jobs to increase the wealth of low income families such that they are no longer low income and can afford to live in wealthier neighborhoods rather than force integration with low income and high income families? 

It's a harsh reality that low income neighborhoods have a lot of crime and moving those families into high income neighborhoods doesn't suddenly make those families upstanding citizens. It just spreads the crime. 

If you make high paying jobs more available for low income families, the actual hard working individuals will take the opportunity and work their way up to get out of the low income bracket. 

Basically, I can see what someone might have an issue with when it comes to super heap homes for low income families being put into your former nice neighborhood that you paid a lot of money to be a part of instead of living in a crappier part of town. It doesn't have anything to do with race. 

Just thought I'd ramble a bit on my thoughts on what is still an issue today I'm sure. "
Angelo Rules,"This could work if there is as little of Mr Isaac as possible, given that there is already Jim Belushi, Alfred Molina, Jon Bernthal, Clarke Peters  and Catherine Keener. I hope it will be an ensemble thing. "
Angelo Rules,Yes! It's actually quite refreshing.
Angelo Rules,"That noise that starts just before the music, almost like a smooth grinding of metal or something.  I get chills down my spine when I hear it, which is happening a lot lately since I'm rewatching The Wire in HD."
Angelo Rules,"Yeah I don't think Rory's was there at the time. I don't know about Burke's or the Heritage either.

Either way, it's very weird to see all the places that I like to get drunk at on HBO."
Angelo Rules,"They also did a few days of shooting at the Will library, according to a friend they were running around Yonkers last fall and winter.  Rory's might have been there but my friend can't remember.  He just remembers how much of an epic shitshow it was.


Not a huge Yonkers history buff, just lived there for a brief unfortunate period And know a few people who grew up there.  "
Angelo Rules,"My take on the Hispanic lady and her family is to show part of the narrative of what life is like in these low income buildings. As David Simon does so well, he gives equal importance to all parties and shows the inside of their real lives. Most of the people in Yonkers that are shown to be protesting are older white people, decrying that the low income housing produces heathen and scum and will destroy their coveted white fence community. The story of the Hispanic lady and young African-American couple is to show what the lives of these ""heathen"" are like and that the majority of Yonkers just have no idea what that their lives are like, who they are as people, because of their latent, institutionalized racial dispositions. The whole ""if they can't afford to live here, they can leave!"" is still very relevant conversation today and as someone who doesn't know this story, I am intrigued to know how it goes even though it is already evident it will be disaster.

As a Canadian I thought the politics was very easy to follow even though it did not seem to be dummied down for the viewer. Loving it so far, just like every David Simon production."
Angelo Rules,"> I don't really know how the Hispanic lady and her kids play into this, but I'm sure she will become important.

Maybe just to show a working single mom living in the type of low income housing being discussed.  Or maybe they will be affected somehow by it."
Angelo Rules,Yonkers isn't NYC
Angelo Rules,">  I don't really know how the Hispanic lady and her kids play into this, but I'm sure she will become important.

I was kind of confused by this too, but I am guessing she and the other people living in the projects are based on a real people, just like the politician characters are."
Angelo Rules,"> People think of NYC as this super liberal place, but even they had to be dragged kicking and screaming into integration.

Yonkers is about twenty miles away from NYC though. But yeah..."
Angelo Rules,"Yes, that was pimpin-ass Orlando"
Angelo Rules,State judges can dictate these issues as well. It's likely the case was brought in federal court however because they'd be seen as more favorable venues. 
Angelo Rules,just wait until the end :(
Angelo Rules,"Lived through it. I think they are telling a straight story. This is totally how it happened. Yet, it was even worse. Those council meetings...people couldn't fit in the door. There were thousands on the street in front of city hall."
Angelo Rules,"you had me up until ""Jews"""
Angelo Rules,"> Affordable housing is now a viable investment.

>as the government guarantees part of the income

If by ""viable investment"" you mean state-sanctioned robbing of taxpayers. Liberal insanity never stops in this country
"
Angelo Rules,If you like Oscar Isaac check out A Most Violent Year and Ex Machina. He's a fantastic actor. 
Angelo Rules,"Oscar Isaac is the best new actor working today. Check out Inside Lywenn Davis and Ex Machina. He's going to be in the new Star Wars movie and I'm convinced he's the next big thing as soon as he gets noticed.

The problem though is he's one of those actors who blends in so well that you don't even realize it's him. I got 2/3rds of the was through Ex Machina before realizing it was him, and I was already a big fan at the time."
Angelo Rules,"He's good. Not a major player, but definitely gives good support."
Angelo Rules,"""Look at the beard on that Abe Lincoln-looking muthafucka, yo!"""
Angelo Rules,The ones that don't share the opinion of the KKK shirt wearer.
Angelo Rules,"The judge, the lady with diabetes? "
Angelo Rules,The architect/city planner that literally looks like God.
Angelo Rules,"I finished the first episode, and I kind of agree. I enjoyed it, but isn't everyone voting for an appeal essentially a racist, including the protagonist? "
Angelo Rules,Common sense
Angelo Rules,He's surprisingly good in the little bit he's in so far.
Angelo Rules,yeah who was that?
Angelo Rules,"I don't think he did, because when she asked him about the hotel he didn't even seem to associate it with anything. However, maybe he was just caught up in the election that he didn't think about it clearly? "
Angelo Rules,Yonkers accents sound kind of like what Manhattan accents sounded like in an earlier era (but have pretty much vanished).
Angelo Rules,"I think the cop in the beginning was Cola's son, and the councilman is shown voting at the end."
Angelo Rules,"Just remember guys, you go on her linkedin while logged into yours, she can see that you visited her!"
Angelo Rules,"> now I can't wait to see what happens, although I could very easily find out by doing an internet search.

That's what I am doing. This series seem to be too close to reality. Reality is boring."
Angelo Rules,Problem is getting high paying jobs for low income people.  Try to guarantee it in any way and you get meetings like we've seen in the series.
Angelo Rules,"Oh, quite the opposite. Isaac is most prominent and is great in this. Others pop up in and out, at least in ep1. "
Angelo Rules,Usually people stop posting the exact same idea over and over again once others have taken notice. I'm actually sort of impressed by your persistence.
Angelo Rules,Burke's came after Dolan's so definitely not. 
Angelo Rules,"in the last episodes, im 99% positive it wasn't even yonkers and actually elmsford. The scene where the lady home owner that changed sides confronts the guy that still against it as he walks out of the pharmacy. I'm pretty sure that was actually elmsford, and not even yonkers lol. "
Angelo Rules,Exactly.  It's not going to be some twist where 'omg she's connected all along!' It's just a cross-section of what it was like for different people.  
Angelo Rules,"It's interesting that the opposite is happening in Chicago now. Rich white people are moving into poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods and ""gentrifying"" them. Right now there is a lot of tension in Humboldt Park, a traditionally low income Puerto Rican neighborhood for just this reason."
Angelo Rules,"Yeah it's like The Wire.  David Simon likes to have a perspective from everyone affected.  So he has the politicians who don't really care one way or the other, the old white lady that is against integration, the hispanic lady that is struggling to feed her kids, and the young black couple who are ""part of the problem"" (the guy sells crack)"
Angelo Rules,Westchester is considered as being a suburb of NYC - or part of the greater NYC area.
Angelo Rules,"I kind of saw those outlying characters as ""these are the people the low income and affordable housing in a better area like Yonkers will benefit""."
Angelo Rules,"It's definitely not considered part of NYC but it's not 20 miles away, it borders the Bronx. The 1 train goes to Van Cortlandt."
Angelo Rules,"McLean avenue, where the bar/victory scene was shot is LITERALLY the border with NYC. "
Angelo Rules,It's not 20 miles. Quit exaggerating 
Angelo Rules,"I completely forgot he was in The Wire. My first thought was ""Hey it's the fuckface lieutenant from Homicide!"""
Angelo Rules,"I live and lived then in NYC, and can only vaguely remember seeing screaming people on the news. Over time I have totally forgotten how it turned out."
Angelo Rules,"I'm Jewish myself... Everybody calls it ""Riverdale,"" when it's just a section of the Bronx. Nobody refers to it as the Bronx though, as it is unlike many other parts. It's very expensive to live in Riverdale, as a religious Jewish community lives there, and has driven up property values.

Many young Jewish couples want to live in Riverdale, but can't afford it. They move to nearby cheaper areas, like south Yonkers, which drives up the prices there.

You can't really have a discussion about affordable housing in Yonkers without addressing the reasons why property values go up or down."
Angelo Rules,"Yeah... What do you think happens when people can't afford housing? Do you think they all just pick up and leave for someplace where they can? That's not how real life works. We've squeezed the poor and middle class so much, we've had to subsidize food and rent just to keep the economy moving.

Angelo Rules,A Most Violent Year was really great and Isaac was the reason. Sad it didn't get much recognition last year.
Angelo Rules,A most violent year is the best movie of the past few years to me
Angelo Rules,"He seems genuine.  

I'll check them out when available.  

Thanks!  "
Angelo Rules,"I fond it odd how well he impersonates two radically different, but also somewhat similar characters in Show Me A Hero and in A Most Violent Year. Their both more mature roles, in the late/early 80s, but in the former he is this very ""normal"", crooked politician with a human face, that's very bland-looking and acts in the same realistic/awkward/common way. And in A Most Violent Year he plays this good and sharp looking "" honest businessman"" that still has a bit of a ganster/vadass vibe...

I find the subtle differences in the way he plays those two similar but different roles quite revealing of his talent/(not that he doesn't absolutely nail his other roles, but they're usually of a very different type)."
Angelo Rules,[deleted]
Angelo Rules,I'm glad to hear! 
Angelo Rules,Would you want the barksdale crew moving next door?
Angelo Rules,That's what I thought but by that time what was the point for vinni to do it because she already won. Unless she was just trying to get back at him.
Angelo Rules,"> at least in ep1

Is it out already. If this true, I'll probably just skip it, can't stand this overrated nobody. "
Angelo Rules,"Still behind, but it wouldn't surprise me if they just chucked in some random Westchester shots.  But they did a bunch in Yonkers, Rory's was really recognizable, the library was as well and city hall was probably most sets but the exterior is damn recognizeable. "
Angelo Rules,"[](/s ""I'm pretty sure they eventually move into the new scattered public housing"")"
Angelo Rules,"> Westchester is considered as being a **suburb of NYC** - or part of the **greater NYC area**.   
   
Exactly. **not** NYC. Hell Jersey City + Newark are considered ""greater NYC area."" NYC is Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, + Staten Island. That's it. That's why they call it the **5** boroughs."
Angelo Rules,The suburbs of NYC and NYC couldn't be any more different politically and culturally for the most part.
Angelo Rules,"Yes, but I am guessing they are based on real people included in the the book this miniseries is based on.

My *speculation* is that housing will be built and these are some of the people who move into it."

Angelo Rules,I was enjoying picturing Abel watching all this playing out in the papers and on tv. 
Angelo Rules,"In Ex Machina he plays a buff, bearded bro/geek hybrid type which hangs around in boxers, drink straight vodka and owns the biggest tech company in the world. He nails it, it just shows how versatile he is"
Angelo Rules,It really has nothing in common with Ex Machina other than having Oscar Isaac in it.  You *might* enjoy it but liking Ex Machina isn't a guarantee that you will.
Angelo Rules,You'd rather see Jim Belushi? Jesus...
Angelo Rules,"It's not, but had a chance to see it.
Overrated is such an overused word. "
Angelo Rules,"yea, majority is Yonkers. I remember when they were filming it in some spots. "
Angelo Rules,But they're still somewhat tied together because many/most people commute into NYC to work.
Angelo Rules,And Drive.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"This is the kind of stupid shit that would actually get me to tune in. Plus, can't go wrong with Ian Eagle. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,This is great! Colbert should do this more often.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,That hot pocket wasn't even frozen!
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Columbia relay team:

 ""Wow, I can't believe we're going to represent our school on national television! Should we give it our all, Mr Colbert?""

Colbert:

 ""Eh, just jog around it."""
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I regret posting this now because reading the comments gave me cancer.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I kind of want to see professionally commentated speed run races now.... ESPN seems to want to get into E-sports in a major way. They should get on that.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Holy crap. GDQ starts today and I didn't even know it. Looks like I have to clear my schedule for a week.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"This was pointless but entertaining. I liked it. 

Some of the comments are fucking cancer."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Turn back now! The comments only get worse from here.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Why did he go to World 7? He had two flutes, he should have gone to World 2 then World 8."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,the microwave says carousel right on it...
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Is that really what hot pockets look like? I've only seen them in commercials but it looks pretty gross.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I really need to buy one of those modern NES gadgets, since my old NES broke.

I miss SMB3. Such a great game, of its genre and era. Maybe the best, though I actually liked Mario 2 even though its the weird red headed step child of the franchise."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"More intense than it had any sensible reason to be.

Oh, and 4x400m is just *under* a mile (1609 meters)"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,That dude looks exactly like you would expect someone to look when you are introducing the world record holder of some video game thing.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I love Colbert, but this segment was dumb. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Desperate for ratings 
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Ha I doubt it. He is a phony that is not funny
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"CBS's focus group testing is on fleek fam.  Speed running games and hot pockets!  Those are what the millennials are into these days, right?  

I also hear they like EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and Hash Tag humble bragging.  Maybe Colbert could work that into the next episode too (or possibly this new electronic cigarette fad my grandon keeps telling me about?)."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"This is the kind of brainless, mind melting bullshit that Fallon does.  America is a joke"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,not gonna watch some uninformed liberal make hot pockets lmfao
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Why is Colbert trying to be relevant?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I""m having massive Letterman flashbacks. This is the kind of stupid shit he'd have on his show after someone explained to him what a video game was."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,At least they're not YouTube comments.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I was just a bit bummed that Colbert *won*.  It would have been funnier if he lost and it would have given the athletes and speed-runner better ""visibility"". "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Oh you poor bastard, every single one gives you an orange envelope doesn't it?"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,The commentary for some runners at SGDQ is even better than that.  They've had commentary for a long time.  
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,There are plenty of streamers that do it very well :)
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,This is exactly what I said. What's even better is that sms is the first game up!
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,It appears he used a glitch that ends the game earlier. 
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"it's called a 'wrong warp'

[here's the video of it.. it's definitely faster than going through world 8.](https://youtu.be/cdWPE9FFA-k?t=3264)"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Oh man they would never ever ever do something for comedic effect on a fucking comedy show.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,You must be fun at parties / sporting events / everything
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I regret to inform you that many people of different body types, and features play video games. This isn't the 80's where going to an arcade meant you were going to be teased later on."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,That guy was a cartoonish parody of himself.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I'm interested to see which 3 things race each other next.

Maybe your sense of cynicism reaching peak levels vs someone getting a prize from a hook machine vs windows 10 loading on a non-SSD.

The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"He doesnt try, he just is. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Super Mario sunshine?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,That was pretty cool to watch.... How do people find these glitches in all these games to do speed runs?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Thanks.  I still play SMB3 and I thought my 13 minute run was good.  Gonna have to learn this.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Sure I play video games too. So when you saw the guy there was no thought in your head of, yep, that makes sense.

If they made that same introduction and a Tom Brady looking guy turned out to be the world's fastest video game something or other, people would flip out.

Same is true on the other hand. If someone is about to be introduced as the NFL's most blah blah and that video game kid came walking out, people would be shocked. If a Tom Brady looking guy comes out people think, yep, makes sense."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,">Maybe your sense of cynicism reaching peak levels

It was just a joke.  Why does everyone on here take a joke about a talk show so deathly serious?  Colbert wasn't taking it very serious and was having fun.  Why can't you?"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I'd watch him make som fluffy french toast.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"I mean that actually takes skill. Not a lot of it, but still."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Yes
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Some of it was found on accident, the newer, faster speed runs are usually done by looking at the assembly code and seeing how to use glitches to write code into the registry that triggers the end sequence."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"What you are is Schrodinger's Douchebag. Someone who arbitrarily and without reservation will say something stupid which is also their ""honest opinion"" and ""just a joke"" until acknowledged by an outside force.

"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I recognise some of those words
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"If I understand correctly, the speed runner will modify the game to insert a glitch?"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,That makes it not impressive and removes all legitimacy.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,">What you areis Schrodinger's Douchebag.

Except it was an obvious satirical joke poking fun at the millennial pandering.

>arbitrarily

It wasn't arbitrary.  I don't think you know what arbitrary means.

>""honest opinion""

Why is honest opinion in quotes?  I never said that.  Man, your comment is all kinds of nonsense.

"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"They can examine the games code. This is done through a low level language called assembly. This lets them see how the game will react under certain conditions. (Should mention what I am about to say may be wrong, and is just my understanding) Now because the game has only a tiny amount of RAM to use, it is very easy for it to run out. This means it will start overriding stored data with new data. [This in theory lets you add your own code to the game while it is running.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6nhjT1bsPE) In the case of that video, doing certain actions at exact spots on screen will push new data into the RAM. If you want to see it done real quick, and partially by a computer, you can see that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkQdwUns7H8). People have even made [pong using these method.](https://youtu.be/OPcV9uIY5i4?t=83)"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Not modify the game itself, but someone might be able to figure out that normallly X triggers Y. But if they do G+H+I instead, they can get Y to trigger early. Y usually being a huge jump in the game. I prefer glitchless speedruns but it's usually a different skillset. Glitches like people use in speed runs require very technical and specific knowledge of certain conditions. Glitchless speedruns are people who are just amazing at the game (So usually they don't have to spend extra time getting things like Hearts in Zelda because they just don't get hit) and have the entire thing memorized. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Not only can they cause glitches but they can write actual code. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnZ2NNYySuE) out. If you look up code injection in games you can find lots of stuff. [Pokemon runners also do similar stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCoQm8bIyyw).
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Well, they write in the registers by *playing the game*. It's really fascinating. [Check out this video (rudimentary knowledge of programming recommended)](https://youtu.be/14wqBA5Q1yc)"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,It's not impressive to modify the games code by hand just by playing the game in order to beat it in a stupidly low time? I'd say it's pretty damn impressive.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Glitches tend to be much, much harder to pull of than beating the game without them. If you prefer glitchless runs those also exist."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Generally whether a certain community prefers to allow glitches in their runs or not is just up to that community of people that run it. It varies a lot from game to game what the most popular category of run is.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Awesome explanation thank you
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,It says 2014 for the code. So I'm assuming pong and snake were not part of the game when released and was later added in 2014? Would be cool to see on a snes.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"This is what I like about the community.  You can have speed runs, glitch speed runs, Tool Assisted Speed Runs, it's all great stuff to push the limits of games.  "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,The SMW glitch have actually been done manually for some time. The top speed runners are not bothering with most of the levels and are just writing code to the memory to go to the end game scene.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,You are welcome.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Pong is not even in the game. People wrote their own Pong game and inserted it into the game. That is what makes it so cool. This should in theory work on an actual SNES. Although as far as I am aware only the credits code execution has been done on a real SNES by hand. It just a normal Mario game. One that happens to be exploitable to run any code they want.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Miyamoto probably looked at Fallon's desk like *""I'm gonna measure the shit out of that.""*  "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,They all look so damn chill. 
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Miyamoto has lived one hell of life. Looks like he enjoys every second of it
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Is there anything entertainment related that Miyamoto can't do?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Can't believe this wasn't already posted. Lead rapper of the Roots rapping about mario on Jimmy Fallon a few years ago

[Blackthought's hard-af mario rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P24hxeBq7g0)
apologies for the quality, i know a better one exists but cant find it

Edit: The first cut off lyric is Shigeru Miyamoto ! Super dissapointing its not included in this mirror"
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I appreciate that Fallon didn't go overboard with this one. He just let the music play.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"HOLY SMOKES this makes me happy. 

I know everyone has their video game memories....but I was in 8th grade when I got the NES. I lived out in the country with a depressed mother and a sister who hid in her room nonstop. 

Super Mario was the BEST. I played it 8 hours the first day I had it...and nonstop the next few years. 

That song is maybe the happiest sound on planet Earth. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Where's Koji Kondo?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Did anybody else notice they practically muted Miyamoto's guitar?  
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"""Play free bird!"""

The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"https://youtu.be/mzET_0VR0w4?t=67

Here's Miyamoto playing again, apparently he also plays the Sitar and Banjo."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"It's crazy to me that the Tonight Show, which is as mainstream as it gets, played the Super Mario Bros. theme. When I was growing up in the 90s, only ""nerds"" played video games. How times have changed."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Awesome. Is there an interview with him too in this show?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,The Roots really are one of the best live bands ever.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,[with lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_WFwbOg6N0)
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Guys QuestLove's in the house 
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"It looked like Miyamoto's guitar wasn't plugged in or mic'd up. I couldn't hear his guitar at all, but it looks like he has excellent technique! I wish I could hear how he was playing it. "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"That was incredibly satisfying. 

Glad Fallon didn't ruin it with some ott shenanigans "
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,"Miyamoto is  better and more influential in his field than Einstein, Paul McCartney  and Michael Jordan put together. It's like he invented the theory of relativity, the slam dunk and rock and roll. Then stuck around for another thirty years to advise Stephen Hawking, LeBron and Maynard. He is on my top five list of people to have dinner with, living or dead. I would not be surprised if there is a religion called Miyamotoism that embraces the ideals of play and creativity 200 years from now. What agreat, interesting person."
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,The man is an absolute legend. 
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Miyamoto is still the best!
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Does he age?
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Seems Nintendo are really on the ball with Switch promotion so far. Hopefully they can keep the hype up until March and avoid another Wii U situation.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,really need to hear world 1-2 music now
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I hope that at least one of those musicians is geeking out internally by playing the Mario Bros theme with Miyamoto on stage.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,fallon wins this round
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,I thought it was the japanese Roots band.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Well I think I speak for everyone one I say that this was one musical collaborations nobody expected.
The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,Wouldn't of been epic if the roots dressed in Mario theme costumes

Apocalypse - World War II,"It’s incredible the amount of actors they had in the series that was either well known or have become well known over the years. 

The same could be said for the pacific, but with Band of brothers it’s way more."
Apocalypse - World War II,Lt. Spears when he ran back.
Apocalypse - World War II,Ron Livingston was fucking golden
Apocalypse - World War II,My Great Uncle Brad Freeman is the last living enlisted member of the Band of Brothers. [He was just honored by the National WWII Museum](https://usveteransmagazine.com/2022/03/museum-honors-surviving-members-band-brothers/).
Apocalypse - World War II,I think people sleep on how good Donnie Wahlberg was in this.
Apocalypse - World War II,"While Michael Fassbender was definitely in it his role was pretty minimal and he basically disappears after the first episode. I don't think you see him again until episode 7. 

If anything James McAvoy has a much more memorable appearance in his only episode.

Still my favorite miniseries ever. I think only Chernobyl comes close."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Welp, guess I'm rewatching Band of Brothers now."
Apocalypse - World War II,[deleted]
Apocalypse - World War II,"This miniseries more than anything else I’ve watched captures so well that sense of marching through hell, witnessing so much horror and then it’s all over and what now? Sell insurance I guess. 🤷‍♂️ 

What a mindfuck that transition must be."
Apocalypse - World War II,">Following the brigade known as ""The Easy Company""

There is so, so much wrong with that phrase."
Apocalypse - World War II,"I watch Band of Brothers around every Christmas. One of my favorite series, that and The Sopranos."
Apocalypse - World War II,Can’t wait to see if they strike gold again with “master of the air”
Apocalypse - World War II,Awesome series…The Pacific was amazing as well. Generation Kill comes in third for me.
Apocalypse - World War II,David Schwimmer acted his ass off.
Apocalypse - World War II,The saddest scene I may have ever witnessed on TV is when they first find and enter the concentration camp. That has stuck with me like nothing Ive seen. Humans can really fucking suck sometimes.
Apocalypse - World War II,Greatest ww2 movie or show ever made.
Apocalypse - World War II,"""The Easy Company""

How many other people facepalmed over that one?"
Apocalypse - World War II,", but *not* Connor Ratliff."
Apocalypse - World War II,"I end up rewatching it every few years - still holds up, and some of the best TV!"
Apocalypse - World War II,"One of the best pieces of TV ever made.

Watching episode 7 with a surround sound system is incredible."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Greatest 10 episodes of anything in television history, bar none. I can’t believe it’s been over 20 years. I vividly remember my dad having 8 year old me and my brothers stay up and watch it with him when it first premiered"
Apocalypse - World War II,"""The Easy Company""....

&#x200B;

It was ""Easy Company"" as in E Company. Easy being ""E"" in the military phonetic alphabet at the time. It wasn't a nickname.

&#x200B;

...Also, it was a Company. A ""Brigade"" is its own thing.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I know it sounds pedantic, but I don't know how you can claim to understand the show in any capacity if you get that basic detail wrong. Like, Easy Company and it's general structure and culture is critical to the show."
Apocalypse - World War II,CURRAHEE!!!!!!
Apocalypse - World War II,This and the pacific were absolutely amazing
Apocalypse - World War II,That show made me take history class seriously.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Just did a Memorial weekend re-watch.

Still shocking how many future great actors were just bit parts in this thing. 

Also *""Bastogne""* is easily one of the best episodes in the history of television."
Apocalypse - World War II,And Steve from American Dad
Apocalypse - World War II,"The greatest miniseries ever IMO. I watch it at least twice a year and it never gets old. The cast was amazing, but my favorite parts are the segments with the men of Easy Company recalling the stories. Now they’re all gone. I would love to see more miniseries like this and am looking forward to Spielberg and Hanks new on ‘Masters Of The Air.’"
Apocalypse - World War II,"""Grandpa were you a hero in the war?"" gets me EVERY TIME."
Apocalypse - World War II,Really an amazing mini-series! Stayed true to the book very well too.
Apocalypse - World War II,"I finally got around to watching Band of Brothers last year... It was an amazing thing to watch, I was kicking myself for waiting so long to watch it.

I followed it up by watching The Pacific right after which I had not seen either.

I still have not seen Saving Private Ryan yet :("
Apocalypse - World War II,Looks like it's time for my yearly rewatch
Apocalypse - World War II,"Hot take: while everyone was great, Donnie Wahlberg had the best performance"
Apocalypse - World War II,Watching this series as a teen definitely played a roll in my decision to go airborne infantry in the army. This series is amazing all around.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Simon Pegg had a longer role than Fassbender. Hell, 99% of the Germans had longer roles than him."
Apocalypse - World War II,I grew up seeing Bill Guarnere and Babe Hefron on my neighborhood. Knew they were vets but had no idea about them until this show. They were really nice guys.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Company. Not a brigade.
Company is approximately ~144 men. A brigade is more like ~2,000-4000 men
I don’t even think we used brigades in world war 2. Still on the regimental system is. 506 Reg 101st Airborne Div"
Apocalypse - World War II,"Ron Livingston- Best know for Office Space.

Who the fuck is rob livingston?"
Apocalypse - World War II,I watched it again on Memorial Day. It’s one of those programs that I can watch over and over again.
Apocalypse - World War II,"I adore both BoB and The Pacific. Still waiting for that third show from these two tho.

During quarantine I read ""With the old breed"" by Eugene Sledge, such a fine read!"
Apocalypse - World War II,Y'all listen to the [excellent HBO podcast](https://www.hbo.com/band-of-brothers/podcast) if you haven't.  Fascinating listen.
Apocalypse - World War II,How did the title get it wrong and refer to the company as a brigage when they also refer to it as a company in the title?
Apocalypse - World War II,"The Bastogne episode that focuses on the medic is one of my favorite episodes of TV ever, it’s so well done."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Saying this features Michael Fassbender is like saying it features James McAvoy or Jimmy Fallon...I mean yeah, it does but they're barely in it."
Apocalypse - World War II,"20 years ago, wtf. Man I am getting old."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Best thing on tv then, best thing on tv now."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Watched it at Xmas, usually do sometime every year. Still a fantastic show and a massive achievement in its scale and how good the characters are. Think I might wait a year or two before watching it again though to keep it feeling fresh, The Pacific as well"
Apocalypse - World War II,Lots of great moments to choose from but Lt Speirs running through the Germans in Foy to get a message to another company and then running back will always be my favorite.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Why We Fight remains to be one of the most powerful episodes of TV I’ve ever seen tbh. The show itself is great, they just really made a point with that episode."
Apocalypse - World War II,"I would love for HBO to do at least one more war miniseries. Korea, Vietnam, WWI. I'll take another WWII series, why not?"
Apocalypse - World War II,Where the hell are they now? Livingston really didn’t land anywhere.
Apocalypse - World War II,Rob? Ron?
Apocalypse - World War II,"A young, slim Tom Hardy looting and rooting."
Apocalypse - World War II,My favorite miniseries ever. To me it’s unparalleled
Apocalypse - World War II,Band of brothers is one of the best shows I’ve ever watched. I don’t own a lot of physical copies of movies/shows but band of brothers is one of the few.
Apocalypse - World War II,Between this and generation kill. Some of the best military shows ever produced. Watched band of brothers 3 times still worth a re watch
Apocalypse - World War II,"this is, in my opinion, STILL one of the best series ever made."
Apocalypse - World War II,Masterful show. Still holds up after 20 year. Must watch for all Americans IMO.
Apocalypse - World War II,I read the book last year and it was even better
Apocalypse - World War II,In the top 5 best shows of all time
Apocalypse - World War II,"> For Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, 1998’s Saving Private Ryan marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration focused on World War II epics. After that film won five Oscars, they teamed up on a wartime drama for the small screen. It would be HBO’s “most expensive miniseries,” with a budget in the realm of $120 million, THR reported.


> Band of Brothers, a 13-hour dramatization of Stephen Ambrose’s best-seller, followed a brigade of World War II soldiers known as “The Easy Company,” a regiment within the Army’s 101st Airborne Division. Each episode opened with audio testimony from a real veteran of the brigade before focusing on a member of the ensemble cast as they prepared for war and entered the field. David Schwimmer, at the height of his Friends fame, was joined by a group of relative newcomers including Damian Lewis in the central role of Lt. Winters, Scott Grimes, Matthew Leitch, Ron Livingston and Michael Fassbender. (Hanks served as executive producer with Spielberg and directed the fifth of the 10 episodes, but did not have a speaking role.)"
Apocalypse - World War II,"Amazing acting, amazing writing, amazing storytelling and pacing. Wonderful music. All around a classic series.

Also a surprisingly scene-stealing turn from David Schwimmer?!"
Apocalypse - World War II,"My buddy is a marine raider, he’s deployed right now. His wife put a bunch of his shit on the curb for people to take. I took it all, band of brothers disk set all his college lacrosse shit, fixie bike etc. he’s gonna be pump when I bring him a 12er and all his shit back he thought was long gone"
Apocalypse - World War II,In the Top 5 greatest TV shows of all time
Apocalypse - World War II,This series is still the greatest thing I’ve ever watched on tv.
Apocalypse - World War II,One of the best series ever produced and that stands the test of time. Each time I watch it is as great as the first.
Apocalypse - World War II,One of my favourite shows ever.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Not ""The Easy Company"" just ""Easy Company"""
Apocalypse - World War II,Fun fact: Michael Fassbender is racing in the 24h of Le Mans right now
Apocalypse - World War II,"I am emotional in a lot of movies, and I have always been sensitive to the horrors of the holocaust. I did not know about episode nine when I started the series, and good lord did it break me. I was quietly crying for about 30 minutes. Incredible show that is more moving (imo) than a lot of other WW2 content."
Apocalypse - World War II,The goat HBO show
Apocalypse - World War II,Oh yeah I like band of brothers too. Like Hansen or the Jonas one.
Apocalypse - World War II,It’s *Ron Livingston. Just feel the proper credit is due. After all he’s the star of Office Space as well another cult classic like the aforementioned series.
Apocalypse - World War II,The Pacific was good as well. Don’t see as much love for that series much
Apocalypse - World War II,One of the best shows of all time
Apocalypse - World War II,"He was an ass, which really tells you how good of an actor he was there"
Apocalypse - World War II,Masters of the Air when????
Apocalypse - World War II,Always gotta get a rewatch in at least once a year!
Apocalypse - World War II,Still upset they never made a northa africa/Italy mini series
Apocalypse - World War II,"If it were locked up in a vault and then released this year, it would still sweep up The Emmys easily this year. The production quality is simply unreal."
Apocalypse - World War II,For whatever reason most WW2 movies tend to do a better job then most modern movies especially the Marvel franchise.
Apocalypse - World War II,Some of the best television to ever air.
Apocalypse - World War II,"A man who was with the 101st gave a talk at the firehouse about ten years ago. He was fantastic. I still remember some of the anecdotes but the most amazing was about Bastogne, being so spent that he and his foxhole companion woke up in the morning next to a huge hole in the ground a few yards away. They had slept right through the hit.

He got a standing ovation from the crowd and there wasn't one dry eye."
Apocalypse - World War II,Based on how much screen time he gets you’d be forgiven if you didn’t remember Fassbender in it
Apocalypse - World War II,"And Michael Fassbender. Lol dude was not a major part at all. Jimmy Fallon was also in BoB. Give more credit to the actors who actually deserve it. And if you need a popular name to push your article then use David Schwimmer, he crushed his role and his character was significant to the story."
Apocalypse - World War II,"Such a good mini series but this article seemed weak. So much more could have been written.

Edit: hbo did a 20th anniversary podcast which was great."
Apocalypse - World War II,It's a masterpiece. If you haven't watched it before. Get it now. And watch it
Apocalypse - World War II,"And tom hardy, and jimmy fallon, and david schwimmer, and simon pegg, and donnie wahlberg"
Apocalypse - World War II,I have the ten DVD box set. Can never bring myself to sell it off. And I don’t own a DVD player.
Apocalypse - World War II,Bacon sandwich
Apocalypse - World War II,ROB lovingstone was amazing in this.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Michael Fassbender was in like 4 scenes and spoke in 2....out of a 10 part mini series. 

Should've name dropped David Schwimmer."
Apocalypse - World War II,Rewatch every year.
Apocalypse - World War II,It’s Ron Livingston not Rob.
Apocalypse - World War II,Thanks for reminding me I need to do my annual watch for 2022
Apocalypse - World War II,"I’m his later years, Sobel ended up shooting himself in a suicide attempt. His attempt failed and he only blinded himself. He later died in a VA nursing home. Alone."
Apocalypse - World War II,"""Easy Company"" was a company sized element, not a brigade. A few companies make up a battalion, a few battalions make up a brigade. Just fyi. And yes I understand the term could have been used as the alternate definition of brigade, but just stating."
Apocalypse - World War II,Episode 9 “Why We Fight” is one of the single greatest pieces of media ever created.
Apocalypse - World War II,"Damian Lewis is such a solid, understated actor. Brilliant as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall. I didn't even recognize him in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
Apocalypse - World War II,"My dad loved watching this. Now that I’ve gone through the series a couple times, it’s one of my favorites."
Wallander,"
>* When the older brother is finally released, the younger brother decides it would be a great idea to fill him in on what really happened.  But the girl is psychic.  She knows what he intends to do, and where he'll be. 

I assume he must've told her he was going to tell his brother. I don't think she knew where he was going to be but the army guy followed him and when he saw him go to the club then he knew he had an opening."
Wallander,"The second season was subpar compared to the first, lots of nonsensical plot holes.... pity, I enjoyed all the Wallander iterations over the years and this had potential."
Wallander,Thanks for saving me from watching anymore. I’m on episode 2 and was curious if it gets better. Sounds like no.  I cannot understand how a human mind actually writes this shit
Wallander,Partially through this drek. How did Soren know where the detective lives?
Wallander,I really enjoyed the first season. But season 2 just didn’t make any sense
Wallander, I wonder if he is smarter than Young Sheldon. It's too bad this one wasn't set in the past like the novels it may have allowed for it to be unique.
Wallander,This is good news! I enjoyed the last Young Wallander.
Wallander,Love the Branagh series -have not seen the others
Wallander,"I've watched the Krister Henriksson (Swedish) series and the Kenneth Branagh (English) series. I thought both were excellent but I preferred the English series. The English series is much more artful, almost like a series of films (I challenge anyone who says they were not gripped by the opening scene in the first episode). In contrast, the Swedish series is more of a typical crime drama. That being said I would still recommend watching both because Henriksson is great as Kurt 

I started the first book but didn't get into it, so I can't comment on how accurate the shows are as adaptations."
Wallander,"I’ve watched both the Swedish tv series and the Branagh series. I liked them both, but preferred the Branagh series. The Branagh series, due to it being shorter, does a better job at telling a story and keeping it suspenseful; While the Swedish series is more of a typical crime drama. That being said Krister Henriksson does a fantastic job as Wallander and is still worth a watch"
Wallander,As others said the Branagh version is very good.
Wallander,Am I the only one here who loved the Swedish series and absolutely could not get into the British?
Wallander,I loved the Branagh series and hated the Swedish series.
Wallander,The Kenneth Branagh series is one of my all time favourite tv shows and just to point out that Kenneth Branagh won back to back best actor baftas for his portrayal of Kurt Wallander.
Wallander,"If you just want to dive in and get a feel for the character and the stories, I'd suggest the Branagh series. Its perfect for people who are new to the Nordic Noir genre and want to get into Wallander after having watched, say, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie starring Daniel Craig.

The Swedish language film series is probably the most faithful to the original books (since it was filmed during and shortly after the books were released) though Lassgard's Wallander takes a little getting used to, especially if you've got Branagh in mind. The later films in this series are a bit slicker and fast-paced...the earlier ones are more like TV miniseries and can be a bit slow (which reflects the pacing of the novels).

I've only watched a couple of episodes of the Swedish TV series and its a different animal altogether. It adapts a couple of the later novels, but otherwise it comprises of original stories with the same characters, and has a lot more focus on Wallander's daughter Linda. Think of it as a kind of continuation of the novels."
Wallander,Loved Wallander(Branagh) & wanted more.
Wallander,"That's exactly what I came to say -and Branagh's is only 4 seasons, 3 episodes per, so you don't need to invest a whole ton of time to watch it. But it's worth every minute, afaic."
Wallander,"Very nice! thanks. 

what about them movies? I heard they were shite. But some say its alright"
Wallander,"It helps that the Branagh series is actually based on the Henning Mankell books, while the Henriksson series is mostly original stories (though it adapts a couple of the books)."
Wallander,This really late but I prefer the Swedish series also.
Wallander,I believe even Swedish people prefer the Branagh Series.
Wallander,It also has Tom Hiddleston.
Wallander,Unfortunatly I haven't seen them yet. I also heard that they weren't very good so I decided not to check them out.
Wallander,"That's interesting. Why is that? Bigger budget, better actors, better direction?"
Wallander,"Alright, sounds like a good advice. Would watch the Swedish & English versions!"
Wallander,Yeah all of it really. From my understanding the Swedish series is more like Law & Order where the British Series is like True Detective.
Wallander,"I wouldn't say it's quite like Law and Order, definitely more of a crime drama though"
Wallander,"Veronica Mars?

House if you include medical mysteries"
Wallander,"American Vandal was a good one, then they canceled it."
Wallander,"I love all the HBO miniseries (The Night Of, Mare of Easttown, The Undoing, etc.) but Sharp Objects sticks with me the most."
Wallander,Season one of true detective
Wallander,Broadchurch
Wallander,Psych. It looks like SUCH a fun show to have been on
Wallander,Mare of Easttown was incredible.
Wallander,Only Murders in the Building.
Wallander,Twin Peaks....Who killed Laura Palmer?
Wallander,The Killing(US). Midsomer Murders and Columbo for the old school kind of murder mystery experience
Wallander,Murderville
Wallander,"After party 
Was really really fun"
Wallander,"Veronica Mars, Season 1."
Wallander,The Killing
Wallander,"i actually loved only murders in the building, thought it’d be terrible but was delighted by it. also white lotus is maybe my favorite series currently"
Wallander,Dirk Gently's Hollistic Detective Agency
Wallander,"British murder mysteries/whodunits are so good. Huge fan of Midsomer Murders, Father Brown, Jonathan Creek, Poirot, Shakespeare & Hathaway basically anything on Britbox."
Wallander,the bridge (the swedish/danish one) is the best show i've ever seen.
Wallander,"Poirot is the best I agree, a great combination of clues and presentation, but there are some other good ones:

* Jonathon Creek - Kind of a ""cryptic whodunnit"" in that the essence of what you need to unpick the mystery is usually laid out very early on, but you really need to think outside the box to get it before they give you all the clues.
* Morse/Lewis - Less so about the ""whodunnit"" aspect as sometimes key clues aren't revealed until late in a show, but they're just so relaxing and nice to watch - more about following the journey.
* Columbo - Working backwards from knowing the answer (sometimes not fully, but massively narrowed down) to how Columbo will work it out is a really great twist to the genre, and wonderfully presented.
* Castle - This feels kind of like a meta-show in that it plays on knowledge of other shows to throw you off which I like.  It's a bit of a mixed bag as there's so many epsiodes - some are really well thought out and have everything you need up front early, but others can be just follow-along (like House, but not to the same degree)."
Wallander,Columbo and Murder she wrote.
Wallander,"Harper’s island isn’t the best but it was a cool concept, ahead of its time with a great story and set-up for the anthology trend which came later.

Highly recommend a watch!"
Wallander,Wallander
Wallander,"Vera is really good. And Shetland, by the same author. There is also a fun mystery starring Lucy Lawless called My Life Is Murder."
Wallander,"Monk and Psych.

Still wishing for an official crossover."
Wallander,Murderville
Wallander,"Poirot is also my favorite! The most recent miniseries of And Then There Were None was very good. 

If you like British whodunnits/detective procedurals, Inspector Lewis is fun. I like Endeavour as well."
Wallander,"Just watched ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" and while you kinda know who did it by episode 4 the whole series was damn good in my opinion."
Wallander,Columbo is pretty great.
Wallander,"I really enjoyed seasons 1, 2, *not 3*, and 4 of **The Sinner**.


What’s fascinating, is you’ll know “whodunnit”. But the mystery becomes “WHY did they dunnit”. And the answer is always complex and interesting.
Except for season 3. That one dropped the ball.


The unfortunate thing is that elements from s3 are present in s4. You might feel a tad lost if you skip it. But it’s worth it because 4 was a total return to form."
Wallander,"Monk

Criminal Minds

Watching Midsomar Murders now"
Wallander,Japanese show The Files of Young Kindaichi.
Wallander,Just watched Murder She Wrote for the first time and loved it. Angela Lansbury is an icon and the show was ahead of its time. Also fun to see all the guest stars back when they were young
Wallander,"I always liked the detective shows from the 70s the best. Maybe it was vintage cars. Out of the dozens from that time my two favorites were #1 Rockford Files. #2 Barnaby Jones (How can you go wrong with Jed Clampett and Catwoman solving crimes?) 

For post 2000, I'd go with the Mentalist. (Cho!)

Honorable mentions: Tony Shaloub was amazing as Monk and Murder She Wrote is underrated and Columbo as many have said is a ""how solve it."" I'm going to have to watch more Psych to see where it firs."
Wallander,Fargo- you know whodunnit first episode but the unraveling is so much fun!
Wallander,Broadchurch (UK version obviously)
Wallander,I enjoyed Only Murders in the Building
Wallander,The Night Of. Now that's a whodunnit
Wallander, Top of the Lake
Wallander,The Mentalist or Life.  Both are amazing.
Wallander,S1 of Veronica Mars
Wallander,"The Rockford Files. 

Because once in a while Isaac Hayes, Louis Gossett Jr. or Rita Moreno would show up and that is a whole lot of badass."
Wallander,"First, Elementary with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu is a Sherlock Holmes series. It’s kind of “meta” if you will. Jonny’s Sherlock is way different than any other, but still feels like Sherlock. 

Also, C.B. Strike on HBO. It’s based off the Cormoran Strike books that J.K. Rowling wrote. Hopefully that doesn’t dissuade you. Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger do an excellent job. I think it’s originally from BBC, typical mini-series episode seasons. This post actually made me look up and see that they just aired a new season but it’s not on HBO yet."
Wallander,Veronica Mars. Loved how it built an overall season narrative through individual episodes.
Wallander,"Diagnosis murder. 

Fight me."
Wallander,Does Murder in Successville/Murderville count?
Wallander,"Dammit Jim, she's a writer, not a murderer!

It's Murder, She Wrote. It's comfort TV."
Wallander,"My multi-rewatches:

* Jonathan Creek
* Shakespeare and Hathaway
* Death in Paradise
* Poirot
* Marple
* other Christie minis/movies: Crooked House, And Then There Were None
* Veronica Mars
* American Vandal
* Murder She Wrote
* Broadchurch
* Harper's Island
* Scream: The Series
* Miss Scarlet and the Duke
* and then in the non-fiction/true crime space: Dateline, Homicide Hunter, A Crime to Remember"
Wallander,BBC Sherlock
Wallander,Matlock. Getting to the final witness of each episode and the summation is like listening to the ending of “Someone Saved My Life Tonight.” I find it immensely satisfying.
Wallander,The head
Wallander,The Missing. both seasons are so good.
Wallander,Veronica Mars has already been mentioned a bunch so I’ll say Bad Sisters is pretty good. I kind of wish it was a one and done season but I guess they’re making a second season.
Wallander,Veronica Mars.
Wallander,"Sherlock

(my favorite that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere yet)"
Wallander,"Elementary has some truly great episodes, way more than bad ones"
Wallander,"Monk, Psych, and Big Little Lies"
Wallander,Jonathan Creek. Fun for its really elaborate murder mystery. The main character is a professional designer of stage magicians tricks and usually helps out a journalist who gets involved trying to solve impossible murders. Stars Alan Davis.
Wallander,PSYCH
Wallander,"Harper's Island was one of the first ones I'd seen and watched it live. I loved the concepts it had and the idea of a big cast of characters dying one by one. While it wasn't perfect, it was good enough for me"
Wallander,Shetland. More of a police drama than a “who done it”. Powerfully beautiful landscape and stoic Scottish detectives. What could be better?
Wallander,"The Killing is a very dark, extremely underrated show.  The entire first 2 seasons follow a single murder case, and the main duo have such good chemistry."
Wallander,I used to love Ellery Queen back in the day.
Wallander,"No one judge me but Scream Queens??

It was way too ridiculous and so much fun. They made fun of most horror tropes."
Wallander,"The Mentalist- who is Red John

Pretty Little Liars- 5 seasons to piece together a 24 hour window."
Wallander,Line of Duty is so so so gripping
Wallander,At the time I really liked Castle
Wallander,There was this short lived show called Ellery Queen Mysteries in the seventies. I was in my early teens at that time and I liked it a lot.
Wallander,Currently loving Three Pines on Amazon Prime Video
Wallander,"Bloodline, first season."
Wallander,Sharp Objects. The only one of this type of show that left me and my girlfriend truly stunned with the reveal
Wallander,"""The night of"" on HBO"
Wallander,Only Murders in the Building. Both seasons are perfection.
Wallander,When I was little I loved watching Midsomer Murders with my mom.
Weeds,"Shameless, Dexter and Weeds were such high points in Showtimes programming, such original and awesome shows. Only issue was they all went too long, but originally they were amazing."
Weeds,"I think the issue is that once everyone dropped cable nobody knew it existed. I just got a year for 99 cents a month, which I took as a sign of desperation."
Weeds,Showtime should just be a “channel” on Paramount+. Similar to how IFC and Shudder are channels on AMC+. I dunno why high paid marketing execs have to make such a mess of things.
Weeds,I will always love showtime because they had the cajones to bring Queer as Folk to an American audience.
Weeds,Homeland was brilliant.
Weeds,Showtime has made a ton of great stuff. A lot of my favorites.
Weeds,"This is certainly yet another sign of the end of the *golden age* of television. We're drifting back to a world where everything is consolidated into a handful of corporate entities (not too unlike the big 3 networks), and where drone-like execs make all the decisions and override anything not mainstream enough."
Weeds,Showtime gave us Twin Peaks S3 which is still the pinnacle of Peak/Golden Age TV.
Weeds,Dexter!
Weeds,Dead Like Me (movie excluded) will always be top-tier television for me.  While I hate that it was canned I am glad it never out out-stayed its welcome.
Weeds,For me it's hard to commit to a Showtime series. Usually start off great but I never want 8 or 9 seasons of anything.
Weeds,"I'm not sure it's a mistake to get rid of the Showtime brand. It's a brand I associate with reaching for greatness, but stopping just short of it."
Weeds,"Too many networks, too many streaming services, too many shows. Anyone else feeling extreme 'media overload' these days?"
Weeds,Showtimes app is god awful.  The worst of the streaming bunch 100%.  Fucking crashes all the time.  Doesn’t save my info for some reason.  I have to do like a 3 step verification every time I log in.  I have it and don’t even use it because of that.
Weeds,"Will this lead to an increase in television series in other streaming services being released on CD/Blu-Ray as well? Only if customers demand it.

It’s probably too late for the Showtime back catalogue as Paramount owns it now. Foolish maneuver on their part. Don’t they know how many people re-watch their favourite shows?"
Weeds,"Currently watching season 2 of Your Honor, I did not think there was a need for a season 2 but it is really good so far. I am old school, my wife works for a big tech tele-communication co. So we are locked in with the almost super premium cable package at a reasonable price. I hate streaming. To me it sucks. Amazon drives me crazy, trying to find something to watch or having to get a new app to watch a free show or movie. I like channel surfing. If I find something I might like I DVR it or find it on demand. Simplicity, no passwords etc. I have Netflix but use that through my PS3, surprised they haven’t taken that from me too. I don’t have a smart TV by the way and don’t want one. 

Goodbye Showtime you will be missed."
Weeds,What's the point of having fuck you money if you never say 'fuck you'.
Weeds,"Are there actually any good Showtime shows, from beginning to end? Dexter and Weeds both turned awful, and IMO Homeland was a mess from the start."
Weeds,"I enjoyed Weeds throughout, but there were definitely some weaker seasons."
Weeds,Dexter’s fourth season is absolutely fantastic.
Weeds,At one point Showtime seemed poised to equal HBO as a prestige cable network. Then it just kinda whimpered away
Weeds,"This comment just made me realize that both weeds and dexter are both showtime and from the same period. 

They are the 2 shows i have rewatched the most and i will always go back to them. Just something about them that makes it so chill to watch"
Weeds,"It’s different in other countries. In Canada Showtime and HBO are bundled together in a service called, ‘Crave’. Therefore it’s on more of an equal footing. It doesn’t appear as a second tier to HBO. It just has a slightly different focus. 

Like the article stated, Showtime was responsible for Weeds, Homeland, Nurse Jackie, United States of Tara, etc. Too many female-led productions?  And queer content like The L Word and Queer as Folk. Too minority focused? But there’s Dexter, Masters of Sex and Shameless. Dexter’s recent re-boot was incredibly successful. End of an era I guess."
Weeds,That was the canary in the coal mine for sure.
Weeds,I had it for 99¢ for three years or so. I got a promo back in the PS Vue days and they never removed it.
Weeds,It is dead. They are going to axe all the programming executives and stop making future Showtime shows. No need for a Showtime tab if it is not going to be generating new content beyond current seasons of Yellowjackets and Billions.
Weeds,"Because they have to ""shake"" things up to make it seem like they have new ideas and a fresh take. When it's really just recycled bullshit they do from job to job"
Weeds,"Yup! 

We’re about to come full circle but likely without the opportunity to ‘own’ any of the content we want to re-watch. No more releases on VHS, DVD or even digital (e.g, iTunes).

This has been a long time coming. Television shows are going to be just like SaaS (Software as a Service). Monthly fees to access what they want us to view not necessarily what we want to see."
Weeds,Agreed!
Weeds,"I think all the scenes with George and her family actually work, it's everything else that's awful. Like I legit want someone to just cut Joy Reggie and Georgia into a fancut version of the movie, that would be fine for me."
Weeds,Same
Weeds,"I always thought they managed to achieve greatness, then blow past it with four more shitty, unnecessary seasons."
Weeds,"The problem where I live (Canada) is access. We have ‘versions of’ Netflix, Amazon Prime, Paramount+, Disney+ in that the catalogue is not the same. What you have available in the US we do not necessarily have in Canada due to licensing agreements. Also cable channels like History, National Geographic, etc. have shows that are not available in here either. It’s very frustrating to see a show listed on r/television only  to  find  out  it‘s  not  available here.  I’m  sure  other  countries outside  the  US  have  the  same  problem."
Weeds,"Because it was so bad I just used it through Amazon Prime Video. The Amazon app wasn't great, looked ugly as hell before the revamp, but it at least works."
Weeds,They have the exact streaming numbers right down to when and where you watched those Showtime favourites. That is the data advantage of streaming.
Weeds,"I miss Justin Kirk on my TV. Succession totally teased him, but it was just a one-off :(

Edit: JK (pun intended) - he’ll be back in the new season!"
Weeds,"1-4 were solid. Then it went haywire.

But that's Jenji Kohan's calling card, strong starts turning completely silly. It's like she stops giving a shit. Same happened to Orange is the New Black."
Weeds,"Weeds and Dexter I continued watching the last season out of habit. But both show I skipped the finale. I couldn't bring myself to watch that last episode of either, I just never cared so little about anything else like that before."
Weeds,"Jenji Kohan and not knowing how to stick the landing, name a more iconic duo"
Weeds,I was only disappointed the story line of them growing the the California forest ended immediately. Like that could have made a great season side plot.
Weeds,"1, 2 and 4 have such a special feeling for me and I honestly LOVED the new one until the ending"
Weeds,HBO will let a show end and meanwhile showtime will run it into the ground
Weeds,"Both of those shows, hell all of them would probably just become P+ exclusives

I’m more amazed that Paramount Network still exists. I figured Viacom would have shelled out top dollar to buy back the Yellowstone rights for P+ and shutter PN."
Weeds,"Stupid of them to kill a well known brand. Sounds like a CEO’s bright idea, as marketing should know better."
Weeds,I strongly doubt we're going to lose physical releases or the ability to buy digital copies anytime soon.  That's just another revenue stream for studios on top of streaming.
Weeds,Why would studios turn the down the opportunity to make $30-50 a season for people who want to buy it? You can buy a lot shows that the streamers put out themselves already.
Weeds,"FWIW, Canada's Disney+ catalogue is bigger than the States because we also get Star, which is essentially Hulu."
Weeds,"In terms of data collection a re-watch while streaming on their service provides a company with data. But not when you’re re-watching your own copy.

Edit: clarification"
Weeds,He was so good in Weeds. Not sure I’ve even seen him in anything else.
Weeds,"He's in the Perry Mason reboot, plays a lawyer"
Weeds,[deleted]
Weeds,">But that's Jenji Kohan's calling card, strong starts turning completely silly

I mean, isn't that true for most showrunners? The only showrunners this doesn't apply to seem to be the ones who don't do tv shows with many seasons."
Weeds,"Weeds finale isn’t great, but it has some pathos that works. Never saw Dexter."
Weeds,"Agreed!!! We don’t talk about f*ve, s*x or e*ght. Seven ain’t bad tho."
Weeds,"And 3 was fine. Definitely not as good as 1,2&4, but better than 5-8."
Weeds,They actually own Paramount Network. The problem is they sold the out of season streaming rights to Yellowstone to Peacock years ago. They have since admitted that was a dumb decision.
Weeds,"> I figured Viacom would have shelled out top dollar to buy back the Yellowstone rights for P+ and shutter PN.

given the Yellowstone demo, it's probably wiser to have it on the linear tv."
Weeds,"It’s been discussed on this forum (and others like r/Bluray)  that  fewer  television shows  are  being  released  on  physical  media.  Also  Apple  has already stated  that  it  can  remove  your  access  to  anything  you  buy  on  iTunes.   According  to  their  new  terms  of  service  agreement  you  don't  own  it.  You’re  just  renting  it meaning they can remove it at any time.  Now  they  might  not do this  but  the  threat  is  still  there.

Edit: fixed autocorrect"
Weeds,"Not for much longer…physical media are disappearing and access to electronic media can be revoked at any time. I think sales dropped on physical copies because people thought they’d always have access to their favourite shows on streaming.   


I don’t know anyone who still has a DVD/Blu-Ray player. For me personally it’s been years since I’ve wanted my own copy of show/film."
Weeds,"He was a lead in the HBO miniseries Angels in America. It is fantastic. MLP plays a main character in it, too! They only have one brief (magical) interaction, though."
Weeds,He was in an episode of You're The Worst. Was cool seeing him pop up.
Weeds,Officially on my list now (as if Matthew Rhys wasn’t reason enough).
Weeds,"I think the presidential election will be a pretty big storyline in Succession this season, and I really hope Justin Kirk and Stephen Root play a big role in it. In the political convention episode last season they focused a lot on establishing Kirk's character, who would fit very well into that universe, and for Root my thinking is that they wouldn't have brought him in to not really do much in that one episode. He played a political consultant very well on the West Wing, I would love to see him do something similar on Succession."
Weeds,"Yeah I think Kohan's biggest fault is that she just doesn't know when to say enough is enough and just end a show, rather than accepting never-ending renewals until everybody's sick of it."
Weeds,"To an extent, maybe. But she should wrap it up before ruining her show.   

A good showrunner know went to call it and start wrapping up."
Weeds,Yeah the Weeds finale was one of the few bright spots of those last seasons. Provided some really good closure for the main characters and didn't really leave any loose ends. I was pretty happy with it overall.
Weeds,"I've seen both. Weeds finale is fine, doesn't ruin anything but isn't super memorable. Dexter....yeah I don't blame anyone for not bothering."
Weeds,"Yeah, they should just buy those right back. They'll expire at some point anyway, so peacock would only profit"
Weeds,"So interesting theory, I wonder if someone will challenge the right to make digital copies from digital. 

If someone was to screen capture a digital media file for personal use, would this not be the same as recording a TV show in the 90's onto VHS?"
Weeds,I have a DVD player and over 30 different tv shows on DVD. I am ready for the apocalypse. lol
Weeds,"Cool, I’ll have to check that out."
Weeds,Second that. He’s very talented (as is MLP).
Weeds,They tried. Peacock turned them down. It is a top draw in streaming and Peacock are basically paying peanuts to have it on their service as they signed the deal for it long before it blew up in popularity in the later seasons.
Weeds,">	 I wonder if someone will challenge the right to make digital copies from digital.

I think service providers of streaming digital content already have ironclad TOS regarding this practice. It’s a copyright issue. I don’t know if anyone has tried to challenge it.

>	If someone was to screen capture a digital media file for personal use, would this not be the same as recording a TV show in the 90’s onto VHS?

In theory, yes. But providers have changed their policies to prevent this so they can continue to make money by having you rent all content you want to view and never allowing you to ‘own’ any copies of it. It’s a way of creating infinite profit when there’s a finite pool. If everyone bought or screen captured the content they wanted to re-watch they’d have diminishing returns."
Weeds,Hi! I saw your comment about wanting to watch the daily show. Did you find an archive? A 640gb collection exists
Weeds,👍
Weeds,I assume this is why Paramount has Sheridan making a bunch of spinoffs?
Weeds,"Anyone can write anything in a TOS, doesn't mean it's legal, hence the need for legal challenge."
Weeds,"Yes, that's exactly why.  And not just spinoffs, he's doing other shows that target the same audience, like Mayor of Kingstown with Jeremy Renner and Tulsa King with Stallone.  Both of which are worth watching."
Weeds,"Fear the Walking Dead, Vikings"
Weeds,Coma seasons of Archer lost me for good. I know it's back on to the original setup but I just don't care anymore.
Weeds,"Did you watch the first three seasons of Arrested Development?  Because if so, that's all you need to watch.  The Netflix seasons are trash."
Weeds,*Whispers* I'm already getting a little bored with Poker Face.
Weeds,Sons of Anarchy
Weeds,"I never finished Grimm, Orphan Black, Black Sails, The L Word, The Originals, I also gave up on Lost. 

All of these shows I enjoyed for at least 3 seasons (except Black Sails, I stopped at 2.) but they started getting stale."
Weeds,"Twin Peaks has an incredible season 3 (The Return) but it's not a show for everyone. If you hated it immediately then don't bother, but if you were perhaps turned off by certain season 2 plot lines I'd vote to try and push through. Up to you though."
Weeds,"The Americans.  I have tried so many times to watch that show, probably watched the first 2 seasons 3 or 4 times.  I just could not keep going.  It's not bad, it just comes across as mediocre to me."
Weeds,"Legacies

A dude literally melted into goo after having sex…… plus one of the actors left and I stopped caring about it."
Weeds," at least 80% of those I watched in the last few years, too many to mention honestly. Exponentially more compared to the number I dropped during the 35 years before"
Weeds,The Wilds on Amazon prime. The guys made it weird. Plus I heard sad news ab my fav girls
Weeds,A new one just came out - *Hunters*. Went through 9.5 episodes just to find out I never should have started it.
Weeds,"What We Do in the Shadows

The Walking Dead

Fargo (season 4 only, first 2 seasons are amazing, especially 1)"
Weeds,"Once Upon A Time. Gave up during Season 6, even though it jumped the shark way earlier. 

The Morning Show. Had one more episode left of S2 but couldn't continue because it felt so self-indulgent, like I was watching these celebs jerk off each other over their acting abilities. 

The Walking Dead, just really bad after Negan entered the scene. 

Russian Doll, watched a few episodes of S2 and the concept was interesting but not enough to justify watching over other shows. I may return to it at some point."
Weeds,"I give up on most shows because they go on too long, and become repetitive.

Even if they are actually good, like Shameless or The Americans."
Weeds,"House of cards.   I legit loved the first two seasons.  After that,  Meh turned into disgust"
Weeds,"- The Blacklist
- The Flash"
Weeds,"The Wire. I know, its one of the greatest ever. Ive watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Better Call Saul multiple times. I even loved the first season. But I simply cannot get through season 2. I think ive been stuck on the first few episodes for three years now.

The Walking Dead is of course an easy answer."
Weeds,If a show has 5+ seasons I'm just totally unable to finish it
Weeds,Deadwood greys shameless arrested development
Weeds,"Sherlock — If you know, you know (and if you don’t know, imagine writing a story and without any build up or foreshadowing, throw dozens of things in the middle with no prior setup, and stumble from there.)

The recent run of Doctor Who, the 13th Doctor, her stories fell flat for me (and the Jack thing.) 

Which is a damn shame because the actress was trying her best with the material she had.

I might return to Doctor Who when the 14th Doctor comes into the picture since RTD was the saving grace for Doctor Who before, however, so half-y on Doctor Who.

But definitely Sherlock."
Twin Peaks,Wait til you get to episode 8 of season 3
Twin Peaks,Make sure to watch Fire Walk With Me. It's a prequel but meant to be watched between season 2 and 3.
Twin Peaks,"It is, believe it or not, the most heartwarmingly wholesome TV show about >!a dead teenage hooker.!<"
Twin Peaks,"I remember years ago I downloaded Fire Walk With Me. The story made no sense but I thought, ""It's David Lynch...so yeah that checks out.""  The movie was super short which I thought was weird so after it was over I looked at the file and realize it said ""Deleted Scenes"" at the end. -\_-"
Twin Peaks,"> We got to the end of the first episode and we had no idea what the hell was going on, but we liked it.

You're [not alone](https://youtu.be/xjDa-_Vq51I)."
Twin Peaks,Would have been even funnier if you watched all of episode 4 and then a 1990 adult Michael Cera shows up.

Twin Peaks,"I was in your shoes a year ago.

Dale Cooper is a wonderful, delightful character, and Kyle McLachlan portrays him perfectly. The goofy side characters, the humor, the heartfelt moments alongside the deeply disturbing and horrifying ones are a spectacle to watch.

I think the thing that saddened me the most about it ending is that there won't be anything exactly like it. Sure, I see derived inspirations in Gravity Falls, Silent Hill and Deadly Premonition, but nothing quite like our cast and their small rural town."
Twin Peaks,This reminds me of the time when the fantastic four 2005 movie came out. I downloaded it on torrent and watched the movie and thought it was great only to find out that the one I watched was a much older 1994 movie that was unreleased and never came out in theatres.
Twin Peaks,"The first season of the 1990 twin peaks might be the best season of TV ever. Never been so captivated by a show.
  
I thought S2 was a noticeable decline but it was so weird it was still interesting"
Twin Peaks,"I kind of feel like it makes more sense now, or maybe just I'm older now. The things it does with playing with the medium, seems more understandable now that it's sort of established ""this is what 80s tv was really doing"" and it wasn't just ""why is this show weird?""

My absolute favorite thing about the show, and I can't explain why, is how food is constantly being ordered and never eaten. It's just the right weirdness that expresses... something? in the right way? (I did say I couldn't explain it.)"
Twin Peaks,"The fact that you not only did this, but *posted about it here* makes me really wish you lived next door to me."
Twin Peaks,"Love Twin Peaks. Haven’t watched the new one though. Back in the day, I lived very close to North Bend, WA. The amount of tourism the show generated was incredible."
Twin Peaks,[deleted]
Twin Peaks,"I decided to watch it a few years ago, mentioned something that seemed off when talking to my stepfather (I knew he was a fan at the time it aired) and he casually spoiled the whodoneit. 🤣 I somehow managed to avoid knowing for 25-ish years... whomp whomp."
Twin Peaks,"It is such a wholesome charming show, it has that stranger things like vibe. small town setting, an overarching surreal mystery it's too good, wish we could've had more shows like this"
Twin Peaks,Watching s2e8 is my most special TV memory. I’ll never forget where I was and how I felt. It feels silly to call Twin Peaks my favorite TV show - it truly is *the* piece of content that has affected me the most
Twin Peaks,"I started Twin Peaks earlier this year, but as I got half way into season 2 it disappeared from the streaming service I was using :(

Still haven't found anywhere to stream the show and before you start listing a bunch of alternatives I'm outside of America

Either way I enjoyed it so far. A little scary, but not too bad"
Twin Peaks,"I just recently watched season 1 and half of season 2 for the first time, and was blown away. It's such a good show. But once the main plot line was resolved, it's like a switch went off for me - utterly zero interest in continuing any further. Oh well."
Twin Peaks,"I've done a similar thing. Back when DVDs first came out, I got the goodfellas dvd, and not knowing it had the video on both sides of the disc, I just inserted it without thinking. The movie for me started with Lorraine Bracco banging on Ray Liotta's door, upset about some girl he had been sleeping with or something. And then the movie was only about an hour long, too. I wasn't sure what was up, but I didn't see what the hype was about the movie"
Twin Peaks,"I hate how streaming services offer you up the latest season. We were on prime and decided to try Yellowstone. First episode people are getting shot and killed and shot is going down. What is going on. So confusing, I assume it was throwing us right into the action. 3/4 I paused the show to find out it was season. 4 episode 1"
Twin Peaks,Highly ronemd you skip Janes snd the Milf subplot
Twin Peaks,"When you finish the original 90s show you should watch the Psych episode Dual Spires. It's an homage to Twin Peaks which features the same actors (not Kyle McLachlan). You don't have to have watched all of Psych to understand the episode (you should watch Psych anyway). The episode makes no sense to me because I've never watched Twin Peaks.

I have a story that has a same ""oh I feel stupid now"" vibe, one time I was watching Scary Movie on tv. It goes on and on, and I think ""Wow I remember Scary Movie being way funnier than this. I know stuff can get less funny as you get older but I'm only one year older than I was when I saw it before?"" 

Did not realize until the commercial break that it was *Scream* that was on, not Scary Movie. To my credit I did at least wonder why the lead actress looked so different from how I remembered, but nothing beyond that and it not being as funny struck me at all. In hindsight it's like ""how did I not notice this was Scream"" so I still feel dumb about it."
Twin Peaks,"This is the one that to this day I still don't understand the absolute adoration that so many people, often with very similar taste in television to myself, have for the show. I don't hate it, but I simply don't get why so many love it."
Twin Peaks,😂😂😂😂😂😂
Twin Peaks,"I live in “Twin Peaks” and have never seen it. 

(North Bend, WA)"
Twin Peaks,God we’ve tried to watch the original twice and its just so SO bad now.  Unwatchably cringe bad.  Im sure theres something to it but cant even get through episode 1…
Twin Peaks,"There's a 4.5 hour ""explanation"" video from YouTube channel Twin Perfect.  If you're interested. 

https://youtu.be/7AYnF5hOhuM"
Twin Peaks,I didn't finish watching it due to work but the one thing that stood out to me was that it looked so nice. The cinematography looked so damn good and it still stands all these years later.
Twin Peaks,"A new season of a favorite show came out on Netflix. I think it was season 3 or 4. I'm 15 min in after hitting play and thinking ""this is so familiar"" ""what a long flashback"". Turns out Netflix had started season 1 episode 1 for me instead of the new one lol."
Twin Peaks,"When you're caught up, I would recommend you take a look at this:  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AYnF5hOhuM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AYnF5hOhuM)  


It's kind of amazing as a piece of analysis."
Twin Peaks,I love lynch but I dont get the show. EVERY time I try to watch it i fall asleep within the first 20 mins.
Twin Peaks,"Watch all of TP.

Then watch this:

https://youtu.be/7AYnF5hOhuM

Then watch a follow-up video on the same channel.

The re-watch all of TP again."
Twin Peaks,"If you dare say you didn't like it, be prepared to hear that you are dumb. That's the center of the Rick and Morty fans and Twin Peaks fans Venn Diagram."
Twin Peaks,"As someone who lives where the shows is based out of, I should probably watch this as well…"
Twin Peaks,There’s no way someone would’ve bust out a smart phone on season one at any point because it was made before those existed. PalmPilots only started to become a thing in the late 90s early 2000s. Some of them might be confused for a smart phone. My guess is that you saw something else and because you’re so accustomed to seeing smart phones that’s what you assumed it was.
Twin Peaks,Just watch season 1 only..
Twin Peaks,"Well, your both morons"
Twin Peaks,"Go on. Get your wig, giant shoes, and red nose. You're a clown."
Twin Peaks,[removed]
Twin Peaks,"Haha, don’t worry about it"
Twin Peaks,"Okay, so I watched the original pilot for Twin Peaks about a decade ago and liked it a lot, didn't really like any episode after so I stopped.

I watched The Return in full when it aired and I fucking loved it.

I didn't really feel the need to watch the rest of the original show because The Return is anti nostalgia anyway.

Mr Jackpots > Agent Cooper"
Twin Peaks,"Ah reminds me of when I pushed my girlfriend into watching Good Omens with me. 

Tuned it in, finished it and was very confused. Turns out I had played the season finale..."
Twin Peaks,"No, you were watching the right one, David Lynch saw into the future and could see iPhones 20 years before they happened"
Twin Peaks,This will be largely how you feel about the original as well
Twin Peaks,No way…. Lol I can’t believe it! 😂😂😂
Twin Peaks,yeah netflix doesnt have the ABC episodes of Twin peaks so you watched what they have atm.
Twin Peaks,So you are watching season 3 without watching seasons 1 and 2??
Twin Peaks,"C'mon, anything David Lynch is high performance surreal art at its finest, especially compared to the drivel that is most of the past 10 years.

Make sure you have seen the films Lost Highway and Blue Velvet too."
Twin Peaks,"I am a David Lynch fan.  And I am old.

But I missed the entirety of the Twin Peaks thing when it was at it's height.  Back then I didn't know - or care - what a David Lynch was.  Was sometime later I found the guy.

Thing is, Twin Peaks has always felt like quite the time commitment to me.  I kept putting it off for watching or rewatching a favorite movie.  

Then Showtime did the Twin Peaks thing in 2017.  It premiered and I said, 'Fuck it.'.  I went all in on the show without any previous viewing experience at all.  

Hands down, one of my favorite TV experiences ever.  Just flying blind like that.  

I mean, the thing about Lynch's stuff - it isn't always supposed to make sense.  Us fans, we love Mulholland Drive - ask us fans to explain it.  We can't.  David gave us a list of 10 things to pay attention to.  We still don't get it.  But we love it anyways!"
Twin Peaks,"If it makes you feel any better, watching the original 2 seasons and the movie won’t really make you know what the hell is going on in season 3 either.  I mean, you’ll know a little more, but not much."
Twin Peaks,"OMG LOLOLOL!!!!!!!! The original still blew minds back in the day, but WOW, this would have been something else!!!!!!! Great post!"
Twin Peaks,"This is the water, and this is the well…"
Twin Peaks,"Been said a million times, but I don't think this will ever be topped as my favorite episode of TV of all time. I've never felt so strongly about liking something I've watched as the first time I saw that. I was thinking about it for weeks afterwards."
Twin Peaks,Maybe my favorite single episode of television ever. After watching it I immediately watched it again.
Twin Peaks,Season 3 Episode 8 is my favorite Lynch film.
Twin Peaks,Best hour of TV ever.
Twin Peaks,I will never forget this experience.
Twin Peaks,"Thanks!

Just started season 1.

Thoughts so far:

1) right this makes sense now
2) This actually looks like it was made at the start of the 90s"
Twin Peaks,Go out and seek the deleted scenes. They were gutted from the film but they are more like the TV series. Explain things a little bit better...
Twin Peaks,"So I always thought the movie was a “made for tv” type film, so when I finally watched it years ago during a rewatch of Twin Peaks, I was shocked at how dark it was in tone and all the nudity."
Twin Peaks,I accidentally watch the movie first before watching the series
Twin Peaks,And watch 'What Did Jack Do?' between seasons 1 and 2.
Twin Peaks,I enjoyed the show but FWWM was too much for me.
Twin Peaks,Is the entire show and 30 years of spin-offs about this? Do they ever solve it?
Twin Peaks,[removed]
Twin Peaks,"well, it's more about how a murder of a girl in a community affects all of these lives in a certain way. It can argued that Lynch is giving commentary on our society and his dislike for throw away violence in TV."
Twin Peaks,Hilarious and fitting that one could watch a bunch of contextless deleted scenes that make no narrative sense strung together and be like “yes classic David Lynch that makes sense”
Twin Peaks,I did the exact same thing!
Twin Peaks,The same thing happened to me. But i caught the mistake like 30 minutes in the film.
Twin Peaks,Well if that ain't the most accurate thing I've seen today...
Twin Peaks,Beautifully haunting or Hauntingly beautiful?
Twin Peaks,Title song with bass line.  https://youtu.be/pXrjMaVoTy0

Twin Peaks,"Omg yes. 

He just said he takes his coffee black as midnight on a moonless night and I bloody died.

What a dork.

Wtf they just there was fish in the coffee pot. 

This show."
Twin Peaks,Pete and Pete was Nickelodeon's Twin Peaks.
Twin Peaks,The 1994 movie made on a shoestring budget only for the purpose of retaining the rights to the Fantastic Four is somehow the best of the Fantastic 4 movies by far.
Twin Peaks,"Thanks, but me neighbour is a bit bored of me already"
Twin Peaks,I live in North Bend now and we still get the occasional tourists at Tweede’s cafe.
Twin Peaks,What I'm finding interesting is that the soundtrack is proper bringing back some strong childhood memories
Twin Peaks,"I'm in UK and we found it on Paramount streaming, hope that helps"
Twin Peaks,[justwatch.com](https://justwatch.com) select your country and search twin peaks
Twin Peaks,"I also find myself usually fast forwarding every scene with Donna after a certain point whenever I do a rewatch, both James and her should've been pushed in the background after the central mystery was solved since (IMHO) they're just boring characters."
Twin Peaks,"In my view, this is true only after the first complete watch. Too easy to miss some important details in those episodes if one is aggressively fast forwarding.  No one when this first aired even could have fast-forwarded. Better to experience it more like the original generation of us did. (Preferably on an old-fashioned CRT TV... just kidding... mostly. )"
Twin Peaks,"Did you watch it when it was on TV the first time?  I don't think it's the full reason, but a lot of the adoration is admiring it for how revolutionary it was at the time. Music, cinematography, pacing, and much of the acting were unique and opened new vistas for what television could be."
Twin Peaks,"Don't waste your time with this please, its a pretentious and self-opinionated take on the series that presents itself as the *true* interpretation, which is inconsistent with the show's production context and Lynch's own creative process. [In other words](https://youtu.be/xmnE4FfvXUM)"
Twin Peaks,You very clearly did not read the post.
Twin Peaks,"Season 3 is one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the decade and Fire Walk With Me a cult classic. Season 2 begins and ends well, the middle is the part people don't like. Ignore this person."
Twin Peaks,"You're*

Edit: we prefer to go by ""gimps"""
Twin Peaks,">The Return is anti nostalgia anyway.

I've seen that take a good bit (just finished the show and getting into the lore), and I like it. Looking back at s3 it does feel like a lot of it was just a big ol' way of saying ""you can't go back"".  From Harry only being mentioned and never shown, Audrey getting her tiny little wtf cameo, and the way it just.... Ends."
Twin Peaks,"I found his list of ten things to be rather helpful. Unlike most of his films, MD can be deciphered fairly well if you really want to. Without spoilers, the key is dividing the real story line from the hallucinated dream of how she wished it had been. For me that accounted for about 85% of the scenes (on about my 4th watching.)  But unraveling it is not the point, just an extra game on top of the masterpiece."
Twin Peaks,Got a light?
Twin Peaks,That summer was magical
Twin Peaks,"I was informed after complaing about twin peaks on another thread, its made to exagerate soap operas and their style of acting. 

I felt something was off about it until about season 2."
Twin Peaks,"Personal advice, feel free to take it or leave it.

For seasons 1&2 It's not a bingeable show

One or two episodes at a time are the most you should do, that's the way the pacing is built.

Season 3 is perfectly bingeable."
Twin Peaks,So did you watch season 3 when it came out and then you’re starting season 1 now?
Twin Peaks,"> 1) right this makes sense now

Enjoy that feeling while you still have it."
Twin Peaks,[The Missing Pieces](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLswgFs_bu87Pc-O_TGYhtAu7yEdPQRkk4)
Twin Peaks,"Would you be willing to talk about your experience watching the show in that order?

I've thought about someone watching it that way before and it seems like it would be a very different journey."
Twin Peaks,Did you watch The Return?
Penelope,Hope they can make me give a shit about Colin
Penelope,"Props to Nicola Coughlan aka Claire, the wee lesbian from Derry. Looking forward to season 3."
Penelope,We want Eloise!
Penelope,"There is so much that I should dislike about this show but when the new series came I had watched it within the first week.  I can’t even call it a guilty pleasure, genuinely like it.    I find myself caring about the families, characters and even the situation.  Also it made me take notice of a bunch of actors who are really amazing.  It makes sense switching to Penelope and Colin and I am glad as I like the characters but am sad that I won’t see more of Benedict who wasn’t given enough last series.  Maybe set up his interest."
Penelope,"Gonna be interesting to see how this turns out. This is gonna be the first pairing where we already know both of the main characters so no new big fresh faces. Kate and Anthony are gonna be a tough act to follow up and personally it's gonna take a lot of things going right for me to care about Penelope and Colin, right now I do not care about them at all. 

Also hope after this season we'll finally be rid of the featherington subplots."
Penelope,They're not as 'traditionally attractive' as the other two pairings so it will be interesting to see what the viewers will make of it.
Penelope,I loved Benedict’s story (plot originally based on Cinderella but diverges wildly) but I agree it makes sense to tie up the Penelope and Colin story since they’ve been building it up the past two seasons of the show. Hopefully we will get to meet Sophie!
Penelope,"I'll give it a shot, but from a narrative perspective this seems like a bad choice. Colin is the definition of a luke warm character, neither bad enough to be universally hated or liked, and perhaps worst of all is overshadowed in every scene by much more interesting characters, even when the room consists of only him and one other character. 

Penelope is a likeable character but nowhere near as interesting since a certain identity was discovered. She's more interesting than Colin, but to be blunt I feel like that arc could be declared done and it would be better if she just moved on, like an actual person probably would by now. 

I don't really care to see the drama around these two again, for yet another season where they tease are they going to get together THIS TIME... I think the only way this works is if both go there separate ways, but if that happens then why include Colin's love story... he's boring AF, it will be a bad B plot, because again... there are much more interesting characters to focus on. 

I would rethink this unless I was DAMN sure that this would be a great story arc on par with season 1 or 2."
Penelope,"I haven’t watched the shows yet, but Penelope and Colin’s book is my favorite, followed by Eloise. I hope it does them justice."
Penelope,When is season 3 out?
Penelope,"Wait, there's books?  TIL"
Penelope,"Colin hasn't had much story and is the most dull of the 3 brothers, but I feel like Penelope has been a major asshole to Eloise and just kind of as a person in general. Does that mean all of the Lady Danbury stuff is getting dropped? The idea that she's gonna be a married woman still writing a gossip column would be weird."
Penelope,Pen is my favorite! This is great.
Penelope,"I really like Polin, but they needed another season of buildup for this IMHO. Should’ve stuck with book order. Plus in the book Colin does a lot of growing up and they are much older, which is why it works. We shall see. I like both the actors."
Penelope,This is such a strange thing. Those two got zero chemistry..
Penelope,So is every season just going to be focused on one of the Bridgeton kids courting when they come of age? No thanks bring back Daphne and Simon as the main characters. Their story is way more interesting.
Penelope,Just because she is in to him doesn't mean he has to be in to her. Granted I haven't read the books :o
Penelope,[deleted]
Penelope,"I enjoyed the first season, but the second one was full of so many historical inaccuracies and plot holes that I will likely not continue."
Penelope,Thank the heavens!!! Benedict’s was boring
Penelope,"I love how people are falling all over themselves about a group of people who gained all their fabulous wealth and opulence from the deaths of millions. 

But yeah drink your fair trade coffee from your sustainable mug and watch literally the most evil people in history live their idle lives at the expense of the lives of the peasantry of their empire."
Penelope,Noooooooooooooook
Penelope,"I'm flying in a bit, in a middle seat, and was thinking about download season 2 to watch on the plane. On a scale of 1-10 how horrible of any idea is that?"
Penelope,There's a book?
Penelope,"Oh man this one is going to be so messy and end in absolute misery, it was so evident in the season 2 finale. Poor Colin is headed toward major disillusionment with women if this crap continues for him.

(Disclaimer: have not read any of the books)"
Penelope,"Diverging from the source material has never worked.

Such a shame. This show was okay."
Penelope,"NGL I'm sad they won't do Benedict first since his story is my favorite. Also hope they don't try and completely change future plots because although I loved season 2 I couldn't help but really really wish they had followed the book because there were SO MANY scenes that would have looked beautiful on screen. Either way, I'm curious to see how this will play out since they changed so much about the characters."
Penelope,"It’s going to be tough, not going to lie."
Penelope,"In the tv series, he just seems like he was complaining about wanting to go on a stoner tour of Europe. So annoying."
Penelope,I had my reservations about Anthony and they pulled that off so...stranger things have happened.
Penelope,"I practically skipped over (and in rewatches, do skip over) Anthony's season 1 stuff ~~except when he is naked~~. He was literally the worst and yet season 2 revitalized him by focusing the story on him."
Penelope,In the books apparently he only starts to like her when she becomes skinny so that doesn't really make him more appealing as a character 😂
Penelope,"I’m looking forward to it but also skeptical.  

They’ve had Colin treating Penelope like shit for quite some time now, so I wonder how they’re gonna try to spin that into romance when I have to imagine a significant portion of viewers will be rooting for it to fail or even for Penelope to reject him when he finally wises up."
Penelope,Two days until the Derry Girls finale and I’m gonna really miss it
Penelope,You already met her husband last season! For like 30 seconds but you did!
Penelope,She will probably be in focus next season? Since Penelope's relationship kicks off her's
Penelope,"Eloise's book is the worst of the bunch.  It's also the one that will be the hardest to adapt.

She basically runs away and then the entire story takes place in the country."
Penelope,"I'm surprised they're not going with her in S3 honestly, seems like what they were setting up"
Penelope,"Right? I grumbled when my wife asked me to watch the second season with her after we finished the first, but it was half hearted at best. And good thing I agreed, because the interactions between Anthony and Kate single handedly made the season for me. 

On the third season, I guess the focus on Penelope and Colin makes sense timing-wise since they've ramped up the Whistledown arc and Penelope's relationship with Eloise. Not complaining though, since anything that gives Eloise more screen time works for me!"
Penelope,"There is a book for each of the Bridgerton children, each season corresponds with a book, so they will get to Benedict."
Penelope,"I reckon their view is that Benedict to Colin is a huge downgrade

Also Colin's love story has been built up for two seasons, might as well bring it to it's conclusion"
Penelope,"So in his book he meets his girl in a Cinderella situation at a masked ball.  She runs off and he doesn't see her again for over a year.  I'm hoping we get that ball this season.

Francesca being recast also makes me hope they're starting her story.  Her story takes place over a ten year timeline.  She has a very sweet and loving first marriage that I hope we get to see this season."
Penelope,I feel like they'll pepper the masquerade where Benedict and Sophie meet this season and possibly Francesca's marriage so we can get those seasons set up later
Penelope,First season was not good but the second season was much better
Penelope,It’s way better than that overrated Downton Abbey
Penelope,"So sick of the Featheringtons. I’m happy the cheese eater is married and off, but I am over absolutely every other one."
Penelope,"Actually really interested in seeing how they treat Penelope in s3. In the books, she didn’t stand out visually because the clothes she wore were ill-fitting and the colors were not flattering to her (I think this is mainly because of her mother, who was trying to build up Penelope’s sister, I forget) but I’m really hoping they change her wardrobe in s3 because I find the actress cute and adorable."
Penelope,"The guy's hot as fuck and the girl is very cute, but I get what you mean."
Penelope,"I'm assuming the main pull is going to be Whistledown's vindictive era. Penelope on a no hold-back rampage of gossip. 

And then its her connections to the Bridgerton's and Eloise and Colin that will bring her back to normalcy."
Penelope,His is my favorite! Really hoping they don’t do a trade off for Colin’s story.
Penelope,Agreed! I had gotten my hopes up for a Benedict/Sophie focused season with maybe Francesca's first marriage as a lesser plotline? But I love Colin and Penelope too so it'll be fun to see how the series handles their relationship.
Penelope,I don't think I could have handled another season of their secret looks.
Penelope,"I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why they didn't write Colin better in season 2 as I was presuming they were going to do this. BUT they could revise him in season 3, I mean - Anthony was revitalized in his season. Colin just needs a lot MORE done."
Penelope,"I spent a large part of Season 2 thinking, ""Please tell me there's someone else for Pen and Colin isn't her endgame...because I'm finding him as dull AF and don't want to watch that."""
Penelope,Penelope is no longer a likable character after Season 2 ending. She‘s pretty much irredeemable after how much she damaged the Bridgerton family
Penelope,Not until next year most likely
Penelope,"We also have the Queen Charlotte show coming out sometime, about the young Charlotte, Lady Danburry and Lady Bridgerton.  It's started filming already."
Penelope,"They're classic regency romances.  Generic but a lot of fun and the author does a fantastic job at writing witty dialog, steamy and funny scenes."
Penelope,Yes! Gregory’s is my fave 😁
Penelope,"For real, it's like CW level of writing with Netflix level budget."
Penelope,"That’s the structure of the books. 1 per sibling, eight kids and 8 books. Also I personally think Kate and Anthony are the most interesting characters so I’m glad they will be back."
Penelope,Why bother commenting?
Penelope,Season 2 surpassed season 1 in viewership and became one of the most successful shows in Netflix history.
Penelope,"I really struggled with what they did with the queen. I love the actror playing the queen, she's really working with what they gave her. But for some reason the idea that the queen would care so much about debutantes was really hard for me to get past. Yeah, I'm sure she loved some good gossip, but the invention of this ""the queen must name her diamond"" thing was just...weird. All the best gossip back then would have been about married people having affairs. I've read too much Georgette Heyer, is the problem. 

Then Kate and Anthony got all smolder-y and... Yeah, I binged it hard anyway.

( I hate those stupid flutter sleeves though. The little puff sleeves were arguably the most flattering part of that style of dress, why ruin the only good part of the dress?)"
Penelope,"You know this is fiction, correct? Because everyone watching it knows.

If you think fictional rich people are the most evil people in history you might need a reality check."
Penelope,Bridgerton. Aka super historically accurate to Regency era London. Next you are going to tell me that we shouldn’t watch Harry Potter because the Death Eaters made their wealth on the deaths of millions.
Penelope,"It's a stylized wish fulfillment romance show aimed at middle aged women. Relax, it's not that serious."
Penelope,It’s good. You also don’t have to worry about a sex montage this time.
Penelope,"Doesn't seem to matter since the writers seemed to hate book 2 given how little of it seemed to wind up in Season 2.

Still don't understand why they thought it was a good idea to take a book that heavily relied on internal monologue, cut it all out, and then waste the runtime on other characters. You wind up with two people being sour assholes for half a season until suddenly they're in love. They even left out most of Anthony's motivation for not wanting to marry for love.

Don't know how well the third season will work out since if I recall it's almost entirely at a house party without any of the other Bridgertons. Colin won't be old enough to believably be working as a spy and I doubt Clare from Derry Girls is gonna pull the Rebel Wilson needed to work as a romantic lead."
Penelope,That was the first season he came back from that trip in the second
Penelope,Anyone who is a fan of G'raha Tia knew Anthony could pull this off lmao.
Penelope,Its also part of the formula.  The man grows during the story.  Season 2 episode 1 Anthony was still a piece of work.
Penelope,Completely untrue. In the books she loses her “baby fat” yet they don’t get together for 12 more years. So it’s not as if a diet magically changes his feelings.
Penelope,"She ""lost the baby fat"" which I took to mean she lost some weight but still wasn't thin. But she had also started dressing herself so she could wear outfits and colors that suited her better instead of the colors her mother made her wear."
Penelope,Yeah I've a feeling they won't adapt that ahahaha
Penelope,"It's not that he didn't like her before, he didn't notice her.  Didn't think of her as a woman, and that was well after she lost the weight.  It's when he see's her at ***** being an independent badass that a switch flips inside him and he can't keep his hands off her boobs."
Penelope,She’s not skinny in the book ever.
Penelope,Makes him an honest character
Penelope,"Good lord, romance novels of the 00s are the grade A worst"
Penelope,I thought they meant Derry Girls season 3.
Penelope,FYI there’s going to be a 45 min special episode airing a week later
Penelope,"Who? Is it the >!printing, newspaper boy!< ?"
Penelope,You meet him >!in season 1.!<
Penelope,I don't think I could have handled another season of hidden looks between the two.
Penelope,"I love the simple trick of giving them names in alphabetical order tbh, I assume it was a draft idea that just stuck. Although couldn't poor Hyacinth have been a Helen? And I doubt it will get 8 seasons, but Benedict is definitely getting his"
Penelope,"I’ve assumed the costume designers have been deliberately putting her in non flattering stuff as it is canon, and honestly having a new non yellow wardrobe is something I’m really looking forward to."
Penelope,In the book she also loses a lot of weight. I wonder if the showrunner will make her lose weight or just keep he the same
Penelope,"In the books she gets more control over her wardrobe and starts dressing in a way that fits her, as her mother has given up on her finding a husband."
Penelope,And the mutton chops only make him hotter to me if I’m being honest
Penelope,"Yes, but Anthony was interesting in season 1... I mean he's an older brother with the inherited Viscount title, and directly influences the main character through his actions and decisions (Daphne).

He's already important and interesting because of his title and who he is to a good chunk of the main cast, all they did was make him more relatable.

Issue with Colin is he might actually be the least interesting or important named character... Like think about it, if Colin just wasn't in the show at all would it change anything in either season... I mean Marina Thompson could attempted to go after Benedict or another noble and her story would more or less be the same. He's a plank... background material nothing more."
Penelope,"Yeah I think they should’ve kept the order because colin (and P!) need a lot more individual work, they could show him growing up more, etc. I really like them and even I think they’ve got a lot of “uphill sledding” to do here!"
Penelope,"It's a possible redemption story.

The show deliberately made him annoying by going on and on about his trip to Europe and showing up at Marina's house."
Penelope,"For me, I don't like what she did, she handled it poorly, I think most people would agree with that stance.

I still like her as a character though, because there is a lot of potential to play off her character and have an interesting dynamic play out in multiple ways. She's essentially a character that can easily ""stir the pot"" and cause expected results to change across most if not all the cast.

She's not irredeemable, that is ridiculous. Because this series is going to play out through 4+ seasons there is still plenty of time for her to grow as a person and a character, be presented with a similar choice and choose differently because she's grown. That is, actually very easy to pull off at this point it just takes time and competent writing, if they wanted to go that way.

My main issue with choosing her at this point would be because it revolves around her and Colin's love story... and regardless of which way they go with it (one story where they get together, or essentially an A plot B plot with two separate love stories) I don't particularly care about her romance, and it would be hard to make me care because that's not what makes her an interesting/useful character.

In the best case scenario she'd probably be a B plot story which means you'd need someone more interesting like Eloise, or maybe Benedict to do the ""heavy lifting"" and carry the season."
Penelope,"They kind of ruined her entire family in the series. They go from nice comic relief and a running gag about their recitals to Cinderella's wicked stepmother, a couple of dimwits, and a whiny girl backstabbing her friend."
Penelope,Sad
Penelope,Dear god why? The Queen Charlotte bits are the worst part of the show. Who asked for more?
Penelope,I'm just saying not every will they won't they has to end up working in shows.
Penelope,"It's not meant to be realistic at all, it's fantasy."
Penelope,"You think romanticizing people who were living off the deaths and misery of others is ok, I don't. 

I respect the fact that we disagree and your opinion is noted."
Penelope,"Its the romanticization of a period in history where people were literally sucking the lives out of half the world and you think that's OK. 

Fine by me the world needs people who think like you so the few can do this over and over again."
Peppa Pig,"NBC obviously censored ""penetrate"" but they ran with anally entered which works so well in this sketch. So funny."
Peppa Pig,Sarah Sherman has been such a great discovery. She’s honestly been knocking it out of the park since joining SNL last year. She’s been hilarious in so much stuff she’s featured in
Peppa Pig,[Mirror.](https://streamable.com/edok3r)
Peppa Pig,"Sarah is becoming one of the rising stars since last season, and with a rebuilt cast, great chances for her to joy Ego on the female lead in the future"
Peppa Pig,Sarah was an amazing find. A real throwback to SNL’s earlier days.
Peppa Pig,"When will the adult sequel, Pippa Peg, come out? I hear that’s the real treasure trove for the Peppe-verse’s gay characters"
Peppa Pig,Sarah Sherman invading Weekend Update has been a perfect match. Her gross-out standup is not really my cup of tea but I think her quirkiness and absurdity have been utilized really well on SNL!
Peppa Pig,Man I wish I could still watch snl but it’s not on Hulu anymore
Peppa Pig,The arms made me laugh so bad throughout this
Peppa Pig,"Video not available in my country, what a fucking surprise."
Peppa Pig,"Wow, first time in I don't know how long that I laughed at SNL. The peppa the pig fan is great, never seen her before."
Peppa Pig,I can't believe I just watched that for 4 minutes
Peppa Pig,I'm glad SNL has mastered subtlety.
Peppa Pig,"Is there some tradition when someone does these weekend update bits where they always throw in one little joke or shout out after they are outro'd? 

I think I've seen it everytime, where they're like 'Such and such everybody!' and they throw in something that the audience drowns out a bit with their applause and cheering."
Peppa Pig,"She's truly managed to give voice to some of the breathless, panicked posting that you see on the Internet."
Peppa Pig,The beat is funnier with what they said. your thinking is the obvious joke
Peppa Pig,"literally censored ""bitch"" in SZA's performance just to run with ""anally entered"" 30 minutes later lmao"
Peppa Pig,Church lady was really vulgar with regular words. The censors wouldn't let her say the bad words but the writers then made the character talk about for way longer with basically more vivid wording.
Peppa Pig,I read the title of the sketch and *immediately* knew who was going to be in it
Peppa Pig,"She's a lot better this year that she seems to be finding her own groove.

I like her characters like this, ones that are zany and odd but not so weird as to be off putting like some of her stuff can be"
Peppa Pig,Moldova?
Peppa Pig,I also listen to Fly on the Wall lol
Peppa Pig,Narnia.
Peppa Pig,Canada.
Peppa Pig,Never heard of it
Peppa Pig,"""They're not even a real country, *anywaaaay*"""
Peppa Pig,It’s made up.
Peppa Pig,Oh no that's Australia you're thinking of.
Peppa Pig,"I think you mean New Zealand, that one isn't even on the map."
Peppa Pig,What about mr. Ratburn
Peppa Pig,That's nice. I thought the eleven minute gay sex scene was a little out of place though.
Peppa Pig,"I bet Peppa was a complete asshole to them, but tbf Peppa's always an asshole.

(Justice for Suzy Sheep.)"
Peppa Pig,Oh dear...my sister and her husband are die hard Christian conservatives...their daughter loves this show. This is not going to go over well in that house
Peppa Pig,"Anybody remember ""Frog and Toad are friends"".  Or Bert and Ernie?  They seemed like nice fellas, just living together happily."
Peppa Pig,"I thought they were all same sex already. Ya know, because of their heads being in the shape of cock 'n balls and all."
Peppa Pig,Isn’t this one of those shows people recommend against because it basically teaches kids to act like assholes?
Peppa Pig,The children's show Pete the Cat on Amazon Prime has had a same-sex couple for like 5 years now.
Peppa Pig,"One parental dynamic that I don't think I've ever seen in children's programming is a *single* parent, or even a step-parent."
Peppa Pig,"Seems like a good thing to me. I wonder if there's a lesson to go along with this, or if the characters were introduced without mention of their same sex. Either way, it's good."
Peppa Pig,Bert and Ernie?
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,Isn’t this old news?  I thought they very heavily implied this in the clubhouse episode. And after writing this I realize I pay too much attention to Peppa pig when my daughter watches it.
Peppa Pig,I wonder if same sex bacon tastes the same?
Peppa Pig,I thought peppa was gay the whole time
Peppa Pig,"the title should say first in that show, not in any children's show"
Peppa Pig,Porkin' is for everyone.
Peppa Pig,Didn’t realize this was an Anthony Fantano comment section
Peppa Pig,"Well, polar bears have hour-long orgasms and the show tried to stay factually accurate."
Peppa Pig,Peppa called the SS.
Peppa Pig,Update please!!
Peppa Pig,"As die hard conservatives they should know that talking pigs are an abomination to God and should be shunned much more than gay people. 

Personally I'm fine with talking pigs and gay people, I just hate it when people are hypocritical about what things they hate on religious grounds. Talking pigs sure sound more satanic than gay people!"
Peppa Pig,"On the subject of Bert and Ernie being a gay couple, one of the people who worked on Sesame Street said ""They're puppets."""
Peppa Pig,But how can you tell the gender/sex on the way they look you bigot?!
Peppa Pig,Yep like Caliou or whatever that spoiled bald kids name is.
Peppa Pig,"Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Steven Universe, Hilda. And if you go back further you've got Jonny Quest and Winnie the Pooh. 

And step-parents are a *staple* of children's programming. A lot of them are evil."
Peppa Pig,Chas from Rugrats was a single dad for a good chunk of the show.
Peppa Pig,"Daniel Tiger, Llama Llama, Sarah and Duck, Curious George"
Peppa Pig,"Llama llama has a mom & grandparents but doesn’t seem to have a dad. 

Besides that, the “dead parent”/single parent/step-parent trope is literally a joke about Disney movies! 

Bambi. Nemo. Simba. The Big-Hero 6 kid only has a mom & his older brother dies instead. Ariel only has a dad until a prequel released 30yrs later where her mom gets hit by a ship and dies. 

Dumbo only has a mom. Toy Story’s Andy only has a mom. The “Up” kid Russel quite memorably doesn’t have a dad but only has a mom. 

Donald Duck only has an uncle & his nephews too. Pinnochio is sort of Gepetto’s adopted son. 

The “Evil Stepmother” in Cinderella(?) isn’t a *positive* example but it is one."
Peppa Pig,"It happens. Clarence comes to mind, where the title character lived with his mom and her boyfriend. Or Pepper-Ann, where the title character lived with her mom. And there are some single parents on Craig of the Creek."
Peppa Pig,Big Hero 6
Peppa Pig,Buster’s mom on Arthur
Peppa Pig,Daniel tiger has a couple of characters like that
Peppa Pig,"Hey Arnold had a character with a single father and they didn't even mention where her mother was at any point.

And I think on Arthur, Buster's parents were divorced, and in any case his dad was a pilot so was never around.

Pokemon has Ash's mom who does once mention his dad, we never see him, a supplementary novel implies he's living in disgrace somewhere and they're basically divorced in all but name only.

The Little Mermaid tv show of course had Ariel's single dad. Then there's Hercules with his FOUR parents. 

It's a movie but The Princess and the Frog has Tiana with a widowed mother for most of the film, and we never see or hear about Charlotte's mother. Of course there's a lot of movies with a single parent.

Sophia the First is a kids' tv show with a blended family - single mom with kid(s) marries single dad with kid(s).

Phineas and Ferb doesn't make a big deal about it but they're step-brothers, with a respective step-parent each. And then Vanessa's parents are divorced so technically two single parents."
Peppa Pig,"As told by Ginger, Rugrats and The Weekenders had single parents and as for Step parents Rugrats and Phineas and Ferb cover those grounds."
Peppa Pig,have you seen suzie's dad in Peppa pig?
Peppa Pig,"Phineas and Herb, Sophia the First, Over the Garden Wall and The Dragon Prince are examples of shows with blended families. 

Hilda, Owl House, Big City Greens and Kippo and the Age of Wonder beasts have single parents"
Peppa Pig,I think they were introduced and you could deduce it months ago. I think this must be when it was spelled out
Peppa Pig,[deleted]
Peppa Pig,[That'd be OK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOcYdHwc1Zo)
Peppa Pig,They slept in separate beds and were never introduced as married.
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,"Is it so hard to tell your child that sometimes, girls like other girls and want to marry them?"
Peppa Pig,"Oh my God, you might have to explain that gay people exist - the horror. Christ that's dumb."
Peppa Pig,What about the lifestyle is completely inappropriate that isn't also entailed in straight couples?
Peppa Pig,Are you opposed to shows with straight couples?
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,"Yeah, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Buster’s Moms, etc."
Peppa Pig,Oh whoops. I’m still proud of mr. ratburn for getting married
Peppa Pig,Maybe the first in a show targeted at preschoolers
Peppa Pig,"Damn, that's a much better joke."
Peppa Pig,can you link me to the bit being referred to?
Peppa Pig,The r/conservative sub is losing their minds over this.
Peppa Pig,They're actually Muppets. Big difference.
Peppa Pig,"That's honestly a perfect answer.  
But do we really think it was done by accident?  They probably just wanted to normalize the idea of a couple of grown men sharing a life together for new generations of Americans.. because why not?"
Peppa Pig,"Queen Sara Saturday and King Friday were puppets, but their straight love burned as brightly as the lights on Trolley."
Peppa Pig,"DuckTales had Della as an intentional single parent to the triplets, though she was an absentee so they were raised by the also usually single Donald instead.

Though Della is a space lesbian, and Donald may not want a boyfriend but he does have an obsessive male admirer."
Peppa Pig,Static Shock I believe as well
Peppa Pig,And when he wasn’t a single parent it result in step-parents
Peppa Pig,Can't believe no one has mentioned Professor Utonium yet
Peppa Pig,Ahhh. That makes sense. Thanks.
Peppa Pig,"Yeah, I was about to say I was pretty sure I heard about Hey Arnold having one or something."
Peppa Pig,You can still be a couple without those two details
Peppa Pig,"Just like with sex education, there's a time and place. A fucking cartoon is not it."
Peppa Pig,[removed]
Peppa Pig,No.
Peppa Pig,"Do you think most kids need an explanation for straight couples as it's the norm and what they've grown up with? No of course not, no explanation needed.  So now straight conservatives are just supposed to allow gay progressives to push their lifestyle as a norm to children that don't understand it? Respect, tolerance and acceptance works both ways. You want people to value your views, beliefs, etc. Then respect theirs as well."
Peppa Pig,What an idiotic statement. They aren't mutually exclusive. Is it so hard to believe that a parent wants their child to learn or be exposed to certain aspects of life when they feel they're mature enough and at the same time not have an issue with an alternate lifestyle?
Rita,"Isbell:

>When I saw some of the show, it bothered me, especially when I saw myself — when I saw my name come across the screen and this lady saying verbatim exactly what I said. 

>If I didn't know any better, I would've thought it was me. Her hair was like mine, she had on the same clothes. That's why it felt like reliving it all over again. It brought back all the emotions I was feeling back then.

>I was never contacted about the show. I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. They didn't ask me anything. They just did it.

>I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims' children. Not necessarily their families. I mean, I'm old. I'm very, very comfortable. But the victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless.

>It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed."
Rita,"At the very least, the creators or producers could've prepared the victim's families that the show was being made.  It's recent enough where people can be contacted."
Rita,I think it shines a pretty big light on the shitty public service Milwaukee police gave Dahmers neighbor Glenda Cleveland when she expressed grave concern for the 14 year old kid practically unconscious said to be Jeffrey’s boyfriend
Rita,"I can understand how she feels. All I can say is that before watching this show, Dahmer is the only name I knew from this mess. I'm no less revolted by him now. And going forward I will now remember some of his victims. Who they were before meeting him and at least a sense of who they could have been if they hadn't. As well as poor Glenda and the incompetent police officers."
Rita,I get it but I really do think the series was very important. It finally showed how Dahmer actually got away with it because of racial inequalities and the corrupt police. Not because he was some kind of super genius.
Rita,"It’s weird when people lump this show in with just true crime porn when the reality is this show highlights the failings of the police that no true crime doc did.  Every single one has Milwaukee police acting like Dahmer is some super smart guy, but the reality that this show correctly points out is Milwaukee doesn’t give a shit about the black and gay community, which is a very important story to tell.  Sure we can probably use other ways to tell that story, but this drives traffic, tragedy.  And that traffic will now be people who know just how shit the cops were when Dahmer committed those crimes.

Edit-thank you for the additional context friends!  Amended “didn’t” to “doesn’t”"
Rita,"This particular series hits me different.  I can’t argue that it is not exploitive of the victims and their memories but it feels different than a lot of the other cash ins that we have seen over the years.

I lived in MKE during this time, my father worked with the guy and I’ve still never been able to fully wrap my head around the horrific nature of these crimes.  I’ve known the body count, the conversion, the cannibalism and plans for an altar made out of his victims but nothing ever felt as vivid as when I watched this series.  Having it all played out right in front of you really gave me a sense of who these victims really were, especially Tony Hughes and Konerak.  I know time couldn’t be given to all 17 victims but my heart definitely feels incredible sadness when I think of all the families.  It went from being something that was a huge historical marker in my hometown to a realization of the depravity of these crimes."
Rita,"thats how I feel about the whole true crime genre, tbh"
Rita,"At the end of the day it’s an event that happened, you cannot stop anyone from talking about it or even making shows/movies about it just because it upsets you. How many WW2 documentaries have you seen, or documentaries and movies on events that are traumatic?"
Rita,"I'm not saying she's wrong but there's like dozens of series in Bundy, Gacy, mass murderers, 9/11, epstein, drugs, murder, rape and every other horror in the world. 

They make money off all of those tragedies but it's not like Dahmer was presented improperly to be glorified, nor his victims to be shown in a poor light. 

I don't understand why series should stop being made based in true stories, Netflix didn't invent that idea.

Why shouldn't a series be made on Dahmer? He's incredibly interesting. It wouldn't have been made if there wasn't a massive demand for that content, you could argue all the people who demand it are in the wrong but it is what it is. 

I'm sick of shows about 9/11, Diana and the Titanic but they still get made because it's ingrained in peoples minds."
Rita,What about war films? Gangster films? Literally any story ever told about any kind of tragic event? Sometimes Reddit’s horse is too fucking high and it irks me.
Rita,So every war movie ever made is off limits?
Rita,So basically like every other thing ever made?
Rita,"I don’t know, I watched it. It (yet again) high lighted a real short coming in America’s response to policing poor and possibly exploited peoples. 

I grew up in the 90s when there was this mystique that serial killers were intelligent methodical killers that had a message and blah blah blah. (See movies like Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Copy Cat, Kiss the Girls, Bone Collector, etc)

But after watching Dahmer, that movie about Bundy and some other docs/movies/shows these guys were lucky the cops sucked at their jobs. Dahmer should have been caught so many times but nobody wanted to listen, he was a total fuck up. 

I think the Netflix show does a good job of humanizing all of these people that Dahmer killed. I didn’t think it glorified anything about how he killed any of those people, in fact they barely show any actual violence or the messed up things he did."
Rita,"Man this kind of stuff shits me off.

It reminds me of when NITRAM was being filmed, the movie about spree killer, Martin Bryant. Apparently the residents of Tasmania basically crusaded against the filming of the movie, forcing the movie to be filmed in Geelong, Melbourne. South-Central Victoria is flat and has mainland flora; Hobart is mountainous with a constant view of the lake and ocean and has Jurassic-era ferns. The difference is noticable.

Now, I was 4 when it happened. There were victims younger than I was. It happened 30-ish minutes drive from where I lived. Half of the movie is set 20 minute walk from where I was at the time. Had he not moved to Port Arthur a couple of years prior to the massacre, the spree killing would have happened, likely at the Polish Club on the corner of Clare Street, Augusta Road, and New Town Road, or the Friend's School that was across the road. [Either way, only about a 4-10 minute walk from the house his girlfriend/mother figure that he killed lived at] (https://imgur.com/a/OQL0IRd), or somewhere equally packed. I wasn't a victim but I could have been and pretty much everyone knows someone who is a victim, or knows someone who knows someone. The shadow of Martin Bryant looms over every Tasmanian. 

Every Australian knows who Martin Bryant is because he's the guy responsible for firearms being heavily restricted in Australia. He'll always be infamous for that. In fact, one of the biggest complaints about the movie was that ""it's a true crime about one of the most horrific days in Australian history so as to teach Americans that guns are bad.""

The reason I even said all of that preamble is to say that despite all of that, I think the movie needed to be made. But now, when I watch the movie, I'm constantly distracted by the fact that despite being raised around the STREET that half the movie is set in, and know every location that is supposedly being shown, I don't recognise any of it because it's filmed in Geelong, Victoria. 

The fact that the movie almost never got made because some people thought it was inappropriate subject matter. The victims having a problem with it is one thing but the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Police Union? Why?"
Rita,Jokes on them - Netflix doesn’t make money.
Rita,"Same shit is happening with the gabby petito murder. Lifetime tv is about to release a series on the case with re-enactments. It’s only been a year. 

It’s disgusting Hollywood again"
Rita,"This thread is essentially people realizing that true crime as a genre is profiting off the pain of families, but justifying it because they like it.

These “characters” were real people. 
Imagine the worst day of your life being used as entertainment again and again for the profit of someone that doesn’t even know you. 

I’ve had to explain to friends why I didn’t want to watch certain shows when it was the same way a family member died. Had to explain that I don’t want to talk about the deaths of friends like they’re gossip. 

It’s easy for people to disassociate, but we really need to reassess and understand that this is not fiction."
Rita,"This is absurd. To begin with, anything (film, show, documentary, book) that explores stuff that humans did in the past will cost money to produce and will need to be sold. Nobody works for free. Also, we can't really pretend stuff like this didn't happen and treat it like a taboo."
Rita,So should we never make stories based on history?
Rita,I’ve never understood why there’s never any complaints like this made about war movies? Isn’t that glorifying a tragedy that affects way more people?
Rita,If you're affected why would you watch this? That's like watching 9/11 footage when your parent died in the building.
Rita,How do they make money off it when anyone watching it is paying a flat rate to watch anything?
Rita,There was a series called Criminal Minds and not all stories were completely imaginary and it went on tv for over a decade
Rita,"People on social media are so cringe about this show, posting their dumb ass thirst memes about Dahmer who was a huge piece of shit on top of being a murderer, same way they did when Zac Efron made that movie about him years ago, people have rocks for brains"
Rita,I came out of watching that pissed off at the police and the system that let these people down.  Shows like this that highlight everything that went wrong only help to prevent it happening again in the future.
Rita,"Sorry to be an asshole about this, but it worked for the bulk of Zodiac Killer, Charles Manson, Hitler, Stalin, Confederate era, Medieval, Roman era/based on movies&TV Shows. 

Yes, it's dramatically reenacted entertainment first with the intent of making money off of it...but this also can help make more people aware of the tragedy. Also make viewers generally interested in stories related to the discussions about mental health in general. Great, now I wish Mindhunter would get another season soon.

Yes, we understand how awful it all was for those involved. Nobody is denying it, but this is history and entertainment based on the principal 101. Aka Hollywood. Not sure what anybody is expecting at this rate outside of those involved people getting proper adaptations of...which is an entirely different discussion altogether."
Rita,"I don't understand why we feel the need to rehash the same true crime stories over and over and over and over again. Dahmer is one of the ""household name"" killers. Why do we need a fictionalized recreation starring a pretty actor? I felt the same way about the Ted Bundy movie with Zac Efron."
Rita,Well yes.. But isn't every ww2 movie that as well?
Rita,"This happened to my cousin about 6 or 7 years ago. She got involved with a religious sex cult and her husband presumably murdered her but covered it up as a suicide (spoiler alert, he’s still free). It was high profile enough to get a dedicated segment on 60 minutes and a Lifetime movie based on it. People got paid from this while my uncle, aunt, and remaining cousins were given continuous reminders that their daughter/sister is no longer here."
Rita,"I'm sure she has enjoyed media that made people related to the event feel the same way she feels.

Dahmer's story should be told as a warning of what can happen to marginalized communities, which we seem to never learn and need to be constantly reminded of."
Rita,"… I mean. I could see that. But, it’s a way to keep the tragedies relevant, imo. It’s horrific. And it being loosely based on a true story makes it intriguing. They’re gunna make they’re money either way. I’d rather it be something with layers than filmed in brail. Jmo. And Evan Peters is freakin awesome."
Rita,"It’s sad that they’re telling a story about a real-life event?

Is she also pissed at every world war 2 movie? Every 9/11 documentary? Every single god damn atrocity?"
Rita,"Yup, I never understood why people idolized serial killers. Blows my mind"
Rita,What made Dahmer so extra creepy was that he looked so normal in court. This actor LOOKS insane. At least Manson had the courtesy to look like a lunatic.
Rita,Or. They are telling a history and they made money for their work in its representation. It’s not like all those WW2 movies and documentaries were just out to make a quick buck on the suffering of Jews. Or how Roots was made to make money off slaves.
Rita,"I went to hear Monica Lewinsky speak recently and she talked about being a producer on the Hulu series about the affair. She spoke about how important it was to be involved and control the narrative after the media and so many others distorted her image. Consent is something we don’t talk about with private citizens being thrust into the public spotlight. I feel for victims of violent crimes and their families, it’s even more important they be involved and consulted. If they don’t consent then that should be respected even if cases are public record. my own family was touched by a hate crime and went through public trial and it was very traumatic. The things strangers say about victims, and the victim blaming etc is awful and I can imagine these families have heard it all sadly. Time for us to move on."
Rita,"""I was fine with the commodification of literally everything, and the runaway unregulated late stage capitalism generally--but someone making money off of a serial killer is TOO MUCH, MAN!"" \*takes bite of chocolate bar Nestle used child slavery and murder to get\*"
Rita,"How about Schindler’s list.. any World War movie.. Zodiac.. 9/11 movies.. etc… 

It’s entertainment, and it sheds light on the backstory of the victims. There’s a difference between ‘It’s Offensive’ and ‘I’m Offended’. 

This is just a way for people to grab some crumb of relevancy from a press train."
Rita,"Couldn't the same be said for Jewish people whose relatives died at concentration camps during the Holocaust? They were also innocent people who the victims of a malignant narcissist psychopath. Many shows, books and movies about the Holocaust are educational but most are also created to make a profit. It must be painful for the families of victims to be reminded of what they went through. 

I understand what Isbell is saying but she describes the scene in Monster where they recreate what she said in court which means she watched the show. I'm confused about why she watched the show knowing it would be a painful reminder. 

Unfortunately victims of madmen that have a historical significance whether it's Jewish people killed in concentration camps, people inside the WTC towers on 9/11 or victims of Jack the Ripper, Bundy, Gacy or Dahmer are part of something that is unusual because of how extreme it is and they're always going to have to deal with people writing books or making shows or movies about it."
Rita,"I’m not saying that the series did it right, but if you extend this argument to other tragedies, what you’re saying is that stories about tragedies can’t be told if there’s any profits made. And if you make that rule, then stories about tragedies won’t be told."
Rita,Those 9/11 and holocaust movies should never have been made?
Rita,So we’re just not supposed to make art because someone’s feelings are hurt?
Rita,Anytime people profit off of stuff like this a mandatory portion should go to people impacted
Rita,Good show this. Really great performance by Evan Peters. I don't see it as being overly exploitative. It's just history like anything else really.
Rita,All historical dramas where anything bad happens are “sad” for making money apparently. Her take is really bad. Art has always been made from real tragedy.
Rita,She means it’s sad that only they’re making money off of this tragedy
Rita,"What I don’t understand is, why are the people affected by these events watching these types of documentaries? You think they would tend to avoid them to not re-open old wounds.

Not defending Netflix or anything, just can’t help but wonder why you would want to do that to yourself"
Rita,This is the “Hollywood Machine” they make money off of every tragedy Rita - wake up.
Rita,Nothing new here.
Rita,The whole point of Netflix is to make money. Tv and movies- it’s to make a profit.
Rita,Everything hurts somebody
Rita,I appreciate Mr. Ballen on YouTube. He tells these types of stories but also raises money to the victim’s family. Hollywood are all greedy bastards
Rita,"I watched this before hearing about all the backlash, and I absolutely loved that it addressed the systemic failures that enabled Dahmer to continue doing what he did. I think their portrayal of the victims was respectful as well. If it were me that this happened to, I wouldn’t mind the whole country paying attention to it again decades later. That’s just my perspective though. 

The I’m sure it isn’t incredibly fun for the families of the victims, and I think it’s gross that they aren’t being financially compensated in any way from the series’ profits. But I still thought it told an important story and was carefully put together as to avoid a lot of this things people who may not have seen it think that it did."
Rita,People have been making money off it for years though
Rita,Someone will always make money off tragedies.   Just bummer it happened to you.
Rita,Know how she feels a cousin of mine in NYC got killed and named dropped in a diss track that blew up. Song was every where for a while shit doesn't feel good. But at the same time the true crime genre has been around forever just wish they would at least offer the families a little something even if they don't accept the offer was there
Rita,Yeah. I can’t believe someone finally made the first piece of content about Jeffery Dahmer ever in history. How dare they.
Rita,"A total outsider looking in, but I think it’s important to know the people that were victims. This show, cash grab or not, does that."
Rita,"It must feel horrible for the families of victims for sure, but by her  logic there shouldn't be any movies , shows or documentaries about tragic stories ?"
Rita,"This is why I refuse to watch this kind of thing. I dislike true crime for the same reason, I feel it gives these messed up people the exposure and notoriety they crave and profits off of their victims trauma"
Rita,"I only watched the first episode so far, so only mild spoilers without giving the ending of that episode away:

I really liked that they made Dahmer an idiot and the victim smarter than him.  I think it did an incredibly good job showing that just because you're the smartiest smarty couch detective doesn't mean you'd get away from a situation like this.  It doesn't matter how much karate you've taken, when you've been slammed against the wall and have a machete pointed at you, the option to just run and yell doesn't work.

First episode did a few things I liked:  
1. It makes him look stupid, or at least a bit more bumbly and mechanical than the great mind he's been portrayed in the past.  
2. It takes away any of the weird sex-appeal gore-porn podcast listeners have built up in their heads about him.  
3. It puts the emphasis of the story on the victims and how they're effected, instead of emphasis on the killer and 'hOw ThErE mInD wOrKs So DiFfErEnTlY tHaN oUrS oOoOo', which is arguably more important (similar mindset to not reporting a mass shooter's name but telling the stories of the heros involved).  
4. Starts you off with a base standard of police intervention which will be (I'm guessing) compared to for the rest of the show... in which the police are going to be incredibly disappointing.


I really hate tragedy-philes, and I really hate dragging victims back through the shit for the sake of profit.  I have not seen the rest of the show yet (first episode was good, debating on watching the rest).  I will say if reviews from Jeremy Jahns and others have been accurate, I think this show was made on better pretenses than most.  I do definitely agree with some of the suggestions surrounding informing victims/money paid out to families for sure, though."
Rita,Hilarious that the end of the series highlights the victims making sure dahmer and his family never profits from his crimes yet Netflix definitely isn't paying victims
Rita,"Honestly through this show I learned a lot about the victims, and the killer. Before I watched this show I didn’t even know he was gay or that he had so many victims."
Rita,I just don’t see the need for more and more films and him and other serial killers. Documentaries are enough but movies and series are ridiculous
Rita,Stop bitching about it
Rita,Lmaooooooo they have like 3 other dahmer documentaries on there just fyi
Rita,Lol stop being so fucking soft. It’s a good show.
Rita,I said the same thing when I saw Pearl Harbor
Rita,[deleted]
Rita,I’m struggling to see how this show is different from any other true crime show of the same nature
Rita,"Sounds like someone that thinks they deserve to be paid for being related to a victim. Like it or not, all serial killers are fascinating to millions of people and their stories will continue to be rehashed for decades to come. No one ever even knows or remembers the victim’s names, perhaps that’s what she should be more upset about."
Rita,"People have been making serial killer biopics forever now. Why is this one causing such an issue?

It’s not even the first Dahmer movie…"
Rita,"Personally, I’ve always found true crime shows to be somewhat tasteless but why are we only hearing about it for this show? There’s an entire tv channel dedicated to this kind of crap and I’ve never heard anything about controversy."
Rita,"It really is but there’s an audience for it that seems to idolize murderers. 

It’s disturbing to see a monster like Dahmer being played on TV for entertainment."
Rita,"I never understood why it's okay to make a Son of Sam, Ted Bundy, and Jeffery Dahmer show. But we can't even mention the names of a mass shooter?"
Rita,"Is it sad? Maybe. 

Is it unprecedented, unexpected or illegal?  

*looks at countless horror films/shows based on real events*

No."
Rita,"How many shows and series can media companies make of the same person? Jesus, we’re in a time where creativity is lacking big time. How many remakes and garbage unoriginal shows is it going to take before we get some quality entertainment?"
Rita,"I guess she hasn't heard there are many youtube channels that specialize in ""analyzing"" and profiting off of these cases and they have millions of subscribers. Probably making thousands upon thousands of dollars a month."
Rita,Holy f some yall have no empathy just cuz u like the show lol like cmon really?
Rita,Did anyone get upset about the 9/11 movie?
Rita,"“The greater good…”

Everybody in this post defending Netflix use of trauma entertainment to “keep the people informed”…"
Rita,"I think it's ridiculous to ask a TV show to pay the victims' families. In that line of thinking, all the movies and TV shows that use what happened in WWII should pay the children and grandchildren of the victims of the war."
Rita,She's really sad that she isn't making money.
Rita,My main question is if the series is good.
Rita,"Just a week ago one of the top posts on r/all was a side by side recreation of her losing it on the stand. While the comments were all praising the performance of the actress and feeling pity for Rita, all I could think was it's just exploitation of a tragedy and her worst memories to help some shitty company like Netflix get ratings or views or whatever the fuck makes them more money. Disgusting."
Rita,"I have no problem with true crime stories as long as at least have of it is devoted to the detectives chasing the murderer or the families being affected by the crimes. I can’t stand this shit when it’s all about the killer. Serial killers are NOT fascinating to me, what is fascinating though is to watch how society handles having these assholes killing people for no reason."
Rita,Why I find the true crime genre pretty genuinely sick
Rita,[removed]
Rita,"Do people get mad when another world war 2 movie, documentary, tv series gets made? It’s history. People are supposed to learn from history to keep it from repeating itself but it seems like only certain aspects of history is ok to rehash while others aren’t."
Rita,Then don't watch it.
Rita,"She wants a cut of the money and she's trying to guilt trip them and pressure them into giving her some.  

An equivalency would be a comedian doing an impression of someone in their comedy special on Netflix, and then the person they were doing an impression of getting mad that they made money off of that.

For those who don't know, she's the one who went crazy in the courthouse and tried to attack Dahmer.  I understand her not wanting to relive those moments, but nobody forced her to watch it.  She's just concerned about the money."
Rita,To be devils advocate - the series delves deeper into the lives of the victims and their families than any other docu series on true crime .  It also has entire episodes about the after math and social injustice aspects .  Maybe she just feels guilty because she’s Jeffrey dahmer sister and needs to speak out
Rita,Unlike the news.
Rita,"So if you were a part of a tragedy like this in any way and you know it’s still traumatic, why in the world would you watch it?"
Rita,"The two Manhunt series by Discovery were fucking awesome, nobody complained about those. How is this different?"
Rita,"Eye on the TV
tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor
It happens to be like
Killed by the husband
Drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son
She used the poison in his tea
And kissed him goodbye
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies."
Rita,"I love Evan peters  , but I’m tired of the dark depressing doom and gloom spiral Netflix content drags everyone into , their algorithm seems to catch hits on darkest side of humanity - sure we all rubber neck a car crash , but just because humanity is naturally intrigued by these dark bleed/ leads things a network should eventually begin to see that the only reason the algorithm is picking this dark ass content up is because there isn’t much else to choose from on Netflix- murder , T&A shows, crime , horror - all dark Ass shit anymore that or some cheap to produce b movie with a big name in it."
Rita,fab five Freddy told me everybody's fly
Rita,Giving 'monsters' the gift of notoriety.
The Mentalist,"Elementary, no match for me. Besides the much more interesting cases and detective work, its acting is what sets him apart from The Mentalist in a major way. Baker is an amazing actor but Jonny Lee Miller's work on Sherlock Holmes is on another level, honestly some of the best tv acting I've seen. Plus, it's often very funny and got some real good twists on Sherlock's lore"
The Mentalist,Psych
The Mentalist,"They are both procedurals where the guilty party is a character introduced about 8 minutes in without being a suspect and their motive suddenly appears with 8 minutes left in the show.

I prefer Elementary (and am literally rewatching it right now), but that is for how the case unfolds.  It has a lot of detective work and drudgery discussed (they don't show hours of looking through files but they comment on it, they show the effort it takes).

The Mentalist is more of him getting hunches then detective work.   It is just less believable.

But the main reason I stopped watching Mentalist was that it stopped being a case of the week and had too many episodes about Red John a serial killer who could do anything and had a cult following and was just a silly plot that dragged out for years.

If you want a case of the week show with logical cases watch Death in Paradise.  The cases are often locked room or impossible murders that they have to figure out how they were done and who did it - but the clues and how it happened all work.  And Death in Paradise always has them list the suspects and the killer is one of the suspects.  It makes sense, it isn't just a surprise reveal."
The Mentalist,I love The Mentalist. I'm going to watch Elementary after I finish Cold Case
The Mentalist,Love both shows. Gotta give the edge to Elementary because it didn't have the lead stars become romantic partners
The Mentalist,"I liked The Mentalist, but Elementary had (from what I remember) way better case solving than Mentalist."
The Mentalist,Sherlock.
The Mentalist,"Elementary wins hands down, currently on my second watch of all seasons and it's consistently great, couldn't get back into Mentalist."
The Mentalist,"I’ve never seen Mentalist so I can’t comment on it, but I have to agree about Miller as Sherlock. He’s just so fucking good in the series"
The Mentalist,Numbers
The Mentalist,The glaring problem with Death in Paradise is that it can't keep cast.
The Mentalist,So the entire show had no feelings at all between them?
The Mentalist,"Came here to say this.

What the op is looking for is actually Sherlock."
The Mentalist,It is a problem.   I like the Irish detective and that cast the best.  They really vary in entertainment.
The Mentalist,"They become friends, nothing more.

She does date his brother Mycroft briefly"
The Mentalist,That's tough
The Mentalist,"I feel like people are down playing it. It's never a will they or wont they, but there clearly is a thing between them. It comes up the 2nd before the last. It's also enough to the point people made fan video about it.

https://youtu.be/00hkjmm2KRI"
The Mentalist,Why are you trying to watch a show you don't enjoy?
The Mentalist,"I enjoyed it by not caring as much about any of those things. It gets better in the last season, but based on your take so, far you're not gonna make it, and if you do, it won't be worth it for the payoff.

The side characters are not the point of this show. The only reason to watch it is Jane, and how the others add to his story. The show does eventually get past the annoying Red John misdirects, until that arc comes to a satisfying conclusion. Then, the show matures past Jane's revenge crusade. It's about who Patrick will grow into, and how life can begin anew. But Teresa and Grace will never be developed enough to stand on their own in the foreground. 

The Mentalist is a show about... the Mentalist."
The Mentalist,Just watch Psych instead. And revel in all of their Mentalist jokes. [Psych](https://youtu.be/6uyrxx9D5ls)
The Mentalist,"well for every season i liked the cast more and more. It wasnt anything special but for me it worked, every new case was a new adventure. Did it get better? I dont think it got worse atleast but i guess its already what its gonna be rest of the way."
The Mentalist,"The Mentalist is one of those shows which had a fantastic premise, a great leading actor, but never quite managed to make it work.

It was a real shame. There are a few high points but it's mostly meh, especially towards the end."
The Mentalist,I stopped watching the moment the show jumped the shark around the end of the second (?) season. It was pretty much all the same formula right up to that point.
The Mentalist,"Perfect show to have on a second monitor while you work. It's light, characters are charming, there's a mystery that develops at the speed of an asthmatic snail..."
The Mentalist,"All of the Red John fake outs were so hilarious. I kept looking forward to see what the writers would come up with next. And even after they resolved it, I wasn't sure it was the end."
The Mentalist,"Some shows get better in later seasons: Seinfeld was ok in the first two seasons, first season of Parks & Rec, etc. I’m wondering if it gets better or not."
The Mentalist,A show that got 7 seasons never quite made it work?  It worked for plenty of people. Stop with the objectively wrong hyperbole.
The Mentalist,Jumped the shark? Are you talking about the lil old man in the Cafe of the shopping mall? Naming the perfumes of the wife and daughter?
The Mentalist,Emphatically not.
The Mentalist,If you don't like one of the main characters-Teresa-you will not like the rest of the show.  And why do you compare it with House? It's not the same genre.
The Mentalist,What's he at these days? I just see him on watch adverts nowadays.
The Mentalist,"Agreed, but I also like to rewatch other ""similar"" shows, like Psych, Castle, Sherlock, House...

Along with Richard Castle and James Wilson, Patrick Jane is my favourite character of those shows."
The Mentalist,"I tend not to be a fan of procedurals, but ditto on Simon doing a great job.  I remember watching the pilot, and seeing that his wife and kids were murdered, and thinking ""this is gonna be one of those shows where the guy solves crimes and just mopes and tells mean-spirited wisecracks.""  Much to my surprise, he played his character with a lot of levity.  I did stop watching shortly after they solved the Red John murders.  How anticlimatic that was, not satisfying at all."
The Mentalist,"He's phenomenal in ""margin call"" 

so cool 

Sell it all, today"
The Mentalist,I’ve been thinking of rewatching this show now that I see it’s on Prime.
The Mentalist,"I quit the show after the Bradley Whitford twist (I loved his reveal) and then they retconned it and dragged the mystery out for another 3 seasons. But I guess that's CBS.

Anyways, Baker always made the show way more enjoyable. He has a calm energy that pulls you in."
The Mentalist,"The Mentalist is so underrated. Simon and Robin had such great chemistry both platonically during the first few seasons and then romantically when Jane & Lisbon get together.

And cmon, he's just so ridiculously handsome."
The Mentalist,"I just can't revisit that show after they closed out the Red John story at the end of s3 then shat the bed and completely chickened out, proceeding to drag it on for ages after to an absolutely terrible second ending.

It also annoys me how quickly the whole mentalist angle is pretty much dropped and the show largely becomes a bog standard police procedural."
The Mentalist,"Korea is remaking this. Gonna see how far and fast they handle the story line. 

Korean drama is not really known for going more than 1 season. So hopefully they do justice how they'll compress the story line. 

They did criminal minds as well and rushed those story lines as well."
The Mentalist,He is directing and acting in aussie movies now.
The Mentalist,"Just started re-watching these for the first time since original air date, along with Lie To Me, Castle and Elementary. Good times."
The Mentalist,"Tunney's role always seemed so absurd - she absolutely did not fit the female law enforcement boss trope, but Simon Baker was a delight in his role."
The Mentalist,"He does. Great smile, great concept, excellent execution. Don't discount Lisbon's reaction shots to underline things. They were an excellent team.

The show committed the only sin I cannot forgive - they ""unkilled"" the invisible Big Bad. Dunno why but that just ruined it for me."
The Mentalist,"ahhh my favorite aussy. he's to patrick jane what RDJ is to iron man. i couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. he nailed it. like another poster said, they kinda blew the RJ thing, but see what happened when it actually was resolved and how procedural and empty it got afterwards.. imagine if that happened 2/3 seasons earlier? probably wouldn't have gotten 4 more. i'm glad we got 7 but i think it could've went to 10 if they had planned another arc instead of doing what the fans wanted and going the Jisbon route. there were so many things they could have explored.. a volker comeback, the whole blake dismantling, another serial killer, the possibilities were endless especially since they were in the FBI. but meh. i've rambled on enough. amazing actor, amazing show. 10/10 everyone should watch at least once."
The Mentalist,Looks like he'a in Australia during the pandemic
The Mentalist,"Castle, Psych, Mentalist, iZombie, Perception, Lucifer. There is something about investigative shows with a consultant who has somet different insight/power I just can't get enough of. But normal cop shows like NCIS, CSI, criminal minds, law and order etc bore me to tears."
The Mentalist,[deleted]
The Mentalist,"I've maintained for a while now that I think he was the most charismatic character on television. Just such a joy to watch. 

And yeah, how aloof and whimsical Jane was really sold it."
The Mentalist,Worst tv arc ending of all time
The Mentalist,"> How anticlimatic that was, not satisfying at all.

People don't listen to David Lynch on this subject but they should."
The Mentalist,"Yes, it's a good movie"
The Mentalist,"Yeah, they had, what, five seasons to conjure up a decent story about Red John and it's like they didn't even try.  I remember when they faked us out with Bradley Whitford appearing as a fake Red John, I thought that was absolutely terrific.  Little did I know what the end result would be.  A big waste of Xander Berkeley's talents, as well."
The Mentalist,still calling it the mentalist?

The Mentalist,"I actually never watched Monk. I am sure I will like it if I watch it, but it doesn't really call me."

The Mentalist,McAllister should have definitely shown up more throughout the show.

The Mentalist,"Yo, someone else has seen Endgame! What a hidden gem that was."
The Mentalist,"I think it should've been Partidge, Jack Plotnik's character"
The Mentalist,"I remember when I saw that episode, when he pops up in the end at that food court.  This was a show that didn't have a lot of special guest stars, so I really couldn't believe it when I saw him.  He did an amazing job, but at the same time, it was such a wasted opportunity."
The Mentalist,"I can accept that.

I just prefer the Whitford portrayal because my *god* that was good."
The Mentalist,"When I watched the show live, I was so pissed when they revealed he wasn't Red John, but I still watched the show.

If that happened *now*, all these years later, I would have absolutely quit the show because that was a bunch of bullshit."
The Mentalist,When I watched The Mentalist I watched only the Red John-centric episodes. It's coherent on it's own.

Top of the Lake,"I enjoyed both seasons, hope there will be more."
Top of the Lake,"Nice write-up.  Top of the Lake is one of my favorite shows. I think I prefer S1, but I appreciate how much you enjoyed China Girl. It's such a strange follow-up... not what I would have expected, but still thematically in line with everything the first season. The fact Puss seems like a sinister version of the guy from the Room makes everything feel surreal. Gwendolyn Christie also has a great rapport with Elizabeth Moss.

I think of GJ in terms of the Log Lady from Twin Peaks.  She doesn't have a obvious point in terms of the plot, but sort of ties the series together thematically.  Top of the Lake is very concerned with how victims of abuse perservere in a society that doesn't do well by them.  GJ allows the show to comment on the story, underline what it's all about, and even poke fun at it a little bit. There's probably an essay to be written about how GJ is basically God in paradise, but I'm not motivated enough to write it.  Holly Hunter is so goddamn great, tho.  

I'm not sure it needs a season three, but I'd take it. I'd love to see Jane Campion do more television in general. Her stuff isn't the easiest to digest, but it's always worth it."

It's like we watched a different first season.  It's a slow, sad burn, so I get why it's not for everybody, but it never fizzles out. The last episode in especially killer."
Top of the Lake,Top of the Lake was pretty good.
Top of the Lake,"I just started watching [*Pure*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxK9_-GZeo4) the other night. I kind of dig it, hadn't heard anything about it before. Anyone else see it? It's a Channel 4 series about a young woman in London with Pure O, a form of OCD.

edit: trailer"
Top of the Lake,There's too many names in this headline for me to bother with it. I don't care about your downvotes.
Top of the Lake,"It was phenomenal. *State of the Union*, a show they did recently with Rosamund Pike and Chris O'Dowd, was good too. And different."
Top of the Lake,Season Two was some of the worst writing I've seen in a tv show. Season One was pretty good though.
Top of the Lake,"Saw it, loved it. Helped me bridge the gap between the two seasons of Fleabag."
Top of the Lake,"I didn't know there was a second season. 

The first was good enough for me!"
Top of the Lake,"I never expected a second season of this, I thought it would always just be a miniseries."
Top of the Lake,I hope it turns out well--the first season was terrific.
Top of the Lake,"If anyone wants another high-brow crime show a la True Detective or Top of the Lake to sink their teeth into, check out BBC/Starz's ""The Missing."" Same level of quality."
Top of the Lake,I loved this show! The last bit of the finale was absolutely thrilling.
Top of the Lake,"Loved everything about the first season except the (ahem) operation led by the Big Bad. After such a tightly wound storyline, the conclusion seemed a bit much.

Season 1 was so explicitly feminist; I'm curious if season 2 will follow that form, take down another institution, or do something else entirely."
Top of the Lake,I smell another Broadchurch collapse...  I loved season one but didn't really think it leant it self to another season.
Top of the Lake,"""Roofies."""
Top of the Lake,"I hope Moss has worked on her accent a bit. I absolutely love the show, but as a kiwi it's quite distracting to hear such a strange NZ/Australian/American hybrid. "
Top of the Lake,"Been meaning to watch this, is it along the same lines as Twin Peaks? Always looking to fill that void. "
Top of the Lake,"I'm still really unsure whether I liked the first season. I loved the feminist storyline, Moss' acting and the beautiful cinematography but I wasn't a big fan of the pacing and the general conclusion."
Top of the Lake,Tried really hard to get into this but just couldn't do it. Gave up halfway through episode 4 I think (just after the old guy self flagellates and visits his mum's grave or something?) cos just was not getting anything out of it at all
Top of the Lake,Faark yes! Didn't expect more of this and it should be very interesting. 
Top of the Lake,"Wow, I was wondering what she would be doing after Mad Men. I expect to see Top of the Lake competing with Fargo during the next Emmy run."
Top of the Lake,"Most important question: will Johnno be back? Oh my God I loved that character. I mean...The Bridge is cancelled, so Wright can totally sign on.... "
Top of the Lake,Is it the same story and characters or totally different ?
Top of the Lake,"Well, i loved the atmosphere and the acting but hated the script in the end.

Campion put way too much stories in there. Which created a lot of plot holes."
Top of the Lake,Faark yes! Didn't expect more of this and it should be very interesting. 
Top of the Lake,"Wow. I am surprised by this, I thought the first season was horrible. "
Top of the Lake,"Well, the first season was up there with True Detective and like Twin Peaks if it took itself seriously for me - bring it on.  "
Top of the Lake,Also I would recommend Bloodline on Netflix
Top of the Lake,"It's been years since I watched this, can you remind me what the operation was? "
Top of the Lake,with campion still writing i see no reason why it won't be as feminist as the rest of her work. yay!!!!!!! 
Top of the Lake,With so much time between the two seasons I would have hope they spent it working on a strong script. 
Top of the Lake,"I, honestly, enjoyed Broadchurch's season 2. Alec and Ellie's relationship deepened and their dialogue was much sharper."
Top of the Lake,"I share your concerns. Some shows only lend themselves to one season and it's a mistake to try and squeeze more out of it. I like that newer shows like American Horror Story and Fargo are treating each season as a one off, but keep a cast of actors together. "
Top of the Lake,"True Detective could be another comp. I don't foresee a collapse, though. I have more faith in this show and the pliability of what they created the first time around considering the returning players."
Top of the Lake,Episode 7 had a huge cliffhanger tho and we didn't even seen the outcome of some stuff
Top of the Lake,"I didn't mind it listening as an Australian.  
It was certainly noticeable but didn't snap me out, the character lived in Sydney from 15 to 20-something.  

Ih thynk eff et wuz too thuck et myte hev put of thee Americunz?"
Top of the Lake,"Not really. It was enjoyable but bleak. No humorous asides and a dark conclusion. Gritty, not fantastical."
Top of the Lake,There has never been a show like Twin Peaks. I don't think there ever  will be 
Top of the Lake,"It's definitely the sort of thing you either get or you don't. The pacing is so strange that a lot of people found it boring, while others loved it."
Top of the Lake,"Bloodline. Yes! Yes! Yes! Omg yes! 

Check The Killing as well"
Top of the Lake,the police chief's sex basement. 
Top of the Lake,"I actually prefer the second season over the first. Just one problem with this particular season is the cringe-worthy ""Tell me you love me"" line from Ellie."
Top of the Lake,"Its like if the first season of Twin Peaks was written by someone with experience of real small-town horrors.  

It is absolutely worth your time.  
Just be prepared for...real things.  "
Top of the Lake,"It was jarring but a brilliant touch I thought.  
The fact that the first ""ending"" could stand alone with the victims sorting out their lives and doing their best was important.  "
Top of the Lake,S1 was unlike anything I had ever seen on TV. I'm pumped. 
Top of the Lake,Just saw it - never heard of the show until now.  I plan on watching S1 soon.
Top of the Lake,Elizabeth Moss is killing it right now. The Handmaidens Tale is excellent so far and I loved Top of the Lake season 1. 
Top of the Lake,"Wow great cast. I've been meaning to watch season 1, but Moss and Kidman hype right now has me pumped."
Top of the Lake,"I had never heard of this before, I will definitely watch Season 1!  Thanks!"
Top of the Lake,Please join us in r/Topofthelake.
Top of the Lake,"Cannot wait!  The first season was so, so good.   And they add Nicole Kidman?  Wow"
Top of the Lake,"How many episodes does season 1 have, six or seven? I'm confused."
Top of the Lake,"Can't wait for this! The first season was amazing, and Elizabeth Moss is a joy to watch. 

It kinda felt like a Kiwi Broadchurch, but somehow even more depressing. In a good way."
Top of the Lake,"Been thinking of starting this series since I've been loving Moss on Handmaid's. And to see Kidman in S2, I definitely need to watch now! She was the best part of Big Little Lies on HBO."
Top of the Lake,So excited! Finally watched season 1 in one sitting because it was leaving Netflix about a month ago and I was amazed.
Top of the Lake,Oh look it is President Bartlett's daughter!
Top of the Lake,"I remember loving Twin Peaks but feeling a bit odd that it treated ideas like sexual abuse ... light heartedly?

Top of the Lake really addresses those issues deeply and truthfully, I felt my brain expanding watching it and I'm really grateful I had that insight into how people interact.  "
Top of the Lake,It's incredible.
Top of the Lake,"it's really slow, but it hits hard."
Top of the Lake,Let's not forget Mad Men right before! 
Top of the Lake,"She was just extraordinary in Big Little Lies, I can't wait to see her in this."
Top of the Lake,Can you describe the structure of the first season? Is it one crime for the whole season or a crime each episode?
Top of the Lake,seven
Top of the Lake,"BBC did 6 hour long episodes, Sundance tv did 7 45 minute long episodes. According to Wikipedia "
Top of the Lake,"You know, thats what I always think when I see her even though she was a main cast and did such an amazing job in Mad Men. First impressions I suppose"
Top of the Lake,Can confirm 
Top of the Lake,Completely stunning.
Top of the Lake,One crime for the whole season.
Top of the Lake,"As mentioned, just one. It's a really slow burn, especially because it's not just about finding the perp, but also about understanding the small community, the protagonist's past, and some other weird things going on in the area. Terrific series. Elisabeth Moss is stellar, and the cinematography is great too (of course due in part to the beautiful location)"
Top of the Lake,What? So they re edited it?
Top of the Lake,"Thanks, mate"
Top of the Lake,She's also lead in a Handmaidens tale on Hulu
Top of the Lake,"Good, I think I might like it. I really liked Bron/Broen (which is also a cop show) especially because it followed this format of one crime per season and really allowed for character development. I'll check it out."
Top of the Lake,I think they just split the episodes differently. But I have not watched it so im not sure. 
Top of the Lake,Watched the first episode and it was incredible.
Top of the Lake,I watched the entire thing yesterday and it was just extraordinary.
Top of the Lake,"I loved the first series but didn’t love S2E1. I think part of it is that I miss the setting of NZ. Nevertheless, I’ll stick with it. "
Top of the Lake,"Enjoyed the first season, although I was disappointed by how it wrapped up. Just finished S02E01. Thought it had some of the worst/unrealistic/cringe-inducing writing and characters in recent memory, and I'm saying this as someone who watched multiple episodes of The Mist. It's like each scene was trying to one-up the previous one in stupidity.

Usually I'll give any show a few more chances to change my mind, but in this case I'm just done. Shame about the cast."
Top of the Lake,"*Top of the Lake* S2, *The Deuce*, and *Bojack* S4 premiering on the same weekend? Clear your calendars!"
Top of the Lake,"Dumb question, but what is this show even about? I've heard good rumblings about it and Moss' performance for a while now, but can never seem to find a synopsis or description of it."
Top of the Lake,"I'm up to episode 5 and although I'm enjoying it I'm finding some of the writing in relation to most of the interpersonal dynamics to be... weird. The whole 'way men treat/view women' thing feels so explicit it makes me feel like I'm watching something written by someone with a specific agenda. Which is a shame because apart from that, I'm a big fan. "
Top of the Lake,so there's this thing called Google right...
Top of the Lake,"> Set in a remote mountain town in New Zealand, ""Top of the Lake"" centers on the disappearance of 12-year-old Tui, who is five months pregnant. She is last seen standing chest deep in a freezing lake, and now all attention is focused on inexperienced detective Robin Griffin, who leads the investigation in the same town where she endured traumatic events years earlier. Not only must she find Tui, but Robin also embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Her limits are tested amid clashes with Matt, the missing girl's father and local drug lord, and GJ, a guru at a local women's camp.

Season 2 is set in Sydney and also has Nicole Kidman and Gwendoline Christie in it. It's directed/written by Jane Campion, who won an Oscar for The Piano."
Top of the Lake,"On a basic level it's a crime story. But it also has this sort of bizarre strangeness about it, like nothing you've ever seen before. It's really about much more than just the crime. The first season takes place in a small town in New Zealand where a 12 year-old pregnant girl goes missing. The second one takes place in Sydney. Moss plays a detective. "
Top of the Lake,"I don't have that feeling at all. It's a very female show, shown from a female point of view. That's maybe why you're thrown. 

Can you provide some examples of what you mean?"
Top of the Lake,That's Jane Campion for you. Talk about a one note artist.
Top of the Lake,"I mean, I'm a female working in the emergency services in Australia, and although there's some of that sort of ""boys club"" attitude, the way it was portrayed in the show was almost cartoonish. 

For example the cop who would just randomly pop up and declare ""I want you Robin! I want to fuck you for X amount of days"" then childishly stomp away when she said no. And although the guys at the coffee shop were straight from /r/incels, it just felt like they were written to strengthen the overall tone of misogyny rather than serving a greater purpose to the plot. The shooter could have done everything he did without any of those coffee shop dudes there at all, which leads me to believe their only purpose was to push the ""all men hate women"" barrow. 

Another example that I literally rolled my eyes at was when the copper says to her whilst excusing the behaviour of the cartoon ""let's fuck"" guy ""oh, all men know women sometimes say no but don't mean it.""

Are all of these things real things? Sure. But cramming all of them - and other examples I'm sure I could remember if I took a minute - into 6 episodes felt like an agenda and even worse - lazy writing.  "
Top of the Lake,"I don't know. I see what you're saying to an extent, but I think calling it ""lazy writing"" is a bit harsh. Realism in fiction isn't really about portraying reality with a hundred percent accuracy.  

The series is, unabashedly, about gender roles. The main character is a rape survivor.  I think some of the situations are heightened to demonstrate how an experience like that can affect a person. The new season leans on a certain Twin Peaks weirdness to drive the point home at times. Top of the Lake has always had that element to it, but it seems more present in China beach.  Especially with the two main creeps randomly attacking Robin in a very cartoonish fashion.  

The dudes in the coffee shop were a direct contrast to the women on the beach in S1. Both groups somewhat broken by their relationship experiences, and inability to communicate with the opposite gender. They didn't have a whole lot to do with the plot, but they did help me understand what I think the series is trying to say about gender roles. Like, I'm not sure if those characters from season one would have made sense to me if I hadn't seen the contrast this season.

I actually liked the way the show portrayed the cop who propositioned her.  He was a dope, but he wasn't a monster or anything. He seemed like a big dumb kid who wasn't used to hearing the word no.  He didn't attack Robin like others in the show, despite his warning from his other friend, he just whined like a baby. All things considered, it seemed like a fairly affectionate portrayal.  "
Top of the Lake,"But you say it like that's the only men in the show. There is plenty of normal, not-asshole men there too.

The mustache cop was set up as an asshole, he's an asshole in the first scene he's in. The kids in the coffee shop are just a group of guys obsessed with going to brothels (and maybe run some sort of a prostitute rating website). They were there to provide contrast to the character of Bret, who is a little different and has serious mental issues. 

Of course, misogyny and treatment of women is one of the main themes of the show, so it's all a little bit emphasized.

There is no agenda here, you're just trying to find one.

This show is a little bit like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series (originally called ""Men who Hate Women""). It doesn't mean ""all men hate women"", it's just about those who do."
Top of the Lake,"That comparison between the commune from season one and the coffee shop guys is interesting.

The commune was a group of women after menopause, broken by previous experiences with men and in general. Campion described them as ""unfuckable"". One of the them even pays men to have sex with her.

The coffee shop guys are kind of like that but in a completely different way."
Top of the Lake,"> There is no agenda here, you're just trying to find one.

Um, no, there is a very explicit agenda and Campion has talked about it many times. It does detract from the show to be honest. It has decent enough plot lines but suffers from being blatantly sexist. I like the Benny Hill show too, but its a guilty pleasure if you know what I mean."
Top of the Lake,"Like I said, I'm a female working in that type of work in that country, and my opinion of that particular portrayal of the female experience in that arena felt overwrought and manipulative.

I'm not 'trying to find one', I'm simply stating my feelings and observations, as is the point of such a forum. I like the show, I'll watch another season if there is one - but nonetheless, I felt like there were many scenes that were written simply to highlight the gender issue rather than tell a story. If the former is relevant to the latter? Great, fine. But some of the examples I gave were not necessary to the plot or even the character development, which - like I said - feels dishonest. Again, my opinion, not a personal affront to you."
Top of the Lake,"Not surprising, the first season had a lot of similar issues. "
Top of the Lake,"Anyone know when this is likely to air?

I enjoyed the 1st series"
Top of the Lake,[deleted]
Top of the Lake,"I finished the first season yesterday. So fucking good! But I dunno about the move to Sydney, the atmospheric NZ backwaters were a huge part of what made the first one so good."
The Office (U.K.),I live in the U.K. And The Office being removed from our Netflix was such a shit move that watching these clips almost makes me want to buy the whole box set for £££
The Office (U.K.),"I agreed with a lot of what he said actually. 

Does anybody know if there'll be a 9th season? I don't think they usually announce anything for another couple of months, but has anybody heard rumors? Does anybody here want a 9th season?"
The Office (U.K.),"TLDR: Fatass who argues how much he loves the British version of ""The Office"" (after first attempting to establish his TV Cred) argues about how much the American version sucks in about 10,000 words.

"
The Office (U.K.),"The UK version was a mockumentry. 

The US version is just a sitcom. As the seasons went on homage to the 4th wall dropped more and more. "
The Office (U.K.),Yet he's right.
The Office (U.K.),"He's mostly wrong, but too moronic to realize/admit it. The US Office has suffered a gradual decline, and with the exception of a handful of moments, this season has been mostly disappointing. But his article disparages the show as a whole in its entirety, and discounts past seasons that were often good to great."
The Office (U.K.),"Only about a few of his basic points I think. He's too focused on comparing the U.S. and U.K. versions as if they were supposed to be carbon copies of each other. The U.S. writers never seemed to have that intention to me.

Jim and Pam were never the center of the U.S. version. It was always Michael. The J+P storyline was fun to watch, but you knew how it was gonna end and it was often more tense than funny. Michael was the heart and soul of the show, you loved him and hated him at the same time. 

In the U.K. version you were supposed to hate Brent and find nothing redeemable about him, but the U.S. one intentionally made Michael Scott a somewhat more relatable character. He's horribly inept and tactless and childish, but he's also an incredibly lonely and depressed and yet still attempting-to-be-optimistic buffoon, and you can't help but root for him to get a few things to go right here and there.

I do agree with the central idea that the U.S. Office has been stretched out past it's prime and is really in a fairly terrible decline, but this article was pretty awful itself. It was a pretentious idiot's attempt to attack an American show he clearly didn't like (despite trying to make it seem the opposite) or properly understand  by repeating ""BRITISH SHOWS ARE DONE BETTER"" over and over."
The Office (U.K.),No. They're very different.
The Office (U.K.),"If you wanna watch, know the main difference.

The US version is optimistic. The UK Version is pesimistic."
The Office (U.K.),"I’m British and watched the UK Office first and loved it.. the US Office is great but it’s an entirely different show, it’s more like a sitcom vibe, whereas the UK Office is a Mockumentary... They’re just entirely different and wouldn’t recommend UK Office to a fan of the US Office unless you like British comedy like Blackadder/Red Dwarf/Monty Python etc as it’s more similar to those than the US version :)"
The Office (U.K.),"I watched the UK Office with my ex girlfriend years ago and we laughed ourselves to death, yet also were so uncomfortable at times we had to look away from the screen now and then. We both have tried, independently of one another, try watch the US version, and while I like the sort of dry humor and handheld filming it, and other shows like it that I do love, use, I cannot stand it one bit. It could be my absolute distaste for Steve Carrel, or it could be a dozen other reasons I'd rather not get into, but I couldn't stand it at all. 

I think someone in the comments said it very perfectly; UK is pessimistic and the US is optimistic, and being a rather bleak person myself, I think the UK version just appealed more to my sensibility, but that doesn't mean I can't also enjoy optimistic things. The US Office just isn't one of those things for me. I didn't find it funny or interesting, but I recognize there was clearly an audience out there for it. So on the whole, no, I don't think you have to watch two separate versions of something to enjoy one or the other. I loved Australian Wilfred, but US Wilfred also kept me from ending my life, so yeah."
The Office (U.K.),"It’s a good show on its own, but different.

If you want something “like the office”, Parks and Rec (season 2+) is also great."
The Office (U.K.),"Office U.K. is more cringeworthy, you want to crawl into your skin while laughing at the uncomfortableness of it.

Whereas the Office US, you’re laughing at the situations and the storyline.

I know they are both based off the premise of it being a mockumentary but I think the Office U.K. feels like one.

They are both great shows but it depends what you like as they are two totally different shows. You could always try 2 or 3 episodes."
The Office (U.K.),"I'd say it's a much watch regardless of the us one, so yes I guess. "
The Office (U.K.),"I watched the British one first by mistake and then the American. 

They are both good, they are both uncomfortable at times, buy they are both completely different shows.

The British one is just pessimistic and bleak to me while the American version is brighter and more colorful. It has hope, it's optimistic.

Not all my friends like the British version but I always recommend it. It got me into David which led me to get watch his other shows like Derek."
The Office (U.K.),"Other than the fact they both star British people, The Office and Monty Python aren't similar at all"
The Office (U.K.),The US office is also a mockumentary...
The Office (U.K.),Would say more like Fawlty Towers for the cringe factor comedy
The Office (U.K.),[deleted]
The Office (U.K.),"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
The Office (U.K.),"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
The Office (U.K.),"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
The Office (U.K.),I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
The Office (U.K.),"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
The Office (U.K.),"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
The Office (U.K.),"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions…""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
The Office (U.K.),"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
The Office (U.K.),Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
The Office (U.K.),No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
The Office (U.K.),Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
The Office (U.K.),"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
The Office (U.K.),Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
The Office (U.K.),"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
The Office (U.K.),"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
The Office (U.K.),🙂💕
The Office (U.K.),It’s great but it’s depressing.
The Office (U.K.),"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
The Office (U.K.),I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
The Office (U.K.),on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
The Office (U.K.),"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
The Office (U.K.),"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
The Office (U.K.),Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
The Office (U.K.),Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
The Office (U.K.),"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
The Office (U.K.),"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
The Office (U.K.),"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
The Office (U.K.),"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
The Office (U.K.),I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
The Office (U.K.),"Yes, Absolutely, this is worth watching! I would totally binge watch MASH again if it was in Netflix."
The Office (U.K.),"Yes yes yes!  Alan Alda as Hawkeye is one of the best characters ever written.
 
I wanted to add, also brilliantly acted.  I grew up with Alan at the top of my list."
The Office (U.K.),I have grown up watching this show partly due to my grandfather serving in the army during the Korean War. But definitely a must watch with a stellar cast.
The Office (U.K.),"You should know that if you do decide to buy the box set, you should check the language settings. If it's the same as my dad's copy, you'll be able to turn off the laugh track and the show is markedly improved by it."
The Office (U.K.),Yes. On my DVDs there are two audio tracks. One with and without a laugh track. Opt for the one without the laugh track if possible.
The Office (U.K.),"In my opinion, hell yes. Some notes, though:

* First few seasons had laugh tracks, but the DVDs typically have an option to play without them. 

* There is a notable shift in tone over the seasons. Some people will tell you the last few seasons are maudlin or overly dramatic or preachy. Other people (like myself) think those are the best seasons and the early seasons are too silly and slapsticky and more shallow character-wise. Just be aware that if you don't care for a few episodes you've seen, give it some time. If you give it a chance and none of the characters grow on you, then you can probably give up on it. 

* The show doesn't feel nearly as dated as I expected it to. It doesn't scream 70s/80s as much as other shows of its era since it's set in the military, so you don't have outrageous fashion or furniture or what have you. 

* Some people want to toss it out with the cancel culture climate because of a few off-color jokes that were of their time. Personally, I think that's absurd. Most of the show was very progressive and compassionate. The early seasons have a weird acceptance of extramarital affairs, but it gets over that eventually. 

* The character of Margaret improves greatly over time and she's much more three-dimensional in later seasons. Frank Burns doesn't get to grow or change at all, which I disliked because that would have been a rich development, but he just fizzles out and gets replaced eventually. Trapper John is a useless nonentity that gets replaced by a much, much better character. 

* Keep in mind that Pilot episodes are always rough. The pilot/first few episodes have a lot of holdover elements from the MASH movie that don't pan out and eventually get dropped. Personally, I'd sample the two-parter **Welcome to Korea** for a better introduction into the show, then if you like that, go back to the beginning. This was a major transitional episode for the cast and is a nice introduction that is more sure of itself than the pilot."
The Office (U.K.),"In my opinion, mostly yes, it is worth it.

The first three seasons were eh, mediocre. I wasn't fond of the Trapper John character and Frank Burns, Henry and Margaret were all sort of one-note. However, once the series brought in BJ and Col. Potter, it seemed to have found its voice.

Of course, I can't tell how it will play to a non-American viewer in 2020. I think most of it will stand the test of time (and location), but can't guarantee it. I will say, whenever I see a M * A * S * H marathon, I find myself drawn back in. Especially if they're already past Season 3, haha."
The Office (U.K.),I binged it a couple of years ago when it was on Netflix in the U.S. but I would definitely watch it again.
The Office (U.K.),Can someone describe the type of sense of humour the show has?
The Office (U.K.),"Yes, and you're lucky because I hear the U.K. version gives you the choice of laugh track or not."
The Office (U.K.),"I would try to find a way to view a few episodes to see if you like it first before you buy it if you've never seen an episode before. I personally don't find it funny at all, not even during the original run, it's more of a sad satire /sadcom than a sitcom in my eyes. I always felt down after watching an episode. 

I just wanted to chime in as a non fan so that you know that not everyone likes it before you spend money on an entire box set of a show that I'm guessing you have never seen. If you have seen some episodes before then please disregard my comment."
The Office (U.K.),"It absolutely is.  I picked up the box set several years ago and have gone through it in it's entirety three or four times.  The finale is such a gut punch, and one of the best episodes of any TV show.

Protip- see if the box set includes an audio track without the laugh track.  I bought the particular set just for that feature.  For me, that's the only way to watch it."
The Office (U.K.),I'd recommend watching the movie first. It tries to highlight the absurdity of a war bureaucracy.
The Office (U.K.),My grandpa served as a tank mechanic and was trained by a ww2 veteran and worked with guys who went back to Vietnam so they all do have something in common
The Office (U.K.),"You should be able to find some episodes streaming somewhere to decide if you like it enough to buy a box set.

It's one of my favorite shows but that doesn't mean you would like it."
The Office (U.K.),"Can I get a big ""Hell yeah!"""
The Office (U.K.),Yes. One of the best series in television history.
The Office (U.K.),It has never been Available on streaming in the U.K. (unless it was ok Netflix U.K. when it was on US Netflix)
The Office (U.K.),"It's on Hulu, with a nice HD transfer, if you're interested.

I know that some people still think of Hulu as bad for the old ad-based model they had, but these days you pay the same amount to them for ad-free that you pay to Netflix. So they're totally comparable.

My wife must have watched through the entire MASH series 3 times over the past few years (summer viewing for a Physics teacher)."
The Office (U.K.),Its on hulu
The Office (U.K.),"Why was the Korean War such a popular watch (was this war a really big one in the USA like Vietnam and WW1 and WW2)

The final episode is the biggest watched episode of any show in America in terms of viewers"
The Office (U.K.),I’ve always thought this show would be better without a laugh track as well.
The Office (U.K.),"> the show is markedly improved by it.

I disagree.  They pause for the laugh track, so the pacing is off if you turn it off."
The Office (U.K.),"The biggest improvement in M\*A\*S*H was the placement of Burns with Winchester.  Burns was a clownish buffoon, while Winchester was an actual foil for Hawkeye and BJ."
The Office (U.K.),I'll add that it's very heavy on wordplay and one liners.  But macabre is also a good descriptor.
The Office (U.K.),Irreverent.
The Office (U.K.),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdhveixpV24
The Office (U.K.),">Why was the Korean War such a popular watch (was this war a really big one in the USA like Vietnam and WW1 and WW2)

No, it was relatively small, at least for those not serving in it or at home on the homefront fretting over loved on serving in it.  It just happens to be the war that served as the ""backdrop"" when the book was written.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH:_A_Novel_About_Three_Army_Doctors"
The Office (U.K.),"I don’t think not was the Korean War so much as the generic war setting. Veterans from Korea, Vietnam, and WWII could all relate. My Vietnam vet dad absolutely loved the show."
The Office (U.K.),"CHARLES! I knew I was forgetting someone! And yes, I agree 100%."
The Office (U.K.),"In the US, Korea is often called 'the forgotten war.'  So, there's that.

As others have said, the movie and TV show say 'Korea', but we all know it's about war in general, and Vietnam in particular."
The Office (U.K.),Oh ok
The Office (U.K.),""",,, Gentlemeeeeeen"""
The Office (U.K.),"Totally!  Each replacement just kept making the show better.  Henry was okay, but Potter was magnificent, Hawkeye/Trapper and particularly Margaret needed a father figure; something about Trapper just bugged me, he was too goofy to play well off of Hawkeye's energy, but BJ had the perfect dryness; and as mentioned above, those two needed a foil, not a victim, and Chaaaaaalls fit that perfectly.  The addition of Charles just completed the cast

Charles quickly became my favorite character, mainly because his character growth was so genuine and broad.  I don't know that I'll ever be able to hear [Mozart's Clarinet Quintet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mKUYMQsFwM&feature=youtu.be&t=8) without tearing up a little."
The Office (U.K.),">Early seasons aired on network prime time while the **Vietnam War** was still going on; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, [and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.](https://i.imgur.com/bYp5Zov.jpg)"
The Office (U.K.),This right here.  MASH pretend to be about the Korean War but in actuality is about the Vietnam war.  Being about the past war let it make comments about the current war.
The Office (U.K.),Like one episode: when they're in the ER jammed pack with wounded... and the newsradio is talking about how the US will be advising the French on the growing situation in Vietnam.
The Office (U.K.),"I never once got bored watching the Office.  I think Robert California was the best addition to the Office that one could hope for after Michael left. I find Season 8 just as good as the rest.  I will agree that Season 9 does lag a bit, but Andy kind of turns into a darker version of Michael.  And IMO the finale is great (with the bachelor party and the return of Michael), so the show ends on a high note."
The Office (U.K.),"I didn't get bored so much as I didn't enjoy seasons 8 and 9 the way I did the previous 7. They're still good TV and I still watch them on my re-runs through the seasons (gotta go in order and can't miss any episodes). A shift in tone and energy, and some corny storylines that revolved on the second tier characters made it less watchable then when the focus was on Michael Scott. 

But that's to be expected, because he's by far the funniest character on the show. Dwight comes a strong second, but only as a sidekick. Dwight's energy is best when he works opposite someone (like Jim and Pam), but Rainn Wilson can't carry the show like Steve Carell did. Rainn's the scene-stealer, not the lead.

I agree that Robert California was the best character of the post-Michael Scott era. I enjoyed David Spader's portrayal, as I do in just about anything I've seen him in, and he had some iconic moments that stand up to even the previous 7 seasons great moments. He has true star quality.

But it was good Robert California was used sparingly, because the humor of the show would have become completely different. With Michael, people were comfortable around him to joke back and forth. There was always an air of fear and intimidation around Robert, so if he was at the office all the time that wouldn't make for good viewing."
The Office (U.K.),"Michael was the undoubted lead character so losing him did change the dynamic. There are times I miss him during the last two seasons.  But I feel when Andy takes over (and is in the office) he is a decent Michael stand-in, albeit a much sadder and pathetic version. Breaking Bad is one of my favorites of all time, so I really can’t argue about that.  I just feel the last seasons of The Office get an undeserved bad rap."
The Office (U.K.),"Elementary is surprisingly good. Lucy Liu certainly does not ruin it, she has a really great dynamic with Jonny Lee Miller.

You could try Silent Witness maybe? You seem interested in UK stuff, it's quite good (I would suggest starting from season 8 - a reboot of sorts)

There's also The Blacklist with James Spader which has a case of the week format, it's more FBI than police, but very good."
The Office (U.K.),"Elementary is fun. 

If you wanted something darker, the first season of Hannibal is very mystery-of-the-week. It's also the most beautiful show on TV, if you're into that. "
The Office (U.K.),"There is a ton of UK crime shows that have been on for years that are case of the week in style.

Morse, Touch of Frost, Lewis, Endeavour, Midsomer Murders, Ripper Street, Luther, Prime Suspect, Rebus, Cracker, Whitechapel, Taggart etc. as well as the likes of Miss Marple, Poirot, Jonathan Creek etc."
The Office (U.K.),"Murdoch Mysteries. It's a period piece about a detective in turn of the century Toronto. The characters do have personal drama from time to time, but it's not completely overwhelming."
The Office (U.K.),"Major Crimes is enjoyable.  Not as good as The Closer but still enjoyable.

I think they're getting ready to add a new show to the Chicago group called Chicago Justice (or something like that) which the commercial made seem as if it's going to be like Law & Order.  "
The Office (U.K.),what is your hatred with the Navy? 
The Office (U.K.),"Oh god is it silly at times but ""Lucifer"" is a lot of fun. "
The Office (U.K.),"Search Party is one of my favorite shows of last year. it's in some ways a parody of mystery shows but is perfectly written and acted. 

The Night Of wasn't perfect (kind of falls apart at the end) but I'd say it's worth the journey if you like crime procedurals."
The Office (U.K.),APB looks promising if it can strike the balance right. The basic plot is a Bill Gates type buys a police precinct and gives them advanced tech so they can not suck. Premieres in a couple of weeks. I'm gonna check it out
The Office (U.K.),"Personally I really like Sherlock, but ""Luther"" on BBC or ""Jack Taylor"" are equally good shows but grittier."
The Office (U.K.),You should try out Luther. It's on Netflix I think. 
The Office (U.K.),">Does Lucy Liu ruin Elementary?

Not at all. In fact, as a huge Sherlock Holmes fan, i think she is a great new take on Watson. It's also very refreshing that she never once becomes a romantic love interest. "
Jack Taylor,Sold me. I’ll give it a watch.
Jack Taylor,Is season 2 blending together both Finders Keepers and End of Watch or are you guys basically doing a book per season? I'm hoping its mixed together just to keep Brady in it. 
Jack Taylor,"Did you guys get to meet King? Has he ever visited the set?

Also, Brendan Gleeson is such a bad ass. Tell him to look after himself. I know it's just a character he plays, but I still worry about the guy like I worried about James Gandolfini.

You guys are awesome."
Jack Taylor,"Holland, how do you draw inspiration for Ida’s spunky personality "
Jack Taylor,Never heard of your show so I guess my question is what unique aspect of your show would make me want to watch it?
Jack Taylor,question for jack – who's the most interesting character to direct on the show? stoked for the new season!!
Jack Taylor,"This question is for Holland! What part of Ida’s personality do you identify with the most? 💪
"
Jack Taylor,"With such a sinister show dealing with such serious subject matters, what is it like behind scenes?  Is there ever any laughs or funny bloopers?"
Jack Taylor,"Holland Taylor! Woooo! Okay, that's not a question."
Jack Taylor,"Ok, what do we need to know about that dog that is clearly not a pig?"
Jack Taylor,"Breeda, how is Lou different this season from last?"
Jack Taylor,I’m a big fan of the book series as well as the show. I really liked how season one was the best television adaption of a Stephen King that I have watched in a very long time. What can fans expect from the new season? Is it true that this season will focus more on King’s  End of Watch story and not Finders Keepers? 
Jack Taylor,What would you most like to tell us that no one asks about? 
Jack Taylor,Do you think Ida and Hodges belong together?
Jack Taylor,"Congratulations on an EXCELLENT adaptation so far. How worried are you about the sophomore curse of series adaptation? Look at under the dome, haven in the SK canon. Decent first seasons, and then the plot gets lost. How have you or do you chart a good course? "
Jack Taylor,"Has the network been restrictive with what you can and can't show? Episode 1 started off with a bang and really surprised me with how far the show was going to go. Also, will season 2 be following the story line from Finders Keepers or going right to End of Watch? Love the first season and can't wait for season 2. "
Jack Taylor,"Jack, I think that you’re one of the best directors working in TV today. What is similar or different about directing for Mr Mercedes when compared to directing for the many other shows you were involved in, like Lost for example ( I’m a very big fan of your work on that show)."
Jack Taylor,"For collectors out there, will Season 1 be getting a Blu-ray release alongside the standard DVD release?"
Jack Taylor,What is the very best dessert? 
Jack Taylor,"Breeda, how are you so badass in every scene?! How do you get pumped up to play Lou?"
Jack Taylor,"hi! thanks for doing this AMA :) 

who is the closest to their character in terms of personality on the show? "
Jack Taylor,"Breeda, will you have a more prominent role this upcoming season?  I really loved your character in season one and would love to see more of you! "
Jack Taylor,Are you or were you fans of Stephen King prior to acting on Mr Mercedes? 
Jack Taylor,"Really enjoyed season one and looking forward to the mind-fuckery you're bringing us in the second! I also loved the comic-con experience, especially Brady's basement set. Super cool to see all the details put in there.

My question is: What kind of ice cream treat would you be buying from Brady's truck?"
Jack Taylor,"Holland, if you could play any character other than Ida who would it be? Like - who could you crush an audition for."
Jack Taylor,Holland - will Ida and Hodges finally get together? 
Jack Taylor,"Holland, what would be your best advice to Ida dealing with Hodges’ obsession with Brady?"
Jack Taylor,I loved first season. It was so intense. Is third season possible?
Jack Taylor,Hey guys - what is one of your favorite scenes from season 1?
Jack Taylor,Holland - how do you like working with Brendon Gleeson? 
Jack Taylor,"Thank you all for joining us for the Mr. Mercedes AMA! Make sure to check out Season 2 on August 22, 2018, and catch up on Season 1 at [att.net/MrMercedes](https://att.net/MrMercedes), DIRECTV CH. 239, DIRECTV NOW or U-Verse CH. 1114.  "
Jack Taylor,Hey! Huge fan. Jack - What are your thoughts on the Outsider? Would you be interested in tackling that story?
Jack Taylor,"Ok my most important question; will there be a season 3 ? I worked background for season 2 and enjoyed every minute ! Can't tell what I played but let me tell you you won't want to miss a minute of this !! Working as a "" little guy"" doing background I was treated with respect by Mr. Bender and his crew , this guy is the real deal ! I would be surprised if Mr. Mercedes did not go on for years! Craig A . "
Jack Taylor,What were all of your favorite episodes to film?
Jack Taylor,Any plans on making the show available in the UK?  I watched the first season but it's so difficult to watch over here. 
Jack Taylor,"Hi Holland!

A couple years ago I worked my way through The Practice and have enjoyed seeing you pop up in shows I watch. Even in parts that otherwise might be ""just the love interest"" (like in Mr. Mercedes) you infuse it with character and make them more than ""just a girlfriend""

I did not know Lou was coming back...my memory's a little rusty about how her story arc ended but from what I gather she is gonna be messed up...looking forward to it.

Really enjoyed the show, it was one of the ones that just came out of left field on a relatively obscure channel that got me watching every week. Great cast (a Treadaway in anything is an easy sell for me), great suspense, all around wonderful. Looking forward to season 2."
Jack Taylor,How many of the cast members have read the books (all three)?
Jack Taylor,"Seriously, why did Claire have to raise Aaron herself Bender?"
Jack Taylor,Jack: We are blending them together because our heroes didn't come into Finder's Keepers until a third of the way through the book.
Jack Taylor,"Breeda: Stephen King tapped me on the shoulder at a bar and said “Hey, Steve King here,” and then said, “Lip em, stick em, take em for a ride in the corral,” and then he started reciting lines from Season 1 back to me. This is a true story."
Jack Taylor,Holland: I look deep inside.
Jack Taylor,"Breeda: It's not like any other show on TV. The way it looks, the way it's shot, the story progression is unlike any show.

Holland: It really isn't. Jack Bender had a real vision for this show. Very gritty and dark. Brendan Gleeson is a tremendous actor. You have a richness that combats the grit. It's pretty addictive.

The art direction and set is so similar to reality that you can't believe it's not a real place. Breeda’s trailer makes you want to live in it! The set just inspires you to live a different life. Hodges house is becoming more adapted to living healthy. Shout out to our great production designer, Marek Dobrowolski! "
Jack Taylor,The opening scene should give you a good idea.
Jack Taylor,"Breeda: Lou, obviously.

Jack: This sounds like bullshit but it's not. Every character on our show, and every actor on our show, is extraordinarily complex and challenging. It would be difficult to pick just one. Except sitting next to Breeda, I would say she is high on the list.

Breeda: I'm at least number ten."
Jack Taylor,"Holland: Her ability to care about another person, no matter how distant they may be."
Jack Taylor,"Jack: Constantly.

Breeda: I personally think that it is cathartic and feels good to make art about dark things, and it is very cathartic to do it with talented people who are supportive and safe. There is great reward in bringing dark things to light.

Our crew is really supportive and goofy, and they support and relieve a lot of the tension on set. A lot of the cast have fantastic relationships with the crew. "
Jack Taylor,"Jack: Great, fun crew. Great, fun actors. We deal with the heavy dark stuff and give each other a hug and laugh."
Jack Taylor,"Holland: We usually made fun of a lot of the dark stuff we did, because of course you have to. We're very playful, lively and smart. Jack is a great leader and a REALLY wonderful director. Brendan is so wise, he can usually course correct a scene, and he's always right. "
Jack Taylor,"Breeda: I have found out that little, weak, meek Brady Hartsfield was a secret murderer who could overpower me in an alleyway. Lets just say I'm pretty pissed off when this season starts."
Jack Taylor,"Holland: To be very surprised by the paranormal elements that will come in. Fans may doubt them. The story is so engrossing that you go down the dark hallway, willing. "
Jack Taylor,"Holland: Nobody asks Ida what she thinks about anyone. I got a fan letter from Malaysia recently, in response to my movie about Anne Richards, called ANNE, a play I did on broadway a few years ago. They wrote the most incredible fan letter about it, “in our country the older you are the more respect and interest we have in what you think and feel, and what advice you may have, because the elders are wise. In your own country you have no respect for your elders at all, and especially older women.” I can't tell you how interested I am in the books I read, and the movies I see, and the news. I've never been smarter than I am right now. And there's no interest, especially in Hollywood. It's troubling and odd. Ida is a very smart woman, she reads great literature. But no one is asking her about anything."
Jack Taylor,"Breeda: I don't know if they belong together romantically, but their intimacy is beautiful and the antidote to all the stress and evil of the show.

Holland: Well boy, that was a pretty great answer. I do think that just as older people, they've lived a long time. So a lot of things don't have to be said anymore. The loyalty, care and affection is valuable. There is so much diseased darkness everywhere."
Jack Taylor,"Jack: Thank you very much, it's nice to hear that and every show is different. Whether it's Mr. Mercedes, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, it's always different. But what makes Mr. Mercedes particularly gratifying is that I'm creatively running the show, and for better or for worse."
Jack Taylor,Breeda: Tres leches.
Jack Taylor,Breeda: I think “Hey what have I got to lose?” and then I throw a proverbial pile of shit against a wall and hope that looks good! 
Jack Taylor,"Jack: Brendan Gleeson. That would be my vote. 

Breeda: It’s Holland Taylor. Ida is very much like her.

Jack: Her life is not quite an open book but it's a good book. Dogeared. Highlighted. "
Jack Taylor,"Holland: I think Breeda, in a way. She's wonderfully out there. Spacey, smart, and weird. "
Jack Taylor,"Holland: I'm not a fan of being scared. I don't want to go to something designed to scare you. I don't mind being scared in a narrative, although I do testify he is a genius. I've seen the classics of course, because I'm nobody's fool."
Jack Taylor,"Holland: I'm really boring when it comes to ice cream because I'm a true addict. And I like, as they say… the white stuff. And I like the cone, because I like licking it. Don't give me no spoon. Unless its a very, very, tiny silver spoon, like for a demitasse. "
Jack Taylor,"Holland: I would love to try Holly. I would never accept the name though, I would make them change the name. My own name is completely unusual. The particular way she is mentally disturbed and afflicted would be a great challenge. I would love to slip into that uncontrolled nature."
Jack Taylor,Holland: Just keep a hand on the reins and try to yank him off course once in a while. 
Jack Taylor,"Holland: You know, it all runs together. In the pilot episode, the character was very established. She was so strong and pugnacious in her progressive ways. It was masterful writing and it was great to play. "
Jack Taylor,"Holland: Fascinating, joyous, relaxed, because you're so confident in him. He will make anything work, and he will make it work for you. He's just a mountain."
Jack Taylor,"Jack: That's like asking me ""what's my favorite Beatles song. It's hard to answer- they're all my favorite children.

Breeda: Episode ten is going to blow everyone's socks off. It's awesome."
Jack Taylor,"Holland: It's a dark world, so it's not like a favorite in the sense of “fun” or “lovely.” But my favorite was an episode where Bill was badly injured and I find him. It was fulfilling to film because you realize how lively the inner artistic responsive is in a character that you've been building for a long time. It's both upsetting and enlivening. "
Jack Taylor,"That's what I thought but thanks for the confirmation. Season 1 was excellent, cant wait for season 2!"
Jack Taylor,"That's so cool, Breeda. I wish good things for you.

I look forward to seeing you guys on screen soon. Have a good season, guys."
Jack Taylor,I'll give it a shot.
Jack Taylor,Jack: I'm boring. Apple pie with chunky apples and vanilla ice cream. I like a little lemon in there.
Jack Taylor,its a dope show. I watch way more TV than I should lol.

Jack Taylor,"Turk and JD.

Data and Geordie.

G'Kar and Londo, and Vir and Londo."
Jack Taylor,Kevin and Nora from The Leftovers!
Jack Taylor,Buffy and Angel
Jack Taylor,Tony and Carmela from The Sopranos. Healthy relationship? Not so much. Addicting to watch? Absolutely.
Jack Taylor,Ragnar Lothbrok and Lagertha
Generation War,"The German title is ""Our Fathers, Our Mothers."" Brings a whole new level to the show, imagining that the show is depicting the lives of your parents and grandparents."
Generation War,"You should check Heimat, it's quite a bit longer spanning from the end of WWI into the 80s. "
Generation War,Ugh. Not on Canadian Netflix. I guess I'll be sailing the high seas. 
Generation War,"I actually saw this in theaters, in a single sitting with one break in the middle. It was a crazy viewing experience, and I spoke to a couple in the audience during the break who were both Holocaust survivors."
Generation War,This was great. Definitely the best war series I have seen. 
Generation War,"I like Generation War as a series. But if you watch, I beg you not to take it as historically accurate. There are several key problems with the series depiction of facts. I would still recommend it, but don't go posting TILs based on some stuff that happened in it"
Generation War,"It is three episodes and the first two episodes are great. 

The third episodes completely shits the bed. The third part takes the brilliant set up of the first two and just throws it out the window. "
Generation War,i watched it when it came out a long time ago. And I 've re watched it twice since
Generation War,I can't seem to find it on Netflix. Are you talking American Netflix?
Generation War,"Just watched the 3 episodes again tonight....

A Very Good film"
Generation War,"Thank you, OP for bringing light to this. Have wanted to watch one from their perspective for a while."
Generation War,I cried for the first time in 6 years watching this. 9/10
Generation War,"It's a great series. It shows how the German soldiers were just as human as us. Fighting for their country, just like us. They were just people. Some greatly mislead, but still people. 
There are critics saying it lets Germans off too easily. That it doesn't excuse them. But, that's kind of missing the point. 

"
Generation War,Wanted to watch this ... obviously with English subtitles needed... so I resorted to torrent ... couldn't find it on Netflix ... sigh 
Generation War,Is it in English?
Generation War,Definitely recommend myself too.
Generation War,"I watched the German version (Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter). It was great. Six young adults caught in a mess they didn't initially understand and could do nothing to prevent. "
Generation War,"It was a cheap shitty bag of cliches.

The battle scenes either looked cartoonish with the badly placed CGI or empty because they had so few extras.

I also get tired of the trope of the jewish resistance fighter. And the stupid chance meetings of the characters."
Generation War,Do the Germans win in this version??
Generation War,"""A bit longer spanning"""
Generation War,Where can I watch it?
Generation War,Lame I wish we could still use the US Netflix with a VPN. Has anyone found a fix for this or a VPN that still works?
Generation War,Just remember to support the creators of media you enjoy when you find reasonably priced deals and I have absolutely 0 problems with that
Generation War,...Have you watched Band of Brothers?
Generation War,"There was a lot of controversy in Poland connected with that TV series when it was shown in the national TV. The way Polish Home Army was portrayed was absolutely insulting, like a bunch of antisemites and criminals. From Polish point of view Germans made a series about how they also suffered from the war, those same Germans that started the war(I know there's a lot more to it, ordinary people didn't start it), who created death camps and Holocaust, and they show Poles that suffered terribly under German occupation, as antisemites. It was outrageous. There were actual, albeit small, protests against airing it by national TV and therefore paying producers. This year 92yo Home Army vet, and National Assosciation of Home Army Soldiers took legal action demanding apology from the producers of the TV series."
Generation War,Who posts TILs based on 'facts' in films anyway? 
Generation War,"I dunno, based on Nate Fick's account in his book it pretty much matches up with things."
Generation War,"Found some sources saying it is on US Netflix, they might have pulled it though"
Generation War,"I just finished watching it on UK netflix.
"
Generation War,"It's on Netflix uk ..... watched it tonight

Type it in Search...."
Generation War,I am going through the same thing.  I haven't found a good torrent yet.  May I ask where you got it?  The only one I found was for an mkv codec that none of my systems supported.
Generation War,Subtitles
Generation War,So you want a WWII series that ignores important groups of people because you're tired of seeing them? Might as well get rid of the Germans too. Nazis in a WWII movie? That's so cliché. 
Generation War,"Man nobody wins in this version, it's like the last act of hamlet, with germans and ukrainians.

"
Generation War,"The reasonably priced deal part is where I struggle. I do buy things I pirate if I find them at a good price, but often I don't find them. "
Generation War,I couldn't stop watching once I started. Awesome 
Generation War,Or The Pacific?
Generation War,"Pole here, I think people in Poland collaborated with the nazis much more than they would care to admit (as did anyone). Yes, Poland suffered the most in the war and yes, Poland has the highest number of people that put their necks on the line to help Jews but I don't believe we can say that during that time Poles generally treated Jews as equals.

""The painted bird"" is a good yet horrible book that tells the story of a jewish child that went through that time, the author swears it is real as well and it paints a similar picture to the show (obviously the author got death threats more than once because of how he depicted rural Poland). Personally I think the degree of antisemitism varied accross the land and whether we are talking about cities or towns (Family was from Lwów and spoke of others being considerate)"
Generation War,"But there is only one single scene in the mini series where a polish home army soldier makes an antisemitic remark (as far as I can remember) and one also has to acknowledge that there indeed _was_ antisemitism in the polish home army. [Wikipedia has a pretty lengthy paragraph about this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Army#Relations_with_Jews) I think this scene in the series should be seen as the attempt to show how common antisemitism was back then and not as the attempt to make the entire polish home army appear as antisemites. Still though, I agree that it could have been executed differently to achieve the same."
Generation War,TIL Oskar Schindler looks like an Irish Fidel Castro.
Generation War,">...Nate Fick...


You're confusing this with Generation Kill. I don't think the Germans fought in Basra and Baghdad :)."
Generation War,Thanks ! I'll try it 😊
Generation War,"The whole premise of the tv-series was to show ""the average"" German during the war, hence the original title ""Our mothers, our fathers"".  
That's what they advertised with here in Germany. That and the historical accuracy.
And sorry to break it for you but Jewish resistance fighters were not the ""average germans"". Neither were highly intellectual pacifists.  
Every single baddie in this show is a child-killing full-time Nazi, a caricature of what a child thinks the Nazis were. It's neither historically accurate nor is it good in any other way.
"
Generation War,"Lol fictional jewish resistance fighters were ""important""?

There were plenty of other victims in that movie you seem to have curiously overlooked such as the little girl shot in the head.

One of the main criticisms of the series was that it claimed to show the ""average German's"" role in the war while  showing only one group of young people and this too low ranking to be responsible for anything of significance."
Generation War,"If you wouldn't have bought something you pirated you do no damage to the industry by pirating it, in fact you do more good than bad because you spread the word. Do make sure you wouldn't have bought what you are pirating and you are doing good, not wrong by the creators. And of course if something lowers in price which you previously enjoyed for free you owe it to whoever provided you with that cool service to contribute.

Just don't be an asshole and it's all gucci"
Generation War,"Do you think ""raging anti-semite"" is the **representative** portrayal of an average Pole at the time? Because that's the problem here. Not that *a* Pole is being shown as an anti-semite but that *the* Poles is being shown as such. 

Note that nobody really protested when such portrayal has been shown in the Pianist - there's both the woman who wants to sell out the main character as well as the dude who is supposed to help him but doesn't care and is a drunk. That's beacuse it was a balanced portrayal - good people, bad people and everyone in between. Unsere Vatter, Unsere Mutter is not that  and not by any means by accident. Germany has had a hand in slow and meticulous whitewashing of their own history and shifting blame on others.  Which is very different from exploring the greys of history."
Generation War,"The article you linked mentions anisemitism among the Home Army as a matter of historical dispute, there definitely were examples of antisemitism(I think that in any group as large as 400 000 you'll find antisemites, just statistical probability)but how minor those events were in the scale of the whole organisation. That's the problem, the scenes in the series and Viktors storyline(HA soldiers making remarks such as ""we drown Jews like cats"" or the commander having an ability to ""smell a Jew"", or the HA abandoning Jews in  the train) paint an awful, oversimplified picture of polish resistance. The way German producers focused on this aspect of HA, while the German protagonists are all non-Nazis, hurt, and disagreeing with the war just feels really unjust and hypocritical to me."
Generation War,u/ArkGuardian's comment made it seem like he was taking about Generation Kill.
Generation War,"I like the cut of your jib, sir. "
Generation War,"No, but it might be of the average rural resistance Polish social norms. Yes, I did find the Polish antisemitism overly exaggerated but nowhere as breaking as people who are complaining about it say it is"
Generation War,"Honestly though, almost everyone hated the Jews back then. I don't get why people are freaking out about this. They hated the Jews 1000 years ago, 500 years ago, 100 years ago. People didn't just stop magically hating the Jews in 1939. "
Generation War,"Title is Generation War
>I like Generation War as a series
>WW2

Don't blame me here"
Generation War,I am sensing agenda. Not surprising.
Generation War,Oh wow I missed that... I'm sleep deprived af. Sorry about that.
Generation War,? The hell are you going on about
Generation War,"I watched this show on a bit of a whim for extra credit in a World War II history course. I was blown away with how good it was. After watching this, Babylon Berlin, and Dark, I can say with certainty that Germany is producing some excellent stuff!"
Generation War,"I've watched *Generation War* myself - it's good, but arguably a bit too coincidence heavy (a similar problem that *World on Fire* is having at the moment). I know Poles objected about their depiction as antisemitic in it."
Generation War,"Misread the title, thought the OP was talking about Generation Kill.

Though really I would recommend watching both."
Generation War,Thanks! I’ll definitely be checking that out. Once it got announced that “Masters of the Air” was being made I started to get an itch to rewatch Band of Brothers and The Pacific. Generation War sounds right up my alley (and less time consuming than rewatching all of Band of Brothers).
Generation War,Yep.  I'm just waiting for a little more time to pass before I watch it again.
Generation War,"The first two episodes are spectacular, the third and final one is terrible.  It is jarring how hard the mini series face plants."
Generation War,I thought the coincidences were stacked pretty high until I watched the expanse and one tiny spaceship is involved in almost every controversy in the universe!
Generation War,"Interesting, I never picked up on this and just assumed it was the same character. Pretty great show."
Generation War,"I think Charlotte is traumatised and racked with guilt over what she did -- so she sees a woman (who is the same actress. The woman who plays Lilija has blue eyes irl) who looks like her, she genuinely does think it's Lilija."
Generation War,"Interesting analysis, so you believe they are meant to be two different characters but they used the same actress?"
Generation War,"I think so, yeah. Otherwise they would have made an effort for the two characters to have the same eye colour. Also, the Soviet solider never acknowledges Charlotte's words of her being Lilija. She only acknowledges Charlotte asking why she was saved."
Generation War,"I watched this over the past three days. Very well made, super high production values and more combat than I expected. Pretty good story with a few weak spots but overall it is good, in a depressing way.

It has been called the German Band of Brothers which I can see the similarities but because it also focuses on the home front a little and non-combat roles it differs.

It follows five young adults from 1941 through the Eastern Front campaign to 1945 and the end of the war. On netflix USA with Subtitles and closed captions.

"
Generation War,This sounds interesting. Does it come across like band of brothers: the Nazi side?
Generation War,Can I watch it on Canadian or American netflix?
Generation War, You think it's more like The Pacific or Band of Brothers? Thank you for posting this I did not know it existed I'm definitely on that.
Generation War,"It's Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter. For those like me that had to click the link to find out."
Generation War,"Isn't it called Our Fathers, Our Mothers? That's what it was called when I watched it.."
Generation War,"Kinda, in that it tells a story from 1941 to 1945 with a group of five people in different locations (generally) but not quite the same as BoB which, because it is longer, goes a bit more in depth into a single campaign. 

Worth the watch though, it's on netflix."
Generation War,Its on American netflix but don't know about Canada 
Generation War,"I have both, so it's all good"
Generation War,"I really liked it a whole lot aswell. Here in Germany it's called ""Unsere Mütter, Unsere Väter"" , which translates to ""Our Mothers, Our Fathers"". 
"
Generation War,"Yeah, I caught it on Netflix a few months ago, and was really, really impressed. I also don't think it white-washes or downplays German complicity in wartime atrocities. There were obviously people who were only tangentially (if at all) related to the Holocaust while still serving the German state, and I think it is important that their story is told as well. I think the series did a great job of acknowledging the darkest aspects of National Socialism while still putting a human face on the average German citizen of that period. "
Generation War,"MC is total bullshit on this for obvious reason. What kind of ridiculous quote is this?

>the refusal of Generation War to focus on any other sort of German makes it both dramatically and historically suspect

Shove your suspect, Mr. Mohan, in the wide crapper where it belongs (I got very explicit in my language because of the Pete and Horace I am watching right now). 

"
Generation War,"It's really not that good. It glosses over German war crimes and the levels of Nazism in German Youth. It also has some blatantly disrespectful inaccuracies - most notably by portraying the Polish resistance fighters as the most anti-semetic people in Europe. 

I went in expecting to be floored away, but I was very underwhelmed."
Generation War,"I really liked it too. 
There were complaints that the show was too appologist for the crimes of the german people, which may be fair. but imho it's the best show from the 'other side' of the war."
Generation War,Yeah I was going to write that in the title but English title is more popular? So some people might not understand it.
Generation War,I watched the films a few days ago and war crimes are portrayed. If I remember correctly one of the main characters even shoots a few children (without showing any emotions.)
Generation War,Yeah it was by far the best I have ever seen and such an emotional one too.
Generation War,"One of the reason The Pacific feels different is that there basically wasn't a group of chummy Marines or Soldiers that all made it through the war and major battles together. It was a *brutal* campaign. 

Hard to have an ensemble cast when there is basically no opportunity to do so and keep it somewhat historically accurate."
Generation War,"> It felt like a documentary at times, you can feel what's like to be there, overall a great series. 

I can't tell if you realise this, but it basically is. Read this series - [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-killer-elite-115107/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-killer-elite-115107/)

Generation Kill is based on these articles, which were written by a journalist embedded in Iraq."
Generation War,"If you enjoy war series that a look at those:

* Soviet Storm (Russian) WW2
* Generation War (German) WW2
* The Unknown War (American) WW2
* The World at War (British) WW2
* Our World War (British) WW1
* Valley of Tears (Israeli) Yom Kippur"
Generation War,"Grooooooooomiiiiiin... standaaaard!!!!

&#x200B;

POLICE THAT MOOOOSTACHE!!!!!!  YER STARTIN TO LOOK LIKE COWBOY ELVIS'S!"
Generation War,"I watched all 3 during this pandemic, while I've seen BoB 3 times already. G.K. has now surpassed the other 2 for me. It's just so real. BoB is still fantastic.

No hate on The Pacific, but it's not as good imo.. there's a third show in the works from Hanks/Spielberg"
Generation War,GK is the best one because its far more realistic and cynical about war and American imperialism. BoB is amazing but its a lot of jerking off the Greatest Generation and romanticising WW2
Generation War,">I know that The Pacific front lasted way longer than the Western Front

You have that backwards mate."
Generation War,"I love BOB, showed it to my younger brother to try and teach him about heroism and leadership etc. Kind of a boomer move on my part tbh. However, I think the idealism etc of the WW2 generation doesn't work anymore today. I didn't show him the Pacific because I want him to stay hopeful and naive lol — we'll watch it when he turns 18.

Generation Kill I haven't seen since 2008 I think. You've inspired me to rewatch! Thanks OP."
Generation War,"Generation Kill is especially strong because its based on a real story. Written by the embeded journalist with that unit. Real Iceman talking about being an adrenalin junkie thanks to war iirc and Fruity Rudy actually playing himself.

BoB is imo a great cinematographic show with somewhat romanticized view of WW 2 heroes. Gen Kill is just the shit frok soldiers point of view. My absolutely favourite series."
Generation War,"I just finished reading *Helmet for my Pillow* and *With the Old Breed* by Leckie and Sledge, I highly recommend them."
Generation War,[deleted]
Generation War,"This is a really good artiulation of some of the things I felt. I own the DVD box set of BoB my dad gave me, and I've watched it umpteenth number of times, but i just watched the Pacific and GK this last week."
Generation War,"Aside from maybe Chesty Puller and the division/regimental commanders it's highly likely there wasn't a single enlisted Marine who managed to remain a part of the island hopping campaign from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.  Those fights only became increasingly more bloody and brutal as the war dragged on, and Japan with it's bushido code inductees soldiers into sacrificing anything and anyone to bless their enemies just a little. Not to mention how every single Marine battle required a d day style amphibious landing which almost guarantees heavy casualties for the 1st wave. Imagine Marine rifleman having to endure an omaha beach or tarawa style landing more than once in a tour plus all the other fighting.

The Germans in Band of Brothers while ruthlessly efficient in their defense of their conquered territories still maintained somewhat similar rules of conduct, at least on the Western Front. Not to mention the majority of German soldiers themselves weren't fanatical to the point where they were going to die needlessly.  Not to say that European theater vets had it easy, but even they were able to meet civilians that spoke their language, civilians weren't wholesale used as human shields, and they were even given liberties bank to liberate territory like Paris.

Whereas in the Pacific it was the complete opposite right down to the in between of campaigns. Imagine Dick Winters in 44 is getting a liberty in Paris to try and forget how about 100 miles away men are still dying by the truck loads over miles at a time.  At the same time the Marines that liberated the Solomon Islands from the fanatical Japanese by the skin of their teeth are stationed in a veritable purgatory of Pavuvu. A logging camp infested with crabs, parasites, and no women for a thousand miles aside from the medical personnel who are explicitly off limits."
Generation War,"I think people regularly ignore this fact. Guadalcanal was fucking terrible. Add to that it’s Marines who (self deprecatingly truthfully) are some of the best terrible people you can ever know, and it isn’t the glitzy Hollywood story time. It’s raw, muddy, and real because that’s all there was. Yes brotherhood and self sacrifice emerged, and heroes were identified, but those guys knew true hell the likes of which weren’t seen in other places. Not to short change easy company because their war was anything but easy. But you had a comradeship and like ability that isn’t generally found in Marines."
Generation War,ANZACS - 80s miniseries from Australia about WW1
Generation War,Great!!!  thnk you!
Generation War,That guy is currently serving thirty years in prison for sexual abuse of three children btw.
New Girl,Shall I compare thee to a summers day?   No because a summers day is not a bitch.
New Girl,"""I'm not convinced I know how to read, I've just memorized a lot of words."""
New Girl,You gave me cookie I got you cookie
New Girl,"Fucking love New Girl.  If you guys have Netflix and wanna watch a funny sitcom, give this one a try.  Schmidt, Nick and Winston are brilliant characters and always bring the funny."
New Girl,"I used to rotate between The Office, Parks & Rec, and New Girl as my go to shows to just have in the background. Netflix has now lost them all."
New Girl,“Hey ladies. Wanna see a grown man cry? No? THEN GET OUUUT!”
New Girl,Classic Peacock & Hulu mess around.
New Girl,"Pretty interesting that they're going with a non-exclusive license with Peacock, considering that they fully-own the show. They did the same thing with Modern Family but that had the added complication of having a distribution deal with NBCU's USA network. 

Shows the ""all exclusive content all the time"" mantra of two years ago is dying, or at least being pared back significantly. Sometimes licensing money is nice!"
New Girl,"Netflix is eventually going to be stuck with all their original unfinished content.

I think they should make less content so they're not forced to cancel so much, and focus on building up their streaming library with actual finished material."
New Girl,"goddamn, I still need to figure out the rules to True American.."
New Girl,Is it staying on Disney+?
New Girl,"True story, my youngest daughter is named after Zooey Deschanel’s character in this."
New Girl,New Girl should be called The Nick Show and focus more on Nick.
New Girl,Sounds like Hulu is trying to fancy fix their streaming catalogue
New Girl,I had no expectations going into this show and Schmidt became one of my favorite characters
New Girl,I guess if you’re gonna party with some havarti you gotta go to Hulu!
New Girl,"Already gone in Canada, I wanted to throw in a random episode yesterday and was devastated lol"
New Girl,When you sit back up your butt is going to make the perfect butt angel in the sand CC
New Girl,Lol. What content does Netflix still have?
New Girl,Where's that Girl?  Where's that Girl?  It's Hulu!
New Girl,Basically your choices are to pay for all streaming services or to pay for none. Raise the skull and crossbones.
New Girl,Way hay and up she rises…
New Girl,"Welp, there goes my Netflix subscription. It was the only thing I watched"
New Girl,It is funny hiw this is relevant only to some countries. We do not have New Girl on Netflix at all but rather on Disney+
New Girl,"and I would add that ironically, Seasons 3-6 of New Girl is what they try so hard to make themselves and fail. Comfort TV, not-offending, you can always watch, say ""it's nice"" and kinda enjoy. (Seasons 1-2 are straight up brilliant)

Like I wish they would aim higher, but even when aiming to the middle Netflix currently miss"
New Girl,Schmidt was the only good character anyway
New Girl,"How crappy. I’m in Canada, we don’t have Peacock but still lose New Girl, and Prime lost Parks and Rec as well."
New Girl,Old Girl
New Girl,"Oh no!


Anyway….."
New Girl,I just watch trailer park boys on repeat.
New Girl,Good I hated it anyway
New Girl,Wait that’s the reaction gif guy. The black guy.
New Girl,No one will care
New Girl,"Crap show leaving one service I own for another service I own.

\*yawn\*"
New Girl,"Oh no, a show I don’t watch won’t be available to not watch anymore. Sad face."
New Girl,Aaaaand now I'll be pirating it.
New Girl,"Well, at least you get to choose between Hulu and Peacock"
New Girl,Stop being so whimsical Winston!
New Girl,Nooooo
New Girl,HEY GIRL WHAT THAT THANG DO
New Girl,GAVE ME COOKIE GOTYOUCOOKIE
New Girl,It's a tremendous comfort show.
New Girl,"Nick miler, nick miller, streets of Chicago has been stuck in my head for like 2 weeks and i havent even sen the show in like a year.

Time for a rewatch"
New Girl,That broken penis episode is still one of the funniest episodes I've seen.
New Girl,It was never on Netflix for me. We have it on Disney+ since it launched here.
New Girl,*If you have Hulu/netflix
New Girl,It’s the only reason aside from avatar I still have Netflix lol
New Girl,Does it get better after the first season? Got like 5 episodes in and just wasn’t vibing with it
New Girl,I rotate between the office and parks quite a bit so I end up spending a lot of time on Peacock.
New Girl,Netflix is losing a lot. Peacock is trying to get all the fan favorites.
New Girl,"Add in Community! It released in the same era as those 3, is really easy to watch, and it’s still on Netflix."
New Girl,"Here’s the thing: I realized that I have basically been using Netflix as my “background show” service.

**That is not worth sixteen dollars a month**, especially when that is with their lowest quality of “high def” video.

Now, they don’t even have any shows to have on in the background! And most of their original content is trash.

Peacock is $9/mo. and it’s 4K HDR and has a lot more quality content. Even Hulu and HBO and Apple TV+ are better deals.

I canceled Netflix two months ago."
New Girl,Add Brooklyn 99 in that rotation
New Girl,All i need is Seinfeld
New Girl,"In the UK we still have The Office (US) on Netflix. That said I still subscribed to Peacock as I end up watching The Office every few months (for years now), so those Superfan episodes were definitely worth the cost for me. Just wished they would release the seasons more quickly."
New Girl,"Unsubbed recently, join the resistance! 

Those bastards have been bleeding so much content, creating terrible shows, cancelling great ones, raising prices, and they're cracking down on password sharing. How many more reasons do you need to give them at least a warning shot and unsub for a few months?"
New Girl,"Yeah,streaming services now  probably have more data showing if X Series doesn't drive subscriptions it's probably better to make it non exclusive and get some additional revenue,especially if it's with a flailing steamer like Peacock who you lease it to.They are probably not viewed by Disney,HBO,Netflix,Prime etc as a threat."
New Girl,"Comcast/Universal still owns a third of Hulu (even though it’s 2/3rds owned by Disney), so I figure that that played a role."
New Girl,"Their current model actually puts me off of even trying their new content. I don't have confidence that their new shows:

1. will be good, or
2. will be worth getting into before they get cancelled"
New Girl,">Netflix is eventually going to be stuck with all their original unfinished content.

You know that most material they have is actually finished right?


>I think they should make less content so they're not forced to cancel so much,

I don't think it's really possible to cater to such a huge and diverse user base without creating massive amounts of content, they need a reason to stay."
New Girl,"even their original content eventually leaves. Look at the Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Punisher series"
New Girl,FDR!
New Girl,Asking the real questions.
New Girl,New Girl is on Disney??
New Girl,**WHO'S THAT GIRL**
New Girl,No they should make a cop show that follows Winnie the Bish.
New Girl,it's on Disney+ here
New Girl,"What the goddamn fuck, I was literally on the last season and watched an episode a few days ago"
New Girl,My *biggest* concern is the smell
New Girl,"I mean just because McDonalds doesn't sell pizza and Domino's doesn't sell burgers, I don't just jump to stealing food."
New Girl,"Or to pay for one. Or two. Or three. Or switch ‘em up a couple times a year…

All this bitching about having the most consumer choice in television than ever before is getting pretty tiresome."
New Girl,This show cost me like $30 to just own on vudu
New Girl,"If you only watch 1 show its never worth to sub to any of the streamers.

Just pirate it."
New Girl,"Schmidt is the worst character next to Jess. Winnie the Bish, Nick and Coach make that show. Shit, even Ferguson is a better character than Schmidt. The only thing he does is just scream complain about things, so obnoxious."
New Girl,"New Girl is already on Disney+, which houses pretty much all the Hulu shows anyway."
New Girl,Imagine having the kind of day where you decide a post like this is a good use of your time.
New Girl,"I think his show is overrated but there is a huge fanbase that loves it and they certainly will care. 

And it’s like the last big sitcom still left on Netflix other than Seinfeld. It’s pretty sad to see how things have changed"
New Girl,I yell this to my friend all the time
New Girl,"I didn't break up with her.

... what do you mean?

I'm still dating her. And Elizabeth.

... what do you mean? 

Ok, you handle this how you need.

https://youtu.be/k1cjQDTD_ww"
New Girl,New Girl and Happy Endings fill a post-Friends itch for me
New Girl,The ice in my glass represents the tears in my eyes
New Girl,It's on Disney+ in Canada for sure. Not sure about other countries.
New Girl,"Absolutely. First season is very much focused on Zooey Deschanel's arc. It becomes much more of an ensemble show, and a hilarious one at that."
New Girl,Yes!
New Girl,Peacock is straight garbage on my playstation. I subscribed and then stopped because it was so bad.
New Girl,"That’s because Peacock (part of Comcast) is simply “reclaiming” shows that were produced by Universal (and aired on NBC), both part of Comcast.   With many studios affiliated with/related to streaming services (HBOMax = WB, Paramount Plus = Paramount, Disney+ and most of Hulu = Disney), it’s no surprise that they want to bolster their subscription services’ libraries.  Hulu is still partly owned by Comcast (though operated by Disney the majority owner), so that’s probably why “New Girl” is headed there, too."
New Girl,"I'm glad Peacock and Netflix are included in my cable costs.  I know it is ""being charged"" but it's two less individual streamers that are charged separately."
New Girl,That’s less than a cost of an average meal out for a service that I use the most if I am using it for background shows. Just saying how much it’s worth that cost is definitely perspective
New Girl,Exactly. And they're so quick to cancel too. Seems if you don't watch something in the first 3 weeks it might be too late.
New Girl,JFK!
New Girl,Yes
New Girl,"Who's that girl~ 

IT'S YOUR FAVOURITE BITCH, JESS!"
New Girl,Vlad the Impaler.
New Girl,With some episodes featuring a team-up with Julius Pepperwood.
New Girl,Disney+
New Girl,"McDonald's used to sell pizza though. 

That doesn't add anything to your analogy, it's just a fun fact."
New Girl,You can just purchase shows. This show was like $30 to own on Vudu. iTunes and Amazon probably have had similar prices.
New Girl,So Schmidty...I read it in his voice
New Girl,"Disney+ only gets the Hulu shows that are owned by Disney.  Hulu also has shows from Paramount, Warner Bros., Universal, MGM, etc."
New Girl,"I actually think its interesting to see how values of content often wildly drop fairly quickly. This show is only like 5 years old after airing or so and the value likely dropped to almost nothing on the secondary market -- its a interesting indication of the type of content that holds value and those that don't.

Even ""good"" content can quickly lose value, its interesting to see which dies and some which become successes after the fact, or if its only really mega hits, like The Office or Seinfeld driving the train and everything else is of minor value.

For example, there's a lot of Sony content out there, and MGM, good stuff, but the value is basically zero, even though they were popular movies and TV shows, and literally no one even wants to take the time to write up a contract or have ops put them on services to clog them up"
Forensic Files,Because all the stuff on the Disney app is super quiet and forensics files is compressed
Forensic Files,"Compression.

But yeah, I’ve noticed that too."
Forensic Files,It's probably due to them using different sound formats. I have to decrease my TV's volume multiple times while on Netflix because some shows with 5.1 have louder audio while a lot of them don't.
Forensic Files,Watching in stereo vs in surround?
Forensic Files,I believe that commercial rule was for O.T.A. only?
Forensic Files,Does compression boost the volume? On Apple TV there is quite a bit of volume difference between apps but I also notice volume differences between shows on the Netflix app.
Forensic Files,They are talking about difference in the sound levels on shows. Not on ads.
Forensic Files,"It’s not that it boost the volume, it’s that it puts all sounds at the same level, so it sounds louder. It’s why commercials used to blow your ears out.

Most sound is a mix of loud and soft. When you compress, you put all the soft sounds in the loud levels. So even though it might be the same dB, it’s perceived as much louder because there’s no soft levels to break it up."
Forensic Files,"Compression is where the dynamic range, the range from the quietest to the loudest thing, is decreased. Older TV especially has almost no dynamic range whereas the newer shows try to go for a cinematic approach by having terribly quiet dialogue, so you turn it up, then blow up your speakers when there's gunfire or an explosion.

I hate it because my hearing isn't great so i tend to hold the remote during the shows."
Forensic Files,"Got it. So this would be why YouTube on Apple TV is so much louder than Hulu or Netflix then. 

Aren’t commercials still highly compressed? I thought that when the government made them stop cranking the volume up on ads they cheated the system by doing what you described."
Forensic Files,Yeah I’ve had to crank up the center channel to boost the dialog that gets drowned out by other sounds on more recent movies.
Forensic Files,"Yes, yes, and unfortunately yes."
Forensic Files,Great show! Really taught me about forensic science way before most people even knew what forensic science was. Made want to be a FS but Im too dumb. 
Forensic Files,It's also the best show to fall asleep to when you've seen all of the episodes multiple times. Peter Thomas' voice is so soothing.
Forensic Files,I interned on the show around 2004. It had an amazing run. 
Forensic Files,It's currently my background noise when I go to sleep. That music in the beginning tho...
Forensic Files,what about the music? curious to see what you say
Forensic Files,Uh...I like it. 
Forensic Files,"I dunno what they will say, but it is pretty retro. My problem is I find it wakes me up if I fall asleep to multiple episodes. "
Forensic Files,Depends on the detective. The educated ones know it's BS but they use it as a tool to fuck with people. Like if you watch Kenda on ID (Homicide Hunter) he gives a good description a few times of how a polygraph *should* be used. This belief in the polygraph just a common misconception that permeates law enforcement.
Forensic Files,obligatory clip from the wire: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN7pkFNEg5c
Forensic Files,"/r/skeptic

Polygraphs are bullshit. They are just a complex tool that the administrator uses to get the subject to implicate themselves."
Forensic Files,I swear to god they make words up on that show
Forensic Files,There is a free 24/7 Forensic Files channel on pluto.tv FYI.
Forensic Files,"get the free Investigation Discovery app too

but yeah, polygraphs get too much respect."
Forensic Files,Those episodes are old. Now people reject the polygraph unless you're a liberal senator trying to stop a Supreme Court nominee.
Forensic Files,They've made Escape useless to me.
Forensic Files,So they just changed the name then? That’s already what Escape would air anyway.
Forensic Files,"Forensic Files is a classic. However, it ended like in 2011 after 14 seasons and the famous narrator Peter Thomas died in 2016 at age 91. It is all re-runs. Same episodes over and over again.  Someone really need to make more episodes and bring back Forensic Files. "
Forensic Files,"You're not wrong. I've noticed this, too. Here is their TV schedule:

http://www.ontvtonight.com/guide/listings/channel/69047084/hln.html"
Forensic Files,I remember when it used to be an actual news channel.  In high school our civics teacher had us watch it for a few minutes a day for a project.
Forensic Files,I literally have had this same thought 
Forensic Files,"Has there been an episode of forensic files where the science was proven wrong and the “criminal” exonerated later?

Kind of like that guy Texas executed for burning his family alive when it was really an electrical fire. Apparently most arson “science” is horseshit."
Forensic Files,"Oh man I didn't know he died 😢 your right, maybe they should make new seasons of the show. It could be cool 👍"
Forensic Files,Jeez! Why not rename the channel Forensic Files then... I'm wondering if they just don't have any other programs to show or if that's the only thing that attracts viewers...
Forensic Files,"My world history teacher has us watch CNN Everytime we come in, so I can relate lol"
Forensic Files,😂😂heyyy Kyle 
Forensic Files,I believe [Joyce Gilchrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Gilchrist) appeared in a couple of episodes. 
Forensic Files,"If Forensic Files is right up your alley, check out the cable channel Investigation Discovery (ID).  The whole channel is dedicated to shows just like Forensic Files. There is a real life murder/serious crime and there is reenactment, interviews with police officers/forensic that was involved with the case, and show how the criminal was captured. Investigation Discovery produce their own shows so each individual show has a theme for the crime: Swamp Murders, Blood Relatives, Evil Twins, Deadly Woman, Fatal Vows, Fear Thy Neighbor, Obsession Dark Desires, Homicide Hunter, etc.  

"
Forensic Files,I've noticed more and more channels are doing this kind of thing lately. [ION TV](https://iontelevision.com/schedule) will spend the entire day playing back to back reruns of CSI or Law & Order.
Forensic Files,who dis ??
Forensic Files,"wow, thanks, didnt expect an answer lol"
Forensic Files,"Hey bro, sounds real cool! 😎😎I'll check and see if I have Investigation Discovery and i do, I'll binge watch everything it has ;) 😂 👌"
Forensic Files,I'm pretty sure some people would love that... Probably that's their way of fighting back Netflix and Hulu by putting on the same shows like that.
Forensic Files,[deleted]
Forensic Files,"TF...? Ya username is kylebb and I just randomly said ""hey Kyle"" because I thought you had a nice name "
Forensic Files,Omfg. Please. No. Not. That.
Forensic Files,Np ;) 😂
Forensic Files,Murderers on Forensic Files are usually some pretty brutal killers. Kill those bastards.
Forensic Files,"I always skipped those anyway- what bugs me in hindsight is that some of the cases have relied on forensic methods that are now viewed skeptically, like forensic odontology, fiber analysis, hair analysis, etc. Whenever I watch an episode in which the case seems to be clinched by one of these kinds of things, I get automatically suspicious. (That's not to say that the forensics aren't really important and that plenty of very important and accurate methods aren't also used in many cases, but still.)"
Forensic Files,"I must have watched a different FF. I never saw them gloating. Were they satisfied they were finally able to apprehend the killer, yea. Never heard them make jokes about the death penalty. Most of the crimes were heinous, so someone wanting the death penalty would not have been strange. Look at what redditors say over on the news forum. And that's in today's world."
Forensic Files,"The death penalty is still a pretty devisive topic so plenty of people are perfectly fine with it.

A lot of people think the knew who do commit these heinous crimes deserve to die for it."
Forensic Files,I mean yeah but still you'd think the police would at least try to seem impartial.
Forensic Files,"Hahahaha, these are American police, being vocal about the death penalty is one of the least worrisome things about them."
Forensic Files,Cops don't have to be impartial to capital punishment. That's up to the courts.
Forensic Files,"Not saying they do, it's not like omg look at these horrible cops post. I just meant the show definitely shows it's age, it's not that serious. Usually when you see cops now on like dateline or whatever it's a lot more formal and ""professional""."
Forensic Files,"Damn, that really sucks. :(
He was such an excellent narrator."
Forensic Files,I loved it when he sounded all agitated when talking about the actual murder. 
Forensic Files,"Maybe because I was so young, but he always gave those shows a extra layer of 'haunting'. Very sad to hear, his voice was spectacular."
Forensic Files,Dammit.  His voice was the best part of Forensic Files.
Forensic Files,Omg I was his biggest fan this is so sad RIP :( 2016 PLEASE STOP
Forensic Files,Well that sucks. 
Forensic Files,I watch HLN because of Robin Meades fine ass doing the morning news.
Forensic Files,Loooooove forensic files.
Forensic Files,"My sister, mom, and girlfriend watch it religiously. I'm sure I've seen every episode at least twice.  "
Forensic Files,Amazon has a pretty good list of Forensic Files! Love that show. I wish I could find cold case files on one 
Forensic Files,"I thought about upping my cable plan just for Forensic Files.  Fortunately I found it on an over the air channel, so I get to save that money.  "
Forensic Files,"Oh yeah. Hard to forget about that. Well, that and her massive titties."
Forensic Files,"Yes, Cause of Death is Forensic Files. The show is also called Medical Detectives and Mystery Detectives."
Forensic Files,I know I'd probably be supremely disappointed but I've always wanted to rewatch the  Real World or the first few seasons of Road Rules

Fargo,"An old one...Dark Shadows. 

""Our soap opera is about to get cancelled!""  

""Add a vampire."""
Fargo,"Not quite sure this works but the CBS show *Mom* got surprisingly better as it went along, especially when they added Kristen Johnston to the cast."
Fargo,"Maybe a bit of a stretch, but I’ll say with how unpopular/polarizing it was/is, the 2nd season of The Wire. The total shift from the story of the streets to the dockworkers with only a few overlapping characters was jarring and brilliant. How the two seemingly unrelated narratives of Sobotka and Stringer Bell actually were parts of a large chain of crime was so well done.  Personally it was one of my favorite but I think the fans that dislike the season were really invested in the characters from season one, rightfully, and didn’t like the feeling of abandonment. Still one of the best shows."
Fargo,Addition of Leon in Curb Your Enthusiasm
Fargo,"Friday Night Lights perhaps? 

Season 4 >!leaves behind the Dillon Panthers and focuses on an entirely new team with mostly new players, with a lot of the main cast being gone at this point.!< 

This probably could have been the show's death but the new cast members were great (like Michael B Jordan) and now I think season 4 and 5 are the best up with the 1st."
Fargo,New Girl bringing in Megan Fox at one of the lowest points of her career to replace Zoey when she went on Maternity leave should’ve been a disaster. Instead it led to some of the best episodes in the series.
Fargo,"I'd consider Community to be an example of this. Fully embracing the ""paintball episodes"" instead of making them a one off thing to the point where later seasons have more silly over the top episodes than not. It's part of what made the show so special and long lasting instead of just being Friends but at a college"
Fargo,"Not sure this is quite it, but in Homeland when Carrie had a kid, and then everyone pretty much hated her trying to be a mom, so she just kind of abandoned her kid and nobody really minded because we all kind of actually wanted her to do it"
Fargo,Old one but Family Matters doubling down on Urkle. It was a major pivot for the show that made it a national sensation and put TGIF on the map.
Fargo,"The Venture Bros. Season 3 finale having the Venture family bodyguard Brock Sampson leave the Ventures and the death of Henchman 24. 

So many core dynamics of the show were broken up by these changes that it could have completely tanked the show going into S4 and yet it ended up being the best move. It allowed for some incredible characters development for Hank and Dean Venture as well as Henchman 21 where they were able to come into their own while also letting Brock's storyline provide more room for some of the side characters to be fleshed out a bit more further adding to the depth of the world.

The Venture Bros. did a brilliant job of writing out characters and storylines when they were played out and it wouldn't be the only instance where they would completely change everything. Thankfully every time they took the leap to shake up the dynamic of the show they would end up hitting it out of the park for the betterment of the story and characters. Just a shame the show didn't get it's 8th season."
Fargo,Archer Vice drops to mind. 5 seasons in and it abandons the spy comedy thing to do something totally different. I was also (mostly) a fan of the coma seasons. I think the reason that show has had longevity is that it tends to shake things up pretty often while still feeling tonally consistent.
Fargo,"Bringing in Danny DeVito on Its Always Sunny.   

On paper it seemed like a really bad idea, this subversive little indie comedy having a big star forced upon them by the network against its creators wishes in order to lift ratings. But now you couldnt imagine the show without Frank."
Fargo,"Just wanna hop in here and correct what was in the other thread a pervasive misapprehension: ""jumping the shark"" does *not* simply mean ""the show got bad,"" but refers to desperate, out-of-left-field decisions showrunners make to try and keep or surprise the audience."
Fargo,The opposite of jumping the shark is called “growing the beard” and refers to ryker of Star Trek as the show got better after his character grew out his beard.
Fargo,"Controversial - Adding Dawn to Buffy, I think it worked, but for some people this one definitely didn't work. 

Possibly Controversial - The Glee club getting canned, moving the show to NYC for the last part of season 5. And then starting the last season with all the main characters failing and having to return home to restart their lives. 

Not Controversial - the Doctor re-regenerating into David Tennant. 

Not Controversial - Angel taking over the villains organization for the last season of his show

Maybe Controversial - Parks and Rec and the time skip for the last season

Shouldn't be Controversial but Probably is - Search Party's last genre shift (started as a comedy about narcissistic assholes searching for a missing acquaintance from college, ends with them accidentally >!causing a ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE!<)"
Fargo,"Parks and Rec possibly? Not so much a single big event to try and catch the audiences attention but a major overhaul of most of the characters to fix a floundering show. 

The conversation that must have taken place where someone suggested ""let's change most of the characterisations, drop some characters completely and essentially treat it like a new series"" must have been interesting to witness."
Fargo,Cougar Town got away from Jules being a cougar pretty quickly halfway through the fist season and morphed into a pretty enjoyable comedy about the cul de sac crew hanging out and drinking wine. It was a hard enough pivot that they considered changing the name of the show and even made jokes about it in the title card.
Fargo,"The reveal at the end of season 1 of the good place. I thought it was a disaster of a decision, and struggled with the next season, but it turns out that it opened up the space they had to storytelling and made the following seasons exceptional"
Fargo,"If people didn't mention the UFO from Fargo I would completely forget about it.  So honestly I wouldn't call it ""catching the shark""   it's just a ""huh, that's odd"" moment."
Fargo,"I don’t know if this counts but classic Doctor Who could have completely failed when they replaced William Hartnell with Patrick Troughton. 

That could have been a jump the shark moment but instead it’s the reason the show has lasted 60 years"
Fargo,"Thinking of this makes me think of Marvel's Agents of Shield.

First, maybe not a catching the shark moment but more of a successful pivot was the end of season one getting totally derailed by the events of Captain America: Winter Soldier (back when the show had some pretense of being part of the cinematic universe)

The actual catching the shark moment in my opinion is midway in season 2 when >!one of the main characters goes through terragenesis and gains superpowers before inhumans are really explained to the audience (oh and another character dies in that moment, RIP Trip)!<

In retrospect, the show later had its jumping the shark moment and i can't decide if it was introducing ghost rider or >!having almost the whole cast be abducted to rescue earth from the future in space!<. Don't get me wrong though, as a fanboy i very much enjoyed how crazy the show got in its later seasons."
Fargo,"Breaking Bad spoilers ahead:

>!Walt rigging a bomb inside Hectors wheelchair, which subsequently exploded with a simple bell ring, which in turn blew up half of Gus Frings face, should have been a Jump The Shark moment. Even describing it now in this post it feels convoluted and cheesy. But the moment went down as one if not the greatest death in BB universe history. The shot of Gus waking out of the hospital ward with half his face melted is ridiculous. An act that would never happen in the real world. But it was spectacular. It stuck the landing.!<"
Fargo,Riker’s Beard…
Fargo,Dawn from Buffy.
Fargo,Ned Stark’s death in Game of Thrones. I know that it was in the book and planned but killing off the main character at the end of the first season is pretty ballsy.
Fargo,"The season finals of What We Do in The Shadows are always a big clifhanger that can cross into Jump The Shark territory when you have to wait a year to see if it's going to pay off but it always does. 

Usually because they just ignore it and go for what's best for the characters and comedy instead of forcing weird plot lines."
Fargo,I'd say in season 2 of The Office it was a smart move to make Michael into a somewhat likable character with some redeemable qualities instead of staying on the same trajectory as season 1.
Fargo,Atlanta season 3 (I think) where it was a collection of vignettes
Fargo,"Not sure if it fits your post but I'll go ahead and say LOST. Only because it's the best show I've seen to sense the pulse of the audience and shift/course correct. Whenever that series started to lose me they bounced back in amazing *jump out of your seat* fashion.



For example, Nikki and Paolo. No spoilers, but the introduction of these two characters was bemoaned by fans. To this day if you ask a fan what is the worst episode they'll say, ""The Jack tattoo episode."" Which is the correct answer. But some might say the episode on those two characters. What's fascinating is that it's not a bad episode. It's a solid thrill ride with a wicked ending. I always theorized fans clung to that episode as a kind of lightning rod for them in the show as a whole. *Nikki and Paolo = bad LOST therefore Nikki + Paolo episode = bad.*




Especially considering when they finally had their end date and could backfill their ""plan"" from there. The first season after that contract negotiation was Season 4 and it was the tightest wound thrill ride of any season. There's almost no fat or down time to be found. (writer's strike probably also helped) I remember my new roommates at the time freaking out as I'd be screaming, ""Oh my GOD!"" at the end of every episode.




And just for fun I'll throw in Supernatural but only for the line: ""It's not jumping the shark if you never come down."""
Fargo,"Each Stargate series had these moments

SG-1 sort of jumped the shark when they replaced Daniel Jackson with Jonas, but Jackson returned the next season. I say ""sorta"" because the Jonas season was actually a good run of episodes.

Also SG-1 replacing RDA with half the cast of Farscape was a good move. It freshened the cast, added a fun romantic screwball comedy angle and brought in a new villain with new stakes

Atlantis brought in Jason Mamoa and the team leveled up, making the show a lot more interesting. Unfortunately season 3 screwed up by >!killing both Carson and Weir!< and I don't think it really recovered.

SGU caught the shark right at cancelation by deciding to have the characters cut out the internal and focus the series on finding the origins of the gates. Unfortunately that was like six episodes before cancellation so they wasted a season and a half of really bad storylines."
Fargo,"I don't know if there really is a show like that. Even Fargo, in this instance, doesn't quite apply. Jumping the Shark is normally used to pinpoint where a once popular show tries to recapture its audience's attention by going big - and they go big in a way that actually cements their fall.

I can't think of a show that's had a downward trajectory, losing its audience, only to go big and recapture their audience. When shows dwindle, they just seem to dwindle.

Although if anyone has one, I would love to know. I love the term."
Fargo,Halt and Catch fire decided to pivot away from being Mad Men in the 80s to something better at the end of season 1.
Fargo,What about adding Kirstie Alley as Rebecca Howe in Cheers!
Fargo,"MASH, with each character replacement. It was damn near perfect from the start, so it would seem impossible to keep the genius going after losing one character and replacing him with another. Yet somehow the show improved and mutated with each change, from Blake to Potter, McIntyre to Hunnicutt, and Burns to Winchester."
Fargo,"M\*A\*S\*H. After a couple of seasons of trying to be a zany comedy, it basically became a different show with the same setting and most of the original cast. McLean (Henry Blake) Stevenson and Wayne (Trapper John) Rogers were removed, as was 90+ percent of the ""slapstick"" humor. The show became a critically acclaimed ""dramedy."""
Fargo,"-Castlevania S2 finale when they killed off a huge character. I thought to myself there's no way the show can continue anymore. But the void left behind only served as room for even more interesting characters to develop. Power vacuums are nice.

-Avatar The Last Airbender, when Zuko pops up and announces that he wants to flip sides and join the Gaang. On paper this seems to make no sense, but due to the teenage awkwardness it ended up working and now I can't imagine the show's arc working any other way."
Fargo,"Maybe not quite that crazy, but Star Trek enterprise failed to really resonate with an audience who had a bit of Star Trek fatigue after so many continuous years of trek. s3 they decided to do one long season wide story arc, which had not been done before in any of the previous 26 seasons of live action trek. It was received very well (compared to its first two seasons)."
Fargo,"When William Hartnell turned into Patrick Troughton in Doctor Who. Completely out of left field and unprecedented at the time, who the heck replaces the lead actor and fundamentally changes the title role? Now, regeneration is the secret sauce for the show's longevity"
Fargo,The Leftovers season 2
Fargo,"I think Amy (along with Bernadette) really assisted with the longevity of the Big Bang Theory but I also think people really hated the idea of Sheldon with a romantic partner and really all of these nerd boys settling down with women

I think it super helped that the women were also nerd women

While the show did move along and become more relationshippy and less hijinksy I think the show would have stagnated otherwise"
Fargo,Replacing Diane with Rebecca on Cheers.
Fargo,Nikki and Paulo episode of Lost
Fargo,"Scooby Doo. Adding Scrappy Doo revitalised the show.


Scrappy Doo was a proper dick though."
Fargo,Always Sunny added Frank.
Fargo,"I thought ""shoresy"" was going to just be more of the same letterkenny format that I've grown stale on.  

It turned out to be a refreshing side piece that takes the humor I like from the show, and replaces all the things that grew old. It's got an actual story line, albeit simple, that tracks through multiple episodes. The jokes are new, characters are new, and thru don't beat you over the head with one liners.  Also as a hockey player the humor was extremely relatable. It gets into more than just what Riley and jonesey had to offer, and provides some more depth.  

All in all it was a really refreshing take on a tired format."
Fargo,Oldie:  When Shelly Long quit Cheers and Kirstie Alley came in.
Fargo,I feel like people didn’t like Stewie becoming a super genius as opposed to a casual genius in Family Guy but I think that’s when his character stopped being annoying to me and started being likable
Fargo,"I’ve heard it called “Growing the Beard”. It refers to Star Trek TNG, when the first officer grew his beard.  It’s listed here. [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard)"
Fargo,"I would say Mr. Robot. When they added this bonkers things like Elliot imagining some of the plot in season 2 or the possibility of time travel would have totally ruin a show, except, somehow, it worked in Mr. Robot"
Fargo,[deleted]
Fargo,"Agents of Shield was okay in season one but as soon as the winter soldier came out and dropped its big reveal, the roller coaster never ended"
Fargo,Rebecca replacing Diane and Woody replacing Coach and Frasier becoming a main cast member in Cheers
Fargo,"I don’t know if this counts but the whole splitting up arch in Black-ish was wild. After that arc ended, the show has a different almost melancholy vibe for a while and ends pretty positively."
Fargo,"We coined a different term for this on our old TV review site [CliqueClack.com](https://CliqueClack.com): ""Blew the hatch,"" referring to the moment in ""Lost."""
Fargo,"Eastbound and Down had an absolutely absurd finale, which I probably would have hated for almost any other show.  But it fit the series perfectly.  And, it had allll the fixxxxinsss."
Fargo,"""Welcome to the future...""

Dark easily could have fumbled this moment, but instead, it was the jumping off point to some of the best TV I've ever watched"
Fargo,"Yellowjackets - the whole >!airplane!< arch - the stranded group of high school girls >!enthusiastically repair the vehicle, clean the way, a teenage girl who never really piloted an aircraft learns it from manual, and IT WORKS! SHE FLIES! YEEES! Oh wait, no, soon there's a problem and she plunges into the lake and dies!<. What a good payoff for such a cliche plot. And then, when a wholesome and heartwarming scene is happening, we see >!the dead pilot girl !<and realise that there is something VERY wrong happening in spite of all this sugary serenity."
Fargo,I think the show shot to new levels when the Teletubbies finally started to scold the Nuu-nuu when it was becoming naughty.
Fargo,"On TV Tropes, it's called [Growing The Beard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard) and is the marked moment where a show or similar noticably starts growing better in quality and execution.

The Trope Namer (the work that inspired the site's choice in name) was Star Trek: The Next Generation where Riker started to wear a beard from season two onward, while he was cleanshaven in the first season, which happened because Jonathan Frakes showed up for a script-reading with it one day and everyone considered it a good idea.

It's also when characters started to really find their niches, with Geordi becoming chief engineer instead of just using his VISOR as a plot device. It was also the season with the episode ""The Measure of a Man"", considered one of the best episodes of the show period.

In truth, it's more like ""Firing the dumbass executive producer"" since Gene Roddenberry was no longer allowed to directly affect the direction of the show or wider franchise, after his micromanaging of season one proved abysmal and he was caught fucking around with the film franchise by leaking scripts at fan conventions because he didn't like certain plot points.

Edit: Also, personally I loved the fact that in Season 3 of McDonald and Dodds, they replaced the asshole police chief who constantly bullies and tries to force Dodds out of the police for perceived mistakes with a more professional policewoman who won't constantly breathe down people's necks for fucking up as well as owns up to her mistakes... such as forgetting to refill the beans in the coffee grinder."
Fargo,Angel season 5. It completely went from a moody detective agency to managing evil on earth. Complete departure from the previous seasons and it was amazing. Shame it was cancelled
Fargo,"I feel like ""caught the shark"" is the wrong phrase. To my mind it feels like that should be the term for when a show (a) was regarded as having jumped the shark and then (b) later did something that caused people to go ""Oh, I get it now"" and what had been regarded as jumping the shark is re-evaluated, What you're talking about seems more like ""owned the shark"".

For example, if Doctor Who had revealed that the timeless child was actually the Master's origin story, then I really think that people would have a totally different opinion about the timeless child as a concept. So, this I would describe as catching the shark.

As to actual example of *this* version of catching the shark? I guess The Wire sort of makes sense. I'm not sure at which point after S2 finishes that S2 makes sense, but it does eventually happen.

In terms of ""owning the shark"", i.e. what you're calling catching the shark, I think I agree with Fring's >!death!< in Breaking Bad. It should feel ridiculous but it never does. Another example would be Agents of SHIELD which literally blew up its whole concept about 2/3 of the way through its first series. Everyone agrees this was a good idea (but the stuff before that moment is seriously over-hated).

I'm a bit torn about Supernatural which someone else also mentioned. I think for most people introducing angels was owning the shark, but for me Supernatural before the angels show up is pretty crap. In other words Castiel's arrival is more like growing the beard than owning the shark. Though that's a bit unfair to S3. The urgency the writer's strike gave the show did wonders for it."
Fargo,"The phrase you want is ""Growing the Beard"", not ""catching the shark""; it's an established term for the situation you describe. 

It is in reference to ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", where the first season was awful -- but the show became great in subsequent seasons.  Coincidentally,  the character  ""Commander Riker"" was beardless in the first season, and wore a beard in all the following seasons."
Fargo,"Happy Days started out kinda boring, but it hit it's stride after that fun and exciting beach episode. 

I wonder why it got cancelled."
Fargo,"Thankfully, not letting Parks and Recreation be another “The Office”. Leslie Knope wasn’t very likeable when they did the first season (and Mark Brandanowitz 🙄) and the story was meh. 

Then they changed gears and that show is classic comedy gold in every episode season 2 and on. They put the focus on Leslie to be more likeable and flush out all the side characters more."
Fargo,The Brady Bunch - when they brought in 'Cousin Oliver'.
Fargo,"Season 1 of Parks and Rec was the weakest part. Better characterization for Leslie, and addition of Ben and Chris really gave the show legs."
Fargo,[removed]
Fargo,Game of Thrones
Fargo,"Please let's  not normalize ""caught the shark"" maybe try ""Fonzied"" or something else. Just not caught the shark..."
Fargo,"The second season of the wire is an obvious example but that being said a lot of people actually didn’t like it.

I think a great example would be supernatural, specifically when the show introduces Angels. I think they introduce them in the first episode of season 4, and then the show proceeds to have the best 2 seasons (4 and 5) of its 15 year run. The show even pokes fun at this a few times, making references to when they just used to hunt Windegos lol"
Fargo,I think this season of The Orville may have done it. They went to Hulu and made each episode a mini movie. Each episode is about an hour and a half and they did an amazing job with both the soundtrack and the visuals. A few episodes channeled old school Twilight Zone.
Fargo,"To me, the ufo fucked that season up."

Fargo,"Clannad/Clannad: Afterstory, not gonna say wht, but you who know, know what I'm talking about"
Fargo,https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard
Fargo,"I’ve generally heard this more as “growing the beard” mainly from the originator of the term- Star Trek the Next Generation.

It represents how it got better when Riker grew out his beard. It’s not 100% accurate because he got it second season and the show was still kinda shit until the third, but yeah."
Fargo,"Gonna throw a wrestling one here. Turning Daniel Bryan heel.

It should not have worked. Daniel Bryan is one of those rare white hot babyfaces the crowd wants to cheer for. Turning him heel seems like the worst booking idea.

But my god it worked. The New Daniel Bryan ecowarrior worked. His promos were fire and the hemp belt was great. Having Rowan as a heavy was also a nice touch. And he made a great foil for KofiMania"
Fargo,"🧛🏽‍♂️Dark Shadows didn’t start off as a vampire show? Wow. I’m now lagging at myself. Caught the reruns on dvd, I was fooled. I don’t think I watched the 1st few seasons. 🤔🤣🤣🤣🧛‍♂️🧛🏽‍♂️"
Fargo,"Not a TV show, but I think hands down the best example is Crash Team Racing on PS1

They were intentionally trying to jump the shark by adding aliens into the mix.  Turns out no one minded at all and it became one of the most beloved games in the franchise.  Not sure how many things can say they were *trying* to sink the series by jumping the shark and it ends up being extremely popular"
Fargo,"The first season of FRINGE was a pretty by the numbers x-files clone. Then each subsequent season took some pretty ballsy turns. I was surprised it worked as well as it did each time.

I don’t know if that has anything to do with jumping the shark. I can’t remember if it was doing well or not."
Fargo,"Not sure if this was the starting point or just the culmination, but the Beebo battle in Legends of Tomorrow."
Fargo,"The evolution of that show is nuts.

Let's do a soap opera about New England blue bloods with a kind of mysterious vibe.

Ratings are meh.

How about having a kid talk to ghosts?

Ratings are up a little but not enough to save the show.

Horror is kind of popular, what if we add a vampire?

Ratings take off.

Fuck it, let's add a Witch, a Werewolf, Time Travel, Cthulhu Cultists and whatever other weird shit we can think of.  We're all in motherfuckers."
Fargo,Completely blew my mind when my mum told me that wasn’t a vampire show at the beginning. That’s all it’s known for 😂
Fargo,"It's the perfect example. Even wilder because Barnabas was meant to terrorize the cast for a few weeks and then be staked, but he was so popular that he ended up becoming the main character."
Fargo,Dropping Ana Faris’ parenting storylines and pivoting to the addiction recovery group as a found family really gave the show its center.
Fargo,It got better when they first added William Fitchner to the cast.
Fargo,"It's great, and the perspective it offers on the scale of the drug problem is important for the overall narrative. It also gives us Amy Ryan's character, who so nearly made McNulty happy for a minute there."
Fargo,"I would like to add Season 4 as another example.

>!Stringer Bell is dead, the Barksdales are gone, and McNulty is sidelined. So most of the ""main"" characters of the previous seasons are absent in this season. On top of that, they introduced 4 new main characters all played by inexperienced actors.!<

That season is considered as one of the greatest seasons of television ever produced."
Fargo,Great example. I really was put off at first. Especially as someone that’s sort of always been interested in gangs and crime and the drug trade and all that. But I ended up completely loving it. Join r/thewire if you’re a fan btw 👍🏼
Fargo,"Good call. When I saw the first ep of season 2 I was really thrown, but it was later my favorite."
Fargo,On first watching Season 2 I couldn't stand it. But on subsequent re-watchings it's honestly one of the best Seasons.
Fargo,"I feel like S2 of The Wire is the best individual series, but it's the one a first time viewer is least likely to enjoy because it just feels so discontinuous initially."
Fargo,"I fucking love the second season. The way it pulls out from the local Baltimore level and slowly pushes back. I think the best part of the season is when the mob are packing up at the cafe at the end and drop the ""you don't even know what country we're from"" line. 

They're 100% Albanian though."
Fargo,"I was really annoyed and confused, because it is such a jump. But once I learned the characters, it's the season that actually sealed it for me. Knew I was watching greatness."
Fargo,"Spot on. I’d honestly say I felt cheated when I first watched the second season.

Like I’d gotten so invested in the corners storyline to then have it sidelined for some random new dock workers felt so jarring.

Having finished the show it’s now one of my favourite seasons. I love how it ties together but I also just love seeing the white working class dockworkers and criminals juxtaposed against the young black men in season 1.

It’s perfect"
Fargo,"Also, it's much better on rewatch. I hated it the first time I saw it. Loved it on my rewatch."
Fargo,It’s always hard to get through season 2 for me.

Fairy Tail,[deleted]
Fairy Tail,"Yep, Brazilian. Game of Thrones is definitely the biggest TV show to date. I'm not a GoT fan, only watched the first season, and it was basically impossible to use social networks around GoT time because everyone talked about it.  

I'm yet to see a TV show that was like this here.  

Now, Star Wars is less popular than Marvel, DC, GoT...."
Fairy Tail,"I know people keep digging into the physical vs. digital debate, so I will try to avoid it as much as possible:

- If you want physical, then buy each season as it releases. Studios will often pull the plug on physical releases if sales of early seasons aren't good enough, especially if there is reformatting/remastering/digitization to be done. This is why we will never see Star Trek DS9 in high definition. 
- If you want digital, then it really doesn't matter. You can look out for sales and get an idea if you're worried about price.

I don't think it matters all that much."
Fairy Tail,"I'm not sure if this will be discussed at length, but there are hidden costs and trade-offs when choosing to purchase and build a content library online vs purchasing physical media.

This is something you might want to think carefully about.

With online content sold from providers like Amazon you do not actually own the content you purchase. You're renting it.  Amazon can remove purchased content at any time.

Studios sometimes get into disputes with content providers. Last year there was a dispute between WarnerMedia and Amazon leading to people who purchased the new full season of The Flash having access to content delayed by 1-2 months that they already had paid for.

With physical media you own a physical copy of the content, but over time physical media can become damaged or degrade, and playback devices may fail or eventually become unavailable."
Fairy Tail,"If you buy something today from a streaming retailers (iTunes, Vudu, Google, Amazon, whoever), there's no way to guarantee that the service will still be available whenever you have kids. That service, or that particular content on the service, could possibly be gone as soon as next month. No matter how huge and stable the company seems to be at the moment. You just never know.  

Meanwhile, people still have record albums and videogame carts and video tapes from decades ago, and machines to play them, and everything still works.  

This is why I'd rather buy my most favorite TV shows on a DVD, or a Blu-ray Disc. And have multiple devices in the house to play them (I even have a cheap player still in the box, in a storage unit up the street, as my most fail-safe backup in case I ever need it).  

Streaming services and their servers are out of your control. Physical media is something you'll always be able to own."
Fairy Tail,"maximize the cost.

pay as much as you possibly can.

&#x200B;

by each ep individually."
Fairy Tail,First look for streaming services that give access to those shows in my opinion
Fairy Tail,I am getting physical. But the question is should i get them by season when they come out or what for the complete season comes out?
Fairy Tail,Buy physical and digitize it.
Fairy Tail,"> over time physical media can become damaged or degrade

It's possible this can happen, and it does from time to time. But it is extremely uncommon for it to happen within the original owner's lifetime. I don't think people should worry about this.  

> and playback devices may fail or eventually become unavailable  

Working playback devices are still available for media that was made in the 1950s and 60s. Check eBay, LOL."
Fairy Tail,Yes I know but that isn’t the question I am asking. I am wondering if I should buy something one season at a time or buy it when it is a complete set?
Fairy Tail,[deleted]
Fairy Tail,"Depends on the show, and depends on the extras. For example, the bonus content that came with the DVD release of the Lord of the Rings extended edition films is far superior to what came with either the extended trilogy set or the individual extended films on BR."
Fairy Tail,"> It's possible this can happen, and it does from time to time. But it is extremely uncommon for it to happen within the original owner's lifetime. I don't think people should worry about this. 

Some types of media are more susceptible to data loss.  Optical media has varying shelf lives, but usually it's less than 10 years.  That's assuming it's not exposed to ultraviolet light or other conditions which might cause media to degrade faster.

> Working playback devices are still available for media that was made in the 1950s and 60s. Check eBay, LOL.

Yes that's an option.  I meant more along the lines of finding new unused playback devices."
Fairy Tail,"I understand, and I'll answer that now since you ask again. But I wanted to take a minute and talk about streaming vs physical media, since I don't believe that this part of the equation gets enough attention these days. Sure, physical media takes up room. But it's worth it, to truly own it. As somebody else said, digital media is really only rented under license, and never truly owned.  

Let's answer your real question, though. Here's my thoughts about that, as an entertainment writer who's covered home video releases of TV shows for 19 years now.  

If it's already available as a complete series set, then it's more cost effective to buy it that way.  

On the other hand, if it's in the process of being released season-by-season, buy each season as it becomes available, esp. if you can pre-order it (or buy it during release week) at any kind of discount. Or otherwise get it on sale at all.  

If a studio decides that the most recently-released season didn't sell well enough, and that there aren't enough customers for that show any more, then they stop producing home video releases of the next season. And a complete series set will never ever get put out in the long run.  

So for a currently airing show, like Rick & Morty, go ahead and buy each season as it becomes available. For a show that's already done and finished, and the complete series is available on home video - like Steven Universe (available on digital already, and hitting DVD tomorrow) - then go ahead and buy it that way!"
Fairy Tail,How?
Fairy Tail,I 100% have optical media older than 10 years that still works.  I don't know what kind of shit you are on
Fairy Tail,">  Optical media has varying shelf lives, but usually it's less than 10 years  

Don't make me laugh. I've got dozens of DVDs from 1999 that still work (and hundreds more since then!). I've also got hundreds of music CDs from the 80s  and 90s which still work. I have thousands of optical media discs in my library, and despite constant playing of ""old titles"" as I go back to the well and enjoy stuff I bought a LOOOONG time ago, I still haven't run across a single item which has degraded and no longer works!  

Public and school libraries are also loaning tons of discs older than 10 years which continue to work and haven't degraded."
Fairy Tail,"Optical discs that are pressed tend to last a lot longer, but are still susceptible to the same times of wear and damage. Burned media can have a much shorter lifespan, which is what I was thinking of at the time I posted, which really doesn't apply.

I didn't think so many would respond so angrily"
Fairy Tail,"I’m not angry. Just trying to correct inaccurate information.  

As for burned discs? The Warner Archive Collection launched in 2009, 11 years ago. I have DVDs from the first few months of the launch of that program. They still work.  

A lot of fear mongering goes on about physical media deteriorating, and it has been especially hyped up on “MOD“ (manufacture on demand) DVD releases. Don’t believe the hype. Even an MOD release is unlikely to deteriorate past the point of working in the lifetime of its original owner.  

Studios like selling physical media, because it makes them some money. You know what they like more? Digital media. And they like you liking it. It makes them even more money, and they control it more easily. And a user who wants to get it cheap can’t buy it used. So the studios fudge the risks of digital media where service discontinuation and server outage are concerned. And they promote the fears about physical media deteriorating, and players going off the market. They talk up issues like how much shelf space in your home it takes up, and how digital is all in the cloud (where it may not take up your shelf space, but you have zero control over it, either).  

Can digital media be gotten illegally? Sure. But studios think along the lines of “people who do that, won’t buy the DVDs either.“ at least not new DVDs at full price, where the studio gets their cut of the money. When a consumer buys digital media from Google, iTunes, Vudu, or whoever… the studio always gets their full share of the profits. and they like that a hell of a lot more than they like DVD or Blu-ray.  

I enjoy having my DVD of The Devil’s Advocate, with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. it’s an original version, before they altered the ending scene due to the lawsuit. I enjoy having my VHS tape of the closest-to-original Star Wars (“Episode IV”) ever legally put on home video. I enjoy having my Simpsons DVD season sets, including the episode with Michael Jackson. They can change that shit on the servers, behind your back and without your consent, no matter what you paid for. But they are not knocking on my door and telling me to hand them over!  

Consumers need to make up their own mind about what’s best for them. Especially collectors with long range plans!"
Fairy Tail,"Season one is a total of 25 episodes, but Netflix only released the first 12. So surprise! More Little Witch Academia is out there right now! The second half of s1 is great- it really amps up the emotions. Plus you meet one of my favorite characters. "
Fairy Tail,"A 3 year old? Buddy, you'll be seeing a lot more of season 1 before we ever get to a season 2, if your 3 year old is anything like the one I know."
Fairy Tail,"So it is a tv series now?  A few months ago I watched what I assumed was a tv series, but ended up being one thirty minute movie.  Later there was a sequel?  It sure felt like a pilot to a tv show, but there was just the one episode."
Fairy Tail,I might give this a try.
Fairy Tail,"I found the first ""movie"" to be quite enjoyable, as i felt it kinda played off the whole ""magic school thing"" (basically if harry potter was a girl without some dude trying to kill them)

The second one was kinda a let down as I felt like it took itself too seriously. 

I'm on episode 3 of the series and found it to be just all right so far. Not as good as the first one, but much better than the second ""movie"".

I'll keep watching as I have nothing else to watch at the moment."
Fairy Tail,It's always seemed interesting. I should really give it a try. How is the dub? Or is it dubbed?
Fairy Tail,"A three year old can't even process what it's seeing, let alone remember it. 

And it *is* just a shitty generic ""cute girl"" anime. "
Fairy Tail,I'll pass. Sounds like the next thing a Brony would get into.

Somehow that makes it sound like hentai.

Fairy Tail,Weeb
Fairy Tail,"and the excuse they gave to someone on /r/anime is just idiotic. ""They didn't people bingeing it too fast"". Bullshit, that's what their entire service is based on. "
Fairy Tail,There's the two movies (LWA and Enchanted Parade) and a series. The series is supposed to be a prequel of sorts.
Fairy Tail,you know there is an anime actually called Fairy Tail right?
Fairy Tail,the real reason is because they want to release it with their dub and they aren't finished with it yet.
Fairy Tail,"The series is actually set in a different continuity than the shorter OVAs, since Akko gets the Shiny Rod in different ways in them, and can fly (albeit very haphazardly) in the OVAs"
Fairy Tail,I was wondering how they went along side each other.
Fairy Tail,I still remember that awesome intro and weird troll family :) 
Fairy Tail,"I love The 10th Kingdom! A friend of my sister's let me borrow her copy and I watched it for the first time and was amazed! (I would have been around 7. 

My mum is a Jehovah's Witness so Christmasses were pretty shitty in my house... no tree, no presents etc. Until one Christmas I came down and found a solitary gift... for me! My sister had bought me The 10th Kingdom on DVD!

So you can imagine it'd wrapped up in lots of nostalgia/happy memories for me!

I think my set came with 3 disks - and the middle one was always my favourite... where Virginia enters the shepherdess competition and is accused of being a witch etc.

I just looked up the show's creator and was surprised to find the series wasn't based on books or anything... it's such a rich world of characters and stories. [Simon Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Moore_\(writer\)) wrote the screenplay. So that's the guy who thought up a forest where mushrooms sing Whiter Shade of Pale?"
Fairy Tail,I loved this and have watched it every two years or so. God I wish they made the sequel but the budget was just too high.
Fairy Tail,"What is the point in having a door with a horrible death behind it anyway?
  
WHAT DOES THAT ACHIEVE?!"
Fairy Tail,"10th Kingdom is one of my favorites. It's a shame it's been so long since it came out - the creator had a whole bunch of sequels planned, and I think one was mostly written, but I guess the ratings weren't good enough so the sequel (which Virginia alludes to at the end) wasn't ordered. Now it's been so long either the sequel would have to be heavily rewritten (because it's supposed to take place about a year after the first installment) or be recast, and I don't want anyone else playing Wolf. Or Wendell. Or even Virginia. Tony could easily still be played by the same actor, though.

I'm not ashamed to say I picked up Wolf's use of ""cripes!"" and use it myself.

I think the CGI hasn't aged *that* badly, at least not as badly as the cgi in some big-budget Hollywood movies. I think it helps that it's supposed to be magic for the most part, so it looking really off isn't as jarring as when it's regular things like boats or staircases in movies that are really bad CG.

Watching 10th Kingdom makes me a little sad, though. I just remember that Hallmark used to produce these epic mini-series (they also had one of the Odyssey and one of Gulliver's Travels), and now they don't. Seems like there'd be a market for fairytale/fantasy mini-series these days."
Fairy Tail,I re-watched this a year ago and I am so glad other people still love it! None of my friends had ever seen it so they could not get past the cringey parts with the power of nostalgia like I could. It's seriously just a fun story though. And I love Wolf...
Fairy Tail,"The last time I saw this I was on acid, it was not a good experience. "
Fairy Tail,"Oh man, I remember watching this on TV as a kid with my parents and I loved it! They both thought it was stupid though so they stopped half way through. I never actually got to finish it until almost a decade later when I found it in a billion parts on YouTube. Still loved it. It's cheesy as fuck, but the show owns it."
Fairy Tail,"This was a fun miniseries that I have seen a few times, and I still use ""nicey nice"" on occasion. My wife loves the trolls because of their rooms of shoes... /sigh."
Fairy Tail,"Yea, Google Play had is on sale for $5 (for HD) a couple months back. I bought it and binged watched the whole mini series. "
Fairy Tail,"the 10th kingdom was a childhood favorite and I was recently pondering if it could be remade, but your point about how ""gritty"" dramas are the thing makes me say ""no"". it was simply a period piece which can't be touched again. it holds a pre-9/11 quality"
Fairy Tail,"I love the 10th kingdom! Howeve, I will be the first to admit that that love is tied up in childhood nostalgia and the circumstances of my life at the time I first saw it. 

I actually own the DVD set (it's like four DVDs) and I've never actually made it through a whole rewatch. It's so. damn. long. "
Fairy Tail,Favorite movie/series of all time. Just wish we could get a sequel.
Fairy Tail,"i was watching this online, and can't find decent links to watch the last few episodes :("
Fairy Tail,"This is my favorite movie and one of the only things that I can rewatch on a frequent basis, but it is LONG.  Everything up to the sheep trial is so comforting and familiar since that's pretty much as far as I can get in a single viewing, so whenever I get past that point I feel I have unlocked a personal challenge level.  

I managed to paint two rooms this weekend while I had this running in the background and I still am not anywhere close to the end (and I even started where I left off last time which is about an hour in).

So far the only movie that I've watched that even compares for me is Stardust."
Fairy Tail,"SUCK

AN

ELF"
Fairy Tail,The only part of the 10th kingdom that makes no sense at all is the magic bean. - if wolf had a magic bean why didn't they use it themselves?.
Fairy Tail,suck an elf!
Fairy Tail,"Haha, yeah, I can't get that song out of my head! "
Fairy Tail,"I guess so! That's what I forgot to mention.. It's amazing how the show takes just a itty-bitty parts of modern world and puts them into fairy tale. And 95% of the times it works flawlessly and you don't even blink, it just makes sense. "
Fairy Tail,"When I was younger I felt like Tony was just an old fuddy duddy and didn't understand the whimsy of the 9 kingdoms.

Now as an adult, I completely side with Tony in these situations."
Fairy Tail,"It's true, that mini-series are my favorite. Small there isn't more these days. "
Fairy Tail,it's definitely a little bit long to watch during a trip and would take up the entirety of the trip. not fun at all
Fairy Tail,"Pre 9/11 quality, wtf? How can you reference 9/11 and the tenth kingdom in one sentence. Al Bundy should show you the door. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE0mRJlQwUs"
Fairy Tail,"I kind of get that, I mean... I couldn't binge watch it either. Whole thing is good for a week, maybe two."
Fairy Tail,"Oooh, I feel that on a personal level. It *is* long. Comforting but long. 

Also I haven't thought about that but you're absolutely right, I don't think I have something else besides Neverending story or Stardust the  compare. And it's not only the nostalgia. "
Fairy Tail,"16 years later and I still say this on a regular basis. Sadly, no one never knows what I'm talking about..."
Fairy Tail,Agreed. The merging of fairy tales has been done before and will be done again eg. Once Upon A Time but The 10th Kingdom is my favourite one to do it so far.
Fairy Tail,Mostly the scene where the prince and the dog animorphed into each other I had to nope right on out of there at that point. 
Fairy Tail,"it takes place in new york, the twin towers are in the opening sequence, and it happened before 9/11. how is it not pre-9/11 media?"
Fairy Tail,"It could have taken place in Los Angeles and would have had the exact same feel...not like where they were from is what was important. They were just trying to get back home and frankly home could have been any city. 

Just hearing you say it was pre 9/11 media is so weird. If anything just call it early 2000 media. Does it being in new York before 9/11 make it the only reason why it's considered pre 9/11? Would a show that takes place in new York from the 80s make it pre 9/11? Does a show based in L.A. that aired in 2000 not qualify as being pre 9/11 because it wasn't based in new York? 

I think it's just a weird term to be using. "
Fairy Tail,there is a distinctive difference in media created before the george bush war on terror era. times have changed since the 80s/90s.

Eigen Kweek,"Top 5 series I've ever seen, they deserve it for sure. "" True Story "" with Kevin Hart is another one that should get the same praise"
Eigen Kweek,The twist about the leader was stupid
Eigen Kweek,"If you have a reason why you didn't like it, please speak.

If you have no reason, please don't even comment."
Eigen Kweek,*best actor.
Eigen Kweek,This was one of a handful of series that I binge watched. I loved it from beginning to end! My husband doesn’t usually like movies that we have to use subtitles but he quickly got over it.
Eigen Kweek,Well deserved.
Eigen Kweek,Such a great series.
Eigen Kweek,Shame about that ending tho!
Eigen Kweek,Well deserved!
Eigen Kweek,"This was a good show, but for me can’t believe the reception it got compared to Alice in borderlands. They’re comparable concepts, but I found the story of Alice in borderlands way more captivating."
Eigen Kweek,"This is one of the few shows I wish I could forget so I could watch it for the first time again. So unbelievably amazing, well deserved!"
Eigen Kweek,Boarderlands was much better imo
Eigen Kweek,It was meh
Eigen Kweek,I personally didn’t care for it after seeing the whole show
Eigen Kweek,I thought it was pretty boring and struggled to get through the first few episodes before giving up. Didn’t finish watching and have no desire to see other shows like it.
Eigen Kweek,Its just tired concepts and unoriginal characters.
Eigen Kweek,South Korea makes some of the best horror films and tv series in the world right now.  Amazing that about 10 years ago the South Korean film industry seemed to just come out of nowhere and now they dominate the genre.  Looking forward to season 2 of Squid Game.
Eigen Kweek,strange i thought the guy in the thumbnail was an actor not an actress…
Eigen Kweek,Awesome! Been enjoying the increase in popularity of films and shows from different countries
Eigen Kweek,"But it's just not good. It's murder porn, that's it. Good tonsee Korean TV getting recognition... but, this? Actors deserve it, certainly... but screenplay and director? Please."
Eigen Kweek,Overhyped.
Eigen Kweek,Hah really?
Eigen Kweek,"It was certainly a very interesting show, but by no means was it award winning good."
Eigen Kweek,"It was good, but I REALLY hope it stops going for these KDRAMA moments. They're so annoying and predictable, the worst kind of tropes."
Eigen Kweek,"Good, now don’t make a season 2"
Eigen Kweek,Only had one good episode and the rest was silly as fuck. Not award worthy.
Eigen Kweek,i did not think it was that enjoyable
Eigen Kweek,"It's good, what a suprise show, if only they decided to end the show on season 1

when he dye his hair red (what), and instead of go away, he turns back >!to face the game again, just for season 2 to happen!<

i was like.. what the fuck"
Eigen Kweek,"Everyone liking it cause the next guy, squid games sucked eggs hard shitty story line shitty acting shitty everything"
Eigen Kweek,As a person who watches mostly Korean shows that’s just a joke. It’s a 2- star show. So many many many better shows than it.. HOTEL DEL LUNA IS 5 stars
Eigen Kweek,Every award show is now teen choice awards!
Eigen Kweek,"Reading the article, it seems every winner in this contest was Korean."
Eigen Kweek,It was ok
Eigen Kweek,Worst acting ever. Cool story but not worth the hype
Eigen Kweek,It's basically like every other death game anime out there but worse.
Eigen Kweek,I noped out based on the concept alone.  It must really be something to get this much praise with that premise.
Eigen Kweek,"TV and movies have turned into super hero movies, revision of history, pushing agendas, emasculation of male roles.  Can’t watch this woke media any more and prefer to watch foreign films."
Eigen Kweek,"Good attempt, terrible actors/actresses. Felt like I was watching classmates present a horrible project😂😂😂"
Eigen Kweek,And I **still** don't want to watch it!
Eigen Kweek,I never watched squid game and I never will. I’m burnt out on battle royale crap.
Eigen Kweek,I watched this and immediately had to google to make sure I wasn’t the only one that thought this was just a slightly different take on the first SAW movie. It’s literally the same concept/story idea.
Eigen Kweek,The show was a complete shitter
Eigen Kweek,Why?
Eigen Kweek,Squid Game is extremely overrated
Eigen Kweek,"Just goes to show that anything they release and market the shit out of will win rewards regardless of quality. 

IMO this show sucked. It’s a preschool level remake of SAW and the only people still watching are kids."
Eigen Kweek,I love the fact that no one talks about how racist this show is.
Eigen Kweek,Come on man. Smile
Eigen Kweek,I like but there are a lot of drama
Eigen Kweek,Why does he look like an amalgamation of the main protagonist and his friend.
Eigen Kweek,Congrats 🎉🎈🎊🍾
Eigen Kweek,If you liked Squid game you should watch Alice in borderlands/All of us are dead/Sweet Home
Eigen Kweek,I liked it enough to watch other Korean dramas. Now I'm hooked! I really recommend people to give a chance to other productions!
Eigen Kweek,I loved it up until that final twist. It definitely had some problems but they were mostly excusable. I didn’t like the twist at all though.
Eigen Kweek,I'm happy for Hoyeon!
Eigen Kweek,I heard he’s a doctor now
Eigen Kweek,"I found it enjoyable, but wouldn’t give it any awards. Too many plot holes."
Eigen Kweek,Idk man heroin definitely lives up to the hype
Eigen Kweek,I think it lived up to the hype
Eigen Kweek,"Not overhyped, just popular. Two different things."
Eigen Kweek,I couldn’t finish it. I tried so hard because everyone was talking about it. But every episode was just 90% watching paint dry and 10% mediocre suspense. I made it through 6 episodes and just could not force myself to sit through the last 2 or 3.
Eigen Kweek,I don’t see a lot of wisdom reflected in Reddit comments these days but your learning is just so nice to see stated here clearly. Thanks for sharing
Eigen Kweek,Should have been the final test. That episode carried way more emotional baggage than any of the other ones.
Eigen Kweek,FUCK
Eigen Kweek,"Is it, as a fellow Dutchman I barely consume Dutch series, I have seen a bit of thuiskweek which is Belgian but are our own shows really all the rage?"
Eigen Kweek,"Yeah, it was easily over-hyped but was still good. Lol I genuinely don’t know how it won best show of the year though, *maybe* if there was a best new series award I could understand it."
Eigen Kweek,I loved it too. It was great. Second season can be good too. The director already proved himself and I guess Frontman will have a bigger role this time and Lee Byung-hun who played the Frontman is one of the best Korean actors. Hollywood used him for action roles but he is really talented too. Him and Lee Jung-jae can carry the show.
Eigen Kweek,[deleted]
Eigen Kweek,Squid Game had legit problems but it was a good show nonetheless. Doesn’t mean no one shouldn’t criticise it.
Eigen Kweek,That’s how Reddit works. Anything that becomes popular must be viewed as unpopular here. Reddit had become the counterculture weirdo from school who hates popular things just to be different.
Eigen Kweek,"Popular doesn’t mean good. A fuck ton of people watched Kardashians and Honey Boo Boo, made 50 shades a bestseller. Doesn’t make those things even average, let alone decent.

SG was just flat, with plain characters, basic story and predictable outcomes.

There are much better Korean shows than this.

Overall, SG is an okay, one-time watch show. Compared to other shows, this one has no value in rewatching, since missing some details is impossible, due to complete lack of those details."
Eigen Kweek,"The show was pretty good and I liked it well enough, but I also learned that Koreans really go for some real big emotional drama and what would pass for ""over acting"" in the west on their tv shows. I don’t care so much about the plot holes and how the bad rich white guys were probably not even real actors, the IMO poor ending and the ridiculous plot twist with the old guy."
Eigen Kweek,"Not just that they don’t like it, but that it’s overhyped because other people like something they don’t. It’s so obnoxious because it happens with every show that’s considered “mainstream”."
Eigen Kweek,oVeRHYpEd
Eigen Kweek,I mean...it wasn't good
Eigen Kweek,The narrative is so full of holes. Was competition really so low this year?
Eigen Kweek,every good show gets this comment eventually lmao
Eigen Kweek,"Agreed. Concept was great but I felt the last episode was unnecessary, the twist cheap and white people over the top weird."
Eigen Kweek,Check out Alice in borderlands. Comparable concept but the characters are more interesting and the story is more captivating imo
Eigen Kweek,"It seemed like the 10th version of Battle Royale/Hunger Games etc. Not original, and not well told"
Eigen Kweek,"My group of friends and i thought it went to crap from the marble episode onwards, ep5?"
Eigen Kweek,It was still a breath of fresh air amongs same'y US produced shows.
Eigen Kweek,"Some of the writing was absolutely horrible, the VIP stuff was terrible and unnecessary, it would've worked far better to have them stream it online for people to donate and watch.

The police story was literally pointless, it went absolutely nowhere and added nothing to the main plot.

And there were so many plot holes and inconsistencies. Why did both the husband and wife come back to play in the games, knowing that there'd likely only be one winner? How didn't the guard see the lighter being used in the honeycomb game? Why the fuck does the show have two completely pointless sex scenes? 

I didn't think it was bad, but it was nowhere close to the best TV show of the year, hell, it's not even the best show about people fighting in a deadly game for money."
Eigen Kweek,"The first episode was excellent. 

The rest of the series was an attempt to throw every possible plot line at the audience with no clear plan with what to do with any of it. They weren’t even seeing what stuck, they were just throwing shit at the wall with no clear goals. It was a sloppy mess. 

As if the show runners really focused on a pilot and we’re so surprised it got picked up they just tried literally everything. 

And then every thread got closed as sloppily as possible, if at all. 

They didn’t even really kill any central characters, they took the east way out at every single turn. That “choice” episode was comprised of characters that had just been introduced the episode before. 

The show was not just “not that good” it was hard boiled crap that a shit ton of people were too easily convinced was good with cheap writing. 

That all really surprised me. The reason I watched it was I saw people resurrecting the old “dubbed or subbed” debate of anime days past. I watched it in shock as dubbed or subbed didn’t matter, it was a steaming pile of shit either way and dubbing or subbing didn’t add or subtract anything from that. It was more like some people way too easily impressed by mass death scenes thought that debate made them sound cultured or some shit. 

It was a piece of shit show from the rolling of the credits on the first episode on. That first episode, though, was magnificent. If only they had known what they were doing after that, it might have been a great show.

It was like hunger games if it was just nothing but gratuitous violence and really lazy, shitty writing."
Eigen Kweek,"I will go further than that. It was *terrible*. I can’t even remember the last time I couldn’t force myself to finish a series, but with this one, I had 2 or 3 episodes left, and just could not make myself watch them."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I agree, I was just hoping someone would kill him."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Amen I’ve almost turned the series off because I hated him so bad just STOP BEING A HERO
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I loved the fact that they started calling him Arturito, put the fake bomb on him and humiliated him in front of everyone. What a delightfully loathsome character. "
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"The worst part was that he was acting like he was a hero, but a lot of the times he made other people do the dangerous stuff."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,That portraits very well a certain type of character in Spanish society. Especially male politician and alike. I think it is what they are trying to put through with Arturo's character.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Then they did a great job!
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"That's great!

Is the actor who plays Superman more real than the comic book Superman that everything else is based off of… That's a deep thought."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,[removed]
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,One of my favorite shows of all time.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,The tales of ba sing se is my absolute favorite episode. The viewer gets a tremendously deep emotional understanding of each other characters in a short period of time. That scene with Iroh on the hill paying homage to his son was absolutely heart-breaking.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I finally got around to watching this.  I just started season 3.  I'm not really an anime fan and I guess I always thought it was a glorified kids show.  

I can't believe how wrong I was.  Avatar should be studied as Storytelling 101.  It's exciting and cool, creative, visually spectacular, but it's also a really sweet, simple story.  The affection the characters have for one another feels so genuine.  It's crazy how attached you get to them.

Uncle Iroh... oh boy, do I love that guy.

How do people feel about the Legend of Korra?  Is it a good successor?

Edit:  and it's funny!  Laugh-out-loud funny!  I watch at night and I keep waking up my kids."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I watched this when it first aired, loved every second and have rewatched it many times. 

I have my own daughter now, shes only just 1 but i'm counting down the days until I can watch this with her. I'm impatient but I don't want to do it too early so she doesn't 'get it'. 

Sadly it's a show that nobody in my life, besides my wife as I made her, has really watched. Maybe it's because in the UK bender has another meaning..."

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"After seeing so many positive things about it, I started watching it last year and finished it in just under two months.

I was expecting a decent show, something mildly entertaining perhaps to kill some time. Basically, as a 31 year old, I wasn't holding my breath for some children's cartoon. My expectations were blown away.

I don't think a show has ever lived up to the hype as much as Avatar: The Last Airbender did! It has instantly entered my top 10 TV shows of all time.

I can't think of any honestly negative things to say about it. Apart from maybe the fact that it finished! I wanted more time with these characters. :("
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"The birth of Zuko, one of the most well developed characters I've seen in any piece of media."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"It's a good thing nobody ever made a ""Last Airbender"" movie. I don't think this story could be translated to the big screen."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I cant believe its been 15 years. [My Cabbages.](https://i.imgur.com/GEivZmD.jpg)

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Confused by “On a less serious note ATLA is also the only cartoon other than SpongeBob to win the Kids Choice Award for Best Cartoon since 2003.”

Are there non-cartoon winners in that category?

Also, I’d maintain that book 2 is one of the best seasons of any show ever."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"15 years later, and ATLA is still one of the best shows I have ever seen. My favorite moment has to be the moment where Iroh visits his sons grave. I still cry whenever I see that scene."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I think what I loved the most about the show was the duality between aang and zuko. The avatar is painted to be a great hero destined to bring balance to the world, but Aang is only 12! Err 112...but still 12.  Zuko is our 1st seasons main bad guy but he only seeks to regain his honor to redeem himself in his father's eyes, yet as he travels around the world he sees what his nation has done to the world and ultimately becomes the avatars' firebending teacher and good friend.

My favorite episode: episode 17 of s2"

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Nick messed up by not playing a marathon for the 15 year anniversary.

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I think the best part of the show is that it is a rare example of a show really being ageless.

Little kids can enjoy the show for it's humor and action, older kids can learn important life lessons from it and for adults it's just a really entertaining story."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I’m hopping dragon prince will end up as this grand adventure in story telling that the last air bender was as well. So far it is great, but I understand that for every great start to a tv show, it could end poorly *cough* Game of Thrones *cough*"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I've never watched this show. When I first saw the commercials many years ago, I thought it looked childish and disregarded it.

However the amount of love and dedication I've seen from the fans of this show (most of it here on Reddit) makes me think there might be something here worth exploring. A show doesn't get a cult following like this for no reason.

I have put this show on my list of things to try and look into this year. Hopefully, before the end of the year, I will be just as excited about it as many of you seem to be :)"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"This was a perfect show. I watched it with my kids when they were toddlers. and my youngest is old enough to have actually bought the series. It's awesome, because she'll come out of her room and cast it on the TV. I got to sit on the couch with my 17 year old daughter and watch Sozin's Comet last weekend. 

The whole series holds up."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"This show is filled with lessons about love, friendship, acceptance, and change. It's very special for my daughter and I. We watched it when it came out and we still talk about it today."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"PLEASE READ THE BOOKS, The first book of the Kyoshi series is out and the second comes this summer. Its extremely well written and really dives into parts of the Avatar universe you wouldn't expect. 5/5 Would Reccomend!"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"For anyone that doesn't know a real strong and more realistic/mature tone also exists in the Rise of Kyoshi novel, sequel book coming this summer. Let's just say its come a long way from Jet's unclear death. And the villain might be as good as Azula."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,What surprises me most about the franchise is the lack of AAA video games. I would kill for a decent airbender video game.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Its top 5 best tv series on my book. 

Beautifully drawn and animated, the story is immersive, the characters are memorable, the action is gripping. 

More importantly it teaches valuable lessons on how to treat others. I will always reccomend it to people."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,ATLA transcends age. It transcends generations. Everyone can learn something from this show.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Watching it with my gf who is a first time viewer. Just started season 3!
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,One of the best written animated tv shows i have ever seen. It’ll be a while before we see its like again.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"It’s amazing how enormous Avatar: The Last Airbender was. I know I remember the advertisements for the premiere, cause it was heavily promoted, but I can’t remember if I saw the premiere or a subsequent re-run the next following days. I still think it’s one of the best action shows of all time, be it animation or television in general. I remember being so satisfied with the ending that I didn’t really need the comic continuations. Korra is fine on its own, though it has so much writing and pacing issues that I don’t think it’s anywhere near the same quality."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"This show taught me so many life lessons. If you watched this show as a child but haven't seen it since, please watch it as an adult! Or, if you've never seen it, please check it out. This story is one of the greatest ever told."

Please do not dismiss these series as just a kids cartoon as I first did upon Googling it, it is much more than that and has some incredible characters which grow over the course of the series and has become one of the best shows I have ever watched"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I live in an EU country and I have tried to find a streaming or any other platform to watch the last airbender series for several years and I have found zero legal ways to see it. So if any of you that see this comment know where I can watch it I would be very grateful.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I recently just re watched the series last month. Still holds up. I was sad watching the last few episodes.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"This show was prime for me as a depressed 20 something to escape to a heartfelt world with wonderful characters and relationships. I bought all three seasons on blue ray and watched them years later with my girlfriend who also loved the show.

Other than some amazing book series I’ve read over the years this has been one of the most therapeutic series I’ve bet watched.

I do wish more time had been able to be spent at each stage of development, especially the final season. Best example is sokkas master, they could easily have stretched that development over multiple episodes where sokka continues training and developing and he catches up with the gang later, that master was truly an amazing character for his growth and it felt a bit too quickly tied up for such a strong growth in sokka."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I have watched the whole thing over the past few weeks, except for the last two episodes, which I was planning to see tonight. Overall, I feel like I missed the boat by watching it as an adult, and was was probably far too old for it even when it came out, but my younger brother and his friends claim it ""was their childhood"". I have to say that Book 3 gets more interesting as it goes on though, and I am looking forward to seeing the conclusion. And I sort of like the way that nearly every one-off character and even the ""cabbage guy"" ends up affecting the story in the final season."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Just watched Day of Black Sun yesterday with my daughter. She's way too young to understand pretty much any of what's going on (only a year) but she's very taken by the art and the music. When Zuko confronts the ancient masters of firebending, I made her look at the screen and she was totally absorbed by the sequence.

Favorite moments are gonna be some of the more obvious ones (That's rough, buddy) and of course everything involving Uncle Iroh, all of the blind jokes with Toph (It's upside down, isn't it?) but...

I'll copy/paste from a comment I made the other day in the ATLA sub on a comment about Azula, sister to Prince Zuko and one of the most evil characters the show has. The post was a picture of her suffering her final mental breakdown and sobbing uncontrollably, and the comment I responded to was about her gagging and probably burning herself on the literal flames she was howling out in fury moments prior.

>I always saw that as her rage sputtering out. The reality of it all settling in and just truly overwhelming her. Beaten by your fuck-up of a brother and his backwater peasant not-girlfriend on what is supposed to be your day while the nation - and the rest of the world - watches with bated breath. Not only is it a loss, not only is it a failure, it is a total deconstruction of everything you thought you were. Perfect? Measured? Balanced? Controlled? Look at yourself. Listen to your manic laughter as you hunt the person who is trying to save your brother - who you just attempted murder on! Technically manslaughter, what with intent and all I suppose, but still.

>Could she have burned herself? Probably. I honestly hadn't considered that until your comment. Everything else about her life failed in that moment, so why not her ability to properly control her incredible talents? But the physical burn wasn't the one that hurt her. It was her world turning to ash before her eyes despite - and in many ways *because of* - her efforts to keep everything perfect. It wasn't her body that burned, it was her life.

Yeah, it's not just a kids show. They deal with some heavy, heavy material. Everyone struggles with the cost of war, and in very real ways, including the depths it can drag you to. The haunted look on Katara's face when she does bloodbending for the first time, the way she collapses into herself when Hamma taunts her about it... Zuko's entire arc. It may be a show for kids, but the drama is definitely for the adults in the room.

When I finish the last episode for my fourth straight-through viewing in a couple days, I will cry just like I did the first time.

And then, of course, the nods to Aang in Korra.

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Only watched this for the first time last year on Prime (in the UK). It was pretty great. I watched the Legend of Korra immediately afterwards and I enjoyed it more. Maybe because it was a little more mature of a show, and I'm in my twenties. Don't get me wrong, I like ATLA, I just liked Korra more. I'm happy a colleague persuaded me to watch it."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Your in depth description alone deserves an upvote...

Besides Gravity Falls, I think this is the best kid’s show with a story that I’ve ever seen. A lot of episodes can work as their own stand alone episodes, but what’s amazing is that every one is important to the overarching story of the series. It’s such a treat when writers put genuine craft in their work for kid’s programming."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I think I’d like this show a lot more if it weren’t for the fandom surrounding it. I currently live with two people who are rabidly obsessed with this show and it’s really spoiled any goodwill I might have had towards it.

I loved the show as a kid, and it was one of the things that brought me and my 4 brothers together, and I was perfectly content to remain nostalgic and maybe watch it again someday. But, hearing constant blathering about ships and Zuko being gay and Uncle Iroh doing this or that is driving me insane."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,One of the greatest shows ever made
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Probably an unpopular opinion here, but my favorite thing about Airbender is its sequel series, Korra. It just spoke to me a lot more than TLA did, but I know it owes most of its success to the groundwork laid by TLA.

I also didn't *hate* the Shyamalan movie, but that's obviously another story"

Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"ATLA was the first tv series I could watch without sleep(2nd was Wolf’s Rain, third one being Higurashi), it was that interesting. I missed the original broadcast, mostly because I am not from the US, so I downloaded all 3 seasons on my portable video player and fondly remember times I could easily watch it up to 4 am and didn’t remotely feel the need for sleep. That spring/summer I watched ATLA 3 times in my native language’s dub and 2 times in english. It’s the only series I can relate to people that say I wish I could forget it all and watch again for the first time. Pure perfection even though some episodes felt somewhat slow. My most favorite episodes of all would probably be the ones with Aang returning to the remnants of air nation in s1e3 and s1e17. Something about uncovering the things of the past really struck a cord with me."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I just finished rewatching Book 1 yesterday, and will continue on with the second season in the next couple of days. This show is great."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I just bought the complete series on Blu-ray this past weekend and I'll be starting the second season tonight. Really good so far and I couldn't be more disappointed in myself that I didn't try to watch this series when it first came out.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"And if you want more Avatar, there are comics continuing both series (ATLA and TLOK) and they're actually pretty dang good."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Favorite show of all time, please add this to a streaming service in the US so I can promptly give that streaming service my money. Also I’m excited for the next Kyoshi book and the live action Netflix show (which hopefully doesn’t suck!)"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I refuse to believe I was 5 when the show started. There is no way it's been that long
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Zuko's story is the greatest redemption arc in TV history with an emotionally powerful last stand playing out in complete silence. This is kind of show you can confidently show you kids and they'll love it for it's fun parts, but it's also a very emotional journey with much deeper elements for the older audience and teaching a lot great values to everyone, be a parent or a kid, including bad examples and explaining well why it is bad (think of Azula here and how her controlling behaviour made her friends terrified of her and turn away for example)."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"One of my favorite cartoon/anime series. And one of the few where the final boss fight didn't disappoint.

Would love to see more Avatar."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"I LOVE AVATAR!!!  All time favorite.  The redemption arc of Zuko is one of the best ever written and although I loved all the characters, Uncle Iroh was my favorite.  To this day, when I'm down, I watch Avatar and let Uncle Iroh give me food for thought."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Avatar is the greatest piece of media I've seen in my life
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I finally watched this about 4 years ago. Fucking incredible show.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,We need an official release of the soundtrack!
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"One of the things they did that was just spectacular was character revelation and development. Characters start off as ""Oh, they are like this,"" and we gain more understanding/sympathy as their histories are revealed. We get to witness their struggles (physically, emotionally, spiritually) and follow them as they journey through that and change over the entire series. We get to understand what they strive for. We get to see WHY they strive for it.

The themes the show contains are both mature and approachable. It speaks to themes that we all encounter: loneliness, yearning, assumptions, irresponsibility, betrayal, loyalty...

The animation is also spectacular, my favourites would be the epic fights! The motion, tactics, and elements clashing create such a symphony of colours and dance. I am always in awe when I rewatch those scenes. Even in battles there are emotional aspects that draw us in and move us.

All in all, a masterpiece."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Favorite moment was ""It's upside down, isn't it"".

It took me to the cactus scene in the good place to laugh that hard at something on a show since."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Still the best show nickeldeon has ever produced.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"Fuck it, we need a third show about an earth Avatar, probably take place in the 1990's"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,My favorite moment is Zuko and Iroh's prodigal son moment at the tent towards the end of the series.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,One of the greatest shows of all time. It was the first series I ever bought on Blu-Ray.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Pronounced like Ahng right?
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"This show aired when my kids were pretty young. They were enthralled by all sorts of shit kids shows that would entertain them so I could straighten up the house on the weekends but I found myself on the couch with them for Avatar. Before long, I realized that it was one of, if not THE best kids show on television. I think that I was more excited than them when a new episode was coming. To this day, I believe it to be one of the best shows ever put on television. The writing and art were perfect, especially as it progressed to the end. It was beautiful."
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,One of the greatest shows ever made. It will forever hold a very special place in my heart.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,"The housemates and I just started a rewatch, so good"
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I can easily call it the best animated series of all time.
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Oh cool! I just started a rewatch yesterday after noticing it on Netfux
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I literally just watched all of Avatar and Legend of Kora this week I didnt even know it was the anniversary
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,I hear the theme play in my head once I starting reading “the avatar has been missing for 100 years... in this time the fire nation... “
Ontdek de wereld met Nijntje,Absolutely love this show. The speech Iroh gives to Zuko when he’s trying to decide whether to steal Appa or give him back to Aang still gives me chills to this day
Dicte,"Wow, you got a lot of them already, but here's the one's I think you could also include:

*Freaks and Geeks* is Lindsay Weir's story of how she falls in with the bad crowd.

*The Legend of Korra* while not as strong as the original, yet, is still a good animated series with a female lead.

*Dollhouse* has a female lead although the you could right question how strong a character could be in that role considering the memory is wiped clean every episode.

*Dead Like Me* has a female lead. The show certainly has its ups and downs but overall pretty good.

I would argue the Major from *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* is the lead there, and an excellent character all around to boot.

*My So-Called Life* was the original Claire Danes TV show before *Homeland* came along."
Dicte,Why wouldn't Homeland count? Carrie is the main character. 
Dicte,[deleted]
Dicte,Why'd you put Parks & Rec under dramady? It's a pretty straight comedy
Dicte,"[Bomb Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1955311/reference) is Canadian btw, unless there's another one, in which case the Canuck show should be on there...

Also, add in [Being Erica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149608/reference) - love that show.

And [Hunted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069449/reference)

Both versions of La Femme Nikita, of course... (although the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118379/reference) was better than the [remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592154/reference) hehe..)

[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098898/reference) (UK) - all seasons/series.

[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/reference) - renewed for a second season yay.

(ps you dont really need to mark anything as Canada since like 50% of the shows listed are produced here and it's redundant.)"
Dicte,"What about Bones? Booth is also a lead, but the show definitely revolves around her.

The Middle could also potentially fit. It generally focuses on Patricia Heaton's character as she deals with her family, though it's become more of an ensemble.

The New Adventures of Old Christine was definitely all about Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character, and should be added for sure."
Dicte,"I think perhaps you might consider adding Little Mosque on the Prairie, it's a little goofball, and kind of skirts some of the more serious issues brought about by the meeting of Canadian culture and Islam, but does feature some strong women, and women of colour to boot.  My personal favourite character is Fatima, a local restaurant owner."
Dicte,I think both Moesha and The Parkers would both qualify as well as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 
Dicte,"""Veronica Mars"" is not a fantasy show. You might want to add ""Nancy Drew Mysteries"" though. Cheers. :-)"
Dicte,"*Necessary Roughness*

I quit watching this season because it basically rebooted itself. Not groundbreaking. Along the lines of traditional USA shows, but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Definitely add *Murphy Brown*.

And while they're older than most shows listed: *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, *Rhoda*, *Maude*, *One Day at a Time*, *Cagney & Lacey*, *Police Woman*, *Wonder Woman*... I'd even argue *Bewitched* and *I Love Lucy*."
Dicte,"Without a Trace (US Marshall/cop drama)  
~~Gilmore Girls (debated whether this fit your 'strong' criteria, decided relationship-oriented didn't necessarily mean weak).~~  

Edit: never mind, you were on it."
Dicte,Hawthorne! Was on air for 4 seasons. Jada Pinkett-Smith is lead. 
Dicte,No X-Files? 
Dicte,"I would have thought Grey's Anatomy would count. It's named after the main character, Meredith Grey.

Borgen, Spiral, Lost in Austen, Land Girls, Sugar Rush, The Sarah Jane Adventures.... Daria? ;)"
Dicte,"Separate the list to include science/speculative-fiction and fantasy as a separate category. Put Fringe, Torchwood, Terminator:SCC. Dollhouse, Star Trek Voyager, Buffy et al under that. "
Dicte,[deleted]
Dicte,"Both from Denmark -  Borgen and Forbrydelsen.  The Killing is based on Forbrydelsen. Borgen is a political drama.

Also Annika Bengzton, Crime Reporter.  On Netflix."
Dicte,"I'm glad to see Covert Affairs here--that show is continually getting better and better. Season 3 was incredible. 

I'm also a big Necessary Roughness fan, although the show's new direction has taken some of the focus off of Dani, and doesn't spend much time on family life anymore, which I enjoyed because how many other shows revolve around a mother with older kids? "
Dicte,"[McLeod's Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod's_Daughters) - this may or may not be to everyone's taste, but it's really good for what it is. The story is carried by a strong cast of female leads and is very heavily female-centric. I personally love it to bits."
Dicte,"None of these have women of colour except maybe Drop Dead Diva (asian woman), but she isn't really a main character.

Pulling (UK) - A comedy revolving around the antics of 3 quickly aging but uncompromising women.  

Accidentally on Purpose - a middle aged woman gets pregnant on a one night stand (might be too focused on both the woman and the dude from the one night stand, but I think the woman is really the main character)

2 Broke Girls - The story of 2 financially lacking girls trying to make it in life.

Drop Dead Diva - A female model gets put into the body of a chubby female lawyer after death.

Hellcats - Cheerleaders dealing with university and athletic pressure.

Reba? Might focus too much on the whole cast rather than just Reba.  (Don't judge, it's a great and adorable show)

Pan Am? Also might focus too much on the men in the show, but I think the women are the main characters.

EDIT to add more shows and: This is a pretty comprehensive list you've got going - I'm definitely saving this thread."
Dicte,"Maybe I'm wrong but I would definitely say Castle.

I guess Castle may be the lead, but Beckett is a close right?"
Dicte,You can put Law & Order SVU on your list. Detective Benson is the main character now that Stabler has left the show.
Dicte,"American Horror Story,
The Americans,
Bates Motel?

"
Dicte,"What do you suggest if I like action/crime shows? I have already watched R&I and I don't like things that are too old or that can't be grabbed from the Internet.
"
Dicte,"I'm rather late to this thread, but: [Hit & Miss](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70271757?locale=en-US&mqso=81198655&titleVideoId=70271757&awadgroupid=8344250348&awcampaignid=121071908&awcreative=34988547188&awdevice=c&awexpid=&awkeyword=%2Bhit%20%2Bmiss%20%2Bnetflix&awmatchtype=b&awnetwork=g&awposition=1t1&gclid=CMP-vaOv_LsCFXPNOgodf2IAqw) (UK). (Technically the character is a pre op transexual, but close enough)"
Dicte,Nice list but now the question is : which are worth watching?
Dicte,"""Strong"" female figures? Some of them, maybe, not all. Not by a long shot."
Dicte,Hightown.
Dicte,I take it you didn't see the end of *Dollhouse* if you question whether or not Elisa Dushku's character is strong even with the memory wipes.
Dicte,"Some good ones, thanks! Added to the list."
Dicte,"I wasn't sure - it seems like an ensemble show (Carrie and Brody). But now I'm remembering that the producers have said the show could go on even without Brody, so you're right. I'll add it to the list. Thanks!"
Dicte,"Great suggestions! Hadn't heard of Devious Maids or Scott and Bailey, and forgot about Prime Suspect and Call the Midwife. Will add them and The Killing to the list. Probably won't add The Bridge since it appears to be an ensemble piece (both the male and female lead have equal billing), but still plan to check it out. "
Dicte,"Just missed it when I was going back through the list. Thanks for the reminder, I'll correct."
Dicte,"Good catch re: Bones and The New Adventures of Old Christine. Never watched the latter, but love Bones. She's a great character (Angela, too :).




Left The Middle off for now because it seems more of an ensemble."
Dicte,"Added. Looks like an interesting show, is it available to watch on DVD or a streaming service?"
Dicte,"Good additions, thanks!"
Dicte,">but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Damn right. Her guest starring on Burn Notice was great as well."
Dicte,"Added. Keep seeing Necessary Roughness and plan to check it out - though this season's promos of John Stamos have not filled me with confidence. Good to hear the first few seasons are good, though."
Dicte,"Nice one! I like Jada, though I got bored after a few episodes...did it get better over time?"
Dicte,"The show seems equally focused on Fox and Scully. Scully's a great character, though."
Dicte,"Agreed. Greys main character, meredith, is complicated and interesting. And the good thing about greys is while Grey is the show's namesake, the rest of the female cast are arguably more interesting and funny and fun to watch. It seriously belongs on the list of good shows with strong female lead(s).

It's written by a woman of color, Shondra Rhimes who also writes Scandal. It's also very rewatchable, it has layers and connections that you can pick up on a 2nd or 3rd viewing. It's on Netflix, 172 eps, and it's good until the S8 finale."
Dicte,Done. Also specified which shows have teen leads. 
Dicte,Added. Is it sc-fi?
Dicte,Are these shows in English?
Dicte,"Just finished marathoning Covert Affairs from the beginning. Starts off a little generic, but gets really good! I'm definitely hooked now."
Dicte,"Good suggestions, added. And I liked Reba, too. :)"
Dicte,">women of colour

sup tumblr"
Dicte,"Officially it revolves around Castle, so it doesn't qualify. Since most TV shows are still led by male characters, or by ensemble casts (if you don't believe me, just browse top TV shows on IMDb, or the shows nominated for Emmys, or the prime-time lineup for almost any network), I want to keep this list to the relatively smaller number of shows led by female characters."
Dicte,"Good point - it started out as an ensemble show, but I think she evolved to be the main character."
Dicte,I think all these are technically ensembles. Good shows! But not appropriate for the list.
Dicte,"All pretty good (in my opinion): Alias, Nikita, The Closer, Major Crimes, The Commander (UK but available on Netflix), Scandal, The Good Wife, Damages"
Dicte,Depends on what you like. What are your preferences?
Dicte,"From the OP:

> It doesn't necessarily mean likable or physically strong, but they have to be *more than one-dimensional caricatures* (i.e. no I Dream of Jeannie's).

""Strong"" as in carrying the show, not as in a character trait."
Dicte,"I think they've said it could go on without Carrie, too. But I would still consider her one of the two lead characters for now, which is enough to make the list, I think."
Dicte,[deleted]
Dicte,Another one is Rookie Blue. It's a Canadian show where Missy Peregrym plays a rookie cop that the show is centered around.
Dicte,"Grey's Anatomy has tons of great female characters, I just forgot it technically revolved around Meredith. I'll add it. 




LOVE Scandal - that was one of the first I thought of when I started making the list."
Dicte,"I was thinking Utopia as well.  It's not exactly sci-fi, but you can put it in that category.  It's also amazing btw lol..."
Dicte,"They're not but the first two are definitely worth watching even if you don't like reading subtitles.

My suggestions would be The Blue Rose (NZ), Outrageous Fortune (NZ), Offspring (AUS), Spirited (AUS) and Lip Service (UK)."
Dicte,I don't get it.  Is there a famous women of colour tumblr or something?
Dicte,That makes more sense. I've always thought that science fiction writers tend to create more well-rounded female characters than other writers. Why do you think that is?
Dicte,If they take Carrie out then they'd have to change the opening.
Dicte,Added. Thanks! Been meaning to check some of these out on Netflix.
Dicte,"Will definitely check out the Danish shows, thanks for the recommendation! And for the NZ and AUS shows, they're good additions to the list."
Dicte,"I think it's because of the writer's theory-of-the-future, or progress more generally.

When thinking of how the future will be, they decide that women will have a larger role in society, more important roles in leadership, and to-but-it-bluntly *more complicated* lives.

I think this is gibberish myself as women already have more complicated lives than they are shown to live in most fiction. When a writer has a female character in a present day fiction that character needs to be complicated in order to be both interesting and realistic.

I think another reason is the mostly male producers either poorly relate to complicated female characters *or* the believe the *auduience they are selling to* will poorly relate."
Dicte,I don't see that as a problem.
Dicte,[deleted]
Dicte,"If I had the time, I'd try to do the Bechdel test on all of those shows/movies. Thanks for your reply, I didn't think I'd get one from anybody!"
Ray Donovan,"Ray Donovan received the classic Showtime treatment most Showtime originals received: starts off strong, falters toward the end and becomes rather mediocre. However, I'll still advise going through with the show, the cast is spectacular with the Donovan brothers (Liev Schreiber, Eddie Marsan, and Dash Mihok), Paula Malcomson as Ray's wife, and Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan. As much as I despised Mickey, I gotta commend Voight on his acting and playing such a good sleazebag/con-man at his age."
Ray Donovan,Terrific show
Ray Donovan,"If you haven't seen *Justified*, your list indicates that it would probably rock your boat as well."
Ray Donovan,Yeah
Ray Donovan,"Yeah, one of the better crime shows of the last decade with an absolute great cast."
Ray Donovan,"No, I don't think so. I wanted this show to be about Ray Donovan being a fixer, and that part is good. But that is only a tiny part of the show, and mostly early on. Most of the show is a family drama. Two annoying older kids, two incredibly annoying brothers, and one infuriating father (Jon Voight), and Ray running around growling while bailing them out of their hairbrained misadventures. Ray's wife is cool, but not a reason to watch the show. I saw the series through but was it was s grind and I was more than glad to be done with it. The whole time I just wanted Ray and his fixing assistants to take over the plot.

I like gritty crime dramas and subtitles, and would say Gommorah and Engrenages/Spiral are 2 of my favorites. Also, saw Mr Robot a few months ago (psychological thriller more than crime drama) and it hurtled to the top tier of my all-time faves. Currently I'm rewatching Justified."
Ray Donovan,"It's good, yes, but as others have noted, it starts to go down hill. 

The Wire is a great option if you have not seen that. Sopranos too. I assume everyone has seen both those shows at this point though, lol."
Ray Donovan,"I liked it enough but yeah they stretched it too much, by the end it's the cast that carry the show. I would check it out but as soon you get fed up with it, simply move on it will not get any better.

Otherwise, I can't recommend Mr. Inbetween enough (r/MrInbetween). It's about  an Aussie hitman trying to juggle his work activities with his personnal life. It sadly was overlooked when it was airing but it's top tier and a quick watch with only 3 seasons of 30 minutes episodes."
Ray Donovan,">tried Homeland but never clicked strongly

I enjoyed Homeland as a whole but it had some weak seasons. I actually rewatched it during COVID and enjoyed it but I still have a hard time recommending it.

As for Ray Donovan, I loved it in the beginning but it was hard to finish. It was a show that I wanted to stay the same but it changed radically. I always loved the fixer aspect of the show but that became a small part after a while.

Maybe I don't have much imagination but I want the core of a show to stay the same. If it's a legal show, I want to see courtrooms. If it's a medical show, I want to see operating rooms. I realize they want to expand characters but once you start having entire episodes that barely touch on the core theme of the show, I lose interest."
Ray Donovan,"Not really,

First few episodes were great and I liked the Ray character, but it rapidly changed into Ray repetitively getting his shitty unlikable family out of their endless boring shitty problems.   

It became sort of like a old time soap opera with ugly shitty people.

I didn’t stick with it long enough to see if it would turn around in later seasons."
Ray Donovan,"It was good, I stopped watching around season 4 or 5. I'd rather watch Ozark or Get Shorty."
Ray Donovan,just watch it and then think if its good or not
Ray Donovan,You binged it? Why in the world would you do that...
Ray Donovan,Yes! It’s very good!
Ray Donovan,The show seemed to become too respective for me and went on too long. Nevertheless Paula Malcomson is a rock star as well as Jon Voight.
Ray Donovan,Southie crime family moves to LA
Ray Donovan,"Thank you so much for the thoughts. Peaky set the bar high lately but officially starting tonight. Couldn't make it past S3 of Homeland, but to each their own. Still have the Crown untouched."
Ray Donovan,"Damn, Pooch Hall's whole struggle was not being considered a Donovan brother and you play him like that."
Ray Donovan,"Have seen, boat rocked. Looking forward to move - thanks homie"
Ray Donovan,"Thanks for the thoughtful response. Just watched the first episode and it interesting but maybe too serious. Peaky, Justified, Deadwood, Barry, Fargo, Slow Horses are fun. If you haven't seen Giri/Haji would highly recommend. Will check out Gomorrah, thanks risq."
Ray Donovan,"Thanks, the OG's. Have - BB, MM, Succession would put above even."
Ray Donovan,Ozark was so fun and engaging. Stellar performance. I like Elmore Leonard's writing and the movie a cult masterpiece. Is the show good.
Ray Donovan,"Bing has not and will never be a thing. My apologies, not fixing. Did you watch/like Ray?"
Ray Donovan,"Ah, haven't seen it yet I'll put it on the list, thanks. Hm, thinking now I should mention that Gommorah is riveting and an a+ all around, but I can't call it fun per se lol. Here is the [season 1 trailer](https://youtu.be/-4QORgagblU) that gives the basic idea but doesn't really capture the tone so much."
Ray Donovan,Almost forgot about Boardwalk Empire.
Ray Donovan,"No i came to see others opinions on the show as well, small sample size so far but seems to me like it might be worth watching"
Ray Donovan,"You know I liked, but didn't love. To each their own."
Ray Donovan,I dunno I feel like they might very much regret it in the later seasons.
Ray Donovan,it's fine for the first 3 seasons then it becomes unbearable very quickly
Ray Donovan,Agree.
Ray Donovan,Its a showtime show.
Ray Donovan,Just watched „Salt“ with Liev Schreiber
Ray Donovan,A showtime show with iffy later seasons that should have just ended earlier? That's unique
Ray Donovan,"So many /r/television headlines are of the form ""Actor, who makes money acting, would consider acting."""
Ray Donovan,Very rarely do actors say they won't go back to a show or movie franchise. They want fans to like them and they want a good pay check so it's no real surprise. Sometimes they will use qualifiers like if it's a good script or if so and so is there. It is only news is if they straight out say there is no way I will go back to that show or movie franchise.
Ray Donovan,Please no. It ended perfectly.
Ray Donovan,"I found the quality of this show really yo-yo'd over the years. I used to love it but then there a season in the middle I assume where it went all weird and dreamy (maybe to Ireland) and it completely lost me. I then read it had regained form the lost it completely again. I had no idea there was a film tying things up...

Get Shorty and more recently Barry satisfied my itch for this type of glossy violent LA comedy/drama"
Ray Donovan,I hate I stopped watching I will be rewatching from the beginning when I get a chance and forget enough so I don't get bored
Ray Donovan,Nice picture. I thought I was looking at Tennessee Ernie Ford.
Ray Donovan,"It's fucking endemic to media in general, I unfollowed ign because it was literally every day they would post 'actor who used to play well received and well paying role would do so again' as if it was their decision and not the studio's."
Ray Donovan,"""but only under any conditions"""
Ray Donovan,"> It is only news is if they straight out say there is no way I will go back to that show or movie franchise.

Even that is often just a negotiating tactic."
Ray Donovan,"This.  I would have loved an actual season eight, ideally, but the movie did a really good job at ending the Ray Donovan story.  We only even got the movie after a lot of social media pressure, so I'll happily take it."
Ray Donovan,movie already released ?
Ray Donovan,Tbh a full final season probably drags on. I loved the movie
Ray Donovan,"Yeah, it was on Showtime a few months ago."
Ray Donovan,"I thought it was very mediocre, but some seemed to like it."
Ray Donovan,"As a longtime TV viewer, it's really, really hard to stick the landing on the finale of a show.  RD's finale was not the best I'd seen, by a long shot, but it was better than a lot of finales that I'd seen.  I'm talking to you, Ozark."
Ray Donovan,"Like most moderately successful showtime shows, they really dragged this show out. Really enjoyed it for a few seasons then lost interest"
Ray Donovan,Could have done with another 20-30 minutes to close out some more characters but it was enjoyable overall.
Ray Donovan,"Whatever your opinion on the show, Liev Schreiber IS an incredible actor"
Ray Donovan,I watched the first two seasons recently but it really fell off in season 3.  He works for some guy I have no care about and it’s just boring.  Don’t know if I’ll ever finish it.
Ray Donovan,[deleted]
Ray Donovan,I dropped it in 3.
Ray Donovan,And then rewarded those that stuck through it with an out of the blue cancellation on a cliffhanger.
Ray Donovan,Couldn't finished the first episode of the last season.
Ray Donovan,The last couple seasons were actually pretty good.
Ray Donovan,"Me, too. Also, the show is a textbook example of a show where every character is a terrible human being... even, eventually, Bunchy."
Ray Donovan,"The deal on the stadium probably fell through because of the arrest of the father, was my thinking."
Ray Donovan,"&#x200B;

Yes, I agree that the beginning parts were better.  I wanted them to do more fixer parts in depth.  I didn't like when Ray actually killed someone.  But still I enjoyed the show until the end and am big fan of it."
Ray Donovan,When Ann Biderman quit the quality dropped
Ray Donovan,"Yeah, that was shitty, but they at least gave us the movie.  I just watched it and it was pretty decent.  I did really like how Ray and Mickey's relationship came full circle in the end."
Ray Donovan,"I also had the same issue. I very much wanted to like the show because Liev Schreiber, but i have a threshold for asshole characters, and it *launched* over it almost *immediately*"
Ray Donovan,"*""Y'fuckin' lyin' to me, Ray?!""*

For four entire seasons."
Ray Donovan,"Nope, it’s grit porn.  The acting is great and the stories are good, but honestly it was just a very difficult watch for me and so I gave up after season 3."
Ray Donovan,Nope. The family is the central plot of the show and the movie.
Ray Donovan,Thanks for posting this thread... I haven't tried the show but now I know why I'm fine just passing it up.  I have a low threshold for this kind of stuff.
Ray Donovan,"It spins its wheels for however many seasons there are. It's ok, but never does anything. I tapped out after maybe 4 seasons."
Ray Donovan,I stopped watching after a few episodes. Every character is a piece of shit. Not my type of show.
Ray Donovan,The daughter is my most hated character. She grinds every scene to a screeching halt
Ray Donovan,The wife and children are insufferable. I don't believe for a second he would be married to that woman. I fast forward through all scenes with the wife and children.
Ray Donovan,"My favorite show of all time lol, mainly cause of how dark it is. I'm not enamored with comedy/parody like most of this sub"
Ray Donovan,Gave up on it after two seasons and by most accounts that was an inspired decision.
Ray Donovan,We watched the finale movie last night. It completely ties everything up. Please continue. It's one of the best shows ever. Seriously!!!
Ray Donovan,"Huh, I love it."
Ray Donovan,"I'm just starting. Halfway through the pilot. (I actually came here to find out of the green dye in the pilot has a bigger significance than just making it really easy to spot that creep if he was stalking that girl again) but now I'm curious.

How does it compare to Shameless? Jesus Christ I hated so many of those characters. Noel Fisher (Mickey) is pretty much the main reason I stuck it out to the end. 

And even Breaking Bad-  my first time through I was so annoyed by how much everyone seems to hate each other. Walt hates Skylar half the time. Then she hates him. Jr. hates. him. Everyone hates Marie or Hank at some point. He and Jesse have a fucked up relationship. And that was the people we were supposed to like! 

If that bothered me, am I really going to despise this?"
Ray Donovan,Ray Ray
Ray Donovan,"Knowing this website, OP is probably talking about his wife and kids and not his dad or brothers."
Ray Donovan,"Knowing the show, it applies to both of them."
Ray Donovan,"I hope this is good.  More shows should get the opportunity to end properly.  

Also, Did anyone see Bunchy in there?"
Ray Donovan,"He never says goodbye to people, in person or on the phone. He just turns and leaves when he’s done with the conversation or hangs up"
Ray Donovan,"I'm finally watching this. On S2. I can see them getting stuck on a plot loop.  I hope they move past it. 

Love the clothing styles though."
Ray Donovan,I don't even remember what the loose ends were but ok I'll watch it.
Ray Donovan,Not a single mention of Con-ah so that is a definite move in the right direction.
Ray Donovan,"I quit watching like a season or two after Abby died, show just seemed to be repeating itself every season Mick does something dumb with the badguy of the season, insert family drama of some sort here, ray prolly cheats on his wife then saves the day through nefarious means, mick does something dumb to lead into next season.

Did the show pick up any a couple seasons after his wife died?"
Ray Donovan,Stopped watching after the weird season where his wife was killed off during the offseason
Ray Donovan,Sure.
Ray Donovan,This was a pretty bad show so I'm surprised they're even getting to do a movie.
Ray Donovan,Do you think all the same people are gonna be in it.?
Ray Donovan,"wait, I seem to have lived under a rock. Has the show been cancelled? What's with the loose end stuff?"
Ray Donovan,Better be some twerking
Ray Donovan,"I stopped watching around season 4 or so. It seemed like Ray stopped being a fixer for other people and started just fixing the problems his family kept getting into.

Did that ever change? My favorite episodes were when he was the Hollywood fixer."
Ray Donovan,"Bunchy is in there, briefly when the brothers all have a drink.  No Connor."
Ray Donovan,"Ron Howard: ""They dont"""
Ray Donovan,Also no indication that they're going to let Bridget sing again.
Ray Donovan,"This, the way they gave her cancer and literally wrote her off felt awful. Prolly gonna miss this one tbh."
Ray Donovan,"Cancelled is the wrong word.  It didn't get picked up for a final full season, but Showtime is letting them do a wrap-up movie."
Ray Donovan,">No Connor

You mean No *Connah* right?"
Ray Donovan,"For the lazy:

>Laying out Showtime’s programming plans for the next year at TCA, the network’s Presidents of Entertainment Gary Levine and Jana Winograde said that the Ray Donovan feature-length movie will debut this coming winter. **Levine later clarified that the film will premiere in the first quarter of 2022**, which would be exactly two years after the series’ surprise cancellation that led to outcry from fans."
Ray Donovan,is the show worth watching?

Penny Dreadful,"RIP

Vibert was Lepidus in Rome. Lepidus was part of the Second Triumvirate with Octavian and Marc Antony. Also was in the Hatfields and McCoys mini series."
Penny Dreadful,"Very likeable in Rome, loathsome in the Borgias.  I guess that's the mark of a great actor."
Penny Dreadful,"He died last Thursday at a Florida hospital after a brief illness. The nature of the illness was not specified. He leaves a wife, Jess."
Penny Dreadful,"Haven't seen any of those, but he was great as Lord Wellington in the TV adaptation of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell."
Penny Dreadful,He was excellent as Giovanni Sforza in *The Borgias*.
Penny Dreadful,I can’t remember him in penny dreadful. I know that series well it’s one of my favorite! Who did he play on the show?
Penny Dreadful,Penny Dreadful was so good.
Penny Dreadful,Rome was such a great show
Penny Dreadful,time to rewatch Rome
Penny Dreadful,"This guy was an actor who made his often minor roles each into something to remember.  

He was a truly repellent Robespierre in the 90s *Scarlet Pimpernel* series with Richard E. Grant, Martin Shaw and Elizabeth McGovern, and later a nasty piece of work that kills the wife of Inspector Lewis in a hit-and-run in a show I can't recall the name of right now.  He was just really, really good... and IMO much better than many actors who are more well known.

Great actor who made the most of even mediocre parts.  R.I.P."
Penny Dreadful,"I can't remember him from Rome but I do remember him as Perry Cline in Hatfields and McCoys. I didn't realise he was British but it makes sense, there were a few random Brits that showed up it Hs&Ms including Beppe Di Marco from Eastenders. It was filmed in Romania.

RIP."
Penny Dreadful,"Damn, I wasn’t familiar with most of his work but I enjoyed him as Lepidus in Rome.  Died too young for sure."
Penny Dreadful,I remember him from Rome and Hatfield & McCoys.  Really good actor.  Very sad.
Penny Dreadful,"Wow, RIP"
Penny Dreadful,"If Rome wasn’t cancelled prematurely, his role as Lepidus would have been remembered more."
Penny Dreadful,Is he related to Luke Vibert?
Penny Dreadful,I'm confusing him with David Thewlis.
Penny Dreadful,"RIP, this guy was great in his roles."
Penny Dreadful,"Vibert is a name I haven’t seen since my family started talking about genealogy and it was my grandmothers maiden name

Edit: and by grandmother I mean hateful bitch who disparaged her dead son"
Penny Dreadful,[deleted]
Penny Dreadful,"Hurry, add this to that fake death TikTok trend for some major confusion."
Penny Dreadful,"Not even old enough to collect social security, tell me SS isnt a scam."
Penny Dreadful,His wife looks like that crazy dog woman.
Penny Dreadful,Who?
Penny Dreadful,RIP
Penny Dreadful,He was such a good actor. R.I.P.
Penny Dreadful,Thanks I was wondering who he was in *Rome*.
Penny Dreadful,">	Vibert was Lepidus in Rome. 

Thank you."
Penny Dreadful,That Hatfields and McCoys mini series was underrated
Penny Dreadful,So loathsome in Borgias. I didn’t even remember him in Rome. Also Alienist and Carnival Row. I feel like Borgias was how I was exposed to him. What a shame.
Penny Dreadful,"> after a brief illness. The nature of the illness was not specified.

Been way to many of these the last couple of years"
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Penny Dreadful,fuck.  what a great adaptation of a great book.
Penny Dreadful,"""I'm Strange."" ""Indeed."""
Penny Dreadful,"I just finished his final episode on that series yesterday. He was a great character, because I hated him. Played the part perfectly."
Penny Dreadful,"He was Sir Geoffrey, the lord out in the country who kills the cut wife"
Penny Dreadful,I LOVED it. Such a shame it didn't have a high viewership and had to have that ending.
Penny Dreadful,Agreed. Right up until they shit the bed with the ending.
Penny Dreadful,"Season 1 is an absolute 10/10 for me

Season 2 is a good 7, but it drops the utterly beautiful yet mournful vibe the first season did so well. The Alienst had the same problem, the second season keeps the style, characters, and aesthetic, but softens the tone and the story just enough that it loses the vibe that made it something special

Both series even have share neuro divergent-coded protagonists that are genuinely shitty people in the first season, like next level toxic traits they struggle with but barely make some progress with, but the second season softens them out far beyond what makes sense for their prior characterization."
Penny Dreadful,"It really was. Then they just kept repeating the same boring ""just out of reach"" storylines for a few more years. Overall, it was still an ""ok"" show on par with Santa Clara Diet and other very shallow shows."
Penny Dreadful,"""How's your cousin, Lepidus?"""
Penny Dreadful,"That show would have been called *Inspector Lewis*. Or just *Lewis*, depending on if you're in the UK or the US."
Penny Dreadful,Ughhhh get a job
Penny Dreadful,Yeah sure let’s use someone death and have some fun with it! So hilarious.
Penny Dreadful,"Sorry, who is asking again?"
Penny Dreadful,"The real Lepidus was just as forgettable, lol."
Penny Dreadful,I thought he looked familiar but then I forgot Lepidus existed.
Penny Dreadful,I used to watch it like once a year I enjoyed it so much. What a great miniseries
Penny Dreadful,"In Rome, he was the General that Antony basically conscripted in to serving on his side (or face the sword)"
Penny Dreadful,"He wasn't in a lot of episodes in Rome, I think 3 episodes in season 2, but all memorable scenes. He was really great as Lepidus. RIP."
Penny Dreadful,"Hey, why don't we go back to 2016?
David Bowie, George Michael, Alan Thicke, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Chyna to name but a few..... a much more famous list of people who died too soon, many from heart complications.
I guess it must have been the vaxx. 
Administered by a time travelling assassin."
Penny Dreadful,Somebody doesn’t like vaccines
Penny Dreadful,The best some might say
Penny Dreadful,So good! I have some quibbles about the ending and how they used Stephen Black but otherwise- so fantastic.
Penny Dreadful,"Yes! Loved the novel and wondered if the adaptation would be up to it. It very much was. His Lord Wellington was great, equal parts brilliant and insufferably arrogant. But he got the straight roads he wanted :D"
Penny Dreadful,Ohhhh ok!  Totally remember now! Thanks 🥰
Penny Dreadful,I’m still not over it. I was so excited when they did another show but it fizzled fast.
Penny Dreadful,"Yes, there should have been more seasons. I remember the ending was abrupt."
Penny Dreadful,"Agree, plus I couldn’t stand Rory Kinnear with the sad monster act. So tiring"
Penny Dreadful,What an amazing coincidence!
Penny Dreadful,"He could've been struck by lightning, ""It was probably caused by the vaccine!"""
Penny Dreadful,I take it you’ve never laughed at a 9/11 joke then huh.
Penny Dreadful,Who is this person again?
Penny Dreadful,The real Lepidus got to peacefully retire in a time when defeated political rivals typically ended up dead. He got off luckier than most.
Penny Dreadful,"The real Lepidus wasn’t that pathetic and in the end lived a long life. Before Octavian he was Caesars most capable Legate and took over after Antony messed up in Italy, proving to be a great administrator. It’s just his role in the civil war had a flaccid start and his own men betrayed him. Similar thing with Antony in the grand scheme of things but he had been in power for longer."
Penny Dreadful,Ouch classics burn
Penny Dreadful,I love how often he shows up in Historia Civilis youtube channel and how things always go wrong for him.
Penny Dreadful,"I mean, he made it all the way up to today, technically."
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Penny Dreadful,"Vaccinated people can still die from covid. They are far less likely to die compared to the un-vaccinated, but the fact that he died (if it was from covid) doesn't necessarily mean he was anti-vax."
Penny Dreadful,He never said vaccine
Penny Dreadful,"Abrupt, but also pretty unfulfilling. The entire arc of the whole show up to that point was just tossed out, and everything just ""ended"" with a big ""F U"" to the viewers. It was the first TV show that ended in such a way that I had been a fan of. It was rough."
Penny Dreadful,The 9/11 joke werent a thing when the event just happened.
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Penny Dreadful,"Not Ronan, the guy I responded to."
Penny Dreadful,This isn't true
Penny Dreadful,Subreddits he's posted in confirms he's an antivax loon.
Penny Dreadful,"He didn't have to.

The anti-vax morons (and indeed most conservatives) love to start shit by ""just asking questions"" that have already been answered but with answers which their audience doesn't know or by asking questions which cannot be reliably answered. They do this to give dumbasses the opportunity to try and answer themselves, usually with wrong answers, or they provide their own equally wrong answer in the next round of responses, all with the goal of diverting people away from the truth because they're trying to garner support for their (again, dumb as shit) ideas."
Penny Dreadful,"He's a conservative, so it's an easy bet."
Penny Dreadful,That’s how afraid of them he is
Penny Dreadful,"I remember watching it live and that title card at the end came up. I was like ""What??"""
Penny Dreadful,"Such a shame, first 2 seasons were incredible"
Penny Dreadful,I didn't catch the last few episodes but was the entire plotline with Dorian and the FrankenBride just dropped?
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Penny Dreadful,Imagine having that username and still not understanding or liking science. Shameful.
Penny Dreadful,Aren’t there clean walls somewhere for you to go smear shit on?
Penny Dreadful,Also it’s obvious to anyone with a brain what he was saying. You barely have to read between the lines lol
Penny Dreadful,"It doesn't help that I've been seeing an increasing number of headlines like ""Woman dies suddenly at 32"" and then when you read the article it turns out she had a birth defect or cancer or something.

And the people who write those articles know the anti-vax loons won't read past the headline.

Like, the media is baiting these people and whipping them up into a frenzy by confirming their nutcase biases."
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Penny Dreadful,I saw a deleted comment and immediately knew
Penny Dreadful,RIP Helen mCrory :(  She was outstanding on S2.
Penny Dreadful,"Showtime and horrible series finales, name a more iconic duo."
Penny Dreadful,Why do you have to hurt me again. I moved on
Penny Dreadful,"I feel so disrespected that Showtime allowed the show to end that way.

I’m now constantly searching to find a show that will fill the void Penny Dreadful left. So far my efforts have been in vain, nothing but disappointment.

We should start a petition to have Netflix or Amazon bring it back."
Penny Dreadful,Not the article I want to see posted as I just finished season 2 :(
Penny Dreadful,"I remember the showrunner claiming it's how he wanted it to end and it wasn't because it got cancelled. No one's buying that, the last few episodes are clearly rushed and are not compatible to anything that was being setup before it."
Penny Dreadful,"No matter what they said at the time is was obvious S3 was not meant to be the end and was cancelled by Showtime after production ended and they asked the producers to lie and slap some sort of ending together. 

What pisses me off to this day is that John Logan or Sam Mendes have admitted that."
Penny Dreadful,"The ending seems rushed for Vanessa's arc, but it's nowhere on the same level as GOT S08. The first half of Penny Dreadful S03 is fine. The conclusion should have been more organic towards Vanessa's ending tho. It had its flaws from S01 which many tend to ignore. The action episodes with the monsters are very mediocre in S01 and the Dorain plot is just a waste of time without his story interacting much with the main plot. What held this show together is the aesthetics of Victorian Era, poetic dialogues, the brilliant cinematography, gothic horror elements, beautiful costumes and on top of that a great acting by Eva Green and others."
Penny Dreadful,[removed]
Whitechapel,"Under The Dome.

Season 1 started OK, but quickly fell apart.

Season 2 I watched because i figured they had to have learned from their mistakes and would fix the problems of season 1.  oh, how wrong i was.

Season 3 I watched to see just how bad it could get.  I had more fun talking about it on the forums each week than ever watching the show.  It was just a train wreck."
Whitechapel,Pretty Little Liars. The actress playing Spencer was the only one not phoning it in after Season 2. The writing dropped like a rock as well after Season 1.
Whitechapel,Heroes. I loved season 1 so much I put up with the other ones.
Whitechapel,The Strain. I hate watched it completely. The characters actively egged you on to throw stuff at the screen. I was fascinated by how much the writers could make me root against the protagonists. At the same time it never stopped throwing twists and turns and WTF moments at you so it was never boring.
Whitechapel,"Lie To Me. A pretty good premise with good casting ruined by the studio insisting that the main character had to be MORE EXCITING.

Shame, could have been great. I kept watching in the dumb hope they'd drop the Mi6 badassery and get back to telling stories."
Whitechapel,"True Blood. Most of S6 but especially, S7.  

My brother and I were binging it just before S7 was released. We both turned to each other on that final episode ending and just looked at each other with disgusted faces."
Whitechapel,Nip fucking Tuck. My friends liked the first 3 seasons but we Unfortunatley kept watching it. I really wanted to quit but they wanted to keep watching it. No show will ever top that garbage.
Whitechapel,"Falling Skies. It was pretty cheesy from the get go but it got progressively worse to the point that there was just a community of people hate-watching it.

That made it pretty fun ngl"
Whitechapel,"Modern Family will be that show for me. It isn’t that the show is necessarily bad but rather that the repeating formula has become stale.  (Plus, with the kids all grown up now it’s becoming an obvious challenge to the writers to construct a rational narrative for their stories to interact with each other.) Again, not a terrible show, just one that needs to conclude."
Whitechapel,"Sons of Anarchy. It had enough good moments, and I'm a sucker for gang war/politics stuff, but it was pretty much hate-watching by the last season. A bunch of likable side characters and one of the *least* likable protagonists.

I'll probably end up watching Mayans sooner or later, too."
Whitechapel,I know Shameless isn't over yet but I have no expectations of it ever getting better. It went way downhill after season 5.
Whitechapel,"Once Upon A Time. Season 1 was really good, then everthing from camera-work to acting fell off the roof. Not to mention they jumped sharks multiple times a season. It was sooooo dumb by the end. But I really couldn't bother with the soft reboot. Gave up after the third episode."
Whitechapel,Weeds
Whitechapel,"With the last season starting soon, I’m gonna have to say Modern Family. Since about season 5/6 it just devolved into absolute trash. At this point I’m watching out of obligation. It’s like the sunk cost fallacy. I’ve committed so much time to this series for years now I might as well finish it 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️."
Whitechapel,"Suits. The show outgrew it's premise by season 3. All of the main characters have become caricatures of themselves and just take it in turns to hold the idiot ball.

Louis Litt was a good villain but has been flanderized to the point wheres he's just a joke character.

However as we trundle through season 9 I've accepted that I'm in till the end even though I hate it."
Whitechapel,"Let’s say it all together, friends... Dexter."
Whitechapel,Terra Nova. Would honestly still watch another season.
Whitechapel,Royal Pains. The cast was likable so I kept watching but the show’s plots got so dumb and convoluted.
Whitechapel,13 Reasons Why. IDK why tf I watched that depressing shit
Whitechapel,Gossip girls. Only reason I completed all 6 season is because my exams were going on. Every thing looks interesting at that time.
Whitechapel,"Heroes. First season was great the rest not so much 

True Blood. My wife read all the books and we watched every season. Hated it"
Whitechapel,Vikings. Series has become so bad especially since you know what happened. Watching it solely to see how it ends nad because of my love for period dramas. The writing and characters left in the show actually infuriate me.
Whitechapel,Bones
Whitechapel,"Prison Break

Season 1 and 2 were good, not amazing but above average. Season 3 was just turd and season 4 could have been ok but they focused way too much on action as opposed to the narrative so instead of having a good politically focused story all you got was small spoken section that acted as a bridge for another stupid action scene. Season 5 was fucking ridiculous also. The motive of the main villain was so so stupid."
Whitechapel,Currently Fear the walking dead is so bad but I can’t quit it
Whitechapel,Inhumans. That show somehow made Iron Fist look good and that's saying something.
Whitechapel,"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda

The show started with a very interesting and promising premise. However, I've never seen a show with so many abandoned plot points, story arcs, and overall inconsistency. That being said, I relished watching the entire thing.

Edit: I watched it for Kevin Sorbo and Gene Roddenberry's name. I kept watching it because it gave me a shot of scifi adventure and grand galactic drama, with a good amount of humor. I recommend it, but don't take my recommendations."
Whitechapel,"The Vampire Diaires

Seasons 1 til 3 were good tv, top tier of what one hopes to achieve watching something on the CW. Good cast with great chemistry (repetitive plot line but still entertaining), and my god were the villains absolutely amazing, it was an absolute pleasure watching Kathrine go toe-to-toe with Damon in the snarky one liners department and The Mikaelsons were Shakespearean sociopaths done flawlessly.

Season 4 had its pros and cons but season 5.... My Gawd was season 5 an abomination, the only thing worse than that season was POSSIBLY season 4 of Arrow (that's how bad it was)
A subplot for an episode was that Elena got a vampire killing bite and obsessive need to kill Vampires, and instead of doing something cool with it, they dedicated the entire hour to how said vampire bite itch impacted on her relationship with Damon... That's it, nothing else came of that plot point, just something used to cause drama in their candy ass relationship because drama sells. That was just an omen for the toxic bleached asshole that was season 5, the main villain (was it Markos? The traveler dude) was the most disappointing season villain I have ever seen (Cept maybe the Night King, because the hype was in a different universe to the execution). Chalk up the Originals being gone from the show and you have a Gumbo of annoying, holier than thou hypocrites characters you're supposed to buy as protagonists. 

Season 6 was decent but after that.... Oh boy.... And I'm the idiot who watched every goddamn episode."
Whitechapel,"Revolution

So much promise, so little execution."
Whitechapel,Outsourced.  It was definitely cheap and not top tier but it definitely had a couple great moments and it filled the time.
Whitechapel,Definitely True Blood - watched it far longer than I enjoyed it
Whitechapel,Last season of How I met your Mother. Whole season in that Hotel. Endless boring talking. From my favorite to just bad!
Whitechapel,"Glee. It was fun at first but the characters were all trash and never grew up, making the same stupid decisions over and over. Even the musical numbers got wackier and I don't know how I finished it. Also Cory Monteith's death was a huge blow and kept so many things from ever being resolved."
Whitechapel,"After Kevin Spacey was booted from House Of Cards, I still watched the last season. It was not good. At all. Talk about a fall from grace, that show was a solid 10/10 for the first 4 seasons, started falling off at season 5, and then completely plummeted into the dumpster by the last season."
Whitechapel,"Revenge. It started out okay, but quickly devolved."
Whitechapel,Arrow
Whitechapel,[deleted]
Whitechapel,Bitten. I watched it only because it starred Supergirl from Smallville. It turns out that's the only reason to watch it.
Whitechapel,"The mist - an amazing movie, damn good novella, had so much potential, sucked worse than a gaping chest wound"
Whitechapel,Teen Wolf.  Those last few seasons were agony to get through.
Whitechapel,"""Salvation"". This is what happens when smart characters are written by stupid people. Also, the entire show was about stopping a planetoid hurling toward Earth. There was no planetoid.

And ""Another Life"", of course. It's not cancelled YET, but I hope it will be, or else I will have to hate-watch it, Stockholm syndrome style. It's as if someone watch the worst possible scenes from ""Prometheus"" and decided to stretch them into an entire season of a series."
Whitechapel,"Has to be Weeds.  I hung around hoping the show would rebound to seasons 1-3 quality, but it never did.  It just got worse and worse for 4 more seasons"
Whitechapel,"Grimm, along with a friend. It took the procedural cop drama, added some supernatural elements, and some soap opera drama sub plots to both mix things up and keep you coming back. On top of that, it had some Syfy original levels of hilariously bad CG and FX, that created a unique dumpster fire of a show. I remember in one of the earlier episodes you can see the strings on a bunch of 'bee's', just to show how half assed it can be at times.

It wasn't all bad though, as the opening hook of the series was intriguing, and there are definitely a few genuinely solid episodes of television scattered throughout. However, there's also amnesia sub plots, a will they won't they love triangle with the main character, and the occasionally infuriatingly stupid plot decisions."
Whitechapel,"The Strain, Dumb vampire show where all the characters were stupid. Watched every episode."
Whitechapel,"Glee. Started off decent enough, but they really jumped the shark tank after Finn’s death. How do they all end up in NYC."
Whitechapel,"Bloodline. Awful writing, extremely predictable and boring plot, and used the same cliche “for my family” phrase way too frequently."
Whitechapel,"Helix on SyFy is the first one that comes to mind. S1 was kind of cool and dark with a good amount of tension, but S2 was just one long drawn out WTF."
Whitechapel,"Although still running, Grey's Anatomy. just too many freaking season, the first 5? were quite good, but then all went downhill really fast after the ending of season 8"
Whitechapel,Orange is the new black
Whitechapel,"Are You Being Served? Again!

The stories about Grace Brothers department store were delightful.

The stories about the hotel were a painful disappointment."
Whitechapel,"Lucifer. Love the premise and expected great things. The premise is good but the detective is just unwatchably bad. I literally fast forward through every scene she is in. And the writing is just not good. Detective screeches with a frowny face, ""Follow procedure!"" then proceeds to follow no procedures nor does anyone think to send Lucifer to procedure school. Plus, they just jump from suspect to suspect with no particular reason...a ""reason"" is usually stated but it's lame."
Whitechapel,"Oz

The last seasons literally have plots about magical devices to age people faster. They have so many plot threads that they have to show flashbacks multiple times per episode so that people can keep track, but none of the plots are interesting. Most of them are just soap opera shit with more rape."
Whitechapel,Scandal
Whitechapel,Nip/Tuck and Entourage. Rich pompous guys stay rich pompous guys.
Whitechapel,"The Glades. Used to really enjoy it, a fun and easy watch police show, but it was absolute garbage by the end and I honestly couldn't care less if the person laying there in a pool of blood at the end lived or died. ( I won't spoil it by saying who it is, in case anyone is silly enough to want to watch the entire series)"
Whitechapel,"Sorry to Jane The Virgin fans but I really had to push through the last 2 seasons. Almost dropped it a couple times but I loved the characters too much where I just couldn't bring myself to not finish it. 
It just got boring with the same kind of drama over and over."
Whitechapel,"Jericho started out so wonderfully, and hit the wall harder than anything I have ever seen."
Whitechapel,The Big Bang Theory
Whitechapel,"How I Met Your Mother. Was a deeply flawed show that I watched every episode of. Occasionally there were jokes, but it was often more narratively interesting than it was funny. Not great for a SitCom."
Whitechapel,Sons of Anarchy
Whitechapel,"Under the Dome, I don't even know why I kept watching."
Whitechapel,Weeds. I kept thinking it would return to form. Never did.
Whitechapel,Zoo. I had to see how it would top the previous weeks stupidity.
Whitechapel,True Blood definitely.
Whitechapel,"Gary Unmarried. It was a two season CBS multicam starring Jay Mohr from 2008. I liked the scenes between Jay Mohr and Paula Marshall, an actress I liked ever since she played a porn star on Sports Night.

It was one of those shows that got massively retooled halfway through. Gary was a middle-class guy painting houses, with Al Madrigal playing his friend. Then, it was completely changed to Gary somehow ending up in his dream job of hosting a sports radio show. His friend was replaced with Keegan-Michael Key from Key & Peele.

While it had its funny moments, it's just another joke-laughter-joke ha ha marriage is a prison sitcom. It was just something to fill the DVR."
Whitechapel,Designated Survivor
Whitechapel,"Only in this thread i realized i have no mercy for the shows. the moment it goes to shit, i quit. i quit soa half the season before the end. dexter 1 season before the end. i just don't give a fuck."
Whitechapel,"It’s not over yet, but god-willing it will be soon.

*The 100*

I liked the original premise, but pretty much from the middle of the first episode it turned into teen angst with only hints of sci-fi. I still put it on in the background to see what happens, but I just want to know how it ends"
Whitechapel,Thirteen Reasons Why and Riverdale
Whitechapel,It’s not over yet but Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead.
Whitechapel,"I'll never get tired of trashing Continuum. It started as an intriguing sci-fi show with dark themes and glimpses of an interesting mythology, but it was quickly brought down by terrible acting (specially the leads), ridiculous dialogues, and constant unexplained changes in the story that made it look like they were making things up on the go. I only finished watching it because my SO liked it, and I enjoyed pointing out every stupid thing that happened."
Whitechapel,Rescue Me
Whitechapel,School days. Such trash...
Whitechapel,"Van Helsing.
They spend every season building up to a climax, only to end the season just before that climax actually happens.

Also: everything seems random rules wise concerning the vamps And characters.

Edit: Spelling"
Whitechapel,"""The Pretender"", 1996-2000. A good idea with a superintelligent agent who can impersonate any impression, had a great bullshit boilerplate Evil Org called The Triumvirate chasing his ass to get him back in the fold. Went nowhere and the finale ended on a train exploding and then credits.

Could NOT compete with The X-Files, which it was created to do, even being marketed as a ""thrillogy"" by NBC."
Whitechapel,Sons of Anarchy. Took me a season or two to realize it's 100% soap opera but it kept me and my wife's attention so we watched the entire thing lol.
Whitechapel,"Sons of Anarchy.

It was like a super dumb soap opera on motorcycles, and I loved every dumb minute of it."
Whitechapel,[deleted]
Whitechapel,Eldorado.
Whitechapel,Mulaney
Whitechapel,"The Aftermath and Salvation. Boys those shows were crap, but it was like watching a trainwreck, I couldn't stop watching."
Whitechapel,Falling Skies
Whitechapel,4400
Whitechapel,"Prison Break. 

I started watching S2 and it just got worse and worse. I didn't stop though."
Whitechapel,....currently finishing Suits.
Whitechapel,"Allen Gregory, from FOX. I tried to enjoy it – his dads were nice characters – but the protagonist was the most annoying, obnoxious, irritating little shit."
Whitechapel,Am hatewatching Another Life until the end.
Whitechapel,Dexter (sans lab)
Whitechapel,"MTV's Scream: The TV Series and its rebooted third season, Scream: Resurrection.

Three seasons of bleh. Anything you really liked about the original Scream is washed down to the squeaky clean bones. And to make it worse, they end the first series on a cliffhanger and then just dive into a reboot. And theres just no way it gets renewed again after everything that happened. Yeah, definitely pass on it. Best thing it had was a few interesting characters and some neat deaths. Plot was paper thin and absurd though."
Whitechapel,Weeds
Whitechapel,"The Gifted, season 2 is so boring/slow bad acting I literally could not watch it."
Whitechapel,Earth: Final Conflict it was so amazingly 90s and just shit the bed spectacularly at the end.
Whitechapel,Inhumans.
Whitechapel,Alphas
Whitechapel,I hate watch ink masters like it’s my job. I can’t gelp myself. I complain every time I watch it yet I keep watching.
Whitechapel,"Melrose Place. It was Monday, and I was in my mid-teens and didn't have cable, so I had homework to do and wanted to pass the time while casually reading the history book or working on math problems.

Show had become so cheesy after the first few seasons."
Whitechapel,"Falling Skies. It was (at best) a mediocre Summer sci-fi TV show that was on TNT. Watched it from the start to the end. My conclusion was that a) season 3 had to be when the show was at its best, ) b the episode where Tom and Pope bounded and were struggling to survive had to be the best episode that was produced by the show, and c) I now hate how a show would take a reform antagonist like Pope and make him the villain in the last few episodes just show the show can have more tension. In my opinion, deserved a better ending.

Edit:

Fixed my auto-correct

Edit 2:

For the most part, I was just hate watching Falling Skies. Like it did have Noah Wyle playing Tom Mason but the writing was terrible and made Tom a Marty Stu. Where everyone (except for Pope who hated him and Tom hated him) thought he was the second coming of George Washington or something. Not only that but the entire show (at times) was just a circle jerk about how great Tom was. Like in one episode a pilot came to their camp (she was from another resistance group and was flying to see who was alive and not) and even she thought Tom was so great and special. Not only that but even the aliens were into him as well and thought that he was such a threat that they had to do all of this stuff to him and to his family (like okay I know he was the main character but it got to the point where it just, in my opinion, became so obvious that the main case, was because Tom was the main character and not really because of the plot).  And I do realize that for the first season it took place in the Boston Area and that Tom was an American History professor before the aliens attacked but overall they really stretched the idea that they were the second coming of the American Revolution, in my opinion."
Whitechapel,Definitely Entourage. Man that show was terrible - but I couldn't stop XD
Whitechapel,Walking dead. I know it’s not over but I’ve spent far too much time on it to give up even though I know that the show has been shit and will only be more shit until it finally gets cancelled in season 87. And yes this includes the shitty fear the walking dead because I enjoy punishment.
Whitechapel,"For me it would have to be lost, it got so convoluted I had to start reading theories to make sense of it, the moment I finished it, seemed like I got flashed by the men in black stick, can't remember anything about that show past the first few seasons..."
Conni,Had me at Connie Britton. Lost me at Taylor Schilling.
Conni,"Watched the first episode of this. Not sure what's the deal but it's intriguing for sure.

Mainly because the two main characters seem pretty likeable and seem to get on well, so it's puzzling how something bad obviously happened in that house."
Conni,"> “Well, let me say for the record that anybody who sexually harassed me is now dead. They’re so old,”

well that's a plus I guess, at least."
Conni,It's hard to explain how common it is to people that don't experience as much sexual harassment. Men certainly do experience it. I have noticed however that whereas women will have an endless number of stories ranging from small encounters that are easily shrugged off to large encounters that leave them shook (or far worse than that) men tend to only have one or two such stories. I wonder if that makes it difficult to imagine this stuff as the near constant running theme that it is for many women- especially young women. But that's what it is. Frequent and tiresome. Very young women will often confuse comments as being flattering- you grow out of that pretty fast. It gets old. 
Conni,"Just back out of the comments here, nothing good to see... "
Conni,My sister works in IT in the 80s and was constantly harassed by several people but didn't even know she was being harassed. She just thought this as how it was if you were the only woman around beside the secretaries. She was just out of college and grateful to have a job. 
Conni,"Maury, you are *not* the father!"
Conni,"I feel like guys who don’t believe stuff like this happens to women a lot must just not really talk to a lot of women.  Like, talk as in ‘have a real conversation where they listen to what the woman has to say’.  I have a lot of female friends and they’ve told me countless stories about situations of harassment and much worse, often in real time as they’re happening.  If you ever actually listen to what women have to say, I feel like it’s hard not to know about the pervasiveness of the sexual harassment problem.  

Here’s looking at most of the commenters at the bottom of this comment section - learn how to listen to your female friends (assuming that y’all actually have any) and you might be surprised by how real of a problem this is. "
Conni,"In the old days male newscasters NOT looking like models was considered an asset.

It would be nice if we could go back to that for men AND women newscasters - why should they have to seem 'hot' at all?"
Conni,"Isn't this the same person that tricked Newt Gringrich's mother into spilling the beans into her son's affair?

""Just between us, the mics are off... What happened?"" or something to that affect. The mics were not off. As far as I can tell, she is a shitty person. I enjoyed the story but I think she victimized a poor mother into disclosing private information about her shit bag congressman son."

Conni,">“Oh yeah, oh sure, yeah, yeah. Every day. I mean, a lot, especially when I started out.”

Not saying I believe her or not but that's a bit vague. This really doesn't give any indication of what actually happened or how serious it was. 

She may have faced some real bad stuff but I feel some people are just saying things like this just to do so

Conni,"Why do people put up with terrible work conditions for asshole bosses when they are supposedly capable and competent professionals who could get a job anywhere?

Conni,Its understandable. She was pretty hot in her day. Who doesnt love asian women? She broke through a ton of barriers in a mans world. She came through a time of women being people who get you coffee and pick up your dry cleaning. Somehow kept going forward. These days you have trash like megyn kelly working hard to undo her work.
Conni,Yeah right..
Conni,I have a hard time believing that. 
Conni,This is such a subjective thing that the only way to really evaluate it is to know *exactly* what was said.

Conni,"Yes! Men dont understand just how much women get harassed. They think oh sure its happened to me once of twice but they dont think that everytime  they go out they night get harassed. 


Hell once my friends and I were going to boston pizza noy dressed special or anything but syill had a creepy man follow us and harass us "
Conni,this is true even if you are a guy and constantly get sexually harrassed(i am on the feminine side like really feminine and a lot of people say i ask for it by showing myself off as such but fuck em) if you do not experience harassment constantly you will very much be unable to understand just how fucking tiring it all is and by the time currently i am 23 and i feel like i have had it happening to me for decades and its only been 6 years since i started dressing as i have and the harrasment began.
Conni,"Two questions. 

1. As a man, how should I go about complimenting someone or flirting with them while avoiding having them think I'm trying to sexually harass them? I have never been sexually harassed and so I don't know if 'sexual harassment compliments' are quantifiable different than 'genuine/benign compliments' or if it just about trying my best to convey earnest intentions? 

2. How can I try to help women who are being complimented in a sexual harassment context? Is there anything I can do to pick up on more nefarious intentions/power plays? "
Conni,[deleted]
Conni,"> Very young women will often confuse comments as being flattering

So basically your calling women who like men stupid. Neat."
Conni,"man, that must be incredibly difficult to go through life not knowing if the endless favors and praise you receive is a compliment for how you look or congratulation for being great. life is so hard for you, pretty girls!"
Conni,"Why does it have to be a competition about who gets harassed more? Can we just have a discussion without that please? We get it, we'll never understand how women feel about this."
Conni,I bet a lot of women confuse what should be a flattering comment as harassment and then make a huge story out of it. 
Conni,"So I'm supposed to blindly accept some random number of occurrences between 1-infinity. A number that changes every millisecond depending on what's most convenient at this specific moment in time.

No thanks. I'll stick with real life where we use evidence and shit.

By the way, you raped me once."

Conni,"I couldn't believe when I found out they were married.  Although Maurey had an early respectable news career, he kind of threw that away.  They married in 1984 so he hadn't yet decided that baby daddies were profitable yet.  "
Conni,Isn't not talking about being sexually assaulted/harrased a big part of it? I've had real conversations with women before and sexual harrasment has never come up.
Conni,"lol I'll be honest, the reason why this whole Post-Weinstein outpour thing comes as a shock to me is because of the opposite. Women just have an aversion to me in general, so when it comes to actually ""having a conversation"", it's pretty much off the table. Like most others of course, I work with women, but those conversations are solely work based and nothing else. I wouldn't consider any of the women I know to be ""Friends"" but rather ""people I am friendly towards"".It was a bit hard picking up on this when the entirety of the victim group doesn't want to interact with you in an one on one setting in any way.  I am not complaining, I am just saying it makes it difficult to pick up on anything like this in general.

It is nice to know that I am not part of the problem they are talking about, even though I am anticipating that this isn't the last time I'll hear about something women go through  a lot and go "" Wow I had no idea that was a thing."""
Conni,Are you suggesting that ugly people aren't capable of sexual harrasment? Because that is a wierd argument.
Conni,"That's just blatant sexism against women. Ugly men can be news anchors just fine. Look at Cronkite, Koppel, etc. But women have to be pretty. "
Conni,"Call me an incel or whatever but this seems a bit iffy to me.

Conni,Ikr. interesting name for a website nonetheless 
Conni,I could've put a baby in her
Conni,"> Every time a woman has worn a short skirt and flashed her panties, that is sexual assault.

The fuck is wrong with you?"
Conni,I mean you gotta factor in intent 
Conni,"Try to think about what it would be like to actually have experienced countless instances of sexual harassment over a many years long career.  Would you want to go into details, or would you be tired of it and just want to leave it in the past?  Would you even be able to remember each specific instance, or don’t you think many of them would’ve blended together by then? 

Her answer here makes perfect sense considering her experiences, and there’s just not a good reason to disbelieve her.  "
Conni,"It is definitely true that minor annoyances like catcalls, sexual harassment, and sexual assault tend to get lumped together in these discussions.   It is hard to know how often each of them occur.

But even though assault is worse than a catcall, people should stop doing all of them.  "
Conni,"Some people don't want their life choices dictated by assholes.  And part of the point of this whole movement or whatever is that this shit seems to happen *everywhere* so you can't just run from it.  
  
No one should have to ""choose"" not to be harassed.  The harassers should be the ones choosing to be decent fucking humans."
Conni,"You would make a WONDERFUL rape counselor...

Conni,Gamers always have the best takes on women.
Conni,Are you nine?
Conni,"""Hi. You are watching the evening news and I am being sexually harassed.""

""See? That solves everything. I bet she got a promotion for that"" -cadjkt"
Conni,"I'm a man and was catcalled on the street one night on my way to a party. Completely caught me off guard and was just speechless. Went into the party and told the story and every woman there was like ""yeah welcome to every 15 fucking minutes of my life"".

It's very difficult to understand what other people go through when their experiences are so different than mine, but I'm trying my best.   I hope you all are too. "
Conni,"We also don't usually have to deal with the continuously inherent threat of ""maybe this person won't let me choose if I say no"" nearly as much. It still happens, of course, it's just not nearly as common or a scenario."
Conni,"I wish as a man I could get a job somewhere that doesn't have flamboyant gay men that sexually harrass me all day everyday. I'm 24, 23 when this happened and daily I had very sexual things said to me that made me feel uncomfortable, especially when it was said to me around other straight girls. 

I was fine with my friend that was a girl from HS slidding my ten dollars of tips into my back pocket, but I never gave him permission to do it and cup a feel while doing it. 

Sure, I went along with it sometimes to make it less awkward, but when you have to scoot by behind someone and parts kind of touch, and he tells you ""oh baby slide it in"" infront of people for the like, fiftieth time, it's tiring and kind of degrading. 

I never told him to stop, so it's kind of my fault, although if I were a girl I know people would tell me it isn't. I still feel like I had that responsibility to end it even though I never did out of embarrassment "
Conni,"When i was younger, i worked in a bar. Someone at my bar offered me to go home with. I said no. Not even if i got paid for it? I said no. ""why not? ""Because i'm 14 years old and i dont think my mom would approve of her son going home with someone her age"". And then i laughed it off as a drunk woman with poor judgement and got back to polishing the glasses.

I've been groped, kissed, cat-called (or how would you call it?), humped, whatever you can do...you name it.

Just because there is no immediate danger in it, doesnt mean it doesnt happen. Men might just not register as such or treat it differently.

Some examples:
- stifflers mom sleeping with her sons barely legal friend is a fun story.
- getting a pizza courier to deliver pizza with a girl opening naked is the famous porn scenario. And people think it's funny.
- a student getting approached by his teacher is lucky, not a victim according to some media.

I do think men have an idea. Just not the same voice"
Conni,"MEANWHILE, you chicks are busy constantly sexing underaged kids in your classrooms.  This sexual abuse epidemic amongst female teachers is horrific and has got to stop."
Conni,[deleted]
Conni,Yea because if there's one thing that'll get people on ur side and interested in your experiences it's a sweeping generalization and insult about 50% of the population
Conni,"Be positive and don't always focus on physical attributes. 

Read non verbal cues. Someone reading, closed off, looking very ""hands off"" is probably a no. 

If someone looks like a deer in headlights, disengage and wish them a good day.

Don't be aggressive and don't be passive aggressive. 

Don't get angry if you get rejected."
Conni,"Those are good questions. I'll answer them as best I can- though keep in mind it's not always a static black and white scenario and people have different levels of comfort when it comes to flirtation. 
So question 1: Look for enthusiasm. Don't get handsy until it's clear to both of you that you're okay with it. You can and probably should just ask if it's okay to touch. If you get an enthusiastic yes in reply- awesome. If you get a silent nod while she stares at the floor it's most likely best not to. Don't take it personally.
Look for responsiveness and don't push it if you don't get it. If you've dropped your best line and it didn't land- just move along. Intent is key when it comes to the kind of language you use. 
Most importantly; if you get the sense that what you're doing isn't okay- listen to that. Honestly. Most of the men that have sexually harassed me knew they were doing it. They knew. They didn't care. It's almost like some of them were proud of themselves afterward. In a few cases it was a friend pushing a little too far that needed to be reminded that it was not okay (one friend who slapped my ass and would say ""good game"" when it was slow while we were at work got a sharp rebuke and never did it again). Most of the time it was an asshole pushing across boundaries they were well aware of just because they thought they could. 
#2: It varies and depends on the people involved. Some women are pretty comfortable shutting down creeps. Many more are not (for good reason) and will try to manage the situation without drawing attention to it. But there are some big red flags to watch for: guys isolating or physically walling in women with their bodies (is she into it- or is she scanning the room for a way out?). Guys copping a feel on a woman that's not showing interest or trying to move away. Guys who won't leave well enough alone. I once watched this very drunken dude follow a friend of mine around for 20 minutes trying to put his arm around her while she kept shimmying away and saying ""no thanks."" Someone else physically had to step in and tell him to fuck off. 

But again the best thing you can do as a bystander is just ask her. Communication is key!"
Conni,"That's easy. If you're good looking or rich it's a compliment, otherwise you're being creepy."
Conni,even writing this question down is rape. 
Conni,"YOU have to show them the money.  How else do you think ugly, fat men like Harvey Weinstein get these young, pretty things naked into their bed and hotel rooms?"
Conni,Yes definitely. There are a lot of parallels (and some important differences too. Women that are white can be pretty naive to the experiences of women that are black and often fail to listen to them and consider their perspective.). Some of the societal responses to saying anything about it are very similar though- questioning if you even know your own mind or understand your own experience. I hope we see that change.
Conni,Says the young man whose user name is Vaginal Decimation.
Conni,Username does not check out.

Conni,Yeah I'm more of an involuntary dryspell type. An indry if you will
Conni,"> he kind of threw that away.

For money."
Conni,"That is a problem, but its a problem that is largely perpetuated by the existence of guys like the ones in this thread who constantly doubt and question everything women say about their experiences with harassment.  If those guys just stopped to listen for a second without passing judgment, women would feel much more able to open up about their experiences and likely would.  

Plus, I’m not saying that every real conversation with a woman will be about sexual harassment, obviously.  But how often have you ever heard a woman who trusts you outright deny that she has ever experienced sexual harassment?  Chances are, if you haven’t heard about it, it’s because it hasn’t come up in the conversation, not because it hasn’t happened.  "
Conni,"Honestly, your female friends would probably think really highly of you if you were to broach the subject with them. ""Hey, I've been hearing a lot about the #MeToo movement. Do you have any stories to share? I'm happy to listen."""
Conni,">Are you suggesting that ugly people aren't capable of sexual harrasment?

Conni,"it is too common sure, but it is not everywhere to the extent that one should feel that moving to another position would be futile. almost every life choice is dictated by assholes... idk why these women dont feel that they can directly confront/solve these harassment issues as they happen just as they would with any other aspect of their life they see the need to change. People are assholes and life is not fair, but that doesnt mean they cant actively at least *attempt* to put themselves in a better position. "

Conni,"Im sorry youve been harassed and have instances like that, and im sorry that you feel responsible for it I know how hard it can be to have a voice and tell someone no. I hope the best for you and hope that in the future this doesnt happen"
Conni,"I never said it doesnt happen, because I know it does I have a friend who was raped by his girlfriend multiple times and im the only person he told. Trust me I know. 

but I hoped people arent so sensative to put words in my mouth. I was talking specifically about the fact that most men dont actually realize how much of a problem it is-  not that men dont have the same problem.


Also if a chick is grinding up against a guy and he has no problem with it or doesnt take it as harassment thats not assult or harassment. And you wanna know who pushes the idea of a boy fucking his teacher as lucky? Men. How many men do you hear saying they wished they couldve fucked their teacher or that their friend is super lucky for doing so. (Not that i think it right im just saying men are the ones pushing that agenda not the media or females)"

Call the Midwife,"The most amazing thing about this show is that they lost its lead after only three seasons, Jessica Raine decided to move unto bigger and better things, she only appeared it 23 episodes. The show is based on, or rather inspired by the memoir of  Jennifer Worth (Jenny Lee in the show)... but since season four, she hasn't been seen again. Awkward. It's currently in its 12th season and will run for at least three more with this news."
Call the Midwife,"This show is cute af, but I don't think Sister Monica Joan can last any longer. They keep teasing her impending death."
Call the Midwife,"Holy crap. I saw a few episodes of this show probably 12 years ago and always sort of meant to give it another go but thinking it had more or less disappeared, as I had never seen it mentioned again. 

And here we are, a whopping 15 seasons. That’s kind of wild.

Is Miranda Hart still on it? Well, is she still on anything?"
Call the Midwife,"I guess it makes sense, it's not like the show needs to focus on the same people. There's a massive rate of turnover and they just get new characters and it works.

I enjoyed it more originally, up until Charlotte Ritchie left, now they ham it up with their goofy looking at each other before a scene change like an old sitcom or a more lighthearted version of an American soap opera... but I still enjoy it overall."
Call the Midwife,Moms everywhere rejoice
Call the Midwife,What year are they in on the show?
Call the Midwife,Love that show!
Call the Midwife,Have they still not called the midwife yet?
Call the Midwife,"Unfortunately, this season which is finishing up next week in the UK, isn't on par with previous seasons"
Call the Midwife,Good show and extra kudos for being able to carry on smoothly even when a major character leaves. - which is bound to happen in a long-running show.
Call the Midwife,"Funny you say that. The creator of the show had mentioned years ago that they had almost exhausted adapting from the source material by Season 3. They used the rest for Season 4. After that you'll notice a change in the opening credits. For Seasons 1 to 4 it says ""Based on the Memoir"" but Season 5 and on it says ""Inspired by the Memoir"".

Jessica Raine left at an opportune moment and no hard feelings about it. I think it was the best move for both the show and the actress since the writers would be moving beyond the original source."
Call the Midwife,And since we're talking about previous characters..  BRING BACK CHUMMY
Call the Midwife,Does it hold up well for all those seasons?
Call the Midwife,"SISTER MONICA JOAN IS STILL ALIVE???

I'm only on season 2. I gave her 2 more seasons at most lol."
Call the Midwife,Judy Parfitt must enjoy playing the character. With this renewal this is turning into a steady gig for the actress. She's 87 so more power to her if she still enjoys working.
Call the Midwife,They've been teasing her death since the first season
Call the Midwife,she's just gonna become a lich
Call the Midwife,It looks like she was on three season of it - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Hart
Call the Midwife,No she’s not. Characters just disappear which annoys me. Only one or two were really written off. The rest of the time the actor leaves and are not mentioned for ages.
Call the Midwife,I’ve been binge watching it recently recently. I do enjoy it but it’s quite formulaic.
Call the Midwife,"I'm a 42 year-old single man, and I absolutely love this show lol. It's like comfort food to me."

Call the Midwife,"1967 I believe.

Nvm maybe it's 1968."
Call the Midwife,1968
Call the Midwife,It isn't amazing or anything but I think you'd still like the show if you initially enjoyed it.
Call the Midwife,"It doesn't get bad. I'm not sure really how to explain it, but you can definitely notice a change as it goes on. It comes off less 'real' after Jenny leaves and more like they're trying to make an emotional show, which is fine, it just kind of feels a little hokey sometimes. Especially in the last few years. 

>!Like when Shelagh and Patrick are talking and they end their conversation and will just stare lovingly at each other. Or the characters just smile at each other too long like a nice version of an American soap opera.!<"
Call the Midwife,"It holds on beautifully, changes throughout as society changed."

On the face of it, it should be nothing I'm interested in at all. But for 9 weeks a year on Sunday nights, I'm a 1960s housewife and don't disturb me, muh stories are on."

Call the Midwife,Excited for the Vietnam episode.
Call the Midwife,"I know exactly which moment you mean, it began to have these almost sitcom moments with stuff like adorable children trying to steal a cookie accompanied by whimsical music. Still, I really like how it showed the transformation of a poor London neighbourhood through the 50s and 60s with council estates, docker jobs drying up and so on. But a part of that transformation was that almost no one was giving birth at home with a nun on a bike attending! Gonna be hilarious as they try to justify their organization's continued existence into the 70s. They're already slagging off hospital births as too cold and impersonal"
Call the Midwife,"Diana Rigg for example - she ""stormed off"" the set of *Game of Thrones* with a zimmer frame and did the first season of the *All Creatures Great and Small* remake before her death."
Call the Midwife,"Exactly. I look forward to the Christmas special on Christmas Day every year, which then leads into the new season. It's a perfect schedule for a series like this."
Call the Midwife,what year did it start?
Call the Midwife,That wasn't really anything big for the UK - we didn't send troops there.
Call the Midwife,"It's a New Year's/winter kind of show.

I always enjoyed the CTM/Doctor Who Christmas double shot, until Chibbers took that away. But it'll be back this year, so everything's fine."
Call the Midwife,"Bro, you're like a professional karma whore, lol."
Call the Midwife,"The show began in 2012, the first season took place in 1957."
Call the Midwife,Ea-rly 50s? Might be before
Call the Midwife,I wonder if by Season 15 they'll push into the 1970s.
Call the Midwife,"Yeah.

It's a season a year. Barring some major unforeseen departure from the norm, Season 15 will be set in 1971."

Call the Midwife,Is this the last season?
Call the Midwife,No. It was  renewed through series 13 a while back. So there's  at least one more.
Call the Midwife,"nope, that's the next one, Call the Caregiver"
Call the Midwife,I came in here to ask if Russian Doll Season 2 was as good as Season 1 and apparently the answer is yes and no.
Call the Midwife,"Honourable mention for Tosin Cole? As in, Tosin Cole, the plank of wood who blankly stared at his castmates on Doctor Who for two years? How the hell did that happen?"
Call the Midwife,"I think she’s great in it, but I didn’t enjoy Russian Doll season 2 anywhere near how much I enjoyed season 1"
Call the Midwife,Shoutout to Adlon and Better Things. One of the best things on tv right now imo
Call the Midwife,Natasha Lyonne is a true artist. This season somehow was even better than the first. I truly hope we get more but also it’s fine if we don’t. So much respect to everyone who worked on this production it is beautifully done in every aspect.
Call the Midwife,"With the Better Call Saul premiere this week, this article is fucking ridiculous. Add Michael Mando to this list."
Call the Midwife,Funniest and most lovable character in OItNB. I should watch Russian doll I’m just scared of developing too much of a crush on Natasha
Call the Midwife,"Elliott is so goddamn good, I was thinking to myself that her acting was fabulous in this week's CTM. And I could listen to her speak in that Caribbean accent all day."
Call the Midwife,"I just binged season 1 last night oddly enough. 

She is excellent! Witty, organic, and just really entertaining."
Call the Midwife,"Is 61st Street good, would people say? Been curious about it for ages specifically because Tosin Cole was in it, and I was wondering if it'd be a better showcase for him than Doctor Who"
Call the Midwife,Watched all of Russian Doll 2 in on evening and I didn't want it to end! That last episode's sequence to Shine on you Crazy Diamond was immense.
Call the Midwife,I just couldn’t watch it because of the annoying acting
Call the Midwife,Her mannerism and speech reminded me so much of Larry David. It’s a great show btw finished a season and a half in one night
Call the Midwife,She’s like a 80s actor but today. I like it. She’s loverly
Call the Midwife,"Love them all, especially Pamela adlon"
Call the Midwife,"Season 2 has a different focus than season 1. You may enjoy it more or less, but it still feels like Russian Doll 100%. There were some knockout performances this season, even if the hook wasn't as strong. The focus on Ruth was something I hadn't seen a show do before."
Call the Midwife,Natasha would have really been perfect for the Lucille Ball biopic!
Call the Midwife,I’m going to need to rewatch Season 2 of Russian Doll. I understood it but I guess I wasn’t expecting it. Love Natasha Lyonne.
Call the Midwife,Tosin Cole ? Of the terrible Ryan of Doctor Who?
Call the Midwife,I loved Russian Doll. It was such a dignified portrayal of people with mental illness and the fallout it causes for others.
Call the Midwife,Gonna have to add the full cast of Outer Ranch.
Call the Midwife,Rhea Seehorn would like a word
Call the Midwife,Her PR company is working overtime
Call the Midwife,All fine performances
Call the Midwife,yuck
Call the Midwife,"I'm only on the second episode, but I got to say I'm not impressed. Natasha delivers a fire hose of one liners. Occasionally it's even funny. But the funny lines just remind me how unfunny the rest of it it is. And the subway is like a hot tub time machine."
Call the Midwife,I'm curious how she got performer of the week because Russian Doll is not very good and her acting is over the top and sporadic in my opinion.
Call the Midwife,“Because Groundhog Day is a genre now.”
Call the Midwife,Is there a new season of Better Things?
Call the Midwife,Russian doll s2 was the best thing netflix made since YOU
Call the Midwife,She looks like Ivy Rorschach.
Call the Midwife,Season two: It looks like four years has gone by without either Nadia or Alan dying and this is when she discovers that the 6 train goes to 1982. (I always took it to go to 1990 myself)
Call the Midwife,"The new season is not, nearly, as much fun. It also feels like she’s “trying harder”."
Call the Midwife,Natasha's acting is way over the top on this season  compared to S1. Also the back and fourth timeline is too confusing. Still haven't gotten passed episode 5 cause of this. They're trying too hard.
Call the Midwife,The first season was a 10/10. The second is a 7.5/10 so it’s not bad but it’s not as strong as the first
Call the Midwife,"Lyonne’s acting, dialogue and delivery is as good as ever and I am again impressed by her acting. Her eyes alone on the call to her mother…

So far it’s good but I can tell it’s not gonna be the zeitgeist of the first but so what? Still fantastic."
Call the Midwife,"They underplayed Alan's character, felt a few episodes too short.

Season 1 is gold, season two is gold plated rock."
Call the Midwife,"I don't like the second season as much, but it's still a good show"
Call the Midwife,"Lyonne was great it in, but the plot was a mess and all over the place. It tried to do waaayyy too much in just 7 episodes.

Disappointing for a 3 year gap between seasons."
Call the Midwife,The answer is no. It picks up towards the end but it's got nothing on Season 1.
Call the Midwife,"the show was always planned as 3 seasons, and i think if they get their 3rd then the chaos of season 2 will make more sense"
Call the Midwife,"I've been very disappointed so far.

Season 1 was weird, but extremely charming.  
Season 2 is weird, and extremely off-putting."
Call the Midwife,"Personally, I didn’t enjoy it nearly as much. Still worth watching tho."
Call the Midwife,Emotional tones hit me harder in Season 2 but the story is weaker with Alan's storyline almost feeling shoehorned in.
Call the Midwife,Season two is a dumpster fire.
Call the Midwife,It’s awful
Call the Midwife,Yes imo. Season 2 is amazing.
Call the Midwife,"not as good, but still pretty good."
Call the Midwife,I’m four episodes in so far and I’m really enjoying it
Call the Midwife,"It is remarkably worse. Based on the first three episodes, they seem to turn it into a simple MacGuffin plot with twists seemingly created just to draw out the season, justifying it by to exploring the theme of family trauma without much subtlety or three-diimensionality."
Call the Midwife,I’m in ep 3 and so far it’s a strong return. Love the cast along with the newcomers. I recommend.
Call the Midwife,A simpler answer would be watch it and see what you think of it.
