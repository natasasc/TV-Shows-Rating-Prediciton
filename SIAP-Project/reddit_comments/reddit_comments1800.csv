TV Show,Comment
Dirty Money,"I loved the irony within the ""Payday"" episode. To me the quote from Scott's wife perfectly captures that irony.

>Because I'm married to Scott; in the government's eyes, it seems to me I just might as well be him.......I'm not allowed to have a credit card. I'm not allowed to use a debit card......I couldn't buy a car if I wanted to

Sounds like someone didn't know what they were signing up for. Probably should have read the fine print........ "
Dirty Money,"I was wondering why there wasn't a discussion thread, so far the series is great. I was hooked after watching the Maple Syrup heist episode first.

I never heard this news story before, nor did I have any prior knowledge of how cutthroat the *maple syrup* industry was to promp a robbery of $30 million worth of the stuff.

I just had to stream the rest of the series, though it practically became a hate-watch. As in you grow to really hate the subjects of each episode's investigations the longer you watch in-depth. Scott Tucker scams millions out of lower-class middle Americans, then whines when the ""big bad guvment"" starts taking all his stuff."
Dirty Money,I had to stop watching it. It's so interesting but it crushes my soul.
Dirty Money,"Rotten is another netflix docuseries that's really good, detailing the darker side of the food industry. The first episode is so so interesting as it goes into fraud in the honey industry. "
Dirty Money,I watched the Volkswagen episode twice cause it was so shocking and so much new information.  I knew they had screwed up but I didn't know it was so blatant how they lied! 
Dirty Money,"OMG, as a Canadian the maple syrup one drove me nuts lol. It felt like I was watching a mocumentary about Canada. Like, the characters were almost so stereotypically Canadian it seemed like it was towing a line of satire the whole time. ""Ees like ze Fort Knox of Canada, we control ze seeeyrup for ze world!"" How did someone steal the syrup you ask? ""We went eeenside, and saw ze seeeyrup, and zen, WE Stole eet!"" 

Also, as an added bonus, absolutely no French Canadians apparently understand how similes work. Watch it again and listen to their comparisons ""it was like Fighting ze fire, with another fire!"".... No... I don't think you know what that phrase means."
Dirty Money,"I was not prepared for a Maple Syrup scandal, I have to admit. Told in such a magnetic way where you completely believe it backed by the framework of it being unbelievable. It's just not a concept you would think there would be explainable ABCs attached to the crime and corruption world. 

All 6 episodes were well done and I hope viewers the take time to watch them all. I found *Drug Short* as the most compelling with *Hard Nox* running a close second. Perhaps *The Confidence Man* could have changed a few votes had it aired before the election. Who can say?"
Dirty Money,"Netflix has really turned it on with these documentaries.  I was only holding on until The Office, Archer and Parks and Rec leave, then they drop the 72 Most Dangerous Animals, Dirty Money, Rotten and The Toys That Made Us.  Didn't even see it coming, but they've done a really good job.  Wish they'd bring back White Rabbit Project though."
Dirty Money,"I'm currently watching. Most of them seem really well done and interesting. However, the only one that I didn't really like was the Payday one. I felt like it was focusing on the wrong part of the Scott Tucker story. Instead of focusing on the perils of the payday loans market and how he was involved in the market (it serves a purpose, but just needs heavy regulation) they should have focused on how he was illegally using tribe status to skirt state legislation which is required for this market for consumer safety reasons. 

I also felt like it equated having wealth to being evil. Too many things demonize wealth today instead of rent-seeking actions which are actually evil.

"
Dirty Money,"I loved the VW episode, but just finished the Payday loan one and am a bit let down. I think they did a terrible job outlining what exactly the dude did that was illegal. They certainly made him out to be a pretty big asshole, but I stopped the video and read the terms they kept putting up on screen and can't say it was hard to understand. (Again, immoral and dickish - yes, but illegal to the point of prison and a billion dollar fine?) I know there had to be some other smoking guns out there (and am doing my own research now to clear up my head), but I don't like any documentary that clearly sets someone up to be the 'bad guy' without giving extremely clear context for where it was he crossed the line. To me it would seem this episode almost lends (no pun intended) itself more to a commentary on the shortcomings of government regulations in this space (much like what I assume will be in the pharma one) instead of a hit piece on one dude that based on the facts presented in the episode just ""raced the rule book"""
Dirty Money,What I felt was compelling about each was watching decent people make incredibly bad decisions that would turn into a series of bad decisions.  Watching the VW episode you had to feel for the exec who was asked if he had a reputation of being a good person and then watching as time went on bad decision after bad decision ruin him.  The lack of a moral code in the Payday Ep was crazy as well - sociopathic behavior on display.
Dirty Money,"I've watched the Payday loans episode and the Trump episode. Fantastic show. The Scott Tucker episode made me want to put all of my time and effort into becoming a professional race car driver, join a race that Scott Tucker is in, then pass him on the final lap, watching his smug face be disappointed in his performance."
Dirty Money,"It's phenomenal. The best documentary film-makers in America make films about corporate greed. It's a little depressing (because most of the time the criminals escape without punishment) but each story is gripping and makes its economic crimes easy to understand and feel invested in. 

My fav so far is the payday loan scam, because we actually spend a lot of time with Scott Tucker and eventually seeing the size of his sentence feels shocking and the pharma giants because it shows the insider workings of gigantic business that ostensibly exists to save lives. The Trump episode (which I think to avoid controversy they left out of the trailer) is nothing new; but its interesting to hear what his former-colleagues and employees think of him: they think he is horrible piece of shit and a very dumb man. "
Dirty Money,Episode 3 on pharmaceutical profiteers Valiant blew my mind. I thank this series for helping me understand and present things in such a clear way. 
Dirty Money,"The episode about Trump was excellent, his former construction manager admitting that his alter ego publicist was really Trump, which we all knew anyway. But still great to hear someone admit it."
Dirty Money,The Maple Syrup Heist is borderline parody. It felt like an Andy Sandburg HBO mockumentary at times.
Dirty Money,I still have to watch the Trump episode but I liked them all except the Maple Syrup Heist episode. I don’t really understand what the message was supposed to be with that episode. I hope there will be a season 2.
Dirty Money,"It’s really enjoyable and interesting to watch. 

The VW scandals narrator was a little to forward about his left leaning ideas, but overall it was informative and interesting (if you overlook his extreme biases). "
Dirty Money,"Just watched episode 6 (the Trump episode). Not much new information, but a well made doc."
Dirty Money,"Really enjoyed the maple syrup one. Almost felt like a mockumentary at some points but very informative and well put together. The start had me laughing pretty good.

 ""Its an insult Canada to serve fake maple syrup at the table. It's like serving water instead of wine."" Oookay now."
Dirty Money,I love it!!! that Volkswagon one was fascinating.  
Dirty Money,It’s some really great stuff. I didn’t half this stuff was going on.
Dirty Money,So far I enjoyed the VW episode and the HSBC/drug cartel episode.
Dirty Money,the volkswagen episode messed me up. Damn
Dirty Money,"Finished them up yesterday, and they were definitely a good series of documentaries. The Trump (I pretty much knew all of it) and maple syrup (weird story, but I felt nothing for either side) ones were the weakest for me, but all of them are definitely worth checking out."
Dirty Money,"Hated it but I like how it showed trump is an asshole!
"
Dirty Money,"Man that Volkswagen episode is just so butt hurt and makes me laugh about how American Car manufacturers are just jokes... hahaha dirty money, smh."
Dirty Money,[deleted]

Dirty Money,"This is gonna sound weird, but my wife and I were honestly put off by how long the ""episodes"" were.

We started the first one on the VW scandal, expecting it to be like a half hour or hour long episode. Then when it felt like it was going on for awhile, I paused it to see that it was actually over an hour and a half. That's feature film length and not really ""bingable."""
Dirty Money,">So many different stories about things I’ve never even heard of

Like .... ?"
Dirty Money,"I watched the VW one and it was ok, I don't know why they had to bring up Trump but whatever, alright. I watched the syrup one next and it was like watching a parody of Canadian life and I just got turned off. "
Dirty Money,What's it about? 
Dirty Money,"More anti-capitalist, socialist propaganda from netflix. Fortunately the millennial generation that eats this crap up is to weak to ever do anything about their situation. Fortunately the younger generation is pro-capitalism and anti-communism. Netflix can keep pushing this shit all they want, but it will have 0 effect."
Dirty Money,Sounds like they might be struggling to pay the bills. I hear payday loans can help alleviate some of the pressure.
Dirty Money,"That whole episode was like: wat?
They (Scott and his wife) were like: poor us, this is not fair. 
Bruh you screwed already poor people out of their money, that’s not fair."
Dirty Money,"Yeah, it was insane.  The part at the beginning too, where the government is seizing his racecars and she was saying ""how could anybody buy something that is involved in another person's life falling apart?"""
Dirty Money,"Fuck his attorney even more.  He looked like a Bond villain.

Scott had zero remorse.  I thought it was poetic justice when he could not confirm his own morality."
Dirty Money,I loved when Tucker was whining about how he was forced to use a court appointed attorney because the government took all his assets. It was just poetic justice. 
Dirty Money,The Scott Tucker one had my blood boiling. 
Dirty Money,"The Scott Tucker one may have been the best documentary I've ever seen. 


The documentarian basically gave him enough rope to hang himself.


And honestly, the way it's made, I think Scott Tucker's family may take it as a sympathetic piece of work.


But anyone on the sane side of the fence sees what entitled assholes they all are. 


I really respect that one, there wasn't alot of editorializing, the facts and the characters themselves made you emotional by itself. Brilliant documentary. "
Dirty Money,Yeah I had the same thought so I thought I’d post something haha. It’s also funny that you mentioned the maple syrup episode because I’m literally watching it right now and it is so insane! 
Dirty Money,"The maple syrup one was a nice break from the infuriating episodes. It's a nuanced doc with both sides having something to say even if the federation exerts control in a way that silences people who are against this system. But at least you get why it's like that. The other episodes there's nothing to get, it's just rotten people and rotten systems."
Dirty Money,[deleted]
Dirty Money,I watched all six of them straight through yesterday.  Really fantastic. 
Dirty Money,Love the way he is complaining as he eats a steak and the people he scammed are literally starving. Disgusting. 
Dirty Money,Scott Tucker was such an obnoxious asshole. He was crying about how the government was so awful and “made” his brother commit suicide. They hurt so many Americans and didn’t give a fuck. Why are people supposed to feel bad for Scott Tucker now? 
Dirty Money,"I like the Stone Cold Steven Austin move ""The Condemned"" better than any single episode of ""Dirty Money"" and you know the cashmaster wants to see it if the name has that $$$$$

I have seen every ep of ""Dirty Money"" and it's not close to ""The Condemned"""
Dirty Money,Yep. The behavior outlined is endemic to our society and we utterly and completely lack the political will to do anything about it. 
Dirty Money,Any one in particular crush your soul or was it a culmination of all of them? 
Dirty Money,"Don't watch ""rotten"" either than! "
Dirty Money,I *knew* something was up with those bloody bees...
Dirty Money,"Thanks for the recommendation, I'll check it out!"
Dirty Money,"The VW is so strange to me.  I sell VWs and started right after the scandal and stop sale hit.

The part that confuseses the most is now that the EPA and CARB have approved fixes for some of the TDIs it hasn't changed the EPA estimates on gas mileage.  The EPA issued new mileage stickers for the cars and it is the exact same.

Although I am told they lost some of the torque on the high end."
Dirty Money,"Fuck man, when they double backed to commission that fraud study to pitch Americans TDI again for 2017?!?!? 


Are you fucking kidddddding me? 


And smug Stuart face and his smuggy face. When he can't bring himself to trying to maintain plausible deniability? I wanted to smash my own phone!"
Dirty Money,"You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means"
Dirty Money,"And like, how were 90% of the people in that episode wearing black and red buffalo check flannels?! Were they like ""everyone please wear your most Canadian-looking black and red check flannel, we're going for a theme here""? 

^^^^now ^^^^I ^^^^feel ^^^^silly ^^^^in ^^^^mine"
Dirty Money,">""Ees like ze Fort Knox of Canada, we control ze seeeyrup for ze world!"" How did someone steal the syrup you ask? ""We went eeenside, and saw ze seeeyrup, and zen, WE Stole eet!""

24 days too late, but come on, bro: they're French-Canadian. They pronounce ""the"" and ""then"" as ""de"" and ""den"", not ""ze"" and ""zen"". The phonology is different from that of French speakers in France."
Dirty Money,"I agree with you about the Maple Syrup scandal one. I actually just finished that episode and found it so interesting and hard to believe but the show did a good job explaining it. 

I still haven’t watched The Confidence Man yet so I’ll get back to you on that but my favorites ones were Payday and Drug Short. "
Dirty Money,Generic comment but nothing will change Trump voters' minds. The man is likely going to be indicted by the special counsel and this will still not change his supporters' minds. You're assuming they are operating with a healthy mind based on fact and logic.
Dirty Money,"I thought the maple syrup one was the worst one, didn't really pay attention. All the other ones were amazing... At getting me all worked up on my sick day"
Dirty Money,"As someone who worked there 2.5 months.  They did a bad job explaining what was so controversial.  They basically brushed over the fact they the links didn't need to be clicked to get the loan and they intentionally made it in big letters what you'd pay for the loan if you opted to pay it off that next paycheck.  Basically it made it look like you were only paying 390 for a 300 dollar loan.  The issue they had was you had to go through a bunch of steps to make the loan come out at the right time.  They'd process the payments at random times. Everyone who worked there knew it was bs. They kept justifying it by giving the workers the copy they gave the court. Everyone thought they were just dumb borrowers.  They automatically set up the payments to screw people.  


The whole thing was a lot more confusing than the documentary made it out to be.  Basically they tried to brush off complaints by acting like you can just send a letter to the ""office"" which was a po box on an Indian Reservation. Customers were again mislead by not being told that the po box wouldn't matter.  All while you kept getting withdrawals. Again almost all of it was technically legal.  Same with the calling of people at work.  You'd leave a message even to the employer which would obviously embarrass the customer.  It was extremely out of control when I worked there,  ethically.  I was there 10 years ago btw. This wasn't a short game they were playing.  Plus the whole leave your cell phones was very real. If you got caught with it you'd be fired on the spot.  They claimed it was because it had people's personal information not so we can't take pictures.  Plus that stupid money bag paper was pasted on all the cubicles on at least the bottom floor. "
Dirty Money,"The box that the wife alludes to... puts it in pretty stark context. They advertised an arrangement of cost and payment that was all but impossible to execute in reality. 


But over and above that were two pretty egregious steps they took..

For one, their interest rates exceeded several state and federal law levels. So there's that, plain and simple. 


And two, no *reasonable expected consumer* would have been able to decipher the terms and conditions without an expert attorney. The regulator laid out that key information was dispersed and purposely spread out over various pages of the document and sentences started and finished in odd ways that made it difficult to follow. The language the employees and attorneys would refer to, was never gathered in one legible spot for the consumer. 


Third, none of us know what are on those native American nation contracts but we can see on the face of it that these were native American in name only. The regulator says at one point, that those nations that partnered with him net like 1% of the total proceeds. It was simply a way to side step intentional state laws avoid regulation. "
Dirty Money,"His smug face melted when he faced the fact he was willfully maintaining plausible deniability.


That lawyer on the other side of the camera eviscerated him. Jesus Christ. Get that guy on as a debate moderator for our elections. "
Dirty Money,He's in jail for 16 years. So no longer on the circuit
Dirty Money,If anything I think scotts sentence wasn't long enough
Dirty Money,"The problem with that one? There was too much to fit in the single episode. They weren't able to go in depth into everything, because each individual issue could have had it's own hour."
Dirty Money,"The most insane part of that episode for me was the SoHo building. It's such an insane web of amorality.

Not only are you using the TV show that was designed to mock your fall from grace to promote your tower in order to help get out of your immense debt, but also you didn't even buy the tower. You licensed it. And not only that, but also the person you licensed it to was essentially a Kazak mobster who was arrested once for stabbing a guy in the face with a wine stem, a a second time for doing a pump and dump scheme.

A toxic mix of wealth, narcissism and daddy issues."
Dirty Money,"I think the point of that episode was to show how any innocuous industry can be corrupted. How money managed to turn Quebec's mild-mannered maple syrup market into a mafioso like racket. One family-owned company putting a strangehold on all producers/distributors, dictating what they can or can't do with what they own and grow. They get all the profit, while everyone else has to put up or shut up because there's no other competition to work with.

Suddenly hard-working people have to turn to crime just to make end's meat under the conditions of the ""maple syrup mafia""... that's a term I'd never thought I would seriously hear before seeing this documentary.

I guess the point is, to show from just one singular industry, how the middle-class have no recourse of choice when the big corporations start to form and take over. With enough money to do *whatever* they want... even buy whatever local/federal government they operate under."
Dirty Money,outsiders
Dirty Money,"Maybe watch it, decide to hate it, and then come back to the thread to share your own criticism?  "
Dirty Money,Why did you click?
Dirty Money,the VW is the weakest episode in the series and feels like its just editing together archival materials. The rest are much better and justify their lengths.
Dirty Money,Netflix is pretty upfront with their runtimes.......I assume most people check how long a show will last before jumping in.
Dirty Money,"It's no different than watching 3 episodes of a show that you binge.  So yeah, it is bingeable "
Dirty Money,"Documentaries are already shortened and easily digestible versions of complex subjects made as such to bring that information to a wider audience. My issue with many of these is that they aren't *longer* but I understand the reason they aren't is people just won't watch them if they are.

I just have such a hard time connecting with this sentiment on a personal level. "
Dirty Money,They are long. I’m not sure about an hour and a half. All the episodes I watched were an hour long. But yea. Too long for what they are about even though it seems some think they weren’t long enough or covering enough. 
Dirty Money,Dirty Money

Dirty Money,"I really don't know how they could film that and not say something. 

They were just so evil but completely believed they were good and didn't care about all the people's lives they ruined. "
Dirty Money,"The way he was *so* upset with the government coming in and ruining his life while ignoring the millions of people's lives he ruined just pissed me off.
"
Dirty Money,"The show runner took a awesome approach to it. He kind of did an clockwork orange type spin by putting in footage of him convinced about how innocent he is. Instead everyone just sees how much of a sociopath he is, and it speaks volume on people like him who run these type of scams. They never really realize that they aren't a victim."
Dirty Money,I actuality worked at amg. Everyone there knew it was horse shit. I worked there back in 2007-2008. They all bragged about the native American loophole.  I can't believe they didn't shut it down sooner.  We had to sign a nondisclosure and I'm unsure of what all I signed but it was accurate from what I remember
Dirty Money,[deleted]
Dirty Money,Did anyone else think Scott Tucker was a real life Mr. Burns?
Dirty Money,I was so fucking angry at that guy; then saw he got 17 yrs in prison and that made me gulp. 
Dirty Money,"The thing that struck me about Scott Tucker is that he had no political capital, no one to call, no one to be in bed with him. He is the Prosecutors dream. One man to blame and convict. He was a con man  that got rich. The thing thats strikes me is the VW and HSBC cases were Fines and I'm sorry. HSBC had fucking NARCO and Terrorists links. Fuck them. Also the fines were nothing compared to what they made. 
"
Dirty Money,"We can only hope he kills himself like his brother did, good riddance."
Dirty Money,This is why I'm afraid to watch Dirty Money. I feel like it's just going to piss me off.
Dirty Money,second this
Dirty Money,"When he started crying about his partner committing suicide, I legitimately felt ""serves you right"". I would never feel this way about another person, but he's a special kind of garbage..."
Dirty Money,"As a libertarian, I found some of his arguments compelling.  When the feds want to ruin you, they can do it so thoroughly as to cross the line.

Also really curious what happened on the native american side, it seemed like they kept a small version of the operation running."
Dirty Money,"> I assume it's not exactly something you want to watch after a long day when tired and irritated then?

Wait until a cold day when you won't mind your blood boiling.  ;-)"
Dirty Money,"At this point, I wonder if anything _can_ be done."
Dirty Money,I thought the maple syrup one was interesting. Pretty much the rest of them felt evil.
Dirty Money,The one about valiant the pharm company crushed me soul. It’s crazy no one is in jail for that.
Dirty Money,"> Don't watch ""rotten"" either than!

I mean...don't watch that because it isn't very good. I couldn't get past the first episode. It was pretentious, whiny, and had the affect of a YT documentary about a forbidden video game club. "

Every time I see it, I just imagine how annoying it has to be to use that phone. Like imagine watching a movie or playing a game on a phone shaped like a pear. lol"

Aren't those just in Rodriguez or Tarantino movies?"
Llama Llama,"Best one I've seen so far, LOVE the wordplay here."
Llama Llama,"Ah well, true. I'm more familiar with writing and artwork, where the money goes the other way when the piece is distributed or used by a third party. Though ""influencers"" don't seem to understand that concept, and think it should work more like product placement. 

The title should have said ""to avoid giving the real company free advertising"", but everyone knew what I meant anyway. It does make me wonder if a show kept the real product or name in the show without being paid, would the real company just take it as free advertising, or would they send a cease and desist because they don't want to be associated with a certain show?"
Llama Llama,"If the use will make the product look bad, the company won't consent to their trademark being used."
Llama Llama,I thought it was a knockoff of Zima since it was the 90's. And Zima was always mocked as being terrible.
Llama Llama,New Girl as well
Llama Llama,"If they wanted to or they can provide the product for free. However, there are rules that apply. 

One example is Apple products - villains can't be seen using Apple products on-screen if they're providing them. Filmmakers can still have a villain using an iPhone, but they would need to buy all the Apple equipment."
Llama Llama,Marlboro
Llama Llama,"I didn't know about fake bags, but I did notice that on NCIS none of their trash cans have liners, which drives me crazy because they're always throwing unwrapped food and full drink cups in there. One time I swear I saw coffee grounds in one.  Within the show universe I feel bad for their janitor, but even on the real set, *someone* has to clean out those trash cans. I just hope they're paid better than an NCIS janitor. 

I always wondered if it was a visual problem, that the liners might be reflective and distracting, but someone pointed out it's probably because of the sound they make that they didn't use them."
Llama Llama,They talk about this on the Office Ladies podcast also. They call them their fakie bags.
Llama Llama,It really is more intuitive
Llama Llama,"It also just dont make any sense.

From what i remember apple is pretty generous with tv serie and movie sets and will lend you stuff for free if needed.

Unless things have changed and they now want money."

* Burn Notice
* Castle
* Chicago P.D.
* Community
* Grey's Anatomy
* How to Get Away with Murder
* The Shield
* Pretty Little Liars
* Sons of Anarchy
* Zoo
* Modern Family

One could argue that all those shows are part of the MCU."
Llama Llama,Bepis
Llama Llama,Actually just Tarantino
Llama Llama,"They can't send a cease and desist, you're allowed to depict products, logos and brand names used the way they are intended to be used."
Llama Llama,"Consent wouldn't really be at issue but more so the damages.

Trademark law is about brand protection in the consumer market, as long as your aren't deceiving consumers you can use it in pretty much any creative work. 

A movie defaming the brand, or making it seem in someway connected with the brand officially is something they can go after because it is damaging to the brand and creates confusion."
Llama Llama,Thanks!
Llama Llama,"It's not an issue with shows not being allowed to feature brands, you're allowed to feature brands without seeking permission.^(1) It's a network policy related to advertising; brands often pay TV studios or networks to feature their products onscreen, and so studios or networks often have a policy of not displaying brands that *haven't* paid, mostly to encourage brands to pay (no point if they're already featuring your stuff for free). 

If you watch The Office, you'll notice that a lot of episodes say ""Promotional consideration by Apple"" at the end. That's Apple paying them to feature iPods, Macbooks, iMacs, etc prominently in the show. A lot of episodes have Apple stuff featured very conspicuously. At one point Apple stopped paying them and you can tell, because suddenly there are decals blocking the Apple logos on the computers already on set (which are obviously Macs) and even a scene or two where they clearly covered up the glowing Apple thing in post. NBC is probably the network that [does product placement deals the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9hepxidZyo) and they're pretty strict about that. If they kept displaying Apple branding on the show when the deal expired, why would Apple ever renew it? (Which I think they eventually did.)

----

^1 Except on some publicly-owned networks like the BBC, where there are strict rules about not commercially advertising. You might notice that if you see a Coca Cola on a BBC show, it's usually in a fridge next to a dozen other drink brands,"
Llama Llama,"it may also be a nickelodeon directive, most examples ive seen of this is on nickelodeon"
Llama Llama,"Real life is now technically a part of the MCU meaning that every show ever is now connected to the MCU, and through the multiverse, likely ""canon""."
Llama Llama,Except Lucifer being that it’s a DC property and he was in an Arrowverse crossover.
Llama Llama,"Yeah, guess it's easier to not show car decals rather than get permission for every episode.

""The pedophile is escaping in a Ford!"""
Llama Llama,"You won't see a Coca-cola on screen in the majority of BBC shows.  With the exception of consumer advice, they're not allowed to show logos at all.  It's why in the early seasons of Screenwipe Charlie Brooker had a random post it on his laptop screen"
Llama Llama,The UK also has a law where any show with product placement needs to put a p logo in the opening to indicate it has it.
Llama Llama,It was a joke
Llama Llama,"Lol, ""a new study,"" like this some piece of scholarship. 

This is a series of infographics put out by a site called [FundMyLawsuitNow.com](https://FundMyLawsuitNow.com). The goal is to make you think about how expensive injuries are, so you'll hire a personal injury attorney.

If someone reputable really wanted to determine the Jackass crew's medical bills, they would probably contact the shows' publicists, not write down all the injuries and estimate how much each costs."
Llama Llama,This is an indictment on the American healthcare system more than the Jackass crew.
Llama Llama,So one ambulance ride?
Llama Llama,"$300k for a broken ankle, WTF America, are you ok?"
Llama Llama,"Oh America. Never change.

Actually, please change."
Llama Llama,Ask for it itemized and it’s 500k max
Llama Llama,"$2.5M for a ""brain hemorrhage"" - going to have to call bullshit on that one. I can't even find any news about him receiving a craniotomy - and even if he did those don't cost $2.5M. My guess is they're fluffing the numbers by taking in associated costs such as missed work and disruptions to production on the movie.

https://fundmylawsuitnow.com/knoxville-tops-jackass-injury-rich-list/

Take a look at the website that funded this ""study"" - ""On top of this, Johnny Knoxville has also sustained a reported 16 concussions in his life, equating to roughly $4m in **settlement costs**""

The actual numbers are clearly not intended to be representative of actual ""medical bills""."
Black Lightning,“Why do they call me ‘Black Lightning’? You may as well call Aquaman ‘White Fish’.
Black Lightning,"A-Train, is that you?"
Black Lightning,In his pants
Black Lightning,There is just to many episodes per season. 22 hour long episodes is just to much time to fill.
Black Lightning,They're really going above and beyond with the fan service. Brandon Routh as Kingdom Come Superman and Burt Ward is cameoing as someone else. I don't watch these shows that often but that's awesome
Black Lightning,[deleted]
Black Lightning,[deleted]
Black Lightning,Finally. i hated that this show was left out of everything.I really enjoy Black Lightning. They do a lot of stuff right and I really want to see an interaction between Black Lightning and Green Arrow or Supergirl.
Black Lightning,"Seriously, Crisis is gonna be the most bonkers thing on TV in.. ever."
Black Lightning,"Oh wow, I thought they were keeping that verse separate."
Black Lightning,Finally! Tired of this series being the stepchild.
Black Lightning,[deleted]
Black Lightning,As someone who tuned out of flash and arrow after season 3 & 4... would I be able to watch Crisis without any catchup or is there just too much lead in to be able to enjoy it that way?
Black Lightning,I've got 29 episodes of Black Lightning to watch then.
Black Lightning,[deleted]
Black Lightning,"Yes! Green Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, the Legends, Black Lightning, awesome to have those titular characters.

And all the cameos we’ve heard about like Burt Ward and Linda Carter!! It’s interesting that DC’s answer to Endgame is coming from their tv side and not the movies"
Black Lightning,I'm not surprised they're adding him in there. With arrow ending this year I'm sure they need somebody to fill the slot for their big crossover events every year.
Black Lightning,I wish they'd just do a legit live action Static Shock show. I'd watch it.
Black Lightning,Great news.  I love black lightning and always thought it a shame it didn’t cross over.  Then again it’s probably more a logistic thing.  All the shows are filmed in Vancouver except black lightning.
Black Lightning,...I really liked black lightning. I'll show myself out.
Black Lightning,Okay shit i guess i'm watching this crossover then.
Black Lightning,"Tried to get into that show, but it honestly sucks. Poor writing, just one big meh."
Black Lightning,What's kingdom come superman like? Sounds quite interesting
Black Lightning,If only the Legends will be included too.
Black Lightning,A train
Black Lightning,A-Train?
Black Lightning,Call me VELVET THUNDERRRR
Black Lightning,Sweet a new character to discuss feelings with and do terrible fight scenes. Can't wait for Oliver and him to disagree about tactics and for Barry to get upset for no reason while the legends totally forget they have super powers untill the show needs an ending. Can Not Wait.
Black Lightning,YOOO YESSSS FINALLY.
Black Lightning,Who is that?
Black Lightning,"So I'm not a real big superhero comic guy but I've noticed a pattern with black superheroes: Black Panther, Black Falcon, Black Manta, now Black Lightning. Am I missing anyone?"
Black Lightning,Season 2 got better during the second half.
Black Lightning,As long as they stay away from Black Ice. You really need to watch out for that dangerous Black Ice...
Black Lightning,do people actually exist who think arrow is better than black lightning
Black Lightning,"It's so weird that there are black super heroes with ""black"" in their name. The original power rangers took heat because the black ranger was played by a black guy, but he would fit right in today."
Black Lightning,"Honestly, mixed feelings about this. Before Black lightning had come out I would have loved this, a black superhero in the arrowverse (other than diggle) needed to happen. 

Than Black Lightening came out and it was a totally different tone than the arrowverse. The arrowverse is like blockbuster fun with a focus on that, and it does it really well. Not always smart and not always great, but it doesn't have to be. Just fun shows to turn your brain off to. 

Black Lightning has more to say about hot-button topics and treats it's charchters and central family a lot more seriously than the arrowverse would. It doesn't always ""get"" certain issues, but it's actively trying to. 

When Arrow tries the same thing (like the gun control episode) it falters because it doesn't make sense to have serious topics when we asskicking has been the status quo, and the writers are great at writing ass-kicking one liners, but more serious topics are almost always a bit meh. 

Tonally, a Cloak and Dagger or even a Runaways crossover would fit more (yes I know they're different companies and a crossover would never happen. It was an example of tonal similarities, not an actual suggestion). I don't want Black Lightening to be in the arrowverse just because he can be. 

But on the other hand I'm sure it'll be a fun idea, I have no idea how they're gonna fit so many new superheros (Burt Ward, this, alternate superman) into 5 hours of content while still giving everyone their due AND probably killing off the arrow."
Black Lightning,I wonder how big is role will be in it.
Black Lightning,Is this for the yearly crossover? Will the Legends say yes this time?
Black Lightning,"I guess BL is officially in the Arrowverse (for whatever reason, they seemed really hesitant to link the series)."
Black Lightning,Crises is a huge story.  I hope they pull it off but have serious doubt if green arrow is their focus point..
Black Lightning,BLACK
Black Lightning,"welp time to binge this show on Netflix, been needing a reason to watch it haha"
Black Lightning,I've been only watching the crossovers these last couple of years so this is good news
Black Lightning,So Black Lightning will officially join the DC tv shared universe?
Black Lightning,They need Power Girl. Though good luck finding an actress that can fill her leotard.
Black Lightning,I'm gonna miss Stephen Amell
Black Lightning,Fuck YES!
Black Lightning,fucking *FINALLY*!!
Black Lightning,Holy shit. They’re doing Infinite Crisis?!
Black Lightning,"So the cross-over is about to get the best damn soundtrack on TV added to it. That's rad.  
Also, the Young Justice Markovia Meta-Human war plot would be fucking awesome going forward in the CW."
Black Lightning,For a second there I thought it was Jordan peele.
Black Lightning,The first season wanted to be taken so seriously but it just ended up being cheesy and also the actor that play the lead is a very bad actor imo. Maybe he got better inter second season which I have not checked out but ...just a really bad first season.
Black Lightning,Why didn’t they make BL part of the arrowverse?
Black Lightning,"I caught up on all of the CW DC shows the last time there was a big crossover event.

The event ended up being lame as hell. I'm not making the same mistake twice.

I might watch Crisis of Infinite Earth's, but I'm not going to binge multiple seasons of bad tv to prepare myself."
Black Lightning,"Huh, I thought they said from the start it was going to be it’s own thing.  Guess they need to get more viewers?"
Black Lightning,This is terrible. Black Lightning deserves way better than to be associated with those shitty Arrowverse shows.
Black Lightning,Black lightning is soooooo bad
Black Lightning,This is awesome news for all three fans of the show.

Black Lightning,Then I guess I’m gonna watch the read a summary of Black Lightning because I don’t watch the show.
Black Lightning,Is this grown up Static?
Black Lightning,Can black lightning use a black lantern ring???
Black Lightning,I tried to watch the show but it sucked and was kind of stereotypical.
Black Lightning,Where the fuck is Sinbad?
Black Lightning,The writing on Black Lightning is on such a high level that I dont want them to mesh with the other shows.

Trolls: The Beat Goes On!,"Laurel and Hardy when they are trying to impress two girls at the park soda fountain.

Ollie only has money for three sodas so he tell Stan that he should say no when he is offered a soda. 

Despite saying he understands, every time Ollie goes around the group offering sodas, Stan accepts. Ollie keeps taking him aside and explaining again that he needs to refuse, then offers the sodas again. 

Every time Stan says yes.

It gets funnier and funnier despite you knowing exactly what's going to happen."

Trolls: The Beat Goes On!,"When a joke goes long, there is a moment where it becomes uncomfortable and if there's enough commitment - and it's actually a good joke - it'll start being funny again.

F[or every meeting he comes up with a random silly name for his partner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4jSE0D69Kw). Usually a pop culture reference.

This goes on for many seasons until finally one day they meet the most hardened psychopathic criminal hitman murderer they've ever encountered. To which he gives his partners full and correct name for the first time since the show started. The look on his face was priceless.

Trolls: The Beat Goes On!,"It’s not television, but Mike Myers peeing after being unfrozen is my favorite example of this in the first Austin powers movie.

All skits are soeaced out with Key & Peele on stage riffing on stuff.

1st main skit of Episode 1, Season 1 after the cold open shows two husbands talking about the absurdity of their wives ending each example with, ""I said, biiiitch."" But they make sure they look over their shoulders and they're out of earshot before saying bitch. They get progressively further from their SOs.

Seasons 4 and 5 instead have them driving to an unknown destination between skits. We're never told where they're going... until the last episode titled ""The End.""

End title card shown. Credits have rolled. They're even showing bloopers from old skits.

Then it fades back to the car on the road. They pull over, decide this is the place, look over they're shoulders and both say, ""I said, biiiiiiitch!"" 

Then decide to drive back because Peele's girl is waiting.

I thought it was a perfect ending to the series, especially because I know so many people that never saw it since it was post credits."

I don’t even know if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and that seems to bring him happiness. But I don’t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there… at night I…I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that’s on my arm. A lady that I once loved, doc. I don’t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the…in the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch… I no longer love him. As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I… that I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn’t such a coward, then perhaps…perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all…Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I’m a moth, just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I’m not feeling good. And so the doctor says, “Moth, man, you’re troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here?”

Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"I don't watch any of those... I considered Perry Mason but just never really bothered, I hadn't heard of Yellowjackets until it was halfway done I think but I'll probably watch it eventually.

There's a few things starting in March but I'm most looking forward to Ted Lasso... but I'll also be watching Superman & Lois, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon and The Mandalorian. 

I'm actually more looking forward to April with season premieres of Schmigadoon, Single Drunk Female, From and The Afterparty... and whenever the final season of Endeavour starts on PBS, hopefully won't be too long."

Perry mason season 1 was terrible with this stupid drama shit. so i do not have high hopes for season 2.

Love top chef? why the fuck would i want to watch a show about cooking? i hate cooking myself so no thanks.

never watched you, but seems another of those oh i feel so sorry for the main character kind of bullshit, i wonder how he will survive all this.

in other words i have completely different taste then you. i mean i have good taste and you do not :)

what i am looking for is succession, shadow and bones season 2. Mandalorian, ted lasso,  swarm"

Tried really hard to like perry Mason but felt it was a total drag"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, Top chef!
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,God damnit. Yellowjackets can not be coming out. I have accomplished nothing...
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Yeah I hope Top Chef ends up being good. I just don’t see how any of them can ever beat Buddha, he’s not only the most dominant Top Chef competitor basically ever save for one or two, he's also had the most recent experience."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Succession and Perry Mason. Loved the first season
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"March is pretty stacked, honestly. Most looking forward to *Succession*, *The White House Plumbers*, *Perry Mason*, *Yellowjackets*, and *The Mandalorian* (among quite a few others)."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"So much more than that.

Probably most excited for mando.. yellowjackets.. succession ..shadow and bone..and Perry Mason...and You.. tho this season has been a bit ridiculous and the ""eat the rich"" undercurrent was not as subtle as normal..not as good as other seasons but still great.

There is a large amount of great shows in season now that are all headed towards the end. Was kinda worried. Didnt realize this much stuff was about to drop."

I really need to start on ""Succession"" and ""Severance;"" they both get such excellent audience and critical raves"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Don't think there is more severance until 2024.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"When i finished the first part like 2 weeks ago, I thought it was really good but not amazing. but since then i couldnt stop thinking about how i need more. excited for march 10th"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Completely agree with your assessment of ""Midnight Mass;"" loved that show


Heard mixed things about ""Midnight Club,"" apparently it's from YA fiction & aimed at teens but sometimes that works out ok, guess will have to check out to see for self"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"""On today's quickfire challenge, you are to hunt, clean, and cook a rabbit dish. In your stations you will find scrap metal salvaged from a plane crash. These will be the only tools at your disposal. The dish you will prepare should be appropriate for a Michelin star restaurant. Tom, release the wolves."""
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,I feel like this show has zero hype and I just loved it. There was a Carnivale vibe to it. So well done.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,World. Baseball. Classic.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Hell yes, I'm so excited to hear about this happening."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Didn't know about this; I'm a big fan of a lot of his work, too, and my sister got me HBO Max for my birthday...thanks for the heads-up!"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Yay! ⚾🏃
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,You know the first ep is out already? It's good!!
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"✔️✔️✔️

I'm really looking forward to both. The art direction, sets, & costume design on ""Perry"" are remarkable 🔥

I've read the writers on Yellowjackets promising big reveals this season as per the ""who is this cult?""  & ""cannibalism--did they or didn't they?"" questions"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"I'm also excited about ""From.""

Give ""Perry Mason"" a chance, it's very well done. 


As others have said, if you're from a certain Riot Grrl or Gen X generation you will probably love ""Yellowjackets.""

I've been curious about the new ""Superman & Lois"" and Shadow & Bone but haven't seen any eps of either yet"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Yellowjackets is amazing and I highly recommend it. I can't wait until The Afterparty season 2! I loved season 1 so much. I constantly watch the dance/rap clip of 2 shots whenever I need a laugh.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Expertly cast. Hauntingly creepy. Uproariously droll. 

Also while the timelines seem to line up with Millennials as the girls' birth generation, they are built of pure Gen-X rocket fuel."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"It's awesome. I usually stay clear of teen drama but this show has a perfect balance of it. It's creepy, I like the mystery and the cast is great!"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Severance is still filming.  Succession comes out in March.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,You’re so smart! You’re in for a treat. It’s excellent!
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,💯🔥💯🔥💯
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,This is the way.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"I thought there is going to be just one, one hour long episode"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Succession is on track to be on the GOATs with season 4 being its last and Severance has one of the best pilot seasons of a show I've ever seen. Highly recommend both.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Might as well add Shrinking to your collection of S shows to watch.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Both are near perfect shows for me to be honest! I was disappointed HotD won over Severance at the Golden Globes, even though I really enjoyed it - it was a significantly better, tighter series premiere."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Don't bother with Midnight Club, it got cancelled... and it wasn't all that great to still warrant a watch. The YA stuff didn't bother me, it was more that the actual show's plot took a backseat to the stories the group would tell. Sure, the stories are meant to be used as a way to work out their issues, but it shouldn't have overshadowed the actual show itself. Though it was cool that some of the stories they told were small adaptations of some of Christopher Pike's other novels.

Flanagan seems to work best with a confined story, instead of trying to stretch it out just in case it gets another season."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Just checked it out. It's definitely teen-oriented, so not really my thing."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Definitely had a ""Carnivale"" vibe; excellent observation ✔️✔️✔️"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,It's just been SOOO long since S1. Nearly 3 years. It did solid ratings wise (S1) but now it's been delegated the Monday night slot and hasn't really had a big marketing push. Worried it may be toast after this season
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"It’s worrying how little promotion there is for this show, which by all accounts sounds excellent. So far only a teaser has come out, but it looks quite good."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Oh they did. It's just a matter of who they ate at this point.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Came here to say From (and a few others that were already mentioned). Surprised no one else has mentioned it, but maybe because EPIX (now mgm+) isn’t super popular or well known. Anyways, I hope it gets strong viewership and continues past this season."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,I think they’re Xennials. Hence the hybrid.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"If I'm not wrong, this time it will be 4 1-hour long episodes. 2 in one season, two in another."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Yup, completely agree with both statements. I will also add that while Succession and Severance are very different, they both are compelling dramas that also have many laugh out loud moments."
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,The Golden Globes are a joke. The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards have more legitimacy at this point.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Thanks for the 411! ✔️
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,FWIW Mike Flanagan did give all of the details of where the show would have gone had it gotten renewed so viewers weren't left hanging forever.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,[deleted]
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"Yeah, that's basically it lmao there were delays on the second half of episodes, so rather than release everything all at once like would be normal, they would rather release two parts of 2 episodes each"
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,Obviously going for the record of longest season time span wise. Ridiculous.
Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody,"He's one of, if not the best player of all time, and he is a friendly host fun to watch.  Its always been a no brainer to have him as full time host if he wants it."

Godzilla,Shouldn't there be more Japanese actors?
Godzilla,I hope they don’t waste this father and son combo.

Godzilla,It's going to be a family drama instead of event television  like Invasion then...

Godzilla,"I enjoyed Godzilla vs Kong. It’s a big dumb sci fi movie that surprisingly doesn’t let too much get in the way of some really fun action. King of the Monsters is watchable but not very memorable. The 2014 Godzilla movie is a very different vibe from the other two and is much slower, plus I literally have not been able to rewatch it without falling asleep, but it’s definitely great on a first viewing if you’re at all a fan of a more grounded take on giant monster films."
Godzilla,First one is great
Godzilla,"First one is good, 2nd one isn’t good but it’s got a ton of monster fights, Godzilla Vs Kong was dope"
Godzilla,And that’s a chop
Citrus,"This show is everything wrong with the public perception of science. Science isn't​ about dismissing critical views, and accepting everything you're told at face value. It's about critically analyzing the way the world works and challenging your own beliefs. This show is trash and deserves every piece of criticism it receives. Watch Cosmos instead if you haven't already, it's​ a much better show."
Citrus,"What drove me away was how he treated some of his guests. He pretty much invited some people just to make fun of them and not give them a word in edgewise, like the crystal healing guy. Not saying crystal healing isn't complete nonsense, but Bill brought him in the show to debate, so let him speak and don't make fun of him, Bill."
Citrus,"This is my favorite Reddit thread of all time. Never have I seen, on Reddit, so many posters from seemingly many different walks of life, share such agreeement. Thanks Bill. You've become the idiot we don't deserve, but we may need."
Citrus,"It seems that most people, right or left, are in agreeance that this is absolute dog shit. Maybe Bill Nye is saving the world after all."
Citrus,"Imagine the incredible accomplishment it takes to create something that is literally one of the WORST THINGS in the HISTORY of TELEVISION.

It really does seem like a ""sell your soul"" situation for Bill Nye. The guy used to be clever and forward thinking. This is regressive idiocy. 

And then ""That's exactly the right message, Rachel!"" My mind boggles.

Do you think he KNOWS he's destroyed his career? Is he being FORCED to do this? Does he have children that perhaps were kidnapped? WTF is going on? 

"
Citrus,"The stoner voice he uses when he's trying to make fun of something, it makes me hate him so much."
Citrus,[deleted]
Citrus,"I think Bill Nye made a major mistake when it comes to celebrities, which is believing his own hype. A lot of people from my generation love Bill because of watching his show as children, and we heap tons of adoration on him because of that. I mean who the hell didn't love Bill growing up. So he spends the last 10-15 years hearing how great he is and starts to think to himself, ""Damn I'm Bill Nye. Everyone loves me. I must be as smart and cool as everyone is saying. Let me teach these dumb assholes how to be like me"". And then he makes a show that does exactly that.


In a way we're partly to blame for placing a guy with one degree on a pedestal. Humble Bill made entertaining and educational content for kids. Celebrity Bill just bitches at people who don't think like him without the real scientific insight to back himself up."
Citrus,"I completely agree.  Who's the target audience for this show?  People who watched him when they were kids, right?  Why does he now think we're dumber than we were at ten years old?  I am now an *actual scientist*, and I'm disgusted by this show.  It's symptomatic of our society's inability to have a productive discussion without screaming at each other.  There are enough shows with screaming pundits."
Citrus,[deleted]
Citrus,"It's the ultimate outcome (well, at least a local maximum) of a trend that has been continuing for a long time now.

Compare the new *Cosmos*. A ton of people loved the new *Cosmos*, but it has a lot of the same problems with slightly better production. The discussion of scientific history (especially Neil deGrasse Tyson's beloved Bruno) is profoundly misleading where it isn't outright false. Things are simplified and controversy and nuance are downplayed.

There are good, interesting segments in *Cosmos*, but it is shot through with this very strong ideological bent where ""science"" is this essentialized, ahistorical object and the only problem is all of these ideological enemies who need to be overcome.

It's ""science"" as a religious or political affiliation rather than what it actually is - a collection of investigatory practices that are pretty diverse and *really* complicated and nuanced.

Speaking as someone who has actually worked as a scientist, I find this very, very troubling. This is not what science or scientists are actually like.

Most celebrity scientists aren't really scientists - either they never were (like Nye) or they've done far more as celebrities than as scientists (Tyson). Those few celebrity scientists who are still working scientists in a meaningful sense, with very few exceptions, have a similar problem: they present their pet theories as established facts or consensus views, regardless of the evidence, regardless of the agreement of the field, with very little nuance (Steven Pinker is a good example of someone especially bad about this).

It's good that we have attempts to educate people about the basics of scientific investigation, about concepts like control (though it would be nice if a little more time was spent on explaining that control is *relative* rather than binary). It's good that we're discussion things that *are* overwhelming consensus views like global warming, MMR vaccines, etc. Honestly, those are so important that if we can get people to believe them dogmatically - who cares. Things need to get done.

But so, so much airtime in recent years has gone toward a Cult of Science. You have non-scientists demonstrating with signs that say ""I believe in science!"". What does that even mean?

It seems to me that it means that Neil deGrasse Tyson is your televangelist. It seems like it's about a condescending attitude toward non-believers (who in turn become more hostile to *actual* science). It means Bill Nye debates Ken Ham and people on his side tune in for exactly the same reason Ham's people tune in - they don't want to learn anything, they want to watch Nye smugly prove what an idiot Ham is, and by extension all the rubes that believe the same things (at no point does Nye actually try to confront Ham on Ham's terms - he just barrels forward because the goal isn't to convert Ham, it's to preach to the choir).

Adherents talk about ""the scientific method"" like it's communion, absolving researchers of sins and yielding truth through a simple pre-written ritual. Kuhn is an apostate - a needless liberal arts nitpicker who doesn't understand the power of the true scientific method (nevermind that actual working scientists use a huge variety of methods, many of them quite different from the rigid ""scientific method"" you were taught in fifth grade). But nevermind that: Saint Popper and the blessed Falsificationism solved science, and any actual scientists and philosophers of science who seem critical are heretics.

Peer review functions as a similar article of faith, nevermind that every single measure shows that it doesn't work very well (as anyone who has ever been on either side of it could probably tell you).

Then you have your distorted version of history (like you see in *Cosmos*) where you were right in every way from the start and have merely been suppressed and victimized by all the people who simply Hate Good Things as a matter of principle.

You have the weird beliefs that took on a life of their own. Mary Magdalene was a prostitute and the Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrated how easily positions of authority cause people to behave inhumanely. You see it get brought up all the time. Except what you may not know is that, among scientists, it is almost universally used as an example of *what not to do* - and not just that it was unethical: the results are completely meaningless thanks to a laundry list of basic problems that you could (and psychology professors often do) teach a class on.

And then you have your iconography: pictures of spaces, pictures from microscopes, pictures of lab equipment, test tube shot glasses, posters with ""science jokes"", ""science nerd"" t-shirts. Look at how popular *The Big Bang Theory* is.

Bill Nye's new show is just the most recent extreme. He's the Milo Yiannopoulos to Neil deGrasse Tyson's Sean Hannity. It's been coming for a while, and it speaks to how common the ideology has gotten that it takes something this extreme for people to notice."
Citrus,Sex Junk may be literally the worst thing I've ever seen 
Citrus,"You're finally waking up to it. The whole ""this is what you need to think/believe on a certain issue and anybody who disagrees with you? You need to call them horrible names and shut them up"" agenda. "
Citrus,"Bill Nye has turned very condescending lately. Instead of explaining his stance, he relies on belittling others now. Its a painful transition. Almost like mr rogers attacking bad parenting instead of promoting great parenting methods. My love for Bill Nye has been dwindling and this show is adding to it. "
Citrus,The only possibility is that Bill Nye is attempting to save the world by bringing Liberals and Conservatives together to form a mutual hate for this series.
Citrus,[deleted]
Citrus,Wait - you managed to get through half the season? That's probably a record. 
Citrus,"I'm in 100% agreement.  The show is just bad.  I lost a ton of respect for Bill Nye because of this.  The green energy segment bothered me with the complete dismissal of Nuclear without bringing up any of the valid and reasonable reasons, and then not discussing the problems with solar and wind.  Let's debunk climate deniers by presenting a biased and neutered argument!"
Citrus,I'm a very left wing person at heart but it made me furious how he always seemed to shut down the right wing person on his panels before they even had a chance to speak.
Citrus,That sex junk thing gave me cancer
Citrus,"I had a big issue with the first episode because he brought on this esteemed panel of experts to discuss energy options and he barely even let the nuclear guy get a word in edgewise.  Bill just cut him off (when he was actually the one I wanted to hear from the most) and continued with his agenda, Nancy Grace-style.  I started the second episode, hoping the trainwreck I just watched was just because he was very dedicated to the climate change thing, and I couldn't even finish it.  The way he frames each segment; the way he talks to the audience of grown adults; the way he completely pulls the rug out from anything he disagrees with... it's exactly what I hate about *science-deniers* coming from a beloved childhood science icon.

It's like he doesn't trust concerned adults (who want to actually learn more) with having adult attention spans, so he rubs glitter on everything and waves Steve Aoki in front of the audience.  It's actually offensive to people like myself, who want to obtain new information without being talked down to."

Citrus,#FUCK
Citrus,[deleted]
Citrus,I was under the impression that this show was intended for millennials. As a millennial I feel retarded watching it and feel ashamed that they think this is what millennials want lol
Citrus,"I haven't watched it,  but if what you're saying is true,  that is really a sadly lost opportunity. One problem with this is that a lot of people sort of set him up as the foil to the anti-science people (see Nye vs Hamm) and by him coming out and peddling easily-provable falsehoods, it will open the door to more anti-science & anti-intellectualism.  We have to do better.  "
Citrus,"Another ""untouchable"" of Reddit falls. He joins all the others in /r/EveryoneYouAdmireIsBad.

Basically, only Mr. Rogers is left as an untouchable. Someone that is universally loved here by everyone. Freddy Mercury is close."

Citrus,"He's against nuclear power? The fuck? I thought most science types were all for it. 

If your post is accurate it sounds as though he's turning as closed-minded as the people him and Tyson try to rail against. "
Citrus,"The show is awful. If you haven't watched it yet, don't."
Citrus,I made it 10 min into the first episode. It's childishly obnoxious.
Citrus,"Just to add on as another example. 

The climate change episode... he talks about Venice flooding out because of the rising water levels, but completely omits to mention that it isn't just rising water levels but also Venice has sank substantially over the centuries. 

It sank because Venetians were pumping water out of the aquifer right underneath the city. The banned this practice in the 60s and suddenly Venice stopped sinking so drastically.

I mean, he isn't wrong... the rising water level is causing flooding, but he sells it as a climate change issue because rising waters is the only cause. Frustrating as hell.

*Explode it* 

**Uggghhhh**"
Citrus,"Bill Nye is a poster boy for an agenda. That agenda may have some well-meaning purpose behind it, but it is bastardized by angry, bitter, cynical types who are more interested in winning an argument than educating the other side.

They wield Bill Nye like an anti-ignorance weapon; not to cure the disease of ignorance, but to eradicate all those with symptoms. 

Education should never, ever, EVER come off as insulting toward the less educated. That accomplishes nothing, and only causes those people to push away even harder.

EDIT: Damn, went from 126 upvotes to 97 upvotes in a span of 10 minutes. Did r/billnyemessiahguy send the downvote brigade over here, or what?"
Citrus,"The whole point of Bill Nye is that he is dismissive as fuck to anything that he doesn't believe in, regardless of if it has any merit or not. The whole ""Nobody wants it"" for nuclear power is laughable. Yeah, nobody wants it. That's why nearly 20% of the US power is derived from Nuclear, and at least as recent as 2014 11% of total world power was derived from Nuclear.

I could go on and on on his various viewpoints but it's just basically a broken record. And he doesn't bother with debate, he just shuts people down."
Citrus,"**Why couldn't they just let us remember him fondly?**

Seriously, ask anyone about Bill last year and they'd probably have stories about their whole middle school class freaking out whenever the teacher rolled in the TV with the Bill Nye tapes.

Now the first thing my mind goes to is *smug*. More smug than Jon Oliver and NDT rolled into one.

Not sure if he's a sellout or if this is the real Bill, but either way I'm sad."
Citrus,Lets be real. We only liked Bill Nye in the first place because science teachers would put his show on in class. Anything was better than class. 
Citrus,"YES! He's completely shitting on the scientific method. He isn't taking all sides and weighing everything objectively. He has a side that he's taken, and cherry-picks evidence to support his position, ignoring any evidence, however legitimate, that contradicts him.

Bill Nye has become anti-science."
Citrus,Bill Nye - The Soapbox Guy
Citrus,"I have long held that Nye likes to overstep his bounds as a science entertainer. I'm not particularly religious, but ever since he accepted to do that [creationism debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6kgvhG3AkI), I have not had much respect for him.

Not only was it presumptuous of him to act on behalf of the scientific standpoint when he, himself, doesn't have a single degree in science (beyond an honorary doctorate.....), but he chose to perform his argument in a manner that was just as fallacious, stating major assumptions as fact, without any support. (for instance, stating, in essence that being christian automatically makes one unfit to be a scientist. The irony here is that he, himself, is arguably even less fit, with no degree...)

The whole thing was just entirely hypocritical -- He shouldn't have engaged in a debate that was obviously a non-starter due to incoherent starting assumptions -- and he **especially** shouldn't have approached it in terms of his *own* arbitrary starting assumptions.

I have thus, for a long time, held the **rather unpopular** opinion that Bill Nye is a bit of a fraud. I am glad to see that others are beginning to understand this about him too. He's an entertainer, and he happened to stumble upon a niche market teaching basic children's science in an entertaining way. But he is no scientist, and has no business lecturing, drawing conclusions, or being considered an authority on the issues of today. This show, and the way in which Nye presents his own opinions and standpoints as fact, is confirmation, to me, that this standpoint is correct. **A true scientist would respect the controversy, represent both sides fairly, and not draw conclusions where none can be objectively drawn.**"
Citrus,"I think this illustrates a problem I have recently started noticing with the left in general, which Nye and myself are a part of. As a group, we seem to have decided that our views are inherently correct, and that anyone who disagrees is ignorant, misinformed or just a bad person. We are no longer willing to listen to anyone on the other side; we ignore them, shout them down, and in some cases block them from even sharing their thoughts and feelings. It is this behavior which has given rise to the perception that the left is ""anti free speech,"" a statement which is becoming harder to refute. "
Citrus,"Years ago, I performed with my band and forgot to remove the capo from my guitar's neck, so I started playing in the wrong key. I didn't realize, the rest of the band didn't know, and when they joined in, it was the most godawful din ever. I just about died on that stage. I still sometimes cringe about it.

Since watching episode 9 of *Bill Nye Saves the World*, however, I'm good. I mean, I suffered just 20 seconds of acute embarrassment. Nye has now secreted hour after painful hour of unwatchable vapidity that's been watched and spat out by (possibly) millions. I don't understand how he hasn't already died from hot burning embarrassment."

Citrus,"That's because the only reason it exists is to push an agenda, not like the olden days"
Citrus,"When he had the panel and he mentioned one of the guys was a Thorium expert, I was sure they would begin talking about Thorium-based reactors, the potential for them, and how safer they are.

Nope."
Citrus,"As an engineer, he should be goddamn ashamed for shitting on nuclear power, as it *has* to be the future if we want to continually grow as a species."
Citrus,"Numberphile, Sixty Symbols, Veritasium, periodic videos, mathologer, vsauce are some examples of very good science channels on youtube. Some videos just make you want to Google a topic and learn more. There are more and maybe better than the ones i listed."
Citrus,"*In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side.*

This is everything these days.  Its John Oliver and Samantha Bee.  Telling people what to think isn't enough - you have to belittle people you disagree with.  

Only slightly different from the Fox News style of telling people what to think then spitting humorless insults at the other side."
Citrus,Bill Nye had become a media whore (tell me that whole dancing with the stars thing was not some cry for attention...)
Citrus,"I think Bill Nye the science guy was 99% writers and 1% bill. As an adult, Bill seems to always come off as a pompous ass to me. "
Citrus,"He mixes fact and opinion, always a problematic combination on a science show. He showed hypocrisy with Nuclear Power and GMO's (the ""nobody wants it"" argument could equally apply to both).

Also, most of the actual ""science"" was something you'd expect a 10 year old to know. Ridiculously dumbed down, I didn't learn anything interesting or new.

"
Citrus,">In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side.

I really noticed this when I watched him debate Ken Ham on creationism.  I was really excited because I thought it would be more of a friendly discussion and maybe they would even find areas where they had common ground and look for ways that both camps can coexist.  Nope.  He basically just ridiculed him the whole time.  Really made me see him in a new light."
Citrus,"Proper nutrition ( fiber, citrus, etc ) isn't alternative medicine.   "
Citrus,I got like 15 mins in and turned it off. It was unbearably condescending and totally unscientific. Op is right in saying it's basically just a big payed for sham to tell people what opinions they should have without actually presenting any valid arguments to support them. Watching it literally felt no different than watching a salesman try and sell me something I don't want or need. It just put zero effort into being entertaining or educational.
Citrus,"It's like it tried to pander to the crowd that ""loves science"" but are no more involved in it than reading the headlines of articles posted on the I fucking love science Facebook page. But it completely dropped the ball and squandered an opportunity to show those people that science is much more in depth and intricate and to really get them engaged with science. It tried to pander, but it just came off as patronizing, and his forced ""cool"" dialog makes it all unwatchable. "

Citrus,Captain dissilution on YouTube is pretty great.
Citrus,Its wierd coming on reddit and not seeing people wanting to suck off Bill.  I like it.
Citrus,"The guy has a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and he took an astronomy elective one time in college. His show was scripted and he had to create organizations to put himself on top of just to build his ""science"" image. The guys is as much a scientist as my stoner roommate who still managed to get his BS. The fact that anybody ever listened to him as a credible source says a lot about how ignorant our country actually is."
Citrus,"""tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side.""

This describes most of the political and news forums/threads on reddit"
Citrus,"I'm honestly dumbfounded how Bill says climate change is the biggest issues while he shot down Nuclear Energy, one of the least greenhouse gas producing sources of power. I used to just love Bill Nye, but now he seems like a heavily opinionated person like the people he makes fun of. It really pains me to talk bad about him."
Citrus,">I just don't see the point of this show.

Bill Nye has (had) your trust as your childhood science guy (aka a guardian of the house of knowledge).  I guess they thought you would introduce your kids to Bill Nye and let them blindly watch it before they get to the episodes like ""my sex junk"".  
"
Citrus,"I feel like tumblr produce the show, especially the sex episode "
Citrus,"I lost all respect for Bill Nye when he made a youtube video ""explaining"" deflategate. He couldn't even grasp the concept of the Ideal Gs Law and belied his credentials as a scientist. He's not a scientist nor has he ever been one."
Citrus,Am I alone in always hating Bill Nye? 
Citrus,"I kinda feel like we deserve an apology for this show. I mean, its not bad, it's *really* bad."
Citrus,Is your sex junk so oh oh oh?
Citrus,">In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because ""nobody wants it.""

To be fair that is a big issue. Nuclear power is safe but as long as people are stupid and assume it's like a nuclear weapon or that they're all as dangerous as Chernobyl nuclear power will never get anywhere. But if Bill didn't bother trying to educate people about it then he's part of the problem."
Citrus,If you dismiss nuclear power without investigating thorium molten salt reactors then I have no faith in your argument.
Citrus,"I agree that the show is not very good.  Everyone he has on there just seems pretentious and is not very good at actually exploring the issues or gaining knowledge.  He lost me when he had the guy from Monsanto on there and did not raise a single question about the issues people have brought up with that company.  All politics and personal opinions aside, if he was any kind of decent fact finder he would at the very least had a couple questions for the guy about the many issues people have had with that company but instead he allowed him to just get out some good PR and left it at that.  I turned it off after that one."
Citrus,Haven't you ever wondered why he's Bill Nye the science guy and not Bill Nye the scientist? 
Citrus,"Agreed. Every time I see Bill Nye I think of him less as a friendly scientist and more like a self-righteous celebrity-chaser who is trying to turn his limited fame as a children's show host into something bigger and more political. Watch the youtube clip of he and tucker carlson debating. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5L2q6hfWo
"
Citrus,">
He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time.

While I agree with most of your points, I'd like to point out that just because something has been used for a long time doesn't mean it works, especially since 90% of medical science before the 20th century was horseshit.

Citrus,"Finally everyone is realizing how bullshit ""New Atheism"" and Tysonesque pop science is. Nothing they are doing is science. It's just moral activism veiled by pretentious scientific language. NDT, Bill Nye, Richard Dawkins, and similar figures don't want people to critically consider issues in a scientific way; they merely want you to trust them by virtue of their elitist status in society. It's literally the same thing as a religion. "
Citrus,I loved bill nye as a kid. Now I can't stand him because he turned into a lunatic/political puppet.
Citrus,At least you didn't make it to the gender episode 
Citrus,"As a Unmerican, who had never heard of Bill Nye until the last couple of years, I've never understood Reddit's blind adoration of him - he just comes across as arrogant, smug, opinionated, dismissive and patronising.

I think that so many people here were blinded by nostalgia, and still wanted to see the Bill Nye from their childhood - Bill Nye the fictional character.

I think what you might be seeing now is just Bill Nye the person.

Edit: For clarity, I have only ever seen him outside of his shows - videos with fans, interviews on other shows, etc.  I haven't seen this show either."
Citrus,"He always sucked, you were just too young to know better. "
Citrus,"If you'll pardon the sports metaphor, Bill Nye plays for the name on the back of the jersey, not the logo on the front. He's another case of cult of personality gone over a bluff. I was done with him back when he thought it would be a good idea to have that ""debate"" about creationism in a kangaroo court setting with that braindead evangelist. I swear, pop atheists are more obsessed with God than that guy who is ""over"" his ex girlfriend, and loudly reminds you that he's over her every five minutes. I get that the argument for Nye is that he's just a celebrity who is promoting scientific thought, and not a working scientist, but if that's the metric we're working with, I've always been way more of a Beakman or James Burke guy.

Citrus,"Bill Nye is not a scientist, but he is definitely an asshole."
Citrus,"I wish this were an issue limited to the Bill Nye, but it isn't. Bill Nye is simply the living embodiment of the current, highly-politicized state of science. As more and more of our culture is dictated by science, it's become more and more self-serving, authoritarian, and ultimately, corrupt.

Just like politics."
Citrus,His views on nuclear energy alone were enough for me to dismiss him as a serious critical thinker on scientific issues.
Citrus,"His comments on nuclear irked me. The San Onofre plant in southern CA that is being decommissioned provided 10 GW of power **per generator**. The entire country's solar power as of the end of 2016 produces about 40 GW of power. Not only that but solar can't provide peak power -- you need hydro, nuclear, or fossil fuel plants to provide the variable power demands of the grid (unless improvements in solar energy storage are made, which is expensive). It just sucks that no modern plants are being built, they would be light years ahead of the ones currently in operation built in the 70s.

I watched a few episodes. What a boring ass show. And preposterous, too. ""Bill Nye is gonna save the world!"" The only thing this show is saving me from is from actually watching it entirely. The irony."
Citrus,"I mean, we all created this. Propping Bill Nye up as this infallible demigod for all the years, made enough of an impression on someone with money that they thought it'd be a good idea to give him a show again."
Citrus,"I found myself enjoying the show but just cringing a bit at his slightly too try-hard attempts to be cool.  Until the gender identity episode - it's not even a science topic (it's sociology), and the whole episode was him droning on and on about his one side viewpoint on something without even offering any scientific​ discussion on the topic (again, because it's sociology). I then rewatched some of his previous episodes and realized I was completely biased, had I disagreed with him there was nothing he offered in the episodes that would change my mind.  It was like getting a lecture from my Dad about how I should feel about something instead of a rational examination of why things are, how they got that way, why we should try and change them."
Citrus,I just want to take this moment and remind everyone- his contribution to the nasa rover was::: a Sun dial

Going into andor i have no expectation at all, so maybe a good surprise ?"

>""I remember living every day as if it was the last,"" the actor says of filming Rogue One. ""I mean, I never thought of being part of this universe at all. I was just a fan, and one day I got a call. I thought it was going to be a one-time thing in my life, and I shared it with my kids, and I saw it. I was ready to move on. And then I was invited to \[return for the show\], and it made complete sense. I had so much more to say and do with this role. I just wanted to explore many things that I thought about while I was shooting that a film would never allow you to explore.""


>""Even though it's called Andor, it's about a revolution. It's an ensemble. It's about a group of people. It's about community. You'll have the chance to meet many characters you don't know and visit places you don't know existed in this galaxy.""

S1 premieres August 31"
Earth to Luna!,Man excited about new job opportunity.
Earth to Luna!,"""Generic statement about part I played once."""
Earth to Luna!,I mean that’s kinda what happens when you’re in a movie that gives almost nothing to its characters. It’s one of my least favorite parts about Rogue One. Certainly my least favorite of the newer films.
Earth to Luna!,"I asked my friend who his favorite character in Rogue One was.  He said Poe Dameron.  I told him that character wasn't in that movie, and that he was just proving my point that none of the characters in the movie were memorable in the slightest."
Earth to Luna!,Said by every actor getting a nice fat cheque
Earth to Luna!,Felix!
Earth to Luna!,Farfetched but big hope (due to Diego Luna's outspoken obsession) that Cassian runs into Jabba on Nar Shaddaa or something.
Earth to Luna!,Nobody asked for this…his character didn’t need a solo series. He wasn’t important lol
Earth to Luna!,"Star Wars really needs to cool it with prequels. When we already know where is character ends up (especially because we know he's still kind of a scumbag at the beginning of Rogue One), it severely limits the character development that can happen.

The best Star Wars anything in the past 20 years was The Mandalorian because he had no set future, the opportunities were endless.

Personally, I loves that Rogue One killed off their entire main cast, because it forced it to be a one-off story, and I don't think this show will do well."
Earth to Luna!,There’s no bigger plot armor then knowing the exact fate of your main character because we’ve seen it.  Any scene involving danger will have zero suspense
Earth to Luna!,I bet it’s going to take place before Rogue One. Then he’s going to leave mid season to have the movie events happen. Then he dies as a martyr for Andor. Making the second half of the season post Rogue One for a new main character.
Earth to Luna!,"this sounds like it will be shit.  Andor in the movie talked about all the horrible stuff he had to do for the rebellion.  now with a prequel they have to show it.  problem is, its disney+ and all their shows are half-baked and averse to displaying unsavory things.  so it will be him walking around talking to people and performing a few misdemeanors"
Earth to Luna!,"I love Rogue One and I liked Diego in it a lot, but I don’t feel like I need anything more from Andor. 

I’ll watch it at some point, but I’m feeling zero hype for now."
Earth to Luna!,Watto spinoff when?
Earth to Luna!,The character was flat and forgettable. There's nothing there to hang a hat on.
Earth to Luna!,Another pointless story like Obi Wan with 0 stakes as you know how the story will end.
Earth to Luna!,"Honestly I'd rather watch a Star Wars spy show about some new characters that Andor might pop up as a side character in. Perhaps it might be post Episode 3 leading into Episode 7 events. It gives you real stakes since it's not a prequel series for the characters and you can do more with it.

This show has to get Andor to Rogue One and therefore there is far less tension since he's safe."
Earth to Luna!,“Yes I want to act my way into a dead end” as so many Star Wars characters are saying these days
Earth to Luna!,"He went on, "">!so many more friends to kill!<""."
Earth to Luna!,He is a gorgeous man.
Earth to Luna!,Isn’t his character dead
Earth to Luna!,I hope he will get to touch Jabba’s belly this time
Earth to Luna!,"Did you, Diego? Your character started as a murderer and ended partially redeemed but not really."
Earth to Luna!,This is going to blow.
Earth to Luna!,"No, you didn't"
Earth to Luna!,Is anyone excited for this? I felt that way about Fraiser tho back in the 90s and was proven wrong so hopefully that happens again but I doubt it..
Earth to Luna!,"This show is so unnecessary.

Spoiler alert, he dies."
Earth to Luna!,There’s an entire universe out there! Do something new!
Earth to Luna!,"Rogue one was, for me, my favorite Star Wars film. Add in a spy thriller narrative and I am all in."
Earth to Luna!,"I find it strange when actors say things like this. He didn’t write the character, so technically he (Diego) isn’t providing anything to the character other than what was written for him."
Earth to Luna!,"I wasn’t particularly excited about Andor, but all the behind the scenes stuff that has come out now has bumped this up to one of my most anticipated new shows. Does anyone else feel the same?"
Earth to Luna!,Holy shit can we get any articles about returning to roles without people making the same “it’s about money” joke every single time. It’s as bad as the “looks like *insert actor name*” when they release the first stills.
Earth to Luna!,I can’t imagine a single thing this show could be about.
Earth to Luna!,I trust this show to be better than Kenobi based solely on the fact Diego Luna rarely does turds.
Earth to Luna!,Read “I like money”
Earth to Luna!,Give us Kyle Katarn back not the Great Value version.
Earth to Luna!,"What the hell does that even mean? Unless he is the one writing the episodes, it really means nothing."
Earth to Luna!,"""I was allowed to act for this role"" - actor"
Earth to Luna!,Can’t wait for this
Earth to Luna!,“I have so much more money to make with this forgettable character.”
Earth to Luna!,Whatever he does it all ends in a shitty pointless cash grab called Rogue One
Earth to Luna!,Time will tell. If KK combed here grimey hands through production we’ll get another mediocre series following BOBF and Obi Wan.
Earth to Luna!,Name three things.
Earth to Luna!,It's the money.
Earth to Luna!,"Stop revisiting characters you’ve already used!!

There’s a whole universe of things to explore, but they keep rehashing the same shit. No more Obi Wan. No more Anakin. No more Leia.

Tell some original stories!"
Earth to Luna!,Yea.  The lines that were written into the script
Earth to Luna!,"Here's the thing, I'm pretty excited to see more inner workings of the rebellion in the tumultuous period before the death stats, how they worked with political capital among sympathizing systems and the lengths they had to go to to resist autocracy. 

What I'm not excited about is Andor himself. The single most important character development happened in Rogue One. Nothing interesting can happen to his character in this show without breaking his moment in Rogue One. And judging from the track record D+ has on honoring characters, I doubt anything good will come out of it. 

They can't even resist fucking up characters they themselves created."
Earth to Luna!,"Disney *really* needs to move on from anything that is even tangentially connected to the Skywalker saga, and this is coming from someone who actually liked the Kenobi show.  

Prequels aren't necessarily a bad thing just because you know the outcome of the story already (see Better Call Saul), but that's all they can do with the Skywalker stuff now, and it's getting old.  It's time for new characters, new planets and new conflicts.  Something like an anthology series would be a great place to explore some of that stuff, get their feet wet and see how the audience reacts to something new."
Earth to Luna!,Well that makes... one person.
Earth to Luna!,Say hello to my little friend.
Earth to Luna!,Did people actually like his character? Doubt I'll watch this unless the reviews are very good.
Earth to Luna!,Rogue One is the only good movie out of all the new ones. Love it
Earth to Luna!,This show is gonna have the same stakes as Kenobi. No real consequences to the main character and the side characters are going to be the interesting ones.
Earth to Luna!,"What else is he gonna say?

""I didn't really want to do it, but money talks"""
Earth to Luna!,"Just once I wish an actor would be like “well they offered me a ton of money so why not?” It’s a job, not every actor in every fandom needs to be a super fan lol."
Earth to Luna!,Really? Like what?
Earth to Luna!,The trailer looks good but I have a hard time imagining what the trajectory of his character is going to be? Is this the story of him transforming from a naïve new rebel into the hardened cynic we see at the start of Rogue One? That honestly sounds pretty bleak.
Earth to Luna!,"Between this and House of the Dragon, it’s a good time to be alive."
Earth to Luna!,His name is cute
Earth to Luna!,ya bsg
Earth to Luna!,"""I had so much more money to make from this role."""
Earth to Luna!,OG’s remember Diego Luna from the Book of Life lol

Earth to Luna!,"“More to say and do” 

After this many Disney plus shows, does anyone believe this anymore? They’re all clearly just cash vows for the teams involved. Nothing new or fresh introduced m, more of the same bland content."
Earth to Luna!,Star Wars has zero momentum.
Earth to Luna!,No you didn’t you fucking chancer
Earth to Luna!,"My god reddit can be so annoying sometimes, this entire thread is repeating the same fucking joke."
Earth to Luna!,"The trailer for this show actually piqued my interest more than any other D+ show trailer so far, it looks much more gritty and interesting than the usual Star Wars fare, and not in a cheap way either. Fingers crossed this one breaks the streak of meh that D+ has been stuck in for a while."
Earth to Luna!,"Surviving a direct hit from a Death Star laser would be a canny trick, even by Star Wars standards."
Earth to Luna!,Secrets only the Rebellion knew!
Earth to Luna!,"This would be nice tho, I wish I could see him and Felicity do this roles together more. They shouldn’t kill him off and just you know, let him do job outside of main saga action. It worked with Ashoka."
Earth to Luna!,Zero. Since we know when it’s set.
Earth to Luna!,No one’s ever really gone
Earth to Luna!,The dead speak!
Earth to Luna!,"""But Diego, please! There is much more for the character to say and do!""

""No, I don't care what you offer. I, a working actor, consider this character's contribution to the story finished"""
Earth to Luna!,"Gotta remember folks, once you take money for a role you’re NEVER allowed to hold an artistic or personal connection to it.

Never. 

Reddit says so."
Earth to Luna!,"""And it's about family."""
Earth to Luna!,I went into *Rogue One* with no expectations except that Donnie was gonna have at least one scene of whoopin stormtrooper ass Zatoichi-style.  I was pleasantly surprised with that film!
Earth to Luna!,">Going into andor i have no expectation at all, so maybe a good surprise ?

I mean it worked for Rogue One. Came in under the radar and ended up in contention as the best Star Wars movie. And certainly the best outside of the original trilogy, the Holiday special, and Revenge of the Sith for putting and end to the ""new"" trilogy."
Earth to Luna!,"Been burned by D+ too many times to be confident, but 

Tony Gilroy has great chops as a political thriller writer/director, and

this is mostly disconnected from the Skywalker Saga stuff, which gives it less fan service baggage and hopefully makes it good

so, despite it all, i’m hopeful"
Earth to Luna!,"That's the best way to go in with every type of media, with zero expectations. Things became so much more enjoyable.

There is lots to say about star wars, I'm just enjoying the ride and the content. Can't all be good but they all have good things within them."
Earth to Luna!,"What gave you high expectations for Kenobi?

EDIT: Downvote me all you want. It’s a genuine question."
Earth to Luna!,"I usually keep my expectations low, but I’m actually hype for andor. Kenobi had multiple red flags (it being delayed and reworked so many times, rando writer who knew nothing about Star Wars). Andor though seems to have all the makings of a great SW show."
Earth to Luna!,I don't know if this is true but Kenobi felt geared towards fans who really liked the prequels. As someone who didn't that kind of hampered my overall enjoyment of it.
Earth to Luna!,Stellan Skarsgård is in it so my hopes are already too high. Can't help it.
Earth to Luna!,"I dunno man, I had a fairly low expectations for Kenobi after the disaster that was Boba Fett and I still ended up disappointed."
Earth to Luna!,"Kenobi was dire
By far the worst of the 3 shows so far.

I'd like to see a Gungan/sopranos mash up. it shows Jar Jar struggling to deal with his role in the rise of Darth Vader so he seeks therapy. Meanwhile he has to balance his family with the demands of his role as enforcer in that unwater city he lives in.

More Jar Jar"
Earth to Luna!,What was wrong with Kenobi? I quite liked it. I thought third sister actress was great.
Earth to Luna!,Ah really? I loved Kenobi.
Earth to Luna!,Kenobi stuck the landing imo.  Ending was quality
Earth to Luna!,"I think since Disney purchased SW it’s important to go into all of that with ZERO expectation.

I went into Mando season 2 with such high hopes.

Same with Book of Boba.

Both let me down immensely, have zero expectations and you’ll be surprised by what you see.

I went into Obi Wan with zero expectations, even knowing Hayden was back and he was in the suit.

Obi Wan is probably my favorite Disney SW project by far.
It’s as close to the Skywalker story without feeling like fan fiction (rogue one, sequel trilogy)

By no means is Obi Wan perfect, and that’s fine.

Neither were the prequels. 

That’s probably why I love it so much. 

It meshes so well with that cringe pre OT universe George created."
Earth to Luna!,"I went in with low expectations for kenobi based off of the screenwriter of the show that was announced months in advance

I seriously do not understand why people do not look at the writers to determine the quality of a show in advance…"
Earth to Luna!,I had low expectations and I was infuriated by Kenobi.
Earth to Luna!,"It has 12 episodes? I’m actually more interested knowing that, plenty of room to develop everything. A lot of the Marvel shows suffer from rushing through 6 episodes to get everything in."
Earth to Luna!,"> ""Behind everyone that has brought change, there's a story, there's a reason. And I just love that now we have 12 episodes to tell you that story.""

This captures what I hate about Disney's approach to Star Wars. Not everything needs to have a back story,  a character can have a role in another story and be done with it. And every single time they have tried this it has been dissapointing"
Earth to Luna!,Surprised that leading role gave him more to work
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,">Netflix and David Letterman’s production company edited out comments by Kanye “Ye” West that referenced Nazis and blamed Rihanna for her own domestic abuse during a 2019 interview with the comedian for his talk show.

>Audience members Noah Reich and David Maldonado of Los Angeles told TheWrap they were sitting in the center front row of a local theater in January 2019 when West repeated right-wing conspiracy theories, observed that liberals treated anyone wearing a red, pro-Trump cap “like they were Nazis” and noted that Rihanna, a former victim of domestic abuse, must have done something to deserve what happened to her.

>Other Ye comments that were edited out included a rant about how an unnamed music executive friend – whom Reich and Maldonado suspected was R. Kelly – got “MeToo-ed” and how West himself could be “MeToo-ed,” they said. The rapper also repeatedly referenced a Hollywood power structure that he suggested was behind the #MeToo movement, which Reich said struck him as a reference to Jewish people."

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"I stopped watching this show when I got part way through this episode. There were plenty of things about the show that bugged me before this, and the guest names listed in the succeeding episodes were far from interesting and/or problematic, but it was mainly this fucking guy’s weird answers and Letterman’s apparent complete lack of interest in interrogating him further on his bizarre takes that made me stop. I wish that had showed up in Netflix’s algorithm so they’d cancelled the show sooner, but I suspect a lot of people did finish the episode, and watch all the other weird guests too."

For people here who aren't Jewish or interact a lot with Jewish people, this comment may seem weird. It doesn't to us. 

Anti-Jewish bigots regularly veil their bigotry into dogwhistles for the express purpose of being able to hide it in case they get called out. Very few of these bigots go full Kanye or do a Mel Gibson style drunken rant. Even Kanye didn't until he did. 

It's always ""you know who"" and ""those people in charge"" and ""can't upset *them*"". Or, the new favourite, simply replacing the word ""Jew"" with ""Zionist"", such that ""the Zionists own the banks"" and ""the Zionists control America"".

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,I don't think they're contractually allowed to do that. At least not without paying him which kinda defeats the point.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,He dropped the kan
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Then they shouldn’t act like it
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Chris Brown brutally beat her.   Few people bring it up though, and other than a bit of finger wagging at the time there have been few consequences for Chris Brown.  As always, after a short time, people projected that he must be sorry, he must have changed, he must not have been his true self at the time.., all the usual kinds of BS that commonly arises when the masses and media decide they want to entertain themselves with a redemption story.  Doesn't even require the offered to have actually changed or to have any remorse.  We just decide it's time and then we start to re-worship them again.

I'm cringing because it's just a matter of time until most people are seeing Klanye warmly because he makes one compliant comment or his PR team sends out one fake apology.  

Noted kook Will Smith sucker punched someone for no reason mere months ago, and he's already back being exalted and people falsely claiming he's learned his lesson."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"The claim is also that aparently, it is a conspiracy theory that people who wore maga hats were called nazis...

Check this thread.. He literally said something that can be witnessed in this thread..

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"The TMZ bit and edited content is equally concerning:

>This is not the first time that controversial comments made by Ye were cut out of televised interviews. Ye praised Hitler and Nazis during a TMZ live taping in 2018 in which the rapper and fashion designer infamously said that “slavery is a choice,” according to recent reports. Former TMZ staffer Van Lathan said in a recent Higher Learning podcast episode that West said something like “I love Hitler. I love Nazis” but that those comments were not included in the final cut for reasons that were unknown to him. TMZ did not respond to a request to explain the edit.

On the podcast they reflected on how the slavery comments attacking Black people/community was left in, but the pro-nazi adolf hitler fan-boy comments were edited out."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau a few years ago, and was struck how a lot of the rhetoric seemed to read as if it was almost attempting to convince visitors that the Holocaust actually happened. Being that I had learned about this horrible event in public school (in the US) since I was barely ten years old, and was under the impression that it was the most well-documented genocide in history; I really didn't think that there was a significant amount of people who doubted its occurrence. However, after my visit (which was haunting in a way that words can't describe), I did some research into Holocaust denial, and found that it was FAR more prevalent than I thought (I think the number I saw was 50% of the global population believes that the Holocaust was either overstated, or never occurred at all) and that, under every crazy conspiracy theory, the shadowy ""they"", was literally almost always Jewish people. As someone who enjoyed a fun conspiracy theory or two before the internet made them into malignant disinformation, it really made me sad that the core of these stories was basically just flagrant antisemitism."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"I try to be aware of this stuff, but I'm feeling so stupid right now because I tend to hear references to ""the people who are really in charge"" and ""them"" as either more generalized right-wing insanity or as a reference to the ultra-rich, depending on [my assumptions about] who's talking.  I've probably missed so much pure anti-Semitic bullshit by mistaking it for something more broad."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Kind of weird when the main guy of metoo was weinstein. And later epstein. R Kelly didnt get much attention comparatively.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Any recommendations you can make about where to learn about how to handle the stupidity that will inevitably come if you call out these bigots? 

I can’t begin to describe the stupid arguments that are made, but I know that there are many that seek to explain all the reasons why Jewish people are somehow in control of everything. Is there maybe a website that lists & corrects common misconceptions?"

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"As a mostly non-practicing globalist, I fully agree. Dogwhistles abound on Reddit too, and not just in conspiracy-minded subs."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Will always stamp out bigotry in public. People are more self righteous in their hateful ideals now more than ever. Deserving of an equally strong response.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"""Globalism"" being a big one.

 ""Liberals"" means the same thing almost now, just ""the enemy"", to the far right and far left, the people responsible for all your woes."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Honestly, just the phrase ""Hollywood power structure"" is enough of a dog whistle to get it's point across."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Well put.

Also, when they pull “it’s just a joke bro” make sure to call them out on that too."

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee


I don't think there is some sort of jewish cabal influencing usa politics but there is so obviously an israelian/zionist one that's it funny to pretend anything otherwise.

And no I don't think jews control banks or media or whatever. They're overrepresented but that's not a bad thing apart from nepotism."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"theres a difference between zionists and jews. maybe not in the context of your example where the blame is being shifted from capitalists to Jewish people, but there is certainly a difference. zionists are colonizing and actively murdering Palestinians. condemning zionists and apply meaningful methods to curb their ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in this way is not anti semitism and cannot be allowed to be construed in such a way."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"The problem with immediately thinking someone using the term “Zionist” is a nazi might be a bit of a reach. 

Zionists are a genuine group of non-Jewish individuals, mostly Protestant Christians, who believe that the end times can only happen if certain conditions are met for isreal. They’re crazy."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"They also use ""globalists"" and ""bankers"". It always comes down to Jews. They could never imagined a minority could succeed without some nefarious clandestine conspiracy."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"I respect the hell out of Jewish people, but that doesn't negate the fact that there are Zionist Jews. That said, these antisemitic assholes never call out Zionist Christians for their weird apocalyptic beliefs either.

Edit:

My apologies: I seem to have misunderstood what Zionist means. My stance is that I have issues with how the Israeli government handles their occupation of Palestinian territory, and Palestinian rights within the Israeli state. Israel can do a lot better Benjamin Netenyahu and his regime. But I digress, I apologize if my ignorance of the definition of the term offended anyone, especially anyone of Jewish heritage. I personally haven't met a single one of y'all that I didn't have love for."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Zionists do commit atrocities against Palestinians and beyond. Nice try trying to equate Jew with Zionists.

There are many Jews against Zionism. And there’s literally a Zionist lobby that pressures companies. Literally leaked emails and you can look them up. 

Gtfo with your censoring and eff Israel!"
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,The fact that Kanye is really really worried about getting “Me Too-Ed” makes me wonder what Kanye has done to make him so worried.
Somebody Feed Phil,"I have honestly never heard of this show, and its on season 7!"
Somebody Feed Phil,"I liked the episode where he was going to have sushi with Larry David, but backed out because Larry was wearing a MAGA hat."
Somebody Feed Phil,"There is a lot of criticism in this thread. I'll say it's a very pleasant show to watch with your significant other at the end of a long day. You feel like you're going on a nice little vacation with a super-positive person who just wants you to have a good time. Is it Bourdain? No, and I for one am happy it doesn't try to be. Let the man have this amazing chapter of his life and bring his family and us along for the ride. There isn't one episode where I feel he ever wasted my time."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Anyone who's watched ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" has watched Phil before. He created the show and was a writer for it. It's loosely based on his family. 

His Mom and Dad are often the funniest part of the show, sadly they've both passed. Yeah he's a little much sometimes, but if I ever ran into him, I'd love to talk with him."
Somebody Feed Phil,"This thread breaks my heart! I can't believe so many of you don't like Phil. For a talented multimillionaire, he seems pretty normal to me. Plus, he calls his parents every week, which is the sign of a good person in my book."
Somebody Feed Phil,"In these troubled times, this show is a welcome ray of light. Just found Phil man kind of man, the way he treat everyone the way he wants to be treated is a lost art."
Somebody Feed Phil,How is this on 7 seasons and I've never even heard of it?
Somebody Feed Phil,"Once I got passedbthe quirky expressions he makes, I learned how to appreciate his warmth and style. Plus I live overseas and I miss genuine New Yorkers- reminds me of my old neighborhood in Ridgewood, Queens."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Love this guy. Went to quite a bit of places he went to in Chiang Mai, Thailand for Khao Soi and also his stops in New Orleans and Portland, OR"
Somebody Feed Phil,"Phil is great, I love his show, it encourages me to travel, but I definitely get upset that my travels don’t involve so many personal tours and meals."
Somebody Feed Phil,Nice!
Somebody Feed Phil,Don’t Feed Phil was better
Somebody Feed Phil,my indian parents kinda love this show. so I l can't hate on it
Somebody Feed Phil,I’m fine with the show but he needs to stop that huge every smile after taking one bite of something
Somebody Feed Phil,Is it a Netflix original? Season 7 must be a record for Netflix
Somebody Feed Phil,"I had to go on a crash diet last year to get my blood pressure down to a sane number, and I've been avoiding travel shows because they always have tons of food I would desperately prefer to salad. Have the recent episodes held up?"
Somebody Feed Phil,"I wish it were more authentic. You don't learn anything about the regional culture or inspirations. IMHO, such a transparent plug for whoever kisses @ss best, whoever has the most persistent pr person, and or wherever Phil wants a free meal."
Somebody Feed Phil,Such a great guy and show!
Somebody Feed Phil,Not sure how it’s made it 7 seasons. I had to turn it off after like 20 minutes.
Somebody Feed Phil,[deleted]
Somebody Feed Phil,This guy made our restaurant so busy but he’s so cocking annoying I just don’t get it.
Somebody Feed Phil,This is the first I've heard of it. I'm assuming it's not about Bam Margera's dad?
Somebody Feed Phil,You know the travel/food documentary space is saturated when the creator of Everybody Loves Raymond has his own show.
Somebody Feed Phil,Cheap reality program renewed for seven seasons. Meanwhile interesting stuff gets canceled.
Somebody Feed Phil,"I started watching it this year. It’s a fun little binge. He’s a warm hearted weirdo, easy to watch. I like a lot of the food he picks out, it’s food that makes a city famous and food the locals love. Plus a handful of mild celebrities pop up, plenty of chefs, as some history along the way."
Somebody Feed Phil,"It's a good background/diversion show if you're into the ""guy goes all over the world and eats awesome food"" shtick.

Phil himself is kind of annoying IMO, but it works for the show.  He has this totally unabashed enthusiasm and joy for good food so the people who cook for him seem to really get a kick out of it."
Somebody Feed Phil,It's the alternate universe version of Bourdain's shows where the host is wholesome
Somebody Feed Phil,"This is the only thing my parents ever watch, over and over again. They “don’t have enough time” to watch dozens of shows I’ve recommended over the years but will kill every entire evening watching this."
Somebody Feed Phil,The Netflix way.
Somebody Feed Phil,He’s got some golden retriever energy and once you accept Phil is a bundle of positivity it makes it so much easier to view his quirks.
Somebody Feed Phil,"Maybe I should give it another try.

I'm not here to dump on the guy, but I did try watching it once years ago, and found him pretty annoying. And at the time I think I was not a fan of how it was structured? But I might be misremembering that.

In theory I'm the target audience. I like food shows. Competition, travel, documentary, instructional, comedy. But for whatever the reasons were, I dropped this one very quickly.

It lasting this long makes me think that maybe I missed something? Or maybe people are tuning in for different reasons than motivate me. If the draw is just ""hanging out with friendly Phil"", it may just not be made for me."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Dunno man, I felt the Oaxaca episode was pretty meh.  It just didn’t seem like he liked being there and they ate the same tacos made by different people like 3 times.  That one was a yawner imho."
Somebody Feed Phil,I'd try the big goodbye. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b541nIfnjqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b541nIfnjqk)
Somebody Feed Phil,"Unfortunately, both his parents have passed away, so he no longer call them.  He calls celebrity friends at the end of each episode instead now."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Phil can be a little much for some people.  On one end of the spectrum is Phil, the other end is Larry David."
Somebody Feed Phil,"I didn't like it at first, but was too lazy to change it. Phil is just who he is, which is refreshing actually. That is Phil and believe me, they feed him."
Somebody Feed Phil,"I don’t think anyone here dislikes him at all. It’s just that his energy isn’t for everyone.

While I appreciate positivity, I also don’t trust someone that likes *everything*.  Nobody likes everyone they meet, everywhere they go, or everything they eat.  So I find it hard to be interested in a show where he likes everything because I feel like I don’t learn anything.

That was really the genius of Bourdain.  You felt like you were a little wiser or a little more experienced with the world because some stuff was awesome and some stuff sucked, and sometimes the people sucked, but there was always some beauty or redeeming quality to it.

Phil, to me, doesn’t have any of that depth, and it also isn’t particularly funny.  It is wholesome and amusing and a good guy on a good show, but kind of milquetoast in the genre to a lot of people."
Somebody Feed Phil,"I know! It's a little sad that so many complaints boil down to ""he's too nice."" Like yeah, that's his vibe. It's a good thing for people to be nice!!"
Somebody Feed Phil,Because you're likely not its target audience.
Somebody Feed Phil,If you’ve watched any food shows on Netflix then they likely would have been showing up on your recommendations. If you haven’t then they probably don’t think you’d be interested in it
Somebody Feed Phil,Dammit Bam
Somebody Feed Phil,Agreed. I tried to watch the Vietnam ep and he starts off by saying he has to go to the one person he trusts on Viet food - another white dude.
Somebody Feed Phil,Can’t stand him. But I know lots of people who love him. To me he is just so off putting and uncomfortable in how he acts.
Somebody Feed Phil,"Same, he’s obnoxious"
Somebody Feed Phil,"This show has no budget, that's why"
Somebody Feed Phil,"I'm not familiar with this show, so I can't speak to its quality (I tried to watch some of it several years ago and quickly moved on).

But that aside... Of course Netflix is going to renew a dozen shows with tiny budgets before they renew a single show with a huge budget. That's not a cynical take it's just reality. The higher your budget, the better you have to perform. In Netflix HQ they were not deciding between keeping ""Somebody Feed Phil"" and ""1899"".

""1899"" cost over $60 million. ""Somebody Feed Phil"" is 90% Phil's salary and I doubt the guy worth hundreds of millions is asking for all that much to be paid to eat and travel. Not to mention it was a show he ran on PBS originally, then went to pitch to Netflix after it got canceled. I doubt he is asking for much more than a PBS-sized salary. He is basically retired and enjoys this."
Somebody Feed Phil,Have you watched it?
Somebody Feed Phil,I did until I tried some of these places and they were largely not good. So I feel deceived
Somebody Feed Phil,I find him amusing but it's mostly because I know what he's doing isn't an act.  He's legitimately that upbeat all the time so it's just see it as lighthearted
Somebody Feed Phil,"He makes the show for me, I appreciate how genuine he is about everything. Yeah he's a little dorky but I think it's charming."
Somebody Feed Phil,"That’s exactly how I would describe the show! I find him annoying but he’s so nice and that it’s hard to dislike him.

I watch it for the interesting foods and places. I want to travel to quite a few places I’ve seen on this show, and many are places that I’d never have had any interest in before."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Totally agree. I have it on in the background while working on weekends. And I also don’t think I love Phil himself, but I’ve seen every episode"
Somebody Feed Phil,Yea I find him annoying too. Really wish Bourdain was still around. RIP
Somebody Feed Phil,"It might not be. For me the draw is definitely ""nice guy goes around appreciating the world"", plus I get to see beautiful food in 4k. Phil is a cozy show just as much as a travel/food show."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Phil is polarizing but I did find myself gradually warming up to him. Really it’s a light show with pretty scenery and bougie restaurants, with some truly heartwarming moments occasionally (like his love for his Down syndrome afflicted cousin). I’m shocked that Netflix hasn’t stopped making it - while it’s cheaper than many shows, this type of travelogue is only popular on E/I television in the US or travel channel reruns."
Somebody Feed Phil,celebrity friends who tell Jokes for Max (his dad)
Somebody Feed Phil,"At first I didn’t really liked the show, I thought he  was overacting.  But as I continued I realized he’s just a human golden retriever and he is genuinely that happy and excited.  Now it’s my favourite show."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Agree. Absolutely hate it when the “expert” isn’t a local but an ex-pat, and often white/privileged"
Somebody Feed Phil,So it's like The Office?
Somebody Feed Phil,I think the fact that he is a bit unfomfortable how he acts bring a nerv to the show. He pushes people a bit.
Somebody Feed Phil,I’d probably do it for free if it was me. Travel the world and way great food? Yes please!
Somebody Feed Phil,"They’re not wrong.

There’s a lot of other shows we would all rather have.

Even the reasonable comments admit that it’s just a material filler show.

Can we not be so conceited?

Is it really that rage inducing that someone can call out a subpar show that somehow hasn’t been canceled?

Phil even hints multiple times that his brother has connections and that’s the only reason the show took off in the first place.

Otherwise it might never had been.

And Phil is a rich dude, the whole basis of the show is kind of out of touch with the times.

Dudes just traveling around blowing thousands of dollars **so we can watch him eat food we will never be able to afford to travel and eat.**

It’s just another form of wealth showcasing.

How many people do you know who could just go out and do what Phil does as a life hobby?

He’s retired and he’s not even senior yet."
Somebody Feed Phil,"If I had, would that change the fact that this is cheap reality programming? Or that better shows on Netflix have been canceled?"
Somebody Feed Phil,Larry made fun of him on Curb and he played himself so you have to assume he's a good sport and self-aware lol
Somebody Feed Phil,"Right that's what I mean. He's a dude I think I would find extremely annoying in large doses in real life, but it works for his show.

I like the show a lot, have seen every episode and most of them multiple times. It's one of my go-tos when I'm in the gym."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Damn, ok."
Somebody Feed Phil,He was a writer or creator of everybody loves Raymond.
Somebody Feed Phil,Yea. I totally understand how some people enjoy the show. Just personally I cringe in how he acts. To each their own though.
Somebody Feed Phil,"> Phil even hints multiple times that his brother has connections and that’s the only reason the show took off in the first place.

Phil was the executive producer/writer for Everybody Loves Raymond. He has his plenty of his own connections."
Somebody Feed Phil,"It’s not *really* subpar if people enjoy watching it, not everyone shares your opinion about what “we’d all rather have” and some of us like a casual warm show of a guy eating food.

It’s also probably cheap as hell to produce."
Somebody Feed Phil,"It’s not about better or worse, it’s about how many people are watching it. Cheaper shows will get renewed easier because they would need less views for Netflix to consider them as successful."
Somebody Feed Phil,"How do you know what shows are ""better"" than something you've never seen?"
Somebody Feed Phil,"Yeah it's the kind of show I can't binge because Phil gets on my nerves on high doses, but it's perfect to watch an episode here or there because it's just a goofy guy having a blast eating food in different places. 

It's one of those ""comfort watch"" kind of shows"
Somebody Feed Phil,"Dudes got a whole camera crew are you high?

If they are paying livable wages it should be in the ballpark of $200k budget.

At least…….

Equipment, lodging, plane tickets, passports, guides, **FOOD…..**?
Oh yeah and wages?

Can we have Sense8 or Daredevil back?

Show is subpar, to say the least."
Somebody Feed Phil,"I mean, yeah, not saying you can make it with a couple bucks but still like probably 1/10th of the budget for a show like Sense8, which guess what, people didn’t watch and couldn’t justify its budget."
Somebody Feed Phil,"Uh.. so if you google, Sense8 cost $9 million per episode. So if you calculate the cost per view.. yea"
Somebody Feed Phil,Actually 2% the budget if $200k is the accurate number
Somebody Feed Phil,"I think this is the most wholesome show that Netflix has. Phil is not only funny but charming and a sweetheart. This is one of those shows that if I am having a bad day, I'll give it a watch to cheer me up."
Somebody Feed Phil,"A happy hungry man
Is traveling all across the sea and the land"
Somebody Feed Phil,"Me and my girlfriend love this show, a few months ago we’re walking around Santiago in Chile and we see him walking pass and we said hi to him, super nice guy tells us he’s filming right now.

But according to this, Santiago is not among season 5, huge bummer i was looking forward to that.

I guess they were filming S5-6 in one go like that article says"
Somebody Feed Phil,"I think Netflix's food content is, or at least can be, some of their best stuff. I really loved Somebody Feed Phil, Chefs Table, Taco Chronicles, The Final Table, and Ugly Delicious.   
I am cautiously optimistic about the new Iron Chef. I can't be the only person who thinks Netflix should put out more stuff with that level of production value. I know there's lots of talk about people considering cancelling Netflix if they go with commericals. And for me, leaving that type of food content behind is what I'll probably miss most."
Somebody Feed Phil,So much for Don’t Feed Phil day!
Somebody Feed Phil,Super happy to hear this. It’s probably my favorite show on Netflix. Ooo now the theme song is stuck in my head..
Somebody Feed Phil,Best food traveling show by a mile and a half that’s currently airing. Absolutely love how wholesome it is. Renew it for 20 more season.
Somebody Feed Phil,"I thought it was referencing viva LA bams ""don't feed phil"" episode"
Somebody Feed Phil,"Love SFP, that opening song is a straight banger, but...

WHEN AM I GOING TO GET MORE CHEF'S TABLE!!!"
Somebody Feed Phil,Love this show
Somebody Feed Phil,padma lakshmis 'Taste the Nation' was really good. Would love to see Netflix give her a show.
Somebody Feed Phil,"I wonder how it will be since he can’t call his parents :(

If anyone likes this show, I highly recommend Stanley Tucci’s Searching for Italy on CNN. It is wonderful and he is fantastic."
Somebody Feed Phil,I can’t stand this guy.
Somebody Feed Phil,"I dislike this show. It’s like Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations, but without the cool personality, good writing, knowledge of food and culture, description of the food being eaten, etc. 

It’s just some guy that knows nothing, eating."
Somebody Feed Phil,"I hate to sound so negative, but I am an American who has lived his whole life overseas. This type of character makes us Americans look dumb, naive and arrogant. There’s no sense of innocent wonder, it’s more like an entitled bumbling fuckwit who knows nothing about the world, history or geography, happens to be thrown into a food show. I know everyone can throw insults at creative projects in social media, I try to keep positive, but this show is just embarrassing to watch. Reminds me that we are, at the core, an imperialist culture with no respect for people who have less purchasing power than our own."
Somebody Feed Phil,I tell everyone about this show! Seriously one of the shows I had no idea what it was about and couldn't stop watching.
Somebody Feed Phil,I just binged the whole series with my SO not long ago. It was really fun. Glad to see I'll get more! I may watch some of it again after work.
Somebody Feed Phil,I first heard about this show while watching curb and I thought it was just a made up show in the curb tv world. But one day I was just going through Netflix and I see it and couldn’t believe it was real lol.
Somebody Feed Phil,Best news I’ve heard all week. Will be hard to replace his dad’s jokes though.
Somebody Feed Phil,Who asked for this?
Somebody Feed Phil,The world could use more people with his personality!
Somebody Feed Phil,He is so obnoxious
Somebody Feed Phil,Best theme song in the biz
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Man I really hate these types of articles / websites. There is nothing more frustrating when you’re trying to read the article and it just repeats what it just said but in a different way, like man just tell me."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,That was a surprisingly really hard to read article in need of an editor.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Me “Wow what a really good and fun episode of she hulk”

Me 2 minutes later; Oh no oh shit oh fuck"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Remember when she hinted that we might see red Hulk just before this scene?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Had no idea Cody Ziglar was writing for this show
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"So I did a term search for ""revenge"" in this long ass article, there are 3 results, 2 in the title and sub title and 3 is in the intro para. 


Rest of the article is about.... Well anything"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,What? Did this show take a turn in tone?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,You ever read a comment section and wonder who’s the bots? Or are they real people but we think they’re bots because there’s a lot of bots with similar comments on other threads. Who’s upvoting and downvoting? How many of them are bots? How much of the opinions that the tribes in these threads have are formed by their interactions with bots? How much THC was in that gummy? Are fingernails bones???
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,It makes me happy that the series has made the shitty online trolls big bads of the show.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,These comments don't seem real.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"The moment where she looks up into the camera and is finally at a total loss.of words was really powerful. It was such a jarring moment and made me even more glad they included all the fourth wall breaking, just to get to that moment. It was heartbreaking."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"It may be too much to ask for a second season, but I really adore this show. I'm invested in Jen in such a relatable way, unlike almost every other unreasonably heroic Marvel character."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,That article was tedious to get through
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,My partner and I were watching and she instantly said it was too dramatic. I said “huh?” And she explained that in the real world everyone else in the room would be super fucking pissed and not bat an eye at the destroying of tvs and or responsible people.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"My wife is not a marvel fan - she doesn't like superheroes, she doesn't like watching overly male narratives. I'd read the comics of she-hulk and was really excited and I think marvel hit the demo perfectly: my wife *loves* She-Hulk and we watch it on release every week. My only gripe is that it's only half and hour, which feels too short for the credits etc, but for whatever reason comedy is only a half hour.  
  
She-hulk is fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's really true to the comics. It's just women's narratives and that doesn't have to be everyone's cup of tea but I've found it really authentic to a lot of things women experience and say and making it fun in a superhero way."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Those are some brave bad guys. She’s 6’7 and can wrestle the hulk! How dumb do you have to be to mess with her?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Damn, the new episode scored a 7.9 on IMDb even with all the review bombings going on. Been sleeping on the show but might watch it now.

Edit: lol some people seem rather upset that I called the weirdly out of place [mass 1 star ratings](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11261206/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt) ""review bombing"""
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Just wait until the Wong-Madisynn sextape comes out.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,The astroturfing in these comments is crazy.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Yes, she gave her last look to the camera while in pissed off hulk mode after knocking the building around a bit and looked scared at her reaction. My wife and I just thought, you’re good girl, let it out, this is an insane situation and quite messed up, you deserve to be mad."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I like the show. It's fun and light and reminds me of that period of comics round about when Runaways debuted that were pretty much that; fun and light. 

I think a lot of the criticism about the politics of the show are about disagreeing with those politics more than an actual criticism of the show itself."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[deleted]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Even though the 4th wall break alluded to a twist. I did not see that coming. I feel for anyone who has been subjected to this. It must be an awful fucking feeling.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,It’s all Josh’s fault
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Havent seen the verge in a minute wtf is that logo??
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,If you made a sex tape of me and tried to show it to my parents I'd want to launch your ass into space.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Personally, the series hasn’t been super great for me, but that last episodes change in tone really worked. Glad i’m sticking around for a Marvel shows finale this time around."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I don't know how people like this show. It is so beyond cringey. I find myself having to skip past chunks of it because it's so painful to sit through.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,This show it terrible.

Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I'll be honest, I didn't like the show. I haven't watched daredevil either, so I didn't know what to expect. 

I've found most of the show to be terrible and preachy. In fact, even when Matt Murdock came into the picture, it made me angry as to how non-antagonistically Jen viewed Matt Murdock, despite being shown as professionally headstrong in her previous scenes.

However, I found that the chemistry between she hulk and daredevil to be endearing, sans the cringeworthy dialogue. Yet, it made the show more than tolerable. 

SO, when in the 8th episode, we see Jen legitimately hulk out and see herself as a monster, Bruce is somewhat redeemed because he had tried to warn Jen against these exact things. This is the exact situation that Bruce was trying to prevent Jen from getting into. Moreover, the CGI has gotten better for the last 2 episodes and I'd love to see more action and drama instead of a saturation of the latter."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I felt so sad for SheHulk, like I'm glad i'm empathetic but damn to be embarrassed like that in front of all your peers and colleagues and i assume for a woman its a lot harder to be respected in those spaces..just felt so sad and ashamed for her and i think her raging was totally warranted. like fuck, i think anyone would rage and fee so embarrassed if their sex tape was put on the big screen. but does this only work against women? or would a guy rage to if a girl put his sex tape on display in front of his colleagues after winning an award?"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Ah yes, once again the cabal of rapists and degenerates that is Hollywood have come down from their ivory towers to preach morals to the unwashed masses."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Jesus fucking Christ this comment section. I have to conclude there is a big amount of people that don't even watch the show downvoting everything. One dude says one thing: downvoted to oblivion. Another dude says THE OPPOSITE: also downvoted to oblivion. What the fuck is going on?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Wait, what? There are people actually watching that show?!"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I'm just salty that She-Hulk received a whole freaking show where as The actual original Hulk is left on the sidelines to do nothing, again. Like why couldn't it have been a Hulk show that featured She-Hulk instead?"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I find it a bit weird that two of the “female-lead” Marvel projects that immediately come to mind (Captain Marvel and She-Hulk) have plots that only really work within the context of “boy, doesn’t it suck to be female in a male-dominated society?”

The only other female lead Marvel thing I can think of is Black Widow which was a fairly generic “bad guys are doing a bad thing. Also, trauma from your past” plot.

I don’t think 66% of the male-led Marvel stuff only works with a male character. Let me do a mental list:

Star Lord’s character would work just as well if they were female.

Iron Man would work if it was a female billionaire tech genius.

Captain America, admittedly, only really makes sense as male because they’re a WW2 front-line soldier.

Hawkeye could have been a female archer.

Black Panther could have been female.

Thor is based off of a male Norse god so being male is kind of mandatory.

Spider-Man sorta needs them to be male for the “spitting web uncontrollably” to be a puberty metaphor but that’s kind of a minor detail and not even really a thing in the MCU’s Spider-Man.

So around a third of the male-dominated superheroes’ stories wouldn’t have worked without a male lead.

It’s a bit of a weird ratio. I guess there are more male superheroes in Marvel and, with only three female superhero stuff there’s a pretty small sample size. Hopefully future projects will have the lead just be female and it not being such a big deal that the plot needs to be about it."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,As a straight male in his 30’s I love this show. There’s nothing like it.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I never understood why people hated this show... CGI is weak yeah but other than that it's really fun.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I feel like this show's been going on forever now with how much space it takes up in tv/pop-culture conversation. Can't wait for this shit to be over, honestly."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"This show is just what I want; comedy Marvel.

Did someone seriously report this as a suicidal post?

Terrible."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I haven't see articles on the best episode in the series, Episode 7 😭 this one pissed me off at the end in a good way plus daredevil, probably second best episode"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"That episode where she goes to court with Titania who is suing her for using the name She Hulk and she has to resort to, how was it said? Using a line of “questionable men” she met on a dating app to back up her case and they all take the stand and embarrass the hell out of her was the funniest, most relatable thing I’ve seen on film in like a million years. I’m super old and I don’t remember the last time I laughed that friggin hard. I thought I was going to have a seizure."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,She-hulk is basically “if Reddit made a show” lol
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Well and people will still judge her for it
 Seriously...fuck them"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"The screenshot they took of the scene shows her bank account with 8k in savings, my my how bourgeois"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Did they really change Intelligencia from a cabal of the smartest people on earth to a bunch of incels? Why? If so every time I hear about them using an obscure thing from the comics like this I just shake my head at the wasted potential.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[deleted]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"So, full disclosure, i havent seen any of she hulk, or, actually, anything marvel related since i was bored and disappointed by the end of wandavision but the main antagonist is basically reddit? 

That's pretty good, really."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Was that the takeaway this episode? I'm been loving She-Hulk but it's just some incels who want the blood of She-Hulk (blood for science purposes)
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Is this really what their audience are interested in? Super heroes fighting online trolls? Not aliens or supervillains, just antisocial dudes with internet connections? What a boring audience"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Idk maybe I’m alone in this but I gave up on this show halfway through episode 3 or 4. I think it’s maybe the pandering 4th walls breaks? Or I’m just getting tired of Disney marvel content. Anyone else feel this way?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Why do the trolls hate this show so much? Is it because they are the butt of the joke a lot and are made out as the villains.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,The MCU is a complete joke now
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"They show really hit its stride with this episode.. They managed to give us a great blend between between sitcom, lighthearted action and social issues/incel commentary. Maslani and Cox have great chemistry and I hope they get to share the screen again if the show comes back."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[deleted]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,She-Hulk sucks.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Great show.  It’s so sad that MAGA-ragers have no lives and all this time to try and bomb Disney cartoons and superhero shows 😂
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Marvel has truly lost its way.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Regardless, this show is gaaaaaarbaaaaaaaage."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Why do people still watch this garbage
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I have feelings about this show and everyone in the comments is a bad person for disagreeing with me.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I saw the reception to this episode so I decided to give this show another chance. It was a pretty great episode, but I don't think I have it in me to watch the other 4-5 I skipped."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Male super heros save the world or universe.  Female super heros deal with revenge porn.  Who writes this crap?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I didn’t care for the dancing stuff. But not everything should be geared towards me. I got to see she hulk be a woman and an OP beast mode hulk. That’s why I’m here!!! I think marvel will be happy in the long run.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I bet it was that creepy rich dude with a hulk fetish. He is gonna be the Villan
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I thought it was supposed to be a lighthearted comedy ?

Did something changed ?

I am not watching the show"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,It’s a good show.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I love this show, it’s such a nice change of pace. I was worried when Disney announced it would primarily follow Jen’s law career but they made it work 🤷🏽‍♂️"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,She-Hulk wasn’t more rageful during her gray period in civil war 2 just because she almost died is was mainly because when she woke up she found out Bruce had been killed and by whom which was the vary important part.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I've been watching this show with my kids. Will this episode be safe? Sounds a little rough
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Spoilers
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Saw this coming a mile away
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,So the big bad they’ve been building up for She-hulk this entire season is 4chan and….revenge porn?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,No one cares.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I am convinced the people who “hate” this show are seeing a little bit too much of themselves in the building villains of the story.

It’s brilliantly tapping into very real shit."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Boring
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Aren't most of the Marvel shows trash, anyway? In the end, this show will be forgotten like most of the Disney live-action remakes; they won't stand the test of time like the likes of Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,I feel like all these positive comments are disney trying to get the show liked
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Weak
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I’ll be honest.

I’m going to assume this isn’t one of those “it’s so important!” episodes."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Crazy ass turn in this show. Say what you want about this show but it has a super incisive wit and a green finger on the pulse of our times. Absolutely fantastic to watch. Just set down your preconceptions for a bit and let yourself have some fun!

Edit: Hit a nerve with The Intelligencia."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[removed]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I like the show. It was slow at first but Jen is pretty likable. It has gotten really good the last three episodes. 

Those that, for whatever odd reason, detest the show have likely only seen shitty YouTube reviews. You don’t have to watch every piece of media in the MCU, just like you don’t have to read every single series in the comics. You’re acting like Jennifer at the end of this last episode."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"The best thing about She Hulk threads is you find the douchiest comments by redditors big mad over a show not made for them, and block/ignore them

Reddit becomes much more enjoyable for both parties."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"You know, I hated it at first, but that twerking scene might be the most brilliant (okay, 2nd most after THE 4th wall break) scene in the whole damn show. Why? Because it is so, so triggering for the actual men that Intelligencia represents. They cannot stand it, so what does the show do? They double down and show it again in the ‘Previously’ title sequence, just to rub it in their faces. It’s just… *chef’s kiss*"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I'm loving this show and Andor, Disney+ is doing me well at the moment. I have to ignore the recently added movies though.

Jen losing her marbles at the video was totally understandable. Her tearing up the car park was less understandable though."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[deleted]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,It’s important that my 4 year old tackle these sensitive social issues while we’re eating cereal
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Is the show just gonna be about her getting mad and that’s it?
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,[deleted]
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Saw someone else point this out, but the final scene is a direct homage to Carrie."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,wow this show is so smart and topical it must be good
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,Too bad they can’t make the show watchable
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"I forgot this show was still on

I guess this is some horrible statement given I’m at 30 downvotes lol. It’s not a bad show, it’s just really uninteresting and forgettable. I watched the first 3? 4? And it was just… okay. And I forgot about it, because it’s just not that interesting."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Also - that wasn't revenge porn? That was clearly a doxxing on the level of fappening, which again, wasn't your typical revenge porn."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"This show is horrible and has some of the worst cgi I’ve seen in years.  
They also milked the whole daredevil thing to force people to watch it. 
Garbage show."
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Damn, this is the same show that had the MC twerking with Megan Thee Stallion?"
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,This show is awesome.
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis,"Don’t get me wrong, revenge porn is awful, *but* when I watch a marvel show or movie, I want to **escape** reality, not see how superheros would handle hot button, culturally relevant topics… This show is the worst."
Mob Psycho 100,fuck yes
Mob Psycho 100,"so hyped, love this show"
Mob Psycho 100,fuck Crunchyroll and their anti union BS
Mob Psycho 100,"Favourite anime ever, so excited for this!"
Mob Psycho 100,ohhhhh fuck yeah. The animation in the last season alone was enough to make an all-timer- the fact that the great story actually had real-shit to say about depression and personal growth is just the cherry on the cake.
Mob Psycho 100,Oh shit oh fuck. Cannot wait.
Mob Psycho 100,"give me more, I cannot wait"
Mob Psycho 100,"I still need to see the first seasons but it looks vaguely one punch man like which has me intrigued

Is the same studio as previous seasons?"
Mob Psycho 100,Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!
Mob Psycho 100,"I always enjoy the first halves of these seasons but lose interest once it turns into characters fighting for the last 5 episodes.

Hopefully this final season gives us some great Reigen, school and Body Improvement Club adventures before it turns into fighting time"
Mob Psycho 100,So what's the synopsis for this season? I didn't think there was still a story to tell since I thought Mob ran out of enemies that can pose any real threat to him.
Mob Psycho 100,**INJECT THAT OP TO MY VEINS!!!**
Mob Psycho 100,"I can't wait, shame about the Crunchyroll situation tho"
Mob Psycho 100,"My body is ready. 

What did it say at the end? Was there a date next to prime video?"
Mob Psycho 100,>~~fuck yes~~ fight on
Mob Psycho 100,"Crunchyroll has always been shitty. When they were first coming up, they stole fansubs and profited off of it. Years later they go legit and can't bother to pay translators.


All that was asked for was a *meeting*, not a commitment to use union talent, or anything. Just a meeting and they couldn't be bothered. Netflix and Sentai have no problem with it, but CR if course does."
Mob Psycho 100,Another reason to only watch subs.
Mob Psycho 100,">it looks vaguely one punch man like

It is based on a web comic from the same author that made One Punch Man, so it does have some similar vibes.

>Is the same studio as previous seasons? 

Yeah, all 3 seasons are made by Bones."
Mob Psycho 100,"Spoilers if you don’t want to know, but the series doesn’t end in a fight like the first two seasons."
Mob Psycho 100,"people don't need to pose a threat to Mob though for the series to be fantastic. Nobody in season 1 was ever a threat to him and that didn't change anything. 

The series knows how to work situations where whether mob is the strongest or weakest person in the room the themes and messages of the series will be conveyed extremely strongly and powerfully."
Mob Psycho 100,"People at the end of S1 were basically part of a bigger organisation.

The kid that was there was far more powerful than the rest but didn't fight Mob. You'll see more of him and his dad in this season. I'm assuming this'll be finishing the story as I don't remember the Manga going on for very long but maybe they could stretch to 3."
Mob Psycho 100,I believe from previous announcements I saw October 1st?
Mob Psycho 100,Oh okay nice
Mob Psycho 100,"Sounds great, thanks."
Mob Psycho 100,Yep it’s the same as one punch man. No one will ever beat satima but the series is still so fun to read for the characters
Mob Psycho 100,"You missed a season, bud. That was season 2 in 2019. It's great, if you haven't seen it."
Mob Psycho 100,You must have missed season 2 coming out a few years ago. This is for season 3
Mob Psycho 100,From October 5th every Wednesday on Prime video
Mob Psycho 100,"This is the type of good news to start my day. As always, animation looks CRISP af."
Mob Psycho 100,"Pshhhh, I won’t be happy till i get my Body Improvement Club spin-off series."
Mob Psycho 100,"Finally, one of my favorite anime will have a COMPLETE series... it feels unreal."
Mob Psycho 100,"I already forgot nearly everything from the first couple of seasons, but the [season 2 opening credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZaT8B31-g) is one of my favorite anime openings ever."
Mob Psycho 100,Hell yeah. Now let's year it for One Punch Man fans. Season 3 when?
Mob Psycho 100,Anime of the year already
Mob Psycho 100,I thought the manga ended with the end of season 2. A pleasant surprise!
Mob Psycho 100,"Oh buddy, the better anime compared to OPM. An actual story and characters to follow with amazing animation. Can't wait and am so glad they're continuing MOB"
Mob Psycho 100,"Holy shit, I thought it ended. Awesome"
Mob Psycho 100,"Looks like a big step up on animation. 
This is definitely one of the better shows running right now. It’s got charm, a nice mix of slice of life and some action. Not to forget the comedy is actually pretty good. 

The main reason I watch this though is the emotional connections it puts forward. I’m not sure why but whenever Mob learns something about his emotions I also feel like I learn this lesson as well. It makes me laugh because I’m 28 and I get emotional with the show."
Mob Psycho 100,This is literally my favorite anime. I am so hype.
Mob Psycho 100,"Eric Trump won't be happy about this

https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1303288007357796353"
Mob Psycho 100,T_T so happy
Mob Psycho 100,I can't wait to see this!
Mob Psycho 100,"I wonder how the season will be adapted. I believe someone did the math, and the remaining material isn’t enough for a full season."
Mob Psycho 100,Yes!! It’s been years!
Mob Psycho 100,That one guy looks like a human version of Mr. Poopy pants at 0:56
Mob Psycho 100,"When I first saw clips of this show I did not care for it. 

But I gave it a try during the lockdown and it's such a good humble show. I love it."
Mob Psycho 100,AYOOOO finally. Now if the studio can go back and make OPM season 3
Mob Psycho 100,LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Mob Psycho 100,Isn't there just like 10 or so chapters left in the manga to adapt? Are they actually gonna pad it out to a 12 episode season?
Mob Psycho 100,"Wait where’s season 2. I watched season 1 on HBO. 


Also does Netflix have any good anime that’s not a “Netflix” series as those seem to suck."
Mob Psycho 100,"I really strongly dislike most anime but go through phases every couple years where I'm like ok I'll try it out again and to see what everyone's talking about. 

So I tried mob psycho 100 and enjoyed it a bit and was like ok maybe I like anime. Then I tried another anime and absolutely hated it and realized that I just like good storytelling regardless if its anime or not

I'll check out season 3!

I am getting a bunch of downvotes which I really don't understand but I did make a list of ones I've watched on MyAnimeList if anyone wants to see the ones I tried out https://myanimelist.net/animelist/jaypeedaylee?status=7&order=4&order2=0"
Mob Psycho 100,Make a crossover with him and one punch
Mob Psycho 100,"With how well S1 went, I was so hyped for S2 only to find it quite meh. Here's hoping S3's better."
Mob Psycho 100,"I watched through all of One-Punch, even the OVAs and extramaterial, loved it.

But I watched the first four episodes of Mob Psycho and it was such a slog. And the ""incompetent master"" trope lost its taste faster than a Juicy Fruit."
Mob Psycho 100,I've thought about watching this because some youtube person started a series on it.
Mob Psycho 100,Never heard of this show what is it?
Mob Psycho 100,"This is great, season 2 ended pretty definitively, so i didn't think they would continue to adapt the rest."
Mob Psycho 100,Greatness.
Mob Psycho 100,"I absolutely loved the 2nd season, can't wait for this."
Mob Psycho 100,I thought Season 2 was weaker than Season 1 but it was still pretty good. I can't wait for this season.
Mob Psycho 100,"sweet. I JUST started this last night. right now it's okayish, nothing super exciting yet. but I'm only on the 3rd episode"
Mob Psycho 100,I hope they top that teleporter fight from last season. That was some of the best action I've seen in any medium.
Mob Psycho 100,"Studio Bones is great.  They've struggled a bit with many of their homegrown stories lately, but the animation is always top notch.  

They're in the same league as Madhouse.  They've been great quality for a long time now.

edit: fixed which ""they're"" that I used."
Mob Psycho 100,I want it to be a legitimate workout tutorial series but the background has a bunch of gags and a whole storyline happening.
Mob Psycho 100,"lol everytime I get my lazy ass out to work out I joke with my SO saying ""BODY IMPROVEMENT CLUB"" and doing a flex

they really give me inspiration to want to work out haha"
Mob Psycho 100,"For real, all of my favorites have been getting postponed indefinitely or only do 1 season every two years or something"
Mob Psycho 100,I'm really happy the whole thing is getting adapted. I jumped into the manga after loving season 2 and goddamn it's such a beautifully well rounded and satisfying story. Very excited to see it come to life.
Mob Psycho 100,"Conversely, a series that I felt was perfectly complete with its first series (FLCL) just keeps coming back, in addition to the 2 new series they added to it a few years ago, there are an additional 2 series for it on the way."
Mob Psycho 100,Hope they return to season 1 form
Mob Psycho 100,"""Spy X Family"" and ""Love and War"" are delivering hard already. And ""Chainsaw man"", ""Made in Abyss"" also come out this year. 

Its actually a really great year for Anime."
Mob Psycho 100,"Golden Kamuy, Made in abyss, Uzumaki, Overlord, bleach and Jojo stone ocean etc all are coming this year. Tough competition.

2022 is one hell of a year for anime fans."
Mob Psycho 100,This season should finish the manga
Mob Psycho 100,"I originally liked OPM more, but after season 2 of both shows came out, MOB is definitely the winner. I'm pretty indifferent about season 3 of OPM, but I'm excited for season 3 of MOB."
Mob Psycho 100,Why the need for comparison at all?
Mob Psycho 100,"Nah I prefer One Punch Man. I love the Mob fights, but most of the emotional stuff falls flat for me. Like, that two-parter in s2 that tried to get me to cry about Reigen did nothing.


Still, if s3 has insane action again I'll be more than happy. Bones at their best is on another level."
Mob Psycho 100,OPM doesn't even have the amazing animation for s2
Mob Psycho 100,"We should fix that with images of the mob that stormed the capitol, that will surely please him."
Mob Psycho 100,Netflix has become one of the bigger heavy hitters in anime. They have a lot of pull in the industry and have some real good ones such as violet evergarden or march comes in like a lion
Mob Psycho 100,"Black Lagoon.

It's kinda like if Cowboy Bebop was about a group of pirates/smugglers in and around Thailand during the 90s.

Studio Madhouse too. Also, like Cowboy Bebop it is best watched in English."
Mob Psycho 100,BNA brand new animal is quite good
Mob Psycho 100,"Season 2 is really, really good. I like it more then season 1. I'm wondering how season 3 can live up to it."
Mob Psycho 100,Crunchyroll and funimation both have it
Mob Psycho 100,"> Also does Netflix have any good anime that’s not a “Netflix” series as those seem to suck.

I would check out Castlevania, which is a Netflix series, if you haven't already. I really enjoyed it. Alucard's Season 3 arc is poor and the deus ex machina of Season 4 is eye-rollingly bad, but otherwise I was really engaged in the story and fight sequence animations.

The same studio did Blood of Zeus, another Netflix series, which really looks like Castlevania, but didn't quite catch my interest after the first episode. Maybe I need to watch a couple more episodes to catch on."
Mob Psycho 100,I really like your MAL! Specially the shows you have as “watched: 0 episodes. Rating: 2/10.”
Mob Psycho 100,"If you like good storytelling, then I have to recommend the anime Monster. You will likely have to pirate it, but it is very good. A nice serious story and none of the shitty tropes that, unfortunately, anime is known for."
Mob Psycho 100,"Have you watched Demon Slayer? The animation quality, art style and soundtrack make it one of the most enjoyable anime ever made IMO."
Mob Psycho 100,"Ghost in the Shell is missing from your list but damn you watched a lot more anime than me and I don't consider myself an anime hater.  

Ghost in the Shell has great storytelling and great visual, though I recommend switching to the show (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) if one of the movies starts annoying you."
Mob Psycho 100,"If you want something that's less fantasy and more ""mature"" I'd recommend March Comes In like a Lion and Run with the Wind.

Both are absolutely amazing."
Mob Psycho 100,I preferred S2's emotional beats a lot more than S1 personally.
Mob Psycho 100,Oh man I loved S02
Mob Psycho 100,"then you should adjust your expectations, cuz if you didn't like the mogami and reigen arcs, there's no way you'll like ss3."
Mob Psycho 100,What? S2 was way better then S1
Mob Psycho 100,"The best episode of season 2 was the first episode, which set my expectations too high as everything else was kinda hit or miss. The race episode would’ve been up there as well if it wasn’t for that cliffhanger ending that got 100% reversed the very next episode."
Mob Psycho 100,"Reigen becomes the star of the show. Mob is a seriously dangerous kid, like we're talking world ending calamity level and Reigen is his emotional support and fully understands what he's dealing with. Their relationship gets heavily fleshed out and it's not just a gag relationship they depend on each other. 

Here's their first meeting. https://youtu.be/9OU_tFXCvwA"
Mob Psycho 100,"I can imagine the group jogging, giving tips on how to run better while mob is fighting toichiro in the background."
Mob Psycho 100,*cries in a certain magical index*
Mob Psycho 100,I don’t think we’ll ever see that quality of animation again. It was a dream combination of some of the most talented freelance animators in the world.
Mob Psycho 100,You say that but I freaking loved season 2. Never understood the hate for it other than the lower quality in animation.
Mob Psycho 100,"not trying to start a dub vs sub war here but kaguya-sama love is war is one of the best dubs I've ever seen, like you can tell each voice actor actually puts a lot of effort, plus the translations nail all the mannerisms and the use modern slang. the narrator seriously has no business being as good as he is. stuff like breaking out into valley girl accent *""like omg he totally didnt""* when he's mocking someone, it's like they just didn't translate 1:1 but put effort in making actually match how people would actually speak in english

like the way he says ""damn what man can deny an invite like that"" in this clip

https://v.redd.it/ky1nx6fohmi51

he goes from a krunk in emperor's new groove yelling type voice to a smooth duke nukem type voice with that ""damn"". if theres a voice actor of the year he should win it lol"
Mob Psycho 100,"Screw those, all my homies are watching My Dress-Up Darling"
Violet Evergarden,One of my favorites of the last winter season. Episodes 7 and 10 are the highlights of the series for me.
Violet Evergarden,"Episode 10 was the one with the sick mother right? I knew what was going to happen at the end of it, prepared myself for it, and it *still* broke my heart"
Violet Evergarden,What a wonderfully articulated post. I also enjoyed this series. It's universal theme is beautifully rendered and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking something emotionally stimulating.
Violet Evergarden,">Grave of the Fireflies

This is both very high praise for a comparison and a near-guarantee I will avoid this show! :)"
Violet Evergarden,"Ancient Magus Bride is also in my top 10 of all time, and check out Your Lie in April from last year if you haven't. "
Violet Evergarden,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden,"You're right, I watched it again last year and got mixed up."
Violet Evergarden,"I saw Doctor Who in the honourable mentions, then Midnight and Caves in the ten and I thought “how the fk can you have DW on this list and not include Heaven Sent?” Then I saw 1. It’d be in my top ten too. It’s not even the best scripted episode - plenty have had denser, more clever and more exciting scripts - but it’s filmed so beautifully, scored perfectly and it has the only actor to play the Doctor with the necessary gravitas,world-weariness and natural presence to carry an entire episode of self reflection, melancholy and loss. It’s visual poeticism sets it apart everything else. A remarkable piece of work and a total oddity in the entirety of Doctor Who.

Also, nice to see Bojack there. I’d be close to including That’s Too Much Man in an honourable mentions list. The planetarium scene ending fucked me right up."
Violet Evergarden,"Judging by the type of shows it seems you like, you should watch The Leftovers and Battlestar Galactica"
Violet Evergarden,I haven't seen Doctor Who and wasn't the biggest fan of Bojack Horseman so I actually relate more to the honorable mentions than the actual list. lol.
Violet Evergarden,"For Game of thrones- No Battle of Bastards or, Hardhome, or Baelor (I feel like this episode separated GOT from all other shows) ?"
Violet Evergarden,Mr. Robot 407 Proxy Authentication Required.
Violet Evergarden,That view from halfway down poem is probably the most haunting thing I’ve ever heard in a Tv show
Violet Evergarden,No Jurassic Bark?
Violet Evergarden,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden,"I have watced that episode 28 times and every time i love it more. To me its the best themed episode ever and that resolution is just awe inspiring. My favorite scene in all of fiction.

Side note did you watch the latest episode and do you listen to big finish.

Btw which episodes do you find having denser scripts than heaven sent. The comparable one i can think of is the view from halfway down."
Violet Evergarden,Sure thanks
Violet Evergarden,"Everyone has different tastes so to be expected. 

You def should check out dr who but warning dr who cqn be embarrasingly bad at timed but the gold is so far beyong gold that it will make it all worth it.

I recommend watching s3 ep 10 blink and s4 ep 10 midnight and then watching series wise."
Violet Evergarden,I understand HardHome or Baelor but Battle of Bastards has so many illogical moments and plot conveniences that it takes away from my liking for the episode.
Violet Evergarden,Hardhome the last 30 mins are phenomenal the earlier 30 are just great.
Violet Evergarden,"Sadly that episode didnt touch me much for most of it. The ending is killer.

Its a bit like rains of castamere the ending is phenomenal but everything beofre that is just good."
Violet Evergarden,Are you even reading? The episode was winds of winter s6 ending.
Violet Evergarden,"Yeah, watched the new episode earlier. Not sure what to make of it. A lot of building up, which I guess was to be expected. I’m reserving judgement for the following weeks as the story unfolds. I used to listen to Big Finish, not anymore. Haven’t the time really, like I used to, and the money I could spend on digital or CD stories I spend on LPs these days.

Dense I mean as in a narrative that has a lot in it. The script to Heaven Sent is really quite simple, not a lot happens. That works in its favour, allows Capaldi room to really embrace the dialogue and the feel, and allows the storyline to move along fluidly without all sorts of plot jumps. You’re right about it being award worthy. Moffat had spent his tenure writing so many scripts that were overcomplicated, with Heaven Sent he left it clean and minimal and sometimes that’s more beautiful writing than something dense and overwrought. I think the same of World Enough/Doctor Falls. Script wise, not a lot actually happens, but that gives room for the interaction between characters - and gives Capaldi space to act his socks off and absolutely kill us all with emotion.

Oh god, The View From Halfway Down. I have trouble watching that episode, every time. It’s amazing how bold that show was in depicting depression and suicide. Hard to watch for anyone who’s experienced either, but also in some strange way, undeniably therapeutic."
Violet Evergarden,"Dr. Who? Nah. Sorry, I'm just pass the point where I've ever give anything with more than 3 seasons a go. I just don't have time for it.

I did watch the 90s movie though so I am slightly familiar with it."
Violet Evergarden,Blackwater is the best GoT episode imo
Violet Evergarden,"I found the opening segments of the episode insulting to watch. Felt like a parody of the show. But then aside from a few cringey scenes i really enjoyed the set up. Hope this arc is more of a big bang than wedding of riversong.


That angel moment was phenomenal.

On thw topic of big fin8sh whoch are your favorite stories, have you heard the shearman plays and/or the war master series."
Violet Evergarden,I cant argue with that. The first phenomenal got episode imo.
Violet Evergarden,"Spare Parts will always remain my favourite from Big Finish. The only time I’ve been absolutely riveted by an audio. All the others I’ve heard were mostly great, but Spare Parts was something else. I’ve been a Cyberman fan since I was real little, so their genesis story was special. World Enough And Time and Rise Of The Cybermen both borrow a little from it, World especially. Aside from that, I really loved the 8th Doctor series with Charley and then Lucie. Lost track after that, but the series’ with those two were terrific.

I’ve heard Shearman’s Jubilee, that Dalek was adapted from, but nothing else. Not heard the War Master series but a mate of mine in England collects all the audios and he loves the War Master stuff.

Yeah that Angel scene was excellent, best part of the episode. I like the new Sontaran look too, similar to the comics from Doctor Who magazine a few years ago with the 9th Doctor."
Violet Evergarden,"You *must* check out the shearman plays. Holy terror should be your first then just listen to storm warning to get acclimated with 8 and charley on audio(its a fine story nothing great)

But then chimes of midnight is in my top 5 favorite who stories ever. Listen to it this christmas if possible."
Violet Evergarden,"Oh I’ve heard Storm Warning, think I’ve heard Holy Terror too. Both were pretty early releases. Didn’t realise Shearman wrote them.

I think Chimes would figure in most people’s top five, or at least their top ten. It’s long been regarded as one of the range’s best stories."
Violet Evergarden,Storm isnt shearman's just needed to appreciate chimes more.
Violet Evergarden,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Violet Evergarden,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Violet Evergarden,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Violet Evergarden,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Violet Evergarden,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Violet Evergarden,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Violet Evergarden,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Violet Evergarden,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Violet Evergarden,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

Violet Evergarden,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Violet Evergarden,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Violet Evergarden,Needs more Jojo
Violet Evergarden,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Violet Evergarden,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Violet Evergarden,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Violet Evergarden,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Violet Evergarden,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Violet Evergarden,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Violet Evergarden,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Violet Evergarden,Madoka magica ! 
Violet Evergarden,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Violet Evergarden,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Violet Evergarden,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Violet Evergarden,Awh no your lie about in April 
Violet Evergarden,This is actually a really decent list
Violet Evergarden,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

Violet Evergarden,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Violet Evergarden,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Violet Evergarden,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Violet Evergarden,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Violet Evergarden,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Violet Evergarden,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Violet Evergarden,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Violet Evergarden,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Violet Evergarden,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Violet Evergarden,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Violet Evergarden,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Violet Evergarden,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Violet Evergarden,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Violet Evergarden,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Violet Evergarden,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Violet Evergarden,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Violet Evergarden,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Violet Evergarden,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Violet Evergarden,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Violet Evergarden,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Violet Evergarden,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Violet Evergarden,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Violet Evergarden,Black Clover?
Violet Evergarden,.
Violet Evergarden,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Violet Evergarden,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Violet Evergarden,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Violet Evergarden,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Violet Evergarden,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Violet Evergarden,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Violet Evergarden,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Violet Evergarden,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Violet Evergarden,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Violet Evergarden,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Violet Evergarden,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Violet Evergarden,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Violet Evergarden,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Violet Evergarden,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Violet Evergarden,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Violet Evergarden,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Pop Team Epic,"Alright so I’ve seen this thing everywhere, but what *is* it exactly?"
Pop Team Epic,I wonder if they’ll only do the first 11 mins. The whole 22 mins is just the same episode twice.
Pop Team Epic,Why the long face?
Pop Team Epic,"Couldn't get behind the japanese version, let's see if the adapted version gets me"
Pop Team Epic,"Robot Chicken, but Japanese."
Pop Team Epic,I feel like the trailer suggests that they’ll be doing the whole 22 minutes.
Pop Team Epic,It's already been out for a while. It got a simuldub. 
Pop Team Epic,And if you don't have a deep knowledge of Japanese pop culture you'll miss the majority of references and parodies
Pop Team Epic,I don’t see a bunch of Americans enjoying that. Even I turned it off on stream when I thought the episode bugged out.
Pop Team Epic,Really? I wasnt aware of that!
Pop Team Epic,"To be fair though there are a bunch of western parodies too, there was a skyrim skit in I think the first ep"
Pop Team Epic,"Oh yeah, I have no doubts that some people will be weirded out by it or turned off from it."
Pop Team Epic,"Yeah, but Skyrim was also sold in Japan. To phrase it another way - the series was made for only a Japanese audience in mind so most of the stuff will fly over the heads of non-Japanese people unless they are maybe weeabos or something like that. There's a good reason why there are videos on YT explaining the references, haha"
Pop Team Epic,How many Japanese people do you know have watched Cool Runnings? That's another one they've parodied.
Pop Team Epic,Also paradied Lets Groove by Earth Wind and Fire
Pop Team Epic,"It was released in Japan in 1994, so there are probably quite a few people my age who remember it..."
Pop Team Epic,"In all fairness, American music is fairly mainstream in Japan. At least a good chunk of the major acts are. Plus you can't really ignore that EW&F is one of the most successful groups ever. "
Pop Team Epic,"I was only planning on linking to the playlist and giving a brief description, and then this somehow happened. If you can't tell, I've been really enjoying this show lol."
Pop Team Epic,">The Caesars will tell the story of the early rulers of ancient Rome, beginning with the rise to power of Julius Caesar.

This was basically the pitch for HBO's Rome"
Pop Team Epic,"I like the idea of a focus on his younger years, HBO's Rome just kinda kicks in when Ceasar is at his absolute peak having just defeated Vercingetorix. It would be good to see a portrayal of his early days in the Roman army, winning the Civic crown and his subsequent rise through the ranks etc"
Pop Team Epic,Jupiter's cock!
Pop Team Epic,"If it is as good as the HBO BBC Rome series, I'll watch it, but reading the article, it sounds like they are just remaking it. "
Pop Team Epic,"Sometimes I wish we could get a series about The Republic, more than the Empire. Imo, the time leading up to Caesar is very interesting and could make for some compelling viewing."
Pop Team Epic,As long as Hirst isn't the only writer but works in a team it should be fine...
Pop Team Epic,">US director Martin Scorsese and British writer Michael Hirst will focus on youth and vitality of ancient Rome’s rulers

So...lots of fucking, then."
Pop Team Epic,"Hollywood is always making Roman period movies in the same themes: Caesar, Roman Britain... That's it, the same thing, over and over again. You'd think with a history as long and as rich as Roman history is that they would get creative and takle ANY other point in the empires timeline."
Pop Team Epic,"As an ancient history buff, I honestly can't contain my excitement for this project."
Pop Team Epic,"I hope they show Caesar kidnapped by pirates, treating them as if he was their better, raising his ransom, being freed, then attacking said pirates. A pretty badass story."
Pop Team Epic,"If Hirst can write it like the first 3 seasons of Vikings, fine. If its Seasons 4&5 Hirst, oh god no"
Pop Team Epic,Team up with HBO and call back the cast of Rome.  That show deserved more seasons.  
Pop Team Epic,[11-year old Martin Scorsese's first storyboard](https://flashbak.com/an-11-year-old-martin-scorsese-draws-storyboards-for-the-eternal-city-1953-and-silence-363835/).
Pop Team Epic,"Joey, do you like movies with gladiators?"
Pop Team Epic,">Martin Scorsese

Yayyyyyyyyyy

>Michael Hirst

Booooooooo"
Pop Team Epic,What have the Romans ever done for us?
Pop Team Epic,"Could be good. Season 4 of Starz's Spartacus gave us a glimpse of a young Julius Caesar, making a name for himself under Crassus. Actually, Crassus himself makes an interesting figure--he is one of the richest men ever to have lived, it is believed.

If they do it right, it could be great. There are outstanding primary sources to provide material for pretty much as long as they want to go. Although I'd almost rather see periods of Roman history that usually get ignored--the Second Punic War, for instance, or the story of the Gracchi, or even the breakdown of the Republic during the civil war between Marius and Sulla.

Or, if you prefer imperial Rome, why not the Flavians? Vespasian was a great general with a very dry & sarcastic wit; Titus fell in love with a Jewish aristocrat during the Jewish Revolt of the 60's/early70's and Domitian was never quite right in the head. I love the Julio-Claudians, and they are stocked with interesting personalities, but there's a ""been there/done that"" quality to covering that ground again.

But Scorsese proved with _Boardwalk Empire_ he can shepherd a great period piece TV series so that gives me hope."
Pop Team Epic,Does it say what channel will this be for? To me it says a lot about the expected quality.
Pop Team Epic,"Fucking hell, don't give us another take on the rise of Julius Caesar. The Roman Kingdom lasted from 753 B.C. to 509 B.C., the Roman Republic lasted from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C., and the Roman Empire lasted from 27 B.C. to 395 A.D., before being split into the Western Roman Empire which lasted from 395 A.D. to 476 A.D., and the Eastern Roman Empire which lasted from 395 A.D. to 1453 A.D., and for some reason the only period of time people show on tv is the 56 years that Julius Caesar was alive. There were so many fascinating events in Roman history and goddamnit, I want to see the Punic Wars given it's due. I want to see somebody portray Hannibal. I want to see the Battle of Cannae, I want to see the Senate debates about Hannibal, I want to see the drama of the Punic Wars. "
Pop Team Epic,"> Michael Hirst

Just bludgeon my shins with a mallet already.

> The Caesars will tell the story of the early rulers of ancient Rome, beginning with the rise to power of Julius Caesar. 


Caesar was born 600 years after the mythical founding of Rome and centuries after anything that could be called ""early rulers of ancient Rome"".

Regardless, this will likely be shit, even Scorcese cannot sweet sprinkle the textual dysentery that is Hirstwriting."
Pop Team Epic,"Michael Hirst?  No, just no...

I don't want a 20 episodes season written by, as the last Vikings season suggests, a hack writer.

I really hope there will be someone sane to keep him on a tight leash."
Pop Team Epic,Prepare yourself for loads of cursing in Latin!
Pop Team Epic,Are we going to finally get a movie about Boudica?
Pop Team Epic,"If it hasn't got Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, it can fuck right off."
Pop Team Epic,"The colors will be saturated to hell, too many male actors will speak on ridiculous gravelly voices, we'll see every female actress's boobs, and the plot will be a shoehorned allegory for trump. "
Pop Team Epic,"And all characters will speak in British accents, obviously"
Pop Team Epic,Was there ever a non epic take on the Romans? The epicness pretty much comes with the territory.
Pop Team Epic,"For once a series that needs no exaggeration or added sex and violence to make it interesting. Im kinda hoping for a Roman House of Cards with the occasional battle and bit nudity. Something like I, Claudius with some money thrown at it."
Pop Team Epic,Start with the Punic wars please!
Pop Team Epic,Scorsese and Hirst teaming up?! Sign me up for this. 
Pop Team Epic,Just finished listening to Dan Carlin's Celtic Holocaust which focuses a lot on Caesar's early years. That would make a great tv show.
Pop Team Epic,"Really wish the byzantines (eastern Roman empire) would get some love, the ceaser family has enough popularity "
Pop Team Epic,"Really excited for this but personally I’ve always wanted to see a miniseries telling the story of the Punic wars, from Hannibal to the sac of Carthage. "
Pop Team Epic,Itsa me ceezer! Fogeddaboutit 
Pop Team Epic,"Can't wait to see an all female legion that's invincible.

It will also be revealed that Caesar was completely dependent on his genius mistress. "
Pop Team Epic,"It will be centered on the Romans, who will all inexplicably have British accents."
Pop Team Epic,I wonder if these will be the BBC black ‘Romans’ or the usual historically-accurate privileged white ones instead.
Pop Team Epic,"Yes, but do something different from Rome, please."
Pop Team Epic,"Always fucking Caesar this and Caesar that, come on now, there were other interesting events in the entirety of Roman history.
"
Pop Team Epic,"Oh, [good](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384766/?ref_=ttls_li_tt), [because](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442449/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) modern [epics](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758429/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) [about](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) ancient [Rome](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020558/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) is a [genre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3231054/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) we [don't already](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034389/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) have [enough](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1921064/?ref_=ttls_li_tt) of."
Pop Team Epic,"let me guess - the main characters will be black

https://kek.gg/i/4bvPF6.jpeg"
Pop Team Epic,I can’t wait! What channel??
Pop Team Epic,Oh this will be cool.
Pop Team Epic,If they release a trailer that uses metal or some other heavy guitar music I'm out.
Pop Team Epic,Yeah I don’t watch rapists productions... 
Pop Team Epic,"""As far back as I could I remember, I always wanted to be a Centurion."""
Pop Team Epic,"Scorsese = good

Hirst = garbage

Scorsese + Hirst = OK?"
Pop Team Epic,Let someone else make this.  Scorsese belongs in JAIL. 
Pop Team Epic,"Why do I have a feeling this is going to include a lot of sex scenes, nudity and possible a bit of historical revisionism to fit with todays culture?"
Pop Team Epic,Rome wasn't produced in a day.
Pop Team Epic,"For everyone lamenting HBO's Rome, the set burned down which is why season 2 turned into a mash of of the beginning of season 2 and the end of season 3, and was then cancelled."
Pop Team Epic,Meh
Pop Team Epic,I bet they're going to blackwash a ton of prominent roles with black actors. Historical accuracy? Blegh.
Pop Team Epic,"Ugh, judging by the picture of the ""female"" warrior, this is going to be terrible SJW fiction. "
Pop Team Epic,"Who want to bet they will depict Romans as being Hijab-wearing black lesbians?
Seems trendy nowadays."
Pop Team Epic,Scorsese's roman war!
Pop Team Epic,"If they can pull off the battle of Cannae successfully, that would be epic."
Pop Team Epic,Goooooood. Gooooooooooood
Pop Team Epic,I’m picturing an epic but set in modern Rome with modern Roman problems. They’ve been telling this story for millenia. These two can come up with something different?
Pop Team Epic,"Oh so it's I, Claudius."
Pop Team Epic,"Cool! Scorsese has been wanting to do a roman film since he was a kid, guess this is close enough!"
Pop Team Epic,"Pity they seem to be covering generic period without much focus. I would love to see what Scorsese could have done with 'I, Claudius/Claudius the God'. I bet his version would be blazing. Michelle Pfeiffer as Livia of course. But who would he have got at as Caligula, I wonder?"
Pop Team Epic,"Try not to burn the whole fuckin' set down this time, fellas. "
Pop Team Epic,Ooooooo I can't wait to see how he fits Gimme Shelter into ancient Rome. 
Pop Team Epic,I flipped past the title and thought it was about Saoirse Ronan. 
Pop Team Epic,Better than Britannia I hope....what a shitshow
Pop Team Epic,Featuring a picture from Vikings.... 
Pop Team Epic,Roman history is my favorite. More Roman stuff please?
Pop Team Epic,Is this her tit?
Pop Team Epic,"Oh hell yeah. Between this and the LoTR series, can't get more hyped."
Pop Team Epic,so i guess Devil in the white city is not happening?  That would have been a great movie..
Pop Team Epic,"Is Katheryn Winnick in it?  Although not very authentic, I would approve.  "
Pop Team Epic,"I cannot wait to see how this turns out. I've been waiting for another series on Rome.
"
Pop Team Epic,Isn't that the actress from Vikings?
Pop Team Epic,"I'm super excited about this, but I want more than anything to some day see an epic drama about Mithridates's Black Sea empire and its struggle to defy Rome."
Pop Team Epic,"The quote which instantly popped into my mind is 'Rome was not built in a day.'  With all the caveats in that article about how history is just the backdrop for the drama and even contemporary accounts can't be considered accurate, I'm not expecting too much.  Tired old politicos - yeah who cares about all that Senate and government crap.  Swords and leather sandals, here we come!"
Pop Team Epic,She has a nice boob.
Pop Team Epic,We already have the best roman show there ever could be but I will take it from scorsese and hirst.
Pop Team Epic,I really want an hour long episode of the battle of Alesia! With GoT-like budget. That's one of the most amazing battles of all time IMO and it would make for an amazing story! 
Pop Team Epic,I remember seeing storybaords that Scorcese did as a little kid for a movie set in Ancient Rome... I wonder if those are connected to this?  That would be kind of awesome.
Pop Team Epic,So Rome then? I'm not saying it won't be good but can't they make something else? There are shows that can be made with a smaller budget. I'm still annoyed they cancelled carnivale cos it was supposedly cost too much money to make 
Pop Team Epic,I'll only watch if ray stevenson gets to reprise his role as titus pullo
Rotten,Honestly can’t wait to see it. Only wish that Halo got the same level of treatment production wise.
Rotten,">98% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes

I heard that number before...oh no."
Rotten,"Looking forward to watching it! I have a hard time imagining it won't be successful enough for a Season 2, which is kind of what I'm interested in seeing the most.

Without getting into spoilers, The Last of Us Part 2 is going to be a much more difficult story to adapt, even just structurally. I think it could benefit by having the pacing of a TV show rather than a game. I'm also hoping some of the themes and story beats that didn't quite land for me in the game can be reexamined or handled in a slightly different way."
Rotten,I'm excited for the show. I'm not excited for three months of people on here who have fully dunning krugered themselves into believing there's a massive psy op to convince them a show they don't like or haven't seen is good like with Andor.
Rotten,Or that they cared about the source material. They didn't even get the Cole protocol right and it screwed them over immediately.
Rotten,"Halo was actually a pleasant surprise 

Yes Cortana could have been a lot better 

But the story took some interesting turns loved the chick in it she was great"
Rotten,Craig Mazin already indicated that TLOU part 2 storyline will be divided into two seasons since the story of part two is very long and too complicated to just fit into one season show.... obviously TLOU part 3 comes after that so it could be 4 to 5 seasons overall.
Rotten,Andor was awesome... but yeah. Excited for this
Rotten,"Besides the fact the people making the show had no idea or love for the Halo universe, its just a bad show period. Its so poorly written and acted. Sucks"
Rotten,"That makes sense, I would guess that they will add more stuff than they apparently have in season 1 as well just because there’s a lot more to expand upon in Part 2."
Rotten,It thought it was actually pretty damn good
Rotten,"Plus theres a 5 year gap between part 1 and part 2, that may be expanded upon as well, and with 2 seasons they can fix two of the main complaints about part 2 which is pacing issues and the proper introduction of Abby."
Rotten,Watched the first couple of episodes last night. Still enjoying the show this far and get a kick out of Johnny's cultural idiocy 🤣
Rotten,"This season is batshit insane, even more so than previous:


Terry Silver's evil master plan is >!entering an international karate tournament to make Cobra Kai really popular!<

There is no way the finale should have ended any other way than literally every member of Miyagi-do and allies being arrested for committing *multiple felonies*

I also appreciate the respect for the Conservation of Ninjutsu"
Rotten,"""If this guy is so dangerous, maybe we shouldn't be saying his name so mucb?""

""Gotta shake the tree to get the apple"".

""Or we can just climb the treee"".

""What tree?""

""....the apple tree. You just said it!"""
Rotten,"This show is at the same time one of the most predictable and one of the most enjoyable things I've ever watched! Pure, simple fun for the whole family

P.S. how many cameos are left? Are we getting Hilary Swank next season?"
Rotten,"Spoilers for season 5, I guess.  

Finally Tori starts acting like something resembling a human being!  Took her long enough.  Really good season all in all, even with Silver and his Evil Asian Henchwoman descending into cartoon villainy.  Really liked the way they incorporated the final two Part 3 characters into the show - no fuss or big set-up.  Like we gotta go see that douchebag who fought for Terry in the movie - yo Mike Barnes!  And especially the way Daniel’s non-girlfriend, Jessica came into it and their history - was expecting a repeat of the Elisabeth Shue scenes, which would have been clumsy and redundant, but nope.  Their use of her worked so well."
Rotten,"I just watched episode five and it was fantastic. There’s a scene that finally happened and it only took like three seasons for it to happen but yes, we’re finally past the initial drama."
Rotten,"show gets good rotten tomatoes score: it must be amazing! 100%!

show gets bad rotten tomatoes score: RT is bad for television. they don't get the whole season. it's not a good source to use except for movies."
Rotten,I still don't like Daniel's children
Rotten,"I'm halfway through S5. So far, it is better than the first half of S4 was. But S4 finished strong, so it remains to be seen whether S5 can match the pace."
Rotten,"Watched first two episodes. Daniel is still an annoying douche and Chozen rules. 

Johnny and Chozen are kinda showing Daniel really was the shit they thought he was back in the day."
Rotten,Cobra Kai is professional wrestling in a tv show with karate and I love it. Everything these days has to be taken seriously but this show is just good clean fun with perfect call backs and double crosses
Rotten,This show is over the top and I am here for it!
Rotten,"best show on tv, ain't even kidding"
Rotten,Will someone tell me what this show is like?
Rotten,"Definitely a solid season but after not having much to complain about for the first four, I didn't think this nailed it as well. There were a few weird writing issues that weren't huge but didn't feel right."
Rotten,I lost interest awhile back
Rotten,I watched the first few episodes last night and was underwhelmed. I’m hoping it gets better.
Rotten,These last two seasons on Netflix have seen a massive decrease in production quality but thankfully the writing and acting is still a lot of fun to watch.
Rotten,"I've said this somewhere before, I'd love to see a ""young John Kreese"" series about his time in 'Nam. 

Episodic; no arc (or at most, a very loose arc). One or two karate fights per episode, basically just him getting by in that crazy war zone during that crazy time in our history. 


Some episodes take place in combat, other's while he's on missons or patrol, others while he's on R&R, etc. There's *tons* of stuff they could do."
Rotten,"Proof rotten tomatoes is inaccurate when it comes to ratings. Big fan of cobra kai, but this is the worst season imo. It's repetitive 6 episodes in."
Rotten,I like all of the drunk driving they do in this season.
Rotten,"LOL, only watched episode 1, but had a good laugh when he bought the cheap cell phone in Mexico with ""60 minutos.  That's 300 American minutes.""  LMFAO, I love Johnny."
Rotten,"Literally everyone in this show, as of the finale, has committed ***multiple serious crimes***, >!now including attempted murder!<. 

I love it. Fuck reality. This is what we deserve."
Rotten,">I also appreciate the respect for the Conservation of Ninjutsu

Late to the party, but this is exactly what I thought of watching the last episode. >!Chozen and Johnny struggle against the blind generic villain #1, but Johnny can fight off him and 4 buddies alone. Or maybe Johnny is just using Drunken Master style!<

https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu for those unfamiliar."
Rotten,"I'm gonna shake the tree from the roots and rake up the fruits, rip it up out of the ground, find out what's going down. Don't worry about tomorrow, Mama, because tonight..."
Rotten,I would like to see more Elisabeth Shue because… it’s Elisabeth Shue
Rotten,"Definitely. This season I found myself noticing how repetitive the writing is, but I still managed to binge the entire season already...so that speaks for itself!"
Rotten,The creators and Swank have both expressed hope that this can happen. So maybe?
Rotten,"Neil Patrick Harris as himself as a nod to that very clever episode in HIMYM that may or may not have helped inspire this all (I've never quite seen a definitive answer to this either way). If not as himself, as someone else perhaps?"
Rotten,At the end of Season One I feared a CGI Miyagi was coming in the future
Rotten,"That's if you like the show. If you dislike the show:

Show gets good score: ""Oh, they must have rigged the reviews! It must be some big corporation swinging around their influence.""

Show gets bad score: ""Well, of course. The show sucks."""
Rotten,"TV shows sequels usually get high scores on RT because it's from the people that already like the show...Go look Arrows and The Flash scores.

And it depends on the show, Netflix does give the whole season to review most of the time."
Rotten,"Arrow Season 4 has 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

That says it all."
Rotten,"A tv show getting a 100 percent rating on RT is like a movie getting a ten minute standing ovation at Venice. There would be a lot less of these articles if they reported the Metacritic rating, which is a respectable but not headline worthy 78."
Rotten,Especially his son.
Rotten,Unpopular opinion but i actually really like samantha
Rotten,I liked Chozen so much this season!
Rotten,It’s literally replaying the events of the movie that Terry Silver was part of except now they’re adults. The show directly will say this to you in the next episode or two. It’s very on purpose.
Rotten,"It really is. 

It's not a miserable downer, it's a carefully crafted piece of joyful entertainment. I can't even think of another show like it."
Rotten,"It's basically a live action anime/soap opera about warring karate dojos that doesn't take it self all that seriously. 

There's going to be some real world logic things you have to overlook because the karate is more important than the idea that cops might get involved and we will get bogged down in legal shit. If you can accept that they take Karate as seriously as YuGiOh takes a card game, then you will probably enjoy it. If you need a show to have flawless real world logic and be a prestige drama, look for something else. 

It's turn your brain off fun with likable characters and love to hate villains. The stength of the show is that you have a pretty large cast of developed characters who switch positions a lot so that every interaction is fun and meaningful because there really aren't throwaway characters that nobody cares about."
Rotten,"being a half-hour comedy, it keeps thing very light. You don't get the prestige drama feel where they really explore issues. You get a few lines of dialogue to get the point across of what the characters are feeling and then things move onto the next scene. Much of the acting is sub-par and there is no shortage of silly scenes.

All that being said, it's a great show. It has it's heart in the right place and many of the jokes land very well. This show is worth watching for William Zabka. It perfectly straddles the line between paying tribute to a classic while also making it feel fresh, something which no other 'sequel to a classic' has managed to pull off except for Top Gun Maverick."
Rotten,An 80s-90s karate drama.
Rotten,"It's like the movies, but updated for the times."
Rotten,just wait til you hear him convert Pesos to Dollars
Rotten,"It literally happened in the movies, which they reference the events of multiple times. 

The parts to focus on aren't the unrealistic law breaking. That's just an element of how this universe works."
Rotten,"Except Terry silver, who has only been proven to have committed conspiracy to file a false police report. Probably endangering the welfare of a minor.  Terry is rich, he definitely isn't going to jail for all the attempted murder of people breaking into his home and businesses and attacking him. 

I don't even remember what Kreese did prior to the finale."
Rotten,"Shoo, Shue!"
Rotten,It’s not like she’s doing anything else but polishing her multiple Oscars.
Rotten,I was wondering the same thing.
Rotten,Of course Amazon is rigging reviews for RoP.
Rotten,"well yeah, that's how personal opinions work"
Rotten,Sigh... DanielSon
Rotten,That’s purposeful tho
Rotten,LaPusso
Rotten,She is much better this season
Rotten,She’s gotten quite thicc
Rotten,"You're not alone.  I like she still has the strong defense in her fighting style, and it came into play"
Rotten,Chozen is amazing and I was very happy at the end of the season.
Rotten,"Ted Lasso springs to mind, minus the violence."
Rotten,All you say is true but also the show is surprisingly interesting take on transgenerational trauma.
Rotten,">It's basically a live action anime/soap opera

It's just 90210 but with karate."
Rotten,"tbh they both got better, but I still don't like them"
Rotten,And bullying.
Rotten,"And rightly so. It's so good, I actually put my smartphone to the side because I wanted to give it my full attention. Something that hasn't happened in a long time."
Rotten,"That isn't very rare for a TV show on RT. I'm sure it's a good show, but dumb headline."
Rotten,"I wonder if there's a level of selection happening with this, where the people who wouldn't like it wouldn't watch it. Like, I have basically no interest in any show about romance, add in teens and that turns into ""yikes, no thanks"". Since I'm not going to watch it, I'm incapable of giving it a negative review.

Give me a gay teen romance set in a post apocalyptic space station with ghouls hunting the last remnants of mankind and we'll talk."
Rotten,"Tv shows getting a 100% on rotten tomatoes is not rare, im sure it’s a good show and lgbtq+ are glad for the representation but headlines like this are intentionally misleading and exaggerated to prop up a show which does the show itself a disservice"
Rotten,What's with all the negativity in this thread? Can't we just be happy the cute little show is doing well?
Rotten,"Far from perfect but a nice teen romance, and first time someone comes up as bisexual and people acknowledge it without saying bs like “you are confused, you need to choose”, so that is historical. There were maybe too many cliches, and I would like more space for some characters and development."
Rotten,Can't wait for Netflix to cancel it!
Rotten,"Arrow season 4 and Supergirl season 2 had 100% on Rotten Tomatoes for months

RT is as useless for TV as this headline"
Rotten,How’s that possible ? Reddit told be Netflix had no content
Rotten,Can't wait for the rioting when they cancel it after season 2
Rotten,"Saw the trailer, not got me but hope people enjoy it"
Rotten,deserved. its amazing and also helped me determine my sexuality for sure!
Rotten,Since when does anyone care for rotten tomatoes scores? It's Well known that they are pure politics
Rotten,The show is ACTUALLY really good!
Rotten,"Saw a few episodes, horrible writing."
Rotten,"Yeah, I've checked it out on Netflix without any prior knowledge. Seen 2 episodes, it was okay...

I think this shows gets so much praise because people feel the need to support the idea and the message behind this show rather than judge this show by itself. How do you call the ""affirmative action"" in this context, English is not my first language, I wonder if you have a special word for it?
 
I don't know if that's good or bad, time will show. But I feel that some may exploit this to fill the niche with subpar products knowing that no-one would dare to speak their mind."
Rotten,Well deserved
Rotten,"If I'm not usually that into romances is this worth watching still. I did enjoy Trying which does have a fair bit of romance, but found Normal People boring. So I guess I like more comedic ones better."
Rotten,It’s gonna get cancelled June 1st after Netflix tweets “Happy Pride Month”
Rotten,"And sitting at 9.1 on imdb. I know, I know. But, yeah, it's the perfect show. ❤"
Rotten,"The show is cheeks, me and my girl watched it, it’s awful, don’t let RT lie to y’all 💀"
Rotten,And it’s canceled.
Rotten,Yea all you need to do to get a 100% on RT is involving LGBT in it
Rotten,"RT is just not a good way to judge quality, the percentage doesn’t mean anything and totally depends on who reviewed and how many reviewers there are. Frequently you get 100% or 95%+ or something with a small number of reviewers and then when you drill down on what outlets these people are from you’re often wondering who are they and how are they qualified to be critics. For this show, who are these people? 

I don’t use RT but I have struggled to see any merit in it whatsoever for people to use it like we do. This being a funny example because I see the same reviewer, reviewing it multiple times under different publications. How often does that happen? This headline grabbed my attention, clearly.

Why does anyone ever care what RT has a thing at? The flaws with the platform are so glaring to me."
Rotten,"RT is a dogshit website. Black Panther has a 96% on there despite having literal worse than PS3 CGI graphics  for the last third of the movie. 

Not surprising at all that an all gay show gets a a 100% from “professional” critics."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Seinfeld also got Richards onto Letterman's show very quickly after the event:

https://youtu.be/IwBoVZh1ruQ"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I hear he’s a great tipper too.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I never figured him as a master chess player.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Great episode.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Despite everything, I never had the impression that Michael Richards was racist. He was someone who was unskilled in stand-up comedy and panicked when he was getting heckled and said some truly shitty things"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Hardcore Seinfeld nerd here: i couldn’t watch the show for many years after the heckling incident. I didn’t buy the letterman song and dance. 

It wasn’t just the n word — which in itself is bizarre that he would go to that — it was the “hanging from a tree with a fork up your ass” flourish. 

I understand saying hurtful things in the moment we don’t mean. I’ve done it more times than i can count. The n word and the imagery, though. 

I’m back on the show, and can look at Kramer’s face now without thinking of it. 

But judging from his spontaneous racist lynching insult fantasy, that guy can get bent."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I think what he said came from a place of racist intent. You can have a fit of rage without going to that place.

NOW... that's not to say you can't change. Michael Richards and anyone like him is capable of looking inwards at their demons and coming out a better person.

I hope he did and I hope he is a better person for it."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I love this episode cause of Richards’ moment of senility where he thinks Sugar Ray still lives in the same house lol.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Jerry looked like a complete idiot by bringing Richards on Lettermen. It was a masterclass in victimizing an unhinged racist. Rather than making the moment about the people he hurt, Jerry decided to throw a big pity party for poor ol' Michael. Jerry is a fucking loser that only defended his friend because of his own demons (having sex with teenagers)."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,He should have done an episode with Shoshanna
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"If he had stopped in his outburst right around the time when he said ""You see?  Those words scare you."", he could have turned it into a monologue about how words can hurt, but they are just words, then made fun of racists.

But he went the other way.  Waaayyyy the other way."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"you're a rube. it might be a masterclass in loyalty, but it's also a masterclass in helping avoid responsibility. saying words of apology don't absolve you or rectify the harm you've caused. michael richards should be shunned in public with a ruined reputation, and any time he's seen publicly should be doing work to rectify the harm he caused/perpetuated."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I think Seinfeld sticking by his side is a moral failling on his part. Whitewashing extreme unhinged racism just because the racist is his friend.

&#x200B;

Richards is not owed a platform or celebrity"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Well they did live across the hall from each other for many years.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I think that Michael Richards' true redemption came when he left that $10,000 tip at Joe K's Deli."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I remember. And Jerry told the crowd not to laugh.
Whew. The cringe was real"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Thanks for reminding me of this. He is clearly introverted, and these are some hard-to-deliver statements he gives. 

Celebrities addressing fuckups with effectively ""I'm doing this because I got caught"" seems to be pervasive, but this example seems genuine."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"$10,000 at Joe K's Deli!"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I love the whole depiction of the savant, it's such a perfect snapshot of that character. You just 'get it'."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"The thing is, he’s claimed that he got worked up and “said some things” or whatever, the usual “it’s not who I am” thing. But if you actually listen to the recording, he doesn’t just say the n word or something like that, he literally opens by telling them that “fifty years ago we’d have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass!”, calling him the n word over and over, literally mocking the audience for being shocked by “what’s buried beneath” (his exact wording). This wasn’t just him “going too far”, this was a fucking dam breaking. Everything I’ve seen with him talking about it has tried to make it sound like some too off-color lines he said on a particularly bad night as opposed to a racially-charged meltdown. Obviously I don’t fucking know the man, but I can’t assume that he’s “learned” since then if he doesn’t even seem to recognize the root problem."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Mate, if your response when a black person heckles you is to say this;

""You can talk, you can talk, you're brave now motherfucker. Throw his ass out. He's a (n-word)! He's a (n-word)! He's a (n-word)! A (n-word), look, there's a (n-word)!""

And

""Fifty years ago we'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass.""

Then you're a racist.

EDIT: Or at least you were at the time. I'm not going to pretend to know Richard's views now, and I don't necessarily think he should still be a pariah. But trying to argue he wasn't racist at the time is ... well it's a bit odd."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Ah, I'd say that it was a great example of how racism is pretty much omnipresent in American culture, if not all cultures. Why did he say those things when he panicked? Why did he go that way? Because he had thought patterns that can only be described as racist. He might not have said those things because he has a fundamental belief in white supremacy, but he was definitely willing to ""go there"" in the moment because he felt it advantaged him. Being willing to use the white supremacist culture to your advantage while not being a true believer doesn't really make you better than a true believer."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"> He was someone who was unskilled in stand-up comedy

He started working as a stand-up comic in 1975.

He was outed as a racist in 2006.

31 years is a long time."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Didn't he threaten to lynch some black dudes?
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Ya my anxiety always makes me drop N bombs.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Richards unskilled at stand up? He only had 30 years of stand up experience. The dumbest excuse ever.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Agreed. I think humans are predisposed to potentially say racist things as, from an early age, we naturally classify the world around us differently than other beings. As adults I believe we should be held accountable, but we should also be offered the opportunity to redeem ourselves."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I could be as mad as hell at a Black person and never use that kind of language because I don't use that kind of language. It doesn't just come out when you're mad unless it was already in you to begin with, which means you are a racist."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Wait… what? How can you honestly look at Kramer’s face without thinking about it? 

Asking for a friend. A friend who had Seinfeld (the show) ruined forever by this event… :/"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Nope...Jay Mohr haha
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"This is the wrong outlook. People deserve second chances. By your logic everyone in jail should be executed or thrown in prison locked away forever.

He said bad things over a decade ago.  He apologized. He's not marching with nazis or joining the kkk."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Jerry telling me ""stop laughing it's not funny"" was one of the funniest things he's ever said"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Yeah, at the time I remember thinking, ""You'd better be glad those people are inclined to laugh for Michael Richards against all reason; that's the only thing that may save him."""
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I think they laughed at how he said Afro-Americans
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Most of that crowd hadn’t heard about what happened yet and thought they were watching a comedy sketch.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"This was before video sharing became big, so a lot of people didn't know what it was all about."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Yep. And this letterman appearance is what really made me think the same thing you’re thinking about Richards’ comedians in cars ep. For Seinfeld to do this right after it happened is really sticking his neck out there. Even friends would’ve distanced themselves from someone like that during controversy like that. But this dude not only sticks with him but goes on one of the most watched shows in the country to help him apologize publicly and save some face. Talk about a huge gesture.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"It's funny because his intent was to shock them into silence and the ""fork in your ass"" comment actually makes the crowd laugh. Then he just starts screaming the N Word like a child and he loses them."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Reddit is obsessed with forgiving racists. This thread is wild.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,yeah I dont exactly see why its so good to forgive this guy and try to rehabilitate him
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"All of the language is hugely racist in what it's saying, but I think that's different than the person actually harboring hate for any group (aka: being a racist). 

You see this shit with edgy teenagers all the time in video games. It's just an attempt to make someone else upset since they've upset you. Richards seemed like he just thought this would make the other person upset."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Geez don't hold a grudge or anything.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"The fact that *that* is what pops into his mind when dealing with a black heckler says everything. His first “panic” response is to make a joke about lynching and say the n word like 6 times? That’s his default response when dealing with a person who is black who he doesn’t like?

For those who think that’s *normal*, seriously reevaluate your thought processes, because that’s exactly what people mean when they talk about implicit racism and implicit bias. Extremely fucked up."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"It's only racist if he actually believes it.

He was trying to be shocking.

Something I never see anyone being up in regards to Richards was how a couple of years before this Bob Saget returned to standup and he tried to be as shocking as possible to get away from the Full House and AFV image he had. So he'd go on stage and talk about how he used to fuck the Olsen Twins and Kimmy Gibler when they were still kids.

And that comedy worked for him, it gave him a big audience. I'm pretty sure Richards had that in the back of his mind when he did his set.

edit: and so the brigade is here. odd how a post can be up for two hours and be at +9 then in the span of ten minutes it's at -7."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I don't agree. The language is racist, saying any of those things is racist. 

But just like a teenager threatens violence, it's not like they're actually going to kill you for fucking up a play in a video game. 

Richards says all those things because he thinks it will hurt the other person as much as they've hurt him and this is the only way he knows how."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,A fork? Does he think black people are meatballs?
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I'm puzzled at the downvotes for your pretty sound take, full of things that are almost universally accepted. I assume they're thinking that all bigoted thoughts or vocalised opinions stem from a proper racist view of the world, as apposed to maybe believing in some racist stereotypes to a degree and understanding the damage those ideas can have.

Like, I can believe if a man was drunk and in a heated argument with an attractive older woman and in the heat of the moment called her desperate and unappealing to men, that he may have held some sexist ideas but more than that he knew saying what he did would help him win.

Note to whoever's reading this, I'm not saying guys are never sexist or anything like that. Insults and violent words may or may not stem from ideological hatred."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"It’s not as uncommon as you think for someone in a fit of rage to try and go for the heaviest blow they can deliver to the person they’re mad at. It could be appearance, family, disability, religion or really anything."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Yeah these guys are giving Kramer grace. Ok whatever. 
Black guy in the audience: ""my friend said you're not funny'
""Oh yeah?If this were 50 years ago you'd be hanging from a tree with a fork in your ass""
😮"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,yeah... feels very 'reddit' in here for lack of a better word.  This site has its issues.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">predisposed to potentially say racist things as, from an early age,

 A baby will suck the titty off of any human presented and it doesn't even need to be particularly hungry. We just don't have this particular problem until our admittedly tainted human predispositions start affecting our growth, and that is cultural :/"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Not trying to be difficult but you might want to save that pet theory for private conversations with only people you trust, because that is a bad take — at best."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"If you explode into a racist tirade simply because somebody was being annoying it’s probably because you’re a racist. 

He didn’t just happen to say all that horrible shit for the first time ever that night. His apology was such a load of shit."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,exactly. “I’m only racist if you were mean to me” isn’t the defense a lot of people are saying it is.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Not OP but...  It's really easy for me.  I've never in my life had fictional media badly damaged by anything the real person did.  They aren't the images I'm seeing on screen, and I don't strongly associate anything I know about them in real life to it in the moment.  I don't know how to explain it better than that though - it isn't a technique or trick, it's just how I am."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Its sort of like Celine or woody Allen. Mind blowing novelist and filmmaker. Also a nazi and a pervert. People with serious problems can do amazing and beautiful things. If we reject their brilliance because of their personal failings we become as hard and cold as they are. I love Seinfeld. It is nothing but joy for me. Kramer is hilarious. The actor I’m not going to hire to watch my cat while I’m out of town, but i crack up every time watching him chug a beer whilst puffing a cig."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"yes, he should be doing work to rectify harm he caused, did he do that? or is time passing enough to erase it?"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"They laughed at the whole thing. If you didn't tell people what you were showing them, they'd think that whole interview was a Kramer bit. It was handled incredibly poorly by Michael Richards lol"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"No, it was on Tmz that day. It was known. I remember vividly"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,It definitely seems like most of the crowd just didn’t really know how to respond at first. By the time he got to all the “what’s beneath” stuff he’d completely turned the audience against himself.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">Reddit is obsessed with forgiving racists.

Really?  I thought Reddit was obsessed with NEVER forgiving racists.  No path to redemption for either racism or cheating on your partner on Reddit as far I've observed.  No passage of years or personal growth is enough, you're just damned forever."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,This is probably the most inaccurate thing I have seen said about Reddit in the ~ 7 years I have been on it.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Forgiveness is good.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">It's only racist if he actually believes it.

No it's still pretty fucking racist regardless. 

>He was trying to be shocking.

You could maybe make that defence if he had actually told a joke instead of going on a racist tirade against some people he was mad at."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">It's only racist if he actually believes it.

He probably did tbh. Can't imagine why I'd give him the benefit of the doubt."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Believe it or not, saying racist things to people because you know it will hurt them makes you a racist."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">	he may have held some sexist ideas but more than that he knew saying what he did would help him win.

Yeah in both your example and I think Richards case, the goal is to hurt feelings. Most likely not some deep down hatred but lashing out at rejection (in the most petulant way possible)"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Oh okay so childish and stupid but also racist. Gotcha.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"He's not racist! He just decided to call a black person the N word because it would hurt their feelings the most! 

Reddit dumb af lmao."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,[deleted]
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,People are way too busy excusing his use of the n word to pay attention to the other racist shit
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I just watched it again...he was fully unhinged, and what he said is really fucked up. Still stand by my position on the importance of the ep."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,What a weightless copout
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"It looks like a reasonable take to me if I'm interpreting it correctly, ie: people see the world through categories and similarity/difference, in turn othering what is not the same as you. We see this with teenagers around what's cool/uncool, weird/normal etc.

When I was a kid it was standard practice to be racist; mostly light racism but all stemming from that *othering* of whoever and whatever isn't the same as you.

Saying *""predisposed to potentially say racist things""* quite easily gives off the impression that it's *normal* to be racist, which it is not, obviously. But if u/formula_F300 is talking about growing up in an environment where it's standard practice to *other* anything that you don't consider normal/acceptable, then I understand their thinking around having empathy and giving people an opportunity to learn and change.

As for Michael, it wouldn't surprise me if he had some racist ideas; though whether those ideas floating around his head were worse than others his age I don't know. I haven't seen this apology video or anything regarding this situation in a long time, but if somebody was hypothetically insincere in their apology then there's no need to forgive them. If they were sincere, well, I'm more forgiving than most - coming from a place of privilege (may as well mention that context)."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"God I’m jealous of you… RIP so much content, including Louis which was one of my fave series on TV - until it wasn’t :("
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"And now for my Woody Allen impression

""I'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls"""
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Wait what did Celine do to be put in the same sentence as child rapist woody Allen?
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"He may or may not have done anything. That's for him to know. All we can do now is move on. Like I said, as we understand it, he made a racist tirade almost twenty years ago. Nothing more. Nothing less. He didn't go on fox news and continue to spread hate. He didn't March against anybody or anything that we know of. He apologized."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Most people didn't. It was mostly entertainment news. That was my point.

New media destroyed an old media star. That was interesting."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Name someone that genuinely redeemed their racist past that Reddit hasn't forgiven. I'll wait.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Its not his god given right to be a rich tv comedian, and we all have to support that or we're bad people.  I don't get it, he is allowed to go off and be a normal person, hell, better than normal because he'll never have to get a job ever.  He can die rich, and be forgotten.  Theres ""Forgiveness"" and then theres this weird thing people do where they act like some people have a right to be famous."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"He was trying to do shock comedy. He failed, sure, but he tried."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,">He probably did tbh.

There's no reason to believe that. If it was his reaction to someone bumping into him on the street I'd agree with you but he was on a stage where the point is to get a reaction from the audience.

>Can't imagine why I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.

As far as we know, this was a one time thing. There weren't several allegations that came out after saying that's what he's actually like."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"It's actually not. Racist means you hate, believe you're superior to, or fear a race. None of those apply here.

Words matter, stop spewing random shit just because it makes you feel morally superior."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I've been way more angry and hurt than this dude and I've never in my worst moments resorted to racism or sexism.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I’d counter and say a dumb person doesn’t realize there’s nuance to every action.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Yes, actually. Racism implies that he did something out of either hatred, fear, or beliefs of superiority against another race. 

It's entirely possible that he has absolutely zero problems with black people, but knew that these racist insults (they are undeniably racist) would hurt this person more than anything else he could have said. 

Have you ever played a video game and had a 13 year old threaten to kill you? We all know they don't actually want to kill you, they're just angry and don't know how to handle their anger."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"He said heaviest not funniest—meaning, which will hurt the most"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,That's exactly what they're avoiding.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,The importance of coddling racists?
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"The episode might have been great if Seinfeld had driven in the car with the men Richards insulted.

Richards had his chance."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Yeah I sense some whitewashing here. First what he said wasn't merely fucked up. It was specific. Graphic. And racist as hell. 
He didn't re-introduce himself on Letterman. We ""met"" him earlier that day. Like, wow, THAT isn't Kramer. That's Michael."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"they hate jazz, what do you expect"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Same. I can’t watch Louie, House of Cards, or Lethal Weapon.

I still listen to Michael Jackson, though. Maybe because he’s dead."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I don't watch Seinfeld reruns because of that racist cunt and I grew up on that show (i just can't). You ain't the weird one lol...
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"I’m still not there with Louis. Great show, brilliant guy, the allegations fall short of genocide, but still, creeps me out. Maybe one day I’ll go back."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,This question makes no sense.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Reddit (in general, there are obviously exceptions) is viciously unforgiving towards people in the public eye who have committed some sort of indiscretion.    This comment seems to go against what your original comment I replied to says.  I'm not sure I am following."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"He was hurling racial abuse at people who upset him, maybe he was trying to do it in a ""funny"" way to win the crowd over but it's still an extremely racist thing to do."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"lol, you can literally scream at black people calling them the N word and talk about hanging them from trees, but as long as you do it just once you're not racist. Sorry, but you sound like an absolute chump and a mark."
Devilman Crybaby,"I remember there being an episode of Steven Universe where they brought the director of Kill La Kill or some other Trigger anime, and the difference in animation was like night and day, and all he did were the storyboards. I think it was the episode with Connie hitting someone at school and then Garnet started singing about thoughts or something. "
Devilman Crybaby,Ping pong might be my favorite anime. Top 3 for sure. 
Devilman Crybaby,The first time I watched this episode I was high as fuck and man is this episode something when high.
Devilman Crybaby,This episode is awesome
Devilman Crybaby,This episode was downright hilarious. 
Devilman Crybaby,The art in this was fantastic
Devilman Crybaby,This was one of my least favorite episodes too.
Devilman Crybaby,God I fucking miss this show. Only one episode that I would consider not good in the entire series and it was a different guest animated one so it wasnt cannon anyway (waterpark one). The other guest animated ones have been really enjoyable too. 
Devilman Crybaby,One of the best episodes imo
Devilman Crybaby,"Yep, Takafumi Hori from Trigger. The *general* animation wasn’t super different (at least, as different as this AT ep and normal eps) but it was way more fluid. The man really knows how to animate action. It also helps that there was a lot *to* animate in the episode: the fighting, then the butterfly scene, then the visions near the end of the episode.  
  
But yea, the quality was 👌👌👌"
Devilman Crybaby,"[Scene from the episode for anyone interested](https://youtu.be/dHg50mdODFM)

Some absolutely gorgeous work"
Devilman Crybaby,She started singing about thots actually. You're totally right though that episode was gorgeous. I remember some shot or effect with butterflies and it being streets ahead of other SU episodes.
Devilman Crybaby,Hey Smile! Did you know blood tastes like iron?!
Devilman Crybaby, Adventure time is over I believe
Devilman Crybaby,"weird, it was one of my favorites. it felt like it could be used as an educational tool for kids outside of the context of the show, but maybe im remembering it wrong. i think it was a beautiful children's story about the food chain and life. philosophically it ran deep when they would depict the characters living through various past-life forms, so there was a lot for an adult to unpackage as well. 

i only saw this episode once and if im recalling it correctly, it made quite the mark on me. "
Devilman Crybaby,"Yeah, there’s a weird anthology of super absurd and random episodes like this one. I think they were all done by guest animators. But they were always my least favorite episodes because they felt like such vanity projects. I also think this show was at its worst when it did weird for the sake of being weird. That CGI one where princess bubblegum was eating her own hair (“a glitch is a glitch” or something like that) was just dreadful imo. Out of all of those, this episode was probably my favorite though, or at least the most enjoyable compared to the others. "
Devilman Crybaby,"Yh it was kind of just a weird drug trip. Super different in tone to usual AT eps. Then again some of AT’s best were the ones that were more low-key ones, barring the finale: Simon and Marcy, I Remember You, Islands, Stakes, etc. Like, they were out there, but they never need to go *hyper* like this episode to be entertaining. This was just a confusing change in tone and style that didn’t really work. But hey, not all experiments work. And it’s not as bad as \*shudders* the Water Park episode "
Devilman Crybaby,"Yeah the animation was kinda the same because it was the same studio producing it, and all he did was just basically tell them how he wanted it animated and how the characters should look, something that the Steven Universe crew sucks at. "
Devilman Crybaby,"One of my favorite scenes and songs from the show.

I also really really wish Estelle could do a whole album in Sugar's style... I like her a lot as an artist, but I want an entire Garnet-like album, though separated from SU. "
Devilman Crybaby,"Right, I forgot."
Devilman Crybaby,Also one of my favorites. 
Devilman Crybaby,I learned about this from pewdie pie 
Devilman Crybaby,"I'd say it's a notch below great.  Parts of it are great, and it approaches greatness throughout most of the run, but it has pacing issues both within the whole series as well as in several episodes that keep it from being truly great.  It's a show that actually could have used two or three more episodes.  All of the fight scenes feel rushed and there's a few minor characters, if given more screen time, that could have really done a lot of good in really exploring and explaining this world.  

That being said, it's absolutely worth a watch, and the ending is superb."
Devilman Crybaby,Castlevania? Voltron?
Devilman Crybaby,Are you shit talking neo yokio
Devilman Crybaby,"I've watched the few episodes, and I'll definately return to finish it, but it's tone and dialogue are just very jarring."
Devilman Crybaby,[deleted]
Devilman Crybaby,"They're good shows, but not made in Japan."
Devilman Crybaby,Those aren't anime.
Devilman Crybaby,"Castlevania was great as well, but I can see making a distinction because of its western creation (even though the source material is Japanese). "
Devilman Crybaby,This is better than either
Devilman Crybaby,Those are not great. Devilman was a revelation. 1/3 anime (other being Cowboy Bebop and Grave of the Fireflies) to really mo e me emotionally. The ending is incredibly powerful.
Devilman Crybaby,Neo yokio is terrible?
Devilman Crybaby,Yeah bushnell mullins is a stupid name 
Devilman Crybaby,What's the distinction?
Devilman Crybaby,I wonder this too. It's all cartoons as far as I can see. Animation style perhaps?
Devilman Crybaby,Anime is Japanese animation. People just refer to any anime thay doesn't look cartoony as anime when that's incorrect. 
Devilman Crybaby,"Well i mean, Japanese people refer to anime as encompassing all animation (including cartoons) so it's more subjective than you're making it out to be."
Devilman Crybaby,Thanks for the explanation.
Devilman Crybaby,"> Well i mean, Japanese people refer to anime as encompassing all animation (including cartoons) so it's more subjective than you're making it out to be.

I'm not saying a cartoon can't be anime. I'm saying people say any type of animation that is very detailed is anime. And while Japan refers to all animation as anime, outside of Japan, anime is only animation from Japan. "
Devilman Crybaby,"Currently watching it. The theme song is fucking dope.

EDIT: Saw a guy get bit in half by a vagina demon. I'm in."
Devilman Crybaby,"Just saw the first episode and it was fucking wild.

The English dub is pretty great too. There is also a French, German, and Spanish dub."
Devilman Crybaby,"That **one** scene in the first episode is like an anime version Rick & Morty Cronenbergs, except WAYYYYYYYYY more violent. I mean, JESUS. On that note, the animation kind of reminds me of a mix between Space Dandy and Lastman. So far so good.

EDIT: Watched a few more. Not a big fan. Thought is was too sexual for them to be high school students. I liked the style and some of the gory parts were interesting. Too much nudity for me honestly, and it didn't do anything to progress the story."
Devilman Crybaby,Good to hear! Big fan of Go Nagai.
Devilman Crybaby,I will watch it this weekend 
Devilman Crybaby,I thought this was the name of a computer virus.
Devilman Crybaby,"just watched the first two episodes, it's freaking awesome. "
Devilman Crybaby,"""Do you think demons are capable of love?""

That's some Solid Snake tier quality writing right there."
Devilman Crybaby,"Oh I thought this would be a parody of the Devil May Cry series...

*Edit* -
Suuure downvote the guy who has a passing knowledge of Japanese media and read the title when he'd just woken up. Oh look at me I'm the bad guy la-dee-da ya porridge brained berks.

"
Devilman Crybaby,That English voice acting was disgusting.
Devilman Crybaby,Y u no speak Japanese?!
Devilman Crybaby,"I like it so far through 2 episodes, but their animation budget looks pitiful. Even the 3 old OVAs look better."
Devilman Crybaby,"Frankly, it wouldn't be Go Nagai otherwise."
Devilman Crybaby,Agreed. It was insane. Very weird and hyper-violent/sexual though Incase anyone doesn’t like that sort of thing.
Devilman Crybaby,">The English dub is pretty great too

I question how good the show actually is after reading this. You call that dub ""pretty great""? I just watched the trailer and that dub was dog shit. By what standard is it great?"
Devilman Crybaby,True to the source material in spirit though.
Devilman Crybaby,"Naw, Devilman is old school. Originally from '72 so the animation looks like a [Satanic Speed Racer.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uRjjb0Z-25o) Given the hero is demonically possessed I guess it's not hard to see why it didn't make a jump to the US like Speed Racer, Macross, and Voltron."
Devilman Crybaby,"Right? Yet somehow the top comment in this thread is calling the English dub ""pretty great"". It's fucking awful. "
Devilman Crybaby,Its great if you're not a weeaboo.
Devilman Crybaby,I mean Ghost Rider was big during the same time frame.
Devilman Crybaby,"Hey totally off topic, but I just finished the series and had a question for someone who knows the shows history. Were the clips of that Devilman TV show that Rio and Taido (sp?? The younger son/brother that “likes” dogs) were watching from the older anime or manga? "
Devilman Crybaby,"Top commenter here. How is the dub ""fucking awful?"" The voices match up pretty well and the performances are really good. Do you watch dubs?"
Devilman Crybaby,"What does Japanese culture have to do with this? If anyone in an actual film or TV show delivered their lines like the ones from the trailer, they'd be laughed out of the job.

Only weeaboos are the ones trying to defend this garbage because it's anime and they're obsessed with the medium - surprise surprise, your post history confirms just that. "
Devilman Crybaby,One of the first villains is like a fully topless angel centaur lady though. 
Devilman Crybaby,"Good point. Although at that time Marvel knew college kids were reading their mags whereas the first round of anime importing was aimed squarely at kids. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure plenty of seven year olds got their hands on good 'ol Flamehead."
Devilman Crybaby,Today's standards for dubs is pretty low then. Go watch something like Cowboy Bebop or even DBZ and tell me this is anywhere near that in quality.
Devilman Crybaby,Good point - I didn’t even think of that 
Devilman Crybaby,"Cowboy Bebop is obviously a top tier dub. The original DBZ dub is pretty good, but it was rushed and pretty amateurish. The DBZ Kai dub on the other hand is great.

As for stuff near CB in quality, there's plenty. My Hero Academia, Death Note, Fate/Zero, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter x Hunter, JoJo, Kekkai Sensen, Kill la Kill, Gundam IBO, Spice and Wolf, Overlord, Samurai Champloo, Attack on Titan, Haruhi, Toradora, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Steins;Gate all have dubs ranging from pretty good to fantastic.

>Today's standards for dubs is pretty low then.

This is straight up wrong. Dubs used to be terrible. That's where the stigma against them came from. Cowboy Bebop and DBZ were outliers.

Standards for dubs nowadays are much higher and there are plenty of good dubs. The shows I mentioned above are just the ones I've seen. I've also heard great things about the dubs for Baccano, Space Dandy, and Black Lagoon."
Devilman Crybaby,"Dude, Cowboy Bebop is one of the top Dubs in Anime and has remained that way for 17 years. Few have come close to that. You're comparing an ordinary Guy with a 5 figure a year job to John Cena.

Many Anime dubs today are actually really good, but since it's Anime and there are thousands out there at once and maybe 1 in 200 are really good, then that's not really saying much."
Devilman Crybaby,"DBZ's dub was pretty terrible, though in a charming goofy kinda way. Kai's was much better. "
Devilman Crybaby,Damn. You schooled him.
Devilman Crybaby,I liked the animation style of the show but everything else made wtf. 
Devilman Crybaby,"I just watched that yesterday and the whole time I was thinking it was one of the worst anime intro's I'd ever seen. Guess we got different tastes. I've rewatched some FMA intros and Tokyo Ghoul a ton, find them much more entertaining personally. "
Devilman Crybaby,Dude I watched the whole first series just recently. That show is BONKERZ but I love it! The art style is incredible
Devilman Crybaby,What the hell is going on with that title? Anime titles in general are often weird.
Devilman Crybaby,YouTube tells me this is blocked in USA.
Devilman Crybaby,u should check out the kakeguri opening i thot it was much better.
Devilman Crybaby,Mob Psycho is better.
Devilman Crybaby,"Is it not a completed? Don't think there is going to be any 2nd season, no?"
Devilman Crybaby,I want to like it but it just seems too weird. The animation is fantastic but the story is ridiculous. 
Devilman Crybaby,"At least it's not some stupid ass shit like ""RE:/monsterHACK/xAngelx"
Devilman Crybaby,"I only saw 10 episodes on NF. And after watching, it seems pretty wrapped up. I don't see where the could go with it."
Devilman Crybaby,"Oh yeah the story is bananas. Stuff happens in leaps and bounds and characters just accept it. Its visually stunning though and really shocking in many places, I would watch it once and thats all. "
Devilman Crybaby,ok but yknow i would watch every episode of that
Devilman Crybaby,NG+
Devilman Crybaby,"You jest but

[Devilman](#s ""Every new Devilman Adaptation is heavily implied to be part of an unending cycle of Punishment for Satan similar to White Bear from Black Mirror or Preacher's Interpretation of Hell where he is forced to relive the events of Devilman repeatedly with only minor variations between each cycle."")
"
Devilman Crybaby,Hmm... haven't watched Devilman yet... GUESS I HAVE TO NOW!
Devilman Crybaby,"The manga's super influential, mostly by being batshit fucking crazy at a time when manga hadn't started habitually doing that.

The adaptions have largely shied away from what made it crazy or fucked it up. With Yuasa in charge, we might finally have the anime it deserves."
Devilman Crybaby,My only complaint with Castlevania is that I just want more.
Devilman Crybaby,"If you can take old style animation Vampire Hunter D is great, maybe my favorite anime of all time.  It really reminded me of Castlevania.    The sequel Bloodlust has better animation.  I think that most people that like this show will like Vampire Hunter D. "
Devilman Crybaby,[deleted]
Devilman Crybaby,"Is it fair to say that this is, by far, the best adaptation of a video game in any other medium to-date?

Video game movies come out, and people often hope ""Okay, this might finally be the one to make the genre take off."" And it never happens. For my money, this show is finally the one thing to absolutely nail it. With very minor tweaks, seasons 1 and 2 would have made for a very compelling blockbuster movie. Writing is everything.

Maybe between this and The Witcher (if also done well), there could be a renewed interest in taking the genre seriously, a la the super hero genre in the mid-2000s."
Devilman Crybaby,Ep 7 is so awesome. 
Devilman Crybaby,[deleted]
Devilman Crybaby,The style of Castlevania or Attack on Titan would work so freaking well with Brandon Sanderson's material. Mistborn or Stormlight Archive would be the absolute bomb if it were adapted in this way. 
Devilman Crybaby,Draculas voice actor is incredible. Each sentence is so powerful and intimidating
Devilman Crybaby,"When the action got going it was good but I honestly found it pretty dull for a fair few episodes, there definitely wasn't enough plot for 8 episodes IMO. Some of the dialogue was also pretty cringey at times and the animation was patchy in places. Episodes 6 & 7 were really good though so maybe if they managed to keep that quality for any future projects it would be worth persevering with."
Devilman Crybaby,They need more non comedic adult oriented  animated  shows. Episode 7 was a thing  of beauty.
Devilman Crybaby,"You want *another* Berserk remake!? 
  
Aiight. I dig it."
Devilman Crybaby,"I've gotta say that I was a bit disappointed with season 2. Don't get me wrong, I still did really enjoy it quite a lot, but I had a few problems with it.

While the art is beautiful and there are parts with amazing animation there's also a lot of times where the animation itself is pretty poor. Story wise the main heroes spend the vast majority of the season in one location just talking, same with the main villain. A lot of the season is instead devoted to setting up future seasons by  focusing on other characters."
The End of the F***ing World,"I binged the whole season yesterday, the episodes are only 20 minutes long and loved it. Even far removed from high school, coming of age stories still resonate.

Plus, it reminded me of one of the strangest eighties tune and then I remembered its [insane video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4T6e3GJCjow).

Can’t wait for season two."
The End of the F***ing World,I'm impressed that Sophia Lillis somehow manages to look simultaneously like a combination of Kristen Wiig and Jesse Eisenberg....
The End of the F***ing World,Great take.  I think Oleff as Stanley was a real stand out.
The End of the F***ing World,A teenage show with supernatural elements...where have I seen this before? Oh right every other week on netflix
The End of the F***ing World,"Is there a reason you write these? You think Ragnarok was bad, but IANOWT was good? What the fuck?"
The End of the F***ing World,"good review. 

disagree with the Carrie influence. pretty faithful adaptation of comic, which again, not really seeing a Carrie influence there either.

if anything it reminded me of The Untold Tales of Spiderman and Jessica Jones a little."
The End of the F***ing World,"Ragnorok is absolute garbage, and yup I Am Not Okay With this is really good (as much as it relied pretty much every highschool movie trope out there to fuel its story). If you didn't spot the big difference in quality that's on you lol."
The End of the F***ing World,"> disagree with the Carrie influence.

are you serious? what 'Carrie' do you think I'm talking about here? I'm talking about [this Carrie](https://img.resized.co/entertainment/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvczMtZXUtd2VzdC0xLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb21cXFwvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudGllXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2VcXFwvaW1hZ2VzX2NvbnRlbnRcXFwvcmVjdGFuZ2xlXFxcLzYyMHgzNzJcXFwvQ2FycmllLXN0aWxsLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjMwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cDpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5zdGFnaW5nLmVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wifSIsImhhc2giOiJhMWU3ODhiZTNjYzFjMDViNDkwYjEzYzcyY2MzMDUxYTEyZmU0MGM4In0=/carrie-1976-cinema-movie-film-review-entertainment-ie.jpg), or [this Carrie](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/0c/de/3d0cdea2883138ab0b4a6ffc13d546aa.jpg), or [this Carrie](https://www.schnittberichte.com/news/pics/carriemoretz.jpg), about a girl who discovers she has telekenitic abilities and fucks up everyone when she's humiliated at prom. Its influence is all over this."
The End of the F***ing World,b r a i n d e a d
The End of the F***ing World,You should the read the comic - you might not get that vibe.
The End of the F***ing World,"The school dance climax and that each girl has telekinetic abilities are really the only similarities.

I got the ""Carrie"" look with the blood splattered girl in the dress but I wouldn't call Not Okay With This ""inspired"" by Carrie."
The End of the F***ing World,oh you are? my bad. 😅
The End of the F***ing World,"oh you're talking just comic. sure the graphic novel gonna have a different vibe. but speaking from just the tv series perspective, very Carrie."
The End of the F***ing World,"> The school dance climax and that each girl has telekinetic abilities are really the only similarities.

I got the ""Carrie"" look with the blood splattered girl in the dress

I mean what more do ya need? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
The End of the F***ing World,based on that comeback and your shit ratings of shows its safe to say you're a highschooler
The End of the F***ing World,"see that's the thing though. the tv show is a pretty faithful adaptation. minor changes.

I think the reason you say Carrie influence was because of the end - but if you read the comic you see that was probably done to stretch the story out as the comic is super short - you can read it 15 minutes."
The End of the F***ing World,"More than that to call the entire series Carrie ""inspired."""
The End of the F***ing World,"I think amma check out that comic for real. But for the series, as I was telling the other user here, the Carrie influence is definately there. The telekinesis powers, the trauma, anger or humiliation both characters go through for those powers to activate, Syd being humiliated at homecoming (Prom) then leaving with her dress all soaked in blood. etc. 

The inspiration is obviously there man. Co-creator of the series Johnathan Entwistle even talks about the series being inspired by Carrie and Matilda [here](https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/i-am-not-okay-with-this-christy-hall-adaptation-powers-puberty-sexuality-1203512195/). 

But I said I don't care either way, once you enjoyed the series man."
The End of the F***ing World,"It's such a classic trope though, how can it *not* be Carrie inspired. Not that it's a bad show at all, but halfway through the first episode, after having seen the lead character soaked in blood followed by an untold number of references to prom, I was like ""oh, it's new-age Carrie. Cool"". It's not a bad thing. But it is very obviously inspired by Carrie."
The End of the F***ing World,"I wasn't really saying the ""entire"" thing was Carrie inspired.... I'm just saying that inspiration is obviously there. And you yourself just listed all the nods the series gave to Carrie. 

But idk man, if you think it isn't then to you it isn't. I just hope you enjoyed the series either way."
The End of the F***ing World,"It's cool. Hey, just want to say I enjoy your reviews. Hope I didn't come across as a jerk in my responses. Not trying to be."
The End of the F***ing World,"You said this in your original post.

I Am Not Okay With This channels the ethos of high school drama by taking inspiration from cult-classic teen-oriented films from the 1980s, maybe even 90s. There's even a Breakfast Club homage episode which is quite fun, **but its heaviest influence obviously comes from the Stephen King novel 'Carrie', which I assume is what the original I Am Not Okay With This graphic novel was a pastiche of.** Just like Carrie, I Am Not Okay With This is a story about the intense tug of war between trauma and control, a self-war to be specific and at the center of it is our main character. 

I took that to mean you were saying the entire series drew inspiration from the Stephen King novel, Carrie.

I disagreed.  I said only the images of the blood soaked girl at a high school dance reminded me of Carrie.  That's like one nod."
The End of the F***ing World,"Oh thanks man. And no you didn't, this was just a healthy discussion that's all it is lol."
The End of the F***ing World,"What do think ""inspired"", in this sense where a tv show takes inspiration from another tv show or movie, even means? Inspired by doesn't mean they're alike in every single detail, it doesn't mean it attempts to remake the whole thing."
The End of the F***ing World,"I know what inspiration means.  I think a few scenes were reminiscent of Carrie.  That's it.  I wouldn't call Carrie it's ""heaviest"" inspiration.  And I didn't even think the detention episode was a Breakfast Club homage. Not every group of teenagers in detention is an homage.  I feel like you were reaching for examples to make your cult classic point."
The End of the F***ing World,"> And I didn't even think the detention episode was a Breakfast Club homage.

You're just fucking with me now man. lol. You're literally the only person I've seen who didn't think it was. The TV Time comment section for that episode is mostly The Breakfast Club references. You trippin' if you didn't think Jenny was a modern-day female version of John Bender. hehe. 

But whatever man if you think it wasn't then it wasn't to you. All that matters is that you enjoyed the series."
The End of the F***ing World,Whenever I think of cannibalism I think of prions.
The End of the F***ing World,Chopped into little pieces for sure. Just not how he hoped.
The End of the F***ing World,"i loved the ""what's this?"" the guy goes ""venison""  


and then you immediately see them pulling in the dead deer that hasn't been cut up yet. i was watching with my girlfriend and she didn't immediately pick up on that ahahahahah"
The End of the F***ing World,"Her performance was so good and when David was on top of her, I kept wondering how that actor who played him continued on when she let out that scream. Holy hell, I know it's acting, but I don't know how he did it"
The End of the F***ing World,[removed]
The End of the F***ing World,easily the most CATHARTIC twenty minutes of tv I’ve seen in decades. Died when Joel called her baby girl.
The End of the F***ing World,"it's weird how 2 IPs from the same developer went into completely different paths, Uncharted went the easy cash out route but The last of Us actually put some effort into making it a thing on its own, Great Job, hope more game adaptations like this get made."
The End of the F***ing World,"I would be dead so fuckin fast in this universe. When Ellie had her gun on the preacher I was like “aw come on he’s a nice guy, he’ll help you!”

And I had somehow not made the connection that they were eating people. When Joel knifed that guy and beat the other one’s head in I was like “Wow Joel is being a real jerk”"
The End of the F***ing World,Bella Ramsey tv line performance of the week. Calling it.
The End of the F***ing World,"Pedro Pascal episode absolutely killed (quite literally too) in that interrogation scene, which is one of the most badass scenes in the game for Joel"
The End of the F***ing World,"My wife (who didn’t play the game) was saying, it’s a crazy situation because he’s [David] is just trying  to protect his people, and Ellie is just trying to protect Joel. I just nodded my head in silence.

6 minutes goes by and she see’s David’s been feeding and eating the people of the town he’s “protecting” and it dawned on my wife. She instantly cheered for Joel murdering the psychopaths who captured Ellie lol."
The End of the F***ing World,I’m still recovering from the episode. It was so intense.
The End of the F***ing World,"I knew that Bella could play this younger version of Ellie but after playing TLOU Pt. 2, I was somewhat skeptical about her playing the older version.

This episode completely put that concern to rest for me."
The End of the F***ing World,What a great show.   It shows the dark side of how a human would really act if something like this happened.  I have a buddy who won’t watch because of the episode of Franks life. Their loss!
The End of the F***ing World,She deserves an Emmy for this episode alone
The End of the F***ing World,"I like (Borderline love) this show but now that we are onto the finale, I feel like we've sped through this. Take away Frank's episode and Ellie's episode, the Sam & Henry one was almost mostly dedicated to them too, we haven't seen enough of Joel and Ellie imo. I have played the games over and over so I KNOW the dynamic but a lot people watching might not get it yet. In the game, Joel is resting up for like 2months in that house, in the show it's like a few days. Everything is on this breakneck pace. It could have benefited from being like 12 episodes long with more action in the mix."
The End of the F***ing World,My one complaint about this show is it’s gone by very quickly. I feel like this current arc with David could’ve been two episodes.
The End of the F***ing World,"Watching this episode I couldn’t help but to think of this video: [How To Write A Character Who GROWS On You (The Last of Us)](https://youtu.be/8rjnU7Gl8aI)

In the video he makes a point about how Ellie starts out as a bright-eyed girl in a world where there’s very little to be cheerful about. From the final scene with Sam onward we see that break, and this episode is the nail in the coffin imo. The biggest tragedy in this show is people losing purpose and their reason to live. All that joy and playfulness is now gone from Ellie and we truly feel it. I’m sure the next episode will really hammer this point in. Ellie’s only reason to continue on now is for Joel and the potential for her immunity to create a cure."
The End of the F***ing World,"Someone very close to me was victimized as a child. The manipulative and abusive father figure, the physical and sexual violence, even the cage. Bella went to a very dark place for this episode. Ellie may never completely recover from this, but I felt nothing but pride and victory for her at the ending. Good for you, Ellie. Good for you."
The End of the F***ing World,"The minute I saw them standing around being preached at I couldn’t. I mean, big sign, cold weather, can’t bury the dead- hello. 

I did want to see if he was going to turn from her bite. That got me curious."
The End of the F***ing World,Yet another fantastic episode. I love this show. Bella is spectacular and Pedro is…well. Daddy I guess?
The End of the F***ing World,My only annoyance about this is that if people have been gone for a long time shouldn’t the world be absolutely teeming with wildlife? Like freaking deer taking over? Why would it be hard to find?
The End of the F***ing World,Bella is so fucking good in this
The End of the F***ing World,"Guess I'll be watching this alone. Told my partner about the game and where this episode was most likely headed. 

""That was in a video game?""

He was shocked and immediately read the video game summary. So yea, I will be watching this alone tonight."
The End of the F***ing World,[removed]
The End of the F***ing World,"“It’s not code”

It was code. Lol"
The End of the F***ing World,The Book of Eli told me that cannibalism turns you into a twitchy mess. I fully expected some of the residents to show signs of this condition.
The End of the F***ing World,She played the disassociation so well. It was Matthew Modine 1000 yard stare from Full Metal Jacket levels of good.
The End of the F***ing World,"She crushed this episode! Being a fan of both games and the show, I’m happy that Bella has mastered her portrayal of Ellie."
The End of the F***ing World,"I haven’t seen it yet, but every time my bf puts it on I get mad again about how cruel people have been to this actress. She’s soooo talented and yeahh, sorry, she’s freaking adorable."
The End of the F***ing World,This episode brought out so many emotions.
The End of the F***ing World,"I loved that we finally got to see someone go full Arya Stark stabbing the Tickler in the Inn.
It’s the perfect way to show someone snapping and no longer being the same afterwards.
That shit was so weak in the show. As if the show writers didn’t understand the work.

Thankfully, there is Last of Us"
The End of the F***ing World,"Removing comments openly discussing episode 8 is ridiculous. Given the title, the spoiler scope is implied and no one should have to tag e8 plot points."
The End of the F***ing World,"This was a hard episode to watch. 

I imagine it was even harder to act out.

Edit: the cannibalism didn’t even register. I just went full walking dead regarding  that. What got me? The religious grown man on little girl grooming and violence…..

I applauded when she went full axe murderess. Not gonna lie.

Edit: not just for Ellie, but that little girl the character kept slapping around in front of the entire town.

Edit: and before anyone comes out of the woodwork to yet again tell me how awful of a woman I am? 

I am a reflection of how I’ve been treated my entire life."
The End of the F***ing World,Was confused for a second like wait why are they calling her by a character name in GOT? Then realized that's just her real name... she played a Mormont on GOT.
The End of the F***ing World,"Maybe I missed them explaining it but I have literally only a single gripe with this show, and it was the worst in this latest episode: Where did everyone go? I seem to remember Joel had to kill like 30 people to save Ellie in the game but here, despite them showing a large group in the beginning, all but two of them disappear. Maybe it's just plot armor, but I kept wondering during the fight when more people would burst in and fight Joel but it never came."
The End of the F***ing World,Unbelievably hardcore intense episode. Holy cannoli. I don't know why I love such disturbing episodes of TV shows so much but there it is
The End of the F***ing World,I was wondering why it took them so long to show people starving in this world.
The End of the F***ing World,"Not sure if it’s just me but the part where Ellie gives Joel the knife and Joel looks at her helplessly reminded me of the scene in The Godfather where Vito’s in the hospital and Michael had to take control and provide protection. Vito had that same helpless look that was almost apologetic for putting Michael in that position. 

I wonder if that was intentional."
The End of the F***ing World,Very good episode.
The End of the F***ing World,"Really not a fan of this post title being a spoiler.

That's all I'm gonna say here in fear of more spoilers."
The End of the F***ing World,"Bella absolutely killed it with this episodes performance, she’s doing amazing!"
The End of the F***ing World,She went cray cray on that disgusting man!!
The End of the F***ing World,Was it implied the deer was infected to? Since Ellie could hear clicking just before she saw the deer?
The End of the F***ing World,Not seen it but what else has that girl been in she’s very recognisable
The End of the F***ing World,"my only crticism is when shes chopping the meat there was no sense of weight, as if she wasnt even holding anything"
The End of the F***ing World,"Greata acting and production as always but I feel like it did not quite live up to the game. They overplayed their hand with the immediate hyper evilness of David and any subtly was thrown out the window. Also, where’d all the people go for the last encounter?"
The End of the F***ing World,"Award winning stuff from Bella, but it was also so much more. Wow. Blown away by this episode."
The End of the F***ing World,"The show is brilliant and the people who are a part of it’s making are superbly talented.

Unlike all the cringey edgelords who go into posts like this to show everyone just how cool and contrarian they are. Just keep moving along, you’re not wanted here. If I wanted the opinion of a bigoted asshole I’d go visit my red hat wearing parents."
The End of the F***ing World, I played the game but fuck that spoilers title.
The End of the F***ing World,"My favorite part about the episode were all the parallels between David and Joel. So much focus on father figures, leaders and the followers choosing who to follow, violence as a survival tool, etc. Almost everything could be applied just as well to Joel, with the only difference being context and circumstances. We’re forced to ask “why would Ellie choose to follow Joel, but not choose to follow David?” And are David’s followers any different from Ellie? Is he any different from Joel? (>!Other than the cannibalism and rape…!<)

Absolutely beautifully written and acted by everyone, this is why I watch shows like these. I absolutely can’t wait for the final episode next week, I can’t imagine they’ll do anything but stick the landing now."
The End of the F***ing World,The show has the least amount of zombies of any zombie related show.
The End of the F***ing World,Now i am worried how I would survive anywhere because I really thought he was a great guy.
The End of the F***ing World,"My standard line In a situation such as this, is ""don't knock cannibalism until you've tried it."""
The End of the F***ing World,she was really great in that ending sequence
The End of the F***ing World,"Some of us can't watch it Sunday night because we have to get up really early. I hate writers who put up slightly spoiler-ish headlines, and yes I've played the game and I can guess which antagonist was up next, but it's still shitty.

Just write ""Bella Ramsey on the ending"" leave out the adjective that gives away an expectation. Dipshit."
The End of the F***ing World,"I don't like that the show removed almost all of Joel's combat, and his ruthlessness, and even his boss fight, yet keeps Ellies."
The End of the F***ing World,"the show has been good. But I think its getting a lot of love from fans of the game.  In a whole season there's been 30 minutes of action and and the rest REALLY side stories. (I did like the Offerman episode, because I liked seeing him build up his town).

I hope S2 brings more mainline story, or I feel it will become the walking dead 2.0"
The End of the F***ing World,"I was worried they’d tone that part down from the game but nope. They showed exactly who David is. Also Troy did a fantastic job as always!

I really wonder how they’re going to handle Part 2 though are they going to stick with Bella Ramsey for older Ellie?"
The End of the F***ing World,"The show's streak has pretty much been flawless, so far."
The End of the F***ing World,I cried a little at the end. Such an amazing show.
The End of the F***ing World,This series started off strong but it has not grabbed my full attention for the last two episodes. Teetering on boring
The End of the F***ing World,Show is extremely boring and overrated.
The End of the F***ing World,"Fantastic episode, probably my fav so far. Can’t wait for the season finale!"
The End of the F***ing World,Right... so this is making me realize I actually HADNT WATCHED THE WHOLE SEASON 1. And i thought i was safe to read the comment section ):
The End of the F***ing World,Wait is the season over?
The End of the F***ing World,"I know this isn’t the walking dead, but how is this not the walking dead?"
The End of the F***ing World,"Oh my god!! I literally cried when Joel called her daughter. 😭😭

It was the most favorite moment of mine, the most heart touching one."
The End of the F***ing World,Americans are incapable of not spoiling shit when things air there first
The End of the F***ing World,"I never noticed until recently, because the Waco show is going on, but The Last of Us’s David was inspired by David Koresh. And the show does a better job of showing the similarities than the game did, getting the point of view of his group."
The End of the F***ing World,Can we not post spoilers in the titles?
The End of the F***ing World,[deleted]
The End of the F***ing World,"I guess Joel and Ellie are superheroes now? 

Joel was barely conscious and almost dying from sepsis and then - somehow - manages to get up and take out two armed men on his own. 

Ellie's 2 kills of hardened, grown men were more believable, but I kinda laughed when she overpowered the preacher dude with a cleaver. Yeah, ok, she's like Arya Stark now - a teenage world-class assassin? 

This show is kinda sliding into campy violence, which is confusing because I thought the tone was supposed to be realism."

"That Winter, the Wind Blows","I hope I live long enough for to be able to read it…

I’m in my 30s with perfect good health…"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","I think this book does come out eventually. 

It's Dream of Spring which has literally zero chance."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Guess it’s time for George’s biyearly vague quote to indicate that he’s still writing to remind the audience that there’s more book to be written.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",If he didn't finish it during COVID it's never getting finished.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The real Winds of Winter is the friends we made along the way
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Because the HBO series came out and exists while the book won't and doesn't?

Oh George, I wish you all the best but I just don't have faith in you."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","""my gardening is taking me further and further away from the television series.""

🙄"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",LESS TALKY MORE TYPEY
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Whatever. We're never going to see this. He's just going to keep teasing us every two or three years until he dies.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Hey George, explain to the folks at home what ""forthcoming"" means..."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",No one needs to hear GRRM talk more about eventually releasing a book. Let us know when it’s in bookstores to buy.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Well yeah

HBO actually released theirs."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",WHERE THE FUCK IS IT GEORGE!?!?!?!??!? ITS BEEN 10 YEARS!
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Preorder now for instant delivery in 2036
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",How many years is be going to say this?  He’ll die before that book comes out.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","""Quite different"" in that it will never exist, whereas the HBO story line does."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Will there still be a Starbucks cup?
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",How would he know? He'd have to write it to know.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Oh sweet, another reminder of my negative feelings on this whole thing. Right on schedule, thanks"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Blah blah blah.... The Great Lies
1. The check is in the mail
2. I'll pay next time
3. I will be releasing ""The Winds of Winter by the end of the year."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Fucking better be.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I have no faith that this will come out before he dies
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I’ve never seen Reddit so united
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",How does he know?
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Yes, the HBO storyline actually got written."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","I started reading the books about seven years ago while recovering from surgery. Plowed through them, thought they were great. Word on the street was that book six was coming out real soon. We all know how that turned out. Finally, in need of closure, I wrote my own book six. Here it is:

Winds of Winter

One day it got real cold all over Westeros. Winter had come. It got so cold that everybody died at the same time, from that weird paralyzed kid all the way up to the lady with the dragons. And that real badass girl that went around killing everybody all the time. And that fat guy. Was there like a fat guy? Anyway, he fuckin’ died too. He wore black boots and pants and a hauberk or whatever it’s called. And a hat of some kind.

THE END

Epilogue: There is no book seven. Story’s over. Piss off."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Fucking yawn
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",It's funny he's still pretending he writes books.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Translation ""So I am now going to totally change what I originally had written and told D & D about because man did you fans hate it. Keep blaming D & D,  though,  because it's hysterical you guys don't understand it was 100% my storyline you are blaming them for."""
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Pretty sure this guy wrote himself into a corner and had zero idea how to write himself out of it. HBO chose a path based on what he thought he might do, fans hated it, and now he’s frantically trying to salvage it. 

I don’t think there’s a way to do that. Killing off your interesting characters people identify with is a neat trick that subverts expectations once. He did it until he had no real plot left and he’s still struggling for one that doesn’t have a typical fantasy ending.

The trick is that not all reader expectations need to be subverted. People read fantasy partially for a hero’s journey. Give them one."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I don’t believe you.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","to be fair ""existing"" is quite different from ""not existing"""
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The main difference being that the HBO storyline actually exists.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Primary difference - the HBO show came out.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Well the HBO storyline actually had a conclusion, so….."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",In that the HBO storyline actually released?
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Available in a bookstore near you in 2032.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",RIGHT. Because HBO actually finished something
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Tell him ""shut up"" for me."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Who’s this guy kidding we all know he ain’t ever releasing it and even if he does he’ll never finish the series. This guy while a good writer is a bad author. Hell never deliver on his promises of a complete AOIAF. He just needs to stop and acknowledge that he won’t finish.

This guy, always coming out with an update on winds of winter. Might as well be talking about Duke Duke em forever in that if he does release it is likely to be dog shot; or The next chapter of half life because it’ll never come out."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","You know what. I am not even mad at this point. He’s fucked off so long I respect it. There’s some sort of zen teaching here about want, desire, action and inaction. 

I hope he release a book that just a list of everything he spent his HBO money on and it ends with ‘git reked’ but one special copy out there gets a 5” floppy disk taped to the back cover. Floppy has three out of sync chapters on it, but you need WordStar 4.0 to read it."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Quite different….like it will never exist.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Are people still buying this guys BS? He was a former tv writer who turned to writing novels and had his series of novels turned into the most successful tv show of all time. He has no motivation to write anymore books.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Well that’s good to hear
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Thank god.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",*A Dance with Dragons* was published 11 years ago.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The main difference is that the show released and the book probably won't.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","“Quite different,” in that the HBO show was actually finished."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The only way I would have been happy is if the Nightking wins…and everyone’s stupid drama was deemed fruitless. Also would’ve been a badass metaphor for climate change. Would’ve been dark and perfect.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Forthcoming. That's a bold word.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Meaning it will be riddled with subplots and extra characters that will amount to nothing. 

Looking at you, Dorne.

I'm afraid it's just his way to garner some interest, after the show pretty much killed any that was left."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The major difference is that one actually exists and the other is theoretical.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Until he actually finishes writing the books, the HBO storyline is effectively canon as far as I'm concerned. If he wants people to get away from the HBO ending he needs to get cracking."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","It’s taken so long that I’ve completely
Lost interest in the series. I don’t even care any more."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",One can hope
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","At this point. Just pay a ghost writer to do it. 

Or fuck it let Stephen King finish them. He’d have both of them done by August."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Less talky about book, more writey actual book."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The main difference being  that the HBO series was completed and released to the public.  I have more faith that Dre will release the Detox album
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Either release it or just tell everyone to get fucked. I am sick to death of seeing this man discuss what this book will be for the last decade. Enough is enough. Nobody cares anymore.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Read Game of Thrones in 1998. 

Gave up hope of ever seeing an end to this series long ago. I've accepted the tv show as the closest thing to closure I'll ever receive. GRRM can eat a weiner."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",If he just did his job the show might have ended on a better note. He allowed amateurs to fill in the details of his outline and they got cold feet and rushed the ending out the door.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","There was a fan-posted video that concluded that since he published Dance, until COVID started GRRM wrote at best 200 pages of Winds, lol (based on his blogposts, updates etc.)"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I wish he’d shut up about it until it’s done.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Bc he rewrote the book after the reception of the final season I guarantee it
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Sure. I read dance of dragons 11 years ago.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Probably different in the fact that the HBO version at least exists.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","“Oh, shit, my storyline failed in the show?  Rewrite!”  No wonder it’s taking forever."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Stop writing articles about this “upcoming” book. It’s either out, or I don’t want to hear about it."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I suspect dude was using the HBO series as a temperature gauge and saw shit go cold pretty quickly.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I don't even remember the plot tbh.....
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",It’s probably taking him so long because he rewrote every time the show did something stupid
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","“Different” as in, the HBO storyline exists, whereas his book doesn’t seem like it will?"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",They could not be more different. The fact that one of them actually exists is the main thing.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Eh, I'm over it. Any interest I had in reading his next book died years ago."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Yeah, in that it doesn’t exist."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Spoilers...

The winds of winter will be vastly different to the series because the series was actually written and finished even if it was garbage"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Quite different because it won’t actually materialize.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",This guy had his moment and absolutely blew it by taking fucking forever.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",oh shutup
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",So he can read the room.  No wonder it’s taking so long.  It’s a whole different fucking book than what he started.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Because the book and the show diverged long before this moment and should necessarily be different.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Does anyone really care anymore? I started reading the books not long after they came out, at this stage I can barely remember what happened in the earlier ones, I don't think il waste my time reading the next installment and then never get to read A dream of spring, chances are il have grandkids by the time it's out"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","At this point even if the book gets released in a short timeframe I have lost interest in reading it. It was the same with A Dance of Dragons. What also doesn’t help is that the longer he takes to finish a book the worse it actually ends up being comparatively to his other works.

You just move on as a reader."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Dude, George. NOBODY CARES.

Release the shit or don’t but stop talking about it."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Meet George.

George writes an insanely popular book series.

George gets said book series adapted for television.

George releases books for said series with less regularity than a constipated person taking a shit.

Show runners catch up to book material and have to make up what happens later in the TV adaptation.

Final seasons of of TV adaptation are critical failures.

When George speaks on next book, he says ""yeah, it won't do what that did.""

George strings along his fanbase and hung show creators out to dry for his incompetence.

Don't be like George."
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Yeah.  Namely Euron Greyjoy is a deeply complex well developed character that is truly the big bad of the entire series. the most consequential person to the all the events of Westeros…  leading to the all out bonanza with the Others factoring in only really as a small part of what Euron is doing.. because they are related. 

And in the show… he just wants to fuck the queen.

We saw him die… not really though.. lord of light right? 

Possible in the new Jon snow show he’s still alive and does what he actually does in the books.

The dark sorcerer necromancer trying to destroy the entire fucking world.

I mean… what the fuck else are they going to do?"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",He’s only saying that so people will buy it I don’t care anymore I don’t even wanna think about GoT anymore
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Yea.. different as in one happened, the other has not…"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Will it be different because one is complete and the other stuck in the contemplative phase
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Unfinished is completely different than poorly finished
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","That's because the HBO storyline was finished, flaws and all"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",The difference:. The HBO series actually exists.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Probably because the TV show actually exists and the book never will
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Pretty sure he’s going to die long before this book is ever published. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",I think they’ll turn either all the books into movies eventually OR just the last book into a movie as an unofficial alternative season finale
"That Winter, the Wind Blows","Believe it when I see it. Hopefully if it does come out, it is nothing like the HBO crap"
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",By quite different he means it'll never actually be finished.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",Lmao forthcoming. I remember thinking that 10 years ago when GOT was hot.
"That Winter, the Wind Blows",In the sense that the HBO series actually exists?
She Was Pretty,"She killed Dipper? Damn, there goes the Gravity Falls crossover"
She Was Pretty,Couple therapy...
She Was Pretty,TIL Melanie Lynskey is John Ritter’s daughter in law
She Was Pretty,Ahhh. Jason Ritter. The guy it took me longer than I'll admit to realize that he isn't James Marsden
She Was Pretty,TIL that Melanie Lynskey is not American.
She Was Pretty,His dad was one of my favorite comedic actors
She Was Pretty,Jason is one of the nicest people to work with in film. Raising Dion may not have had much success but damn it was fun to help make that show with him. Glad he's still going forward with more stunt work.
She Was Pretty,TIL that Melanie Lynskey is married to Jason Ritter.
She Was Pretty,She was great in Fireflies. Edit: Yellowjackets.
She Was Pretty,"> as the survivors are attacked by a herd of clickers, which is the show’s name for the terrifying former humans who are now controlled by a parasitic fungus that was mutated by global warming. 

Ugh, Clickers are a specific type of infected, not every one is a Clicker. Clickers are the ones with their heads completely covered, they can't see anything but have exceptional hearing - they navigate by making clicking sounds."
She Was Pretty,Nepo Zombie
She Was Pretty,"I’ve never been more pleased with watching a character get her face eaten off by a rambunctious preteen hoped up on fungus

She delivered that part fantastically and I hated her maliciousness."
She Was Pretty,isn't this the chick from two and a half men
She Was Pretty,"""The 'Yellowjackets' star had a guest-starring role in the second season of the hit HBO series.""

Am I taking crazy pills or is this stupidly wrong."
She Was Pretty,"That's a solid blood line: existential crisis that results in subtle personal growth or some equally poignant but violent outburst, then trip over a couch before getting some strange at the Regal Beagle"
She Was Pretty,Ive seen her in a few things and when i saw her on a talk show yesterday i was so surprised she had an accent. Im always impressed at how good they get at hiding it.
She Was Pretty,"She’s an INCREDIBLE actress!!! Loved her in Good Girls, Candy , Yellow Jackets just to name a few. I love her grit and dead pan humor. Amazing that she’s a NZ native!!!!"
She Was Pretty,Y'all do realize it was all pretend? She played a character and he played another character? This would only demonstrate how much they like one another.
She Was Pretty,"Wow, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ""news"" aren't we?"
She Was Pretty,She is one of my favorite actresses.  I loved her in that HBO show with the guy from the league.
She Was Pretty,"Jason looks every bit the spitting image of his dad. Perfect for a 3's Company remake, but I also don't want it because it wouldn't be in the spirit of the original."
She Was Pretty,Jason Ritter is a wholesome dude. I miss his dad.
She Was Pretty,"Omg I didn't realize she was in this, I adore her. I was planning to watch already but definitely will now."
She Was Pretty,She was the weakest character in the show.
She Was Pretty,kathleen was sucha lame character
She Was Pretty,"She didn’t work for me in the role. Just took me right out of the story whenever she was onscreen. I get that they were trying to cast against type, a normally nice woman driven to ugly extremes because of trauma, etc, but it just didn’t work IMO."
She Was Pretty,Spoilers in title smh
She Was Pretty,She has a great voice.
She Was Pretty,"What dedication to acting, letting fungi infect her husband and then shooting him dead"
She Was Pretty,She was wrongly cast for that part in the show. Didn’t fit at all.
She Was Pretty,"there were only a few missteps from this show and her character was one of them. felt like a character from a bad walking dead season, totally out of place with the vibe of the rest of the show."
She Was Pretty,That’s a reveal? We’ve truly run out of things to talk about.
She Was Pretty,I liked all the changes they added to the show….EXCEPT HER
She Was Pretty,She did a good job in TLOU.  Made me absolutely despise her character.
She Was Pretty,I love this.
She Was Pretty,"I love how excited he is about her projects. Candy, Yellowjackets, this. They’re so sweet and you can tell how supportive of her work he is."
She Was Pretty,"Lovely performance on both sides, I’d say."
She Was Pretty,I love them so much
She Was Pretty,I love shit like this!
She Was Pretty,Another Canada shot show that had main cast's family in smaller roles. It's an interesting way to get around the regulations
She Was Pretty,Cathartic; most likely
She Was Pretty,Umm spoiler?
She Was Pretty,"TIL 

&#x200B;

Jack Ritters (RIP) son Jason is married to Melanie"
She Was Pretty,That is hilarious!
She Was Pretty,Her acting was really bad
She Was Pretty,"She was pretty awful lol. Least menacing “scary leader” ever with a dumb backstory completely centered around Dead Unseen NPC #15382. 

Show’s pacing was a nightmare in an otherwise solidly crafted show and that whole side plot was a huge offender."
She Was Pretty,"Who asked? Easily the lousiest acting and character arch of the season. She, nor the series, benefited from her casting in this role… just an honest evaluation."
She Was Pretty,Worst character in the show imo. Least likely person in the apocalypse to become leader
She Was Pretty,Worst and least believable character in the show.
She Was Pretty,"This was one of the most recent memorable miscastings I can recall from a television show. 

Great actress - Just atrocious for this role."
She Was Pretty,She was easily the worst character in the show
She Was Pretty,"She was Probably the only negative i have for the show. Her voice was unbearable, couldn’t wait for her to die"
She Was Pretty,"Can anyone recommend some of her performances? Ngl she was one of the few characters in LOU that didn’t make sense for me, it just didn’t seem like she was in any form of character. There were moments that I could see what she was going for, but many others where her acting took me right out of the drama and made me feel like I was watching a bad Walking Dead episode."
She Was Pretty,She was the absolute worst character in this entire show by far... (acting wise)
She Was Pretty,[deleted]
She Was Pretty,"I absolutely love Melanie Lynskey….she’s excellent in everything she’s in (even though we didn’t really need to see much of her or her group in this season Last of Us. 

It was a nice diversion for sure, and a great little story line - but would have rathered more Joel and Ellis stuff!"
She Was Pretty,She was so bad. I’m sorry but she was
She Was Pretty,So?
She Was Pretty,Meh show
She Was Pretty,She was the worst character in the show
She Was Pretty,Is that Rose on Two and a Half Men? Looks like her
She Was Pretty,Jason Ritter has such a doofus face.
She Was Pretty,😐👍🏻
She Was Pretty,"Two and a half men crazy lady, right?"
She Was Pretty,I had no idea they were married
She Was Pretty,Why is this trending?
She Was Pretty,"I’m sorry, but who gives a shit?"
She Was Pretty,"Jason Ritter is an awesome person, only good things to say about him."
She Was Pretty,"Am i the only person who's buy-in to this post apocalyptic world was completely destroyed when the leader of this brutal faction was revealed to be a midwestern Karen? It was zero percent believable. I enjoyed the show. I actually cried when Joel asked Tommy to take Ellie. When Neil is actually focused on the story, he's pretty good. But when he's distracted by.... other priorities... it really hurts the whole product."
She Was Pretty,She did a horrible job in the Last one of us.
She Was Pretty,Who cares?
She Was Pretty,"This is just tabloid nothings. 

Also, her character was the weakest, unfortunately I didn’t hate her because she was so mean or whatever… I hated her for being extremely unconvincing and just an element that was unnecessary to exist. 

“Oohh but her husband was in the show as well!”—- published over a month after we alllll forgot about her 💀"
She Was Pretty,"""quick, need to fill our TLOU news quota for the day"""
She Was Pretty,Why would you remind the world of one of the most horrible miscasts in Hollywood history?
She Was Pretty,Worst performance of the show. Woefully miscast and horribly executed.
She Was Pretty,I kinda liked how poor of a fit she seemed for her role. I felt like it made sense for the context of her being someone who kinda ended up in charge in a place where the rest of the attempts at law and order were pushed out.
She Was Pretty,"The game was better hands down, idk what this crap is, but i beat it on ps4."
She Was Pretty,"She was fantastic in this role.  Check out her episode as a sweet voiced sociopath in ""the shield"" too."
She Was Pretty,She was awful. How did she get cast in that role?
She Was Pretty,Worst actress ever
She Was Pretty,Man I hate that the show wasted so much time on this annoying character
She Was Pretty,"She was poorly cast. Loved her in “Heavenly Creatures” when she was a teen, but she was unconvincing on “The Last of Us.”"
She Was Pretty,"Ngl, I think her character was maybe the weakest part of the whole show"
She Was Pretty,What an absolute bombshell of a reveal 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
She Was Pretty,"Is she considered famous enough for being a ""guest star""? She's borderline an actor you know you know but don't remember where from. It took me a while for me to recognise her from don't look up.

I don't know how good she is in yellowjackets but her performance on Last of Us was really poor and unconvincing. I really don't get all the praise She's getting for that part.."
She Was Pretty,Slow news day huh
She Was Pretty,Who the fuck cares
She Was Pretty,"""Revealed"" or just casually mentioned in an interview. I hate modern journalism..."
She Was Pretty,"Wow, slow news day. Who cares?"
She Was Pretty,Ok
She Was Pretty,This isn’t an old show. Careful with the spoilers
She Was Pretty,Most screen time as a Karen award goes to!
She Was Pretty,She was trash on the show
She Was Pretty,Ass character. Wasn’t threatening or intimidating.
She Was Pretty,Terribly miscast; wooden and unconvincing dialogue; wholly forgettable performance that was distracting and unnecessary in a stirring and emotional episode.
She Was Pretty,wtf... jason could do sooooo much better
She Was Pretty,anyone else despise her casting and story arc?
She Was Pretty,Probably some of the worst acting from a person I’ve ever seen from a high budget television show
She Was Pretty,Worst actor in the series so far. All her scenes were so unbelievable that she would be the leader of her group. I was happy she was killed off in 2 episodes.
She Was Pretty,Glad this idiot got taken out in the series.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","The Young Offenders on BBC3 is a sweet, funny, surprisingly emotional little comedy series set in Cork. It's *very* irish - I had to watch with the subtitles on to fully understand everything!"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Look for Love/Hate - crime drama set in Dublin, worth a watch.
"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",A lot of Irish people hated it and found it cringy. I personally found it alright but didn’t bother watching the 2nd season when it came out
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",You might enjoy 'a date for mad Mary' she is the main star
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Father Ted is technically an English show but it's written by and stars Irish and is set in Ireland. One of the very best sitcoms of the '90s. 
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Is that ok Netflix!?!?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Not sure. I'm pretty sure they had it a few years ago so they might still. 
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Its a really great read if you have the time

Some Excerpts:

On the appeal of playing Barry:

>“It was about figuring out what’s the story, and getting into the tone and the feel of it. And then being like, ‘Oh, I guess I’ll play Barry.'”

On the physicality of the role:

>“I remember HBO being like, ‘You need to start working out'. And I’m like, ‘I actually do work out. I work out three days a week, sometimes more. I work out a lot.’ I never get, ‘Wow, you look great.’ It’s always like, ‘Huh.’ Once I was like, ‘I just don’t want to be too ripped.’ \[My trainer\] was like, ‘I don’t think you have to worry about that.'”

On the intensity of S3 (Spoilers):

>>!“I don’t know if he will hold the audience’s loyalty this season. It’s OK. I remember watching Goodfellas growing up and going like, ‘Wow, look at his life. This is great.’ And then they shoot Spider \[Michael Imperioli’s character\], and you just knew that this was real.”!< 

>>!“Barry’s back is against the wall and he’s freaking out and he has this in him,” Hader says. “There’s only a matter of time before it starts going out on the people he loves. In the writers room, people go, ‘Well, that’s going to be really upsetting.’ And it’s like, ‘But yeah, to not do it, it feels like we’re purposely avoiding it. And you don’t want to go, ‘Well, he’s only mean to these people.’ It’s like, ‘No, he’s mean to everybody.'”!<

On his struggles with Anxiety on SNL:
>”The live aspect of SNL — I’m just not built for it. Before shows, I would go into a bathroom that was way down this hall, go into a stall and have a full-blown panic attack, crying, the whole thing. And then I go and get in a giant banana costume. This voice would come on in my head of like, ‘You fucking asshole, do you know how many people would kill for this? Dude, get your shit together, come on.'”"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",">Barry, which returns to HBO for its third season April 24,

The most important line of the article as far as I'm concerned."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Babka, anyone?"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Barry recommend?

E: I have resubbed to HBO, will be watching today- thank you all :)"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","So excited for the return of Barry. ronny/lily is one of the best tv episodes of the last decade, in my opinion. The show is brilliant."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Hey Ike you Shitbird, want a little pie?!!"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Great article. Although it says that Hader directed episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm and I can't find that anywhere.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I adore Bill Hader. In everything Ive seen him in he just radiates charm! It also doesn't hurt that he's cute as fuck. He seems like the type of person who is beautiful inside and out.

Reading about his struggles with extreme anxiety makes him so relatable and impressive to me. We all have our own struggles even if its not visible from the outside. Even when someone looks to be doing something naturally and flawlessly that doesn't mean there isn't internal turmoil and it is a relief to me to know the tenderness and vulnerability of humanity that exists even within the most impressive individuals."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Interesting. I wouldn't really call Barry ""in-control"". He is pretty prone to losing his cool and going crazy."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Great comedians wield a great understanding of many things.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",The bad news of this article is that apparently he won't be involved at all in season 4 of Documentary Now.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I didn’t like his work until I saw Barry and now I will watch anything he does.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","This is some protracted promo tour for season 3, but I'm willing to bide my time with all the morsels they give us."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Barry best show ever. So funny and so clever. Watch it.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I wouldn't call Barry an In control person if anything it feels totally the opposite
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",He’s the dreamiest 🤩
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Good article, that title is trying wayyy to hard tho."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Barry the character seems pretty freaking far from being in-control, and had (writer's constant plot) serendipity not been an over-riding device the man should have died dozens of times by now. 

Love the show for it's characters, but to me the writing is far too fantastical to be  considered auteristic."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Neat
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",[deleted]
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Meh. Wasn't for me. Hope he comes back for the next Documentary Now! season on camera.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",It’s a good show but the praise it gets is so over the top. I wonder if some of that is just because of all the inside baseball entertainment industry stuff.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I don't think any other actor hypes themselves as shamelessly as Bill Hader.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I’m now imagining the “my lord, the queen is dead!” But Barry’s in a banana costume."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",This is what I was looking for!
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Thanks for this! Can't wait!!
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","NoHo Hank: “Well, you know what Sonny and Cher would say, that’s on you babe.”"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Chocolate or cinnamon?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Would you like a submarine sandwich?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",It’s good
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Yes. If you don’t like it by the end of the second episode it’s not for you
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",It's brilliant in my opinion.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Do you like submarine sandwiches?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Strong recommend.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Sooo good, I love it. Great Dark comedy"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","yeah

Season 2 better than Season 1 imo, but Season 1 is also good"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Enjoy!
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Absolutely recommended this to everyone not easy to find in the UK (another monthly bill). But for me unquestionably a must watch.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",That episode had me in stitches.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",That shit was crazy
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","""Wow, he did not care *at all*."" ""You said he's 6'2""?""

""Yeah, 6'2""!"""
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Potentially the episode he's in in the latest season?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","The headline is referring to the actor, not the character."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Same!   Totally the same!
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Bill Hader Created a Killer to Cope. 

It’s a perfectly interesting title. And it’s an alliteration, so that’s fun.

I think you’re trying too hard to be critical and I’d love to see you try to make an equally interesting but less “cringe” headline or whatever you think of this.

It pulls the reader in and is relevant to the subject of the article, it’s fine."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Wdym
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Look up what autuer means.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Yeah, this seems like a direct Dexter copy in nature?"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Wut
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Maybe Donald Glover. But you're not gonna make it if you don't hype yourself up my man
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Dude, but real talk? That episode fucking TRAUMATIZED me.  I can’t fully explain it, but like, the way that episode played out made me feel *incredibly* sad, and I ended up putting off watching the final episode for literally a year because when the episode ended, I literally walked around my house lightly crying for almost an hour.

Yes, I am laughing at how insane that whole scenario is. I have a lot of big feelings—so I at least try to watch things by myself before watching them with other people."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Then Keenan shows up in a funnier costume and plays dead
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Barry ""You want me to stab him in the nuts? I've done that before"" 

Goran "" no what are you saying. Stab him in the nuts, thats just gross. Just kill him""

Paraphrasing from what I remember"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Disagree. I kind of petered out after 4 episodes, then came back after a few month break. The final three episodes of season 1 were so fucking good I watched the rest immediately."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Or babka? Two babka?  I get two babka.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I was glued to the screen
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Jeff Schaffer directed it. But even if Bill Hader had, the article says that he had directed episodes before the meeting with HBO where he pitched Barry. So it should've been before 2018."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Ah, I see! Thank you for the correction!"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",The headline is a nightmare to read.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",The headline that refers to him as an assassin?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","""HBO's assassin auteur"" Fuck off. It's a fluff piece meant to stroke an actors ego."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Not at all. And I take you have never seen the show.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Oh yeah. That episode’s fucking brutal.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Wait, which episode? Of what?"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Hah! That's great...Those guys are are such an amazing ensemble cast! ""Barry"" is right up there with Breaking Bad for me."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Huh interesting. That’s fair. Towards the end (if memory serves me right) is where it got really serious on the drama end, right?"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I enjoyed it all the way through, but definitely agree with you stating to hold out til this point. The tonal shift's pretty crazy (but not jarring) and it really elevates itself the final few episodes."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Like Fuches' hands!
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Curb came back in 2017, not 2018. I think the first pitch meeting for Barry was around 2014/16 and when that happened, Curb had been on hiatus for 5 years."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","It refers to Hader as an auteur, which is a creator, not a character.  He's not an in-control assassin (Barry's not in control of anything).  Hader is an auteur of a work about an assassin, and he's very much in control, as executive producer, writer, lead actor, and director.

The headline makes no sense if you insist it's about Barry, but it does make sense when you realize that it's about Bill Hader."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",It’s a Hollywood reporter article LOL what do you think this is??? Being critical of entertainment news articles doesn’t look as cool as you think it does hahah
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","No I have never seen it. Lmfao I was just asking, you insufferable people"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",season 1 episode 7 of *Barry*
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","To keep it as spoiler free as possible, I believe the end of episode 6 is them arriving at the airport."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I said 2018 because, if Barry premiered in 2018, then the pitch meeting must've happened before that. Anyway, nowhere does it say that Bill Hader directed an episode of Curb."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Ah yes, I shall consume without question."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","You are insufferable. You comment on things you know nothing about and make wild assumptions based on nothing. 
You probably didn’t even read the article. But I’m guessing you are white and male and American so you MUST GIVE AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING! 
lol go touch grass."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Ahhh, got what you meant. Sorry, my sleep cycle hasn't been the best and I'm not feeling too well, so everything's kind of a blur."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","1) you’re a racist, sexist loser. 2. hahahahahahahaha, get fucked"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","Haha, it's all right, happens to all of us, hope you get better!"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I’ll take this response as I am correct and your fragile man brain can not handle criticism. Like the Karen you are. 😘
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","1.	⁠you’re a racist, sexist loser. 2. hahahahahahahaha, get fucked"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",The clickbait is real. He had no problem coping.
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",He was very politely trying to get through this boring interview
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",That was my favorite segment from last night’s 60 Minutes. They do a really good job
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I  was never a fan of Sesame Street but this message.

>""You can feel loneliness, you can feel sadness,"" , ""you're not alone.""  

It's really sweet."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Jim Henson would be proud
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Sesame street and the muppets are two different things
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",Is it in Arabic?
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","I listened to a great podcast episode, I think it was last year from Freakonomics Radio or 99PI or something, that discussed this huge grant from MacArthur Foundation and had interviewed the finalists for the $100 million award, which of course included this and other proposals. I wish I could recall which podcast it was because it was cool to hear these different proposals for dealing with big problems -- one wanted the money to completely wipe out some neglected tropical disease, et cetera. I remember not thinking that Sesame Workshop's proposal had much of a chance to win the big prize but it's cool. There's more info on this and the other award winners here: https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/recipients/."
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope","So the US took in 10'087 Syrian refugees under 14 since 2011. (Source: https://ireports.wrapsnet.org/Interactive-Reporting/EnumType/Report?ItemPath=/rpt_WebArrivalsReports/MX%20-%20Arrivals%20for%20a%20Demographic%20Profile)
(That's of course ignoring children growing out of this age group since then.)

Nice to see they put in so much effort into the mess they definitely helped cause. /s"
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",How sweet
"Cant Cope, Wont Cope",I don’t think I’ve ever read a sweeter thing. Got tears in my eyes when I imagined their joy seeing the fun characters and bright colors
We Speak Dance,"> “Wednesday” still has one more week to climb even higher. However, the series is now 352.1 million hours behind “Stranger Things” Season 4’s performance in its first 28 days, and with “Wednesday” racking up 269.7 million hours viewed during the Dec. 5-11 viewing window, it seems most likely that “Stranger Things” will hold onto its No. 1 title. 
> 
> But **it’s also important to consider that “Stranger Things” has a longer runtime — Season 4 runs for approximately 13 hours while “Wednesday” runs for 6.8, giving the former a significant advantage when comparing viewing hours alone.**"
We Speak Dance,It's crazy that Netflix drops the whole show at once and if a 100m people don't gulp down the whole thing the first month then it's a disappointment or a flop. Weird business model
We Speak Dance,Just renew it already.
We Speak Dance,"It was a good mix of new and old. I used to watch the original on tv (reruns). 

Hopefully the renew it and start on the next season. There is a lot of potential. They did not get into the backgrounds of the different monster types."
We Speak Dance,The one true homicidal maniac comes out on top.
We Speak Dance,Most people around me have watched it and really enjoyed it. I guess that the next big thing for Netflix will be Knives Out in a couple of weeks
We Speak Dance,"I’ve got to admit, the “you might think I don’t care if people don’t like me, the truth is… I enjoy it” line was a good one."
We Speak Dance,"I'm 50, so old enough to have watched the original Addams Family series.

Wednesday is brilliant! Ortega absolutely nails the part of the title character, and the style of Tim Burton is perfectly suited to this content. Can't wait for S2!"
We Speak Dance,"Wednesday has one more week to pass Stranger Things 4 (28 day viewership):

1. Stranger Things 4 – 1.35B
2. Wednesday - 1.02B
3. Dahmer - 856M
4. Bridgerton: Season 2 – 656M
5. Bridgerton: Season 1 – 625M"
We Speak Dance,Jenna Ortega absolutely carries the show.
We Speak Dance,[removed]
We Speak Dance,This is the power of goth girls and kooky dancing
We Speak Dance,"Obviously, Jenna Ortega deserves all the praise because she crushes it as Wednesday but the show around her is meh to okay."
We Speak Dance,Good. It’s creepy how in to dahmer people are.— in ways that are different from general morbid curiosity
We Speak Dance,"Good. The Dahmer show was really well done, but it's kind of f\*cked up that it's one of Netflix's most viewed shows ever.

I'm glad something like Wednesday topped it."
We Speak Dance,"The 269,670,000 hours Wednesday managed this week works out at the equivalent of 40 million complete viewings. A very impressive 34% drop from last week. Through three weeks it has racked up 151.5 million equivalent complete viewings. 

To put those numbers into perspective Stranger Things s4 only did 103.7 million equivalent complete viewings over 28 days. Wednesday has smashed it. Easily Netflix biggest English language hit. Though it will fall short of the 204.2 million equivalent complete viewings Squid Game did over 28 days! 

The Harry & Megan series has also been a big hit. It got 28.6 million in equivalent complete viewings. That puts it nearly on Stranger Things s4 levels! A big hit even if all the internet seems to hate the pair! It is just getting overshadowed by those ridiculous Wednesday numbers.

Elsewhere 1899 (32.8 million), Dead to Me s3 (17.9 million), and Elite s6 (18 million) wrapped their 4 week runs in the chart. I feel like they all did OK. The 7th season of Elite will likely be the final one as it has faded heavily since the 5th season (a 32% drop). Hopefully the numbers for 1899 are enough. 30 million seems the renewal point and the show is hoovering just above that with 32.8 million. Hopefully its big budget does not go against it. 

The big bomb of the week is Money Heist Korea. It opened to only 1.8 million. Way down vs the 4.9 million the first half of the season got. All of which is miles away from the numbers the Spanish version did as one of Netflix’s biggest hit shows. 

Most of the other new arrivals were DOA. Most Beautiful Flower (less than 1.5 million), Cat (less than 1.4 million), Dragon Age: Absolution (less than 4.1 million), and How To Ruin Christmas s3 (less than 4.3 million) failed to chart while Lookism (2.5 million) and I Hate Christmas (4 million) scrapped in with low numbers. 

Not much else happening. Firefly Lane s2 managed a 6.6 million second week which was a 74% boost on the awful 3.8 million it opened to last week. Japanese show First Love scored a strong 34% week 2 to 3 drop and managed to have a week three that outdrew week one but the overall week three number of 1.1 million is still abysmal."
We Speak Dance,"Lookism and Hot Skull in top 10. Very good.         
Gudetama just released today and I can't wait to watch it. Trailer was amazing."
We Speak Dance,"""Nobody is watching or cares about Netflix.""

Yeah, really goes to show why we can't take Reddit too seriously. My mom is always watching Netflix. On the polar opposite, the Extremely Online folks on Twitter are also always watching Netflix."
We Speak Dance,More like Wednesday Chaddams
We Speak Dance,The dance scene was Brilliant. I don’t know why but I was captivated.
We Speak Dance,"I don't get it. Watched it all, found it rather uneventful tv. Not sure what the appeal is?"
We Speak Dance,"Ngl I’m not on board with turning the lives of serial killers into TV dramas. 

I like my documentaries about them but the Dahmer show was crossing the line imo. I see it as borderline glorification."
We Speak Dance,"Jesus. The show is good but I didn't think it was THAT good. Especially as it starts to really fall off at the end. She basically goes from super intelligent to just accusing everyone she comes across until the answer hits her in the face.

But I guess a lot of people really like to teen drama, was a little too much for me but still overall enjoyed."
We Speak Dance,"This show was a disappointment for me. It often felt like those shitty supernatural teen dramas that I don't like, with the stupid relationships and bad dialogue. 

I also don't get why they went for the Hogwarts type setting. The real gold of Adams Family was always the contrast to normal people and that was almost completely absent in this show. They still try to portray Wednesday as the out of place weirdo, but it doesn't work when the people judging her as an outcast are all mythological creatures themselves."
We Speak Dance,And the sub for the show is dead. It doesn’t make sense.
We Speak Dance,It was great.  Jenna Ortega and the girl who played Enid were captivating.  The other cast was great too.  Somehow the show managed to be both sardonic and heartwarming.
We Speak Dance,"What I loved about it is that it felt like a “goth meets high school” RPG rolling together a bunch of silly tropes unabashedly like Scooby Doo murder mysteries, Beetlejuice weirdo vibes, and Addams Family “outcast vs normies” culture clash.

Plus the internal monologue of Wednesday and MC casting is just fire."
We Speak Dance,Makes sense. It's way more accessible to a much wider audience.
We Speak Dance,"I enjoyed Wednesday. Critically, it's not great art and it ""borrows"" a lot of tropes from other movies and shows, but it's fun dark humor."
We Speak Dance,"No one has any reason to trust Netflix viewership numbers. It's something they put out themselves with no oversight, which is why the newest shows always seem to smash records."
We Speak Dance,The world-building on this show has been absolutely fantastic and if they don't drop the ball for future seasons we could have a new Harry Potter-sized hit. The potential for video games and other media set in this world is tremendous!
We Speak Dance,"Wednesday was a superb first season. Gave lots of Harry Potter vibes, outcasts in a school, magic, monsters and mystery to solve.

Wednesday herself came across to me as the goth hermione.

**insert meme of the girl with rainbow hair and her dark friend with Jenna and Emmas faces**"
We Speak Dance,And that’s only one day of the week!
We Speak Dance,Why is it hours viewed and not total views?
We Speak Dance,they better drive a dump truck full of money up to jenna ortega’s house because she carried that show on her tiny charming shoulders
We Speak Dance,Jenna O is 20 now. There. I saved you from googling it.
We Speak Dance,I really enjoyed it.  Hopefully there’s another season that they hinted at.
We Speak Dance,Gives me hope for the world
We Speak Dance,This show was a cringe fest to me I couldn't get into it
We Speak Dance,"I absolutely loved Wednesday, but the one thing that confused me was how she found it wrong for others to murder or kill, but it was fine for her to want to do those things."
We Speak Dance,Goth girls are hot
We Speak Dance,I was so excited for this show but struggled to like the first episode so I gave up. Didn’t really care for the casting. I’m glad a lot of people liked it and it did well.
We Speak Dance,It’s really not that good
We Speak Dance,"I enjoyed Wednesday but i wish they didnt stray so far from normal Addams family stuff and into supernatural, twilight meets hogwarts BS. Totally unnecessary to make Wednesday a fun character"
We Speak Dance,"Ok, I guess I’ll watch it now."
We Speak Dance,"I honestly don't get it.

Show's fun but what the hell."
We Speak Dance,This Wednesday character was too Sheldon from big bang theory-esque for me. And the world just felt like a cheapened version of harry potter.  Not sure how it got to be such a hit.
We Speak Dance,"I always thought that the show underestimated his teenage audience by painfully spelling each joke, but apparently they didn't. I overestimated them."
We Speak Dance,All time english speaking show *
We Speak Dance,Who actually finished Dahmer? I know literally no one who made it more than halfway through including myself. It was too well done and was scarier than any horror movie because it was real. Not sure if that's a compliment or not?
We Speak Dance,"So the numbers don’t lie…
People really enjoying watching absolute trash"
We Speak Dance,Dahmer is 1000x better.
We Speak Dance,"crazy, same record of stranger things and squidgame but feels like people arent talking about this show as much as the other 2"
We Speak Dance,"Combination of excellent writing, perfect casting, a sprinkling of nostalgia and easter eggs, and a loved established IP on top. Such a good show."
We Speak Dance,Dahmer of all things was the all-time most viewed Netflix show?? Wtf is wrong with people
We Speak Dance,"Thank god, we shouldn’t be making shows about real life murderers. It paints them the wrong way and I feel like the only way they should get a show is by documentary"
We Speak Dance,"I watched the first episode and half of the second and didn’t find the appeal. Maybe I’ll give it another chance, but it felt like a CW tween show."
We Speak Dance,Thank fucking god
We Speak Dance,"It's amazing how every single show Netflix releases becomes their single biggest show in the history of television.  
  
Also like their data is murky and meaningless."
We Speak Dance,Why?
We Speak Dance,First Bridgeton now this. The power of horny women is astounding
We Speak Dance,Did they kill off pugsley?...Does the show still work if she was just any goth themed character? And not necessarily an Adams? Or do they do the characters justice
We Speak Dance,Wow ppl have been really bored huh
We Speak Dance,What a mid show…..Netflix and their stupid hours viewed. Give us proper viewership numbers you cowards
We Speak Dance,Those are two different viewing spectrums. There needs to be a place on Netflix where a show like warrior nun can survive. They should want to cater to all demographics and not just the big tent pole extremes and the reality tv extremes.
We Speak Dance,Netflix likes telling us that all of their shows are breaking records. That's the only fact I'm sure of.
We Speak Dance,"I wanted to hate the show at every minute, but Ortega has been spellbinding and there's nothing I can do."
We Speak Dance,what a rubbish program though
We Speak Dance,"Just out of Curiosity, modern viewing figures are released by the company themselves right?

So isn't this just marketing? Just trying to create buzz?"
We Speak Dance,That list on Variety is eye opening. I think it’s time for me to cancel because I don’t think any of these are very good.
We Speak Dance,"Wednesday was great, Dahmer was not."
We Speak Dance,Why tho? Dumb show
We Speak Dance,i feel annoyed by all this *look at us we had the most people watching our show* as if this was an indicator for quality or something like that. its not.
We Speak Dance,new show is more popular than old show. imagine my shock.
We Speak Dance,"Let's go Jenna, our scream queen!"
We Speak Dance,Haven’t watched it
We Speak Dance,"These posts are dumb, that's the nature of exponential user growth every new popular show is going to be the most popular"
We Speak Dance,"The show that trends mostly because Tik Tok dance and ex disney kids star. The quality by it self is really nothing special.   
It just means they will continue to invest in poor writing cause it obviously does not matter if you put Tik Tok dances..."
We Speak Dance,The show that portrayed genital mutilation as a joke ?
We Speak Dance,[deleted]
We Speak Dance,"I still have zero interest in it
Happy for Tim Burton though, love his stuff."
We Speak Dance,"But it wasn’t even that good, save for the dance and cello solo!"
We Speak Dance,Gay people and murder or children and murder? Survey says…?
We Speak Dance,Gross. Imo Wednesday is pretty bad and leagues below the 90s films and the old show. When I watch it all I can think is 'this is NOT Wednesday.'
We Speak Dance,Is the show actually that good or are people just watch because younger Aubrey Plaza?
We Speak Dance,"Ugh, wish it actually was that great."
We Speak Dance,"Having seen a trailer, it looked *really bad*. Was it just the trailer? What's the appeal?"
We Speak Dance,Doesn't it owe a lot to Tik Tok? Some rando managed to make the show actually entertaining by putting a lady gaga song to it.
We Speak Dance,So Netflix viewers are really into goth chicks and gay serial killers right now.
We Speak Dance,That’s insane cuz it’s straight fucking garbage.
We Speak Dance,Ab*sed women love the female mean mug. Same way men like trap music. Makes them feel something
We Speak Dance,Ok… is that going to change anything though?
We Speak Dance,Maybe a billion hours is the milestone for not being cancelled. We'll see.
We Speak Dance,I like the directing and cinematography - Tim is the man
We Speak Dance,Fuck I still haven’t watched either of these
We Speak Dance,114000 years
We Speak Dance,One of the best series!
We Speak Dance,"Someone feel free to fact check this cuz I did it at 4 in the morning but if you do the math and could lay all the hours of this watched out in like it’s 114,000 years give or take"
We Speak Dance,Its crazy how this show blew up in the most odd time and wasn't really hyped up to be the biggest show on TV tier
We Speak Dance,Good.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It's a good show, I also like Grand Designs which follows people making homes like this"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,They really should make a McMansion Hell TV show as a counterpoint to it.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"This was an entertaining show! 
The cabin on the water was beautiful."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Yeah, I’m British and so I’ve been watching Grand Designs for eons.

Absolutely agree; I find it a lot more fascinating to see how the houses are built (and the ups and downs that it inevitably involves), than just seeing end result on its own."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,But it could never work without its host
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Oh absolutely, Kevin McCloud is an outright treasure."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"If I'm liking EAW, will I like other K-dramas? This show is pleasant and I'm incredibly surprised to find myself enjoying it."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"For the curious that works out at a third week of 8.5 million equivalent complete viewings for The Sandman. A solid third week hold. It is not a massive hit but it should get renewed. Unless the talk of it costing $15 million an episode is true! If that is the case it might well be on the bubble. 

A solid second week for Never Have I Ever. 12.9 million equivalent complete viewings. Almost the same as week one. Its 24 million over two weeks matches The Sandman. Though I’m expecting a harder fade in week three. 

Echoes off to a weak start. Just 4.8 million equivalent complete viewings. Not necessarily DOA but definitely not a great start. 

A pretty disappointing week for all the new debuting non-English titles. Not a one got above 1.5 million. Good thing they have a weekly K-Drama in Extraordinary Agent Woo to eat up some viewing time."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I can see both these things. Sandman is fantastic. Woo is beautiful.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Who is watching the Korean dramas, is it South Koreans or Westerners?"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I've yet to check out ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" but have been watching another kdrama series ""Alchemy of souls."" It's a good fantasy/wuxia series that's worth watching"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I've seen the new SK crime drama 'A Model Family'. It was entertaining despite the fact that most of the characters were making dumb decisions throughout the series.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"shame sandman is apparently super pricey. like you can tell its expensive, some shots are simply so beautiful. but if netflix sunk 150 million into it, not including marketing, and its numbers arent CRAZY, it makes me concerned for it."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Not looking good for Kleo since its only number 7 in its home country of Germany. Luckily it doesn't end in a cliff hanger
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"hbo's succession had like 2 million viewers at the season finale. but according to reddit and the internet succession is a super, mega, super-duper smash hit"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,The main character in attorney woo annoys me so much.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Holy fuck I can honestly say that I have no interest in any of that top ten.  I'm starting to wonder why I even still have Netflix, to be honest."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Hasn't been much else to watch tbh.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Damn Even a k drama is doing better than the sandman. And I guess the budget is like 10* higher
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Korean dramas are quite diverse so you’ll definitely find something you’ll like! South Korea also produces some of the most endearing slice-of-life shows IMO so if you’re into that, I recommend Hospital Playlist :)"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Watch Move to Heaven if you like EAW.  It's about an autistic man who works as a Trauma cleaner with his uncle after his father dies.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Watch the following:

Crash Landing on You

Start-Up

Hometown Cha Cha Cha

While You Were Sleeping

I think this are the fairly safe dramas that can be gateway dramas for the majority."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Try Mystic Pop Up Bar or It’s Okay To Not Be Okay. The first one is more humorous and the second one is more theatrical, kind of similar to EAW. Tomorrow, Hotel Del Luna, and The Uncanny Counter might be in the same mix.

If you like the actress, I also recommend The King’s Affection.

If you like legal dramas, then Juvenile Justice or Law School

I really did like Twenty Five Twenty One as one of my favorites this year."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I'm not a huge k dramas fan but I do love Extraordinary Attorney Woo. I recommend Vincenzo and Twenty-five Twenty-one. They're 2 great dramas with similar wide ranging cast that you'll probably like.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Im pretty picky with the kdramas i do like and i really liked hello my twenties. Its also on netflix
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Try Mr. Sunshine

It's a historical fiction set during Japanese occupation of Korea in 1900s. Its also a romance story between a guy who was born into slavery and escaped to US where he becomes a Marine Corps officer and an aristocrat lady who is a secretly member of a rebel faction that opposes Japan."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"100%, there are some top tier kdramas that rival and beat a lot of western shows. 

If you like the law side of it and maybe want a more lengthy and complex mystery, Stranger is amazing. If you want some horror/supernatural, watch The Guest. I've honestly seen so many that depending on what types of tv shows you like or want to see, I can give you some starters."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Echoes is a limited series so it was never getting a 2nd season
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"To be fair, I don't think that Sandman is doing badly, but rather that Extraordinary Attorney Woo is doing exceptionally well. 

In Asia, you have to be living under a rock not to have heard of it. There was no publicity whatsoever in other regions, but the word of mouth spead quickly with social media, as it is actually really good."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Extraordinary _Attorney_ Woo

She’d be a pretty bad agent… too easily distracted by talk of whales or dolphins"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"If it’s 15 mil an episode, I can’t imagine Sandman gets renewed. I am absolutely in love with this series but Netflix is currently on the ropes. They can’t do all the dick swinging they used to. Sandman might just have to be a one season wonder. Luckily, there is no shortage of comics to read. If they cancel the show, I’ll just switch to the comics to see how everything ends."

The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It's both. EAW broke viewing records in Korea but it's also doing extremely well worldwide. I was talking to my best friend and her mother in law and 78 year old father were both obsessed with the show, they live in WA. Her MIL loves Kdramas but her father has never watched them. She has no idea why he started watching it. I just binged it this week as well."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I’ve contributed my share of viewing hours from Attorney Woo and My Liberation Notes.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Both. There are lots of international viewers who watch K-dramas. Source: am one, have been since 2008, back when the only way to watch most Korean entertainment was via fansubs."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Love, love, love Netflix Kdramas!"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,People in Latin America
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Canadian here: I watch a lot of Korean dramas. The quality and storytelling is so good. I loved Woo Young-Woo and watched it every week.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,also extremely popular in Japan
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Is this the cartel one?
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Do they have subtitles in other languages? Sometimes german movies and series are only german with german subtitles 🤣😂
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Different platforms. Different genres. Different budgets.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"That's what you took from ""#1 thing in English for the 3rd straight week""?"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Even a K drama? Netflix's hit K dramas are more popular than most of Western shows not just Netflix ones. People here underestimate how popular K Dramas worldwide.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"In a few years, Netflix will just be K-dramas and Stranger Things spinoffs."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,SoKor?
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,My Mister is another slice of life I recommend! Damn that show is up there with Reply 1988.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,_A Business Proposal_ is also pretty fun as a cute light romcom.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,It’s Okay to Not Be Okay is in no way similar to EAW come on. They’re worlds apart.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I love when she just goes off on whales.  Imagine if she got a whale case.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Fair point lol. I’m blaming auto-correct on that one rather than my own carelessness! I’ve yet to watch Extraordinary Attorney Woo but I absolutely intent to at some point. I’m just caught up with Westworld right now. I’m squeezing in a full rewatch in case they cancel it! Never have to worry about that with licensed K-Dramas.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"The [author of the book said](https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1561251440311603200?s=21&t=LFMuZRC-VM9kBCZIxt4RMg) he would try to get the show picked up by another streaming platform in the event of a cancelation by Netflix. I don’t know how much sway he has in the show’s production so take it with a grain of salt, but hopefully he does have enough influence to make it happen if Netflix does cancel the show."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Netflix isn't on the ropes. Good lord.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It might renewed but with a reduced budget for season 2. We've seen shows where that happened, for example Altered Carbon. That was never official but that S2 was looking much cheaper than the first.

Also, despite how much Reddit wants to believe it, Netflix isn't in difficulty"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"This is complete ignorant tinfoil hat bullshit on my end but part of me wonders if the reason Netflix didn't go hard for the show is because they regret spending money on it before their current situation

Otherwise it seems pretty weird to unceremoniously release a 150m show lol"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,If it gets canceled it’ll get picked up.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"As an American viewer, it’s phenomenal! Very interesting to see ins and outs of Korean social norms and is also fairly informative about autism and whale facts!"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"This is my dad too. I saw him one day watching the show and laughing, it was really random. We're korean, but he doesn't usually watch drama series (unless they're historical). But something about the show really draws a lot of people in. It is a great show tho."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Cool, thanks!"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"If you like My Liberation Notes, you should watch My Mister. It's the same writer and it's amazing beautiful story."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Ya there has been a lot of good Korean content on Netflix, people shit on Netflix but they consistently have good foreign shows on there which is something most other streamers don’t. I appreciate Netflix for investing heavily in foreign stuff"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Yep.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It's subtitled and dubbed.

I watched two episodes but didn't love it."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"for some people Korean shows are not ""real"" shows."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,South Korea :D
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,He has also said the $15 mil. price tag people are putting on it is false. If I'm able to find the tweet of that I'll edit it back in.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I mean he can try, but shows getting picked up after cancellation is a VERY RARE thing. If a show get cancelled it's generally for a business reason that does not make it look appealing to other services (generally the ratio viewers/budget is bad), especially from Netflix which has the largest base of viewers to begin with (so the show would likely do even less anywhere else)

The only one I could see being interested are Apple if they want to make it run at a loss for the prestige (and because they have infinite money from other sources and I'm sure most of their shows are not profitable anyway) and HBO because they own it (Warner production) but apparently they already passed on it and HotD good debut will make them go even more all-in on the Game of Thrones universe."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,The absolute worst thing you can say about Netflix's current situation is that they fumbled the lead they had on other companies' streaming platforms ambitions.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"They are more conservative with their spending these days, less give famous directors blank checks and accumulate debt for content that they used to do"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"They rarely advertise any of their shows or movies save for Stranger Things. Mostly, they rely on word of mouth. This past year they'vedropped so many movies with A list stars and A list directors with so little fanfare. They'll put out a trailer on their official youtube channel with the hopes that it will go viral. For obvious reasons, Netflix loves the ""reaction"" youtube channels. Free advertising. So, no, I doubt Netflix is regretting making Sandman. They were just hoping that with a built in cult fanbase, the fanbase would do all the legwork for them in order to save money."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Its not really that extraordinary. The Crown has an absurdly high budget too (I think $13M per episode? and with Gaiman allegedly saying Sandman wasn't $15M per episode we can assume maybe comparable if on the high end) and its 5th season is scheduled for release in less then three months. There has been exactly zero news about the show in like 10 months. The Crown has also won tons of awards and critical acclaim and its still not really getting a ceremonious release or marketing campaign. 

With even the MCU doing abridged marketing campaigns, I wonder if they've just learned you don't need to do huge massive marketing stunts to get viewers anymore. A short window before release will get people to watch just the same."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It's the normal strategy for Netflix though, they are never doing big marketing campaigns and such. They rely on it being on the front page for their hundreds of millions of subscribers and word of mouth."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I could see Apple getting it. It's a huge IP, the first season was well adapted and there's huge potential. Looking at what Apple TV has produced, it fits perfectly with their brand and they're not afraid to spend big money on content."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Very debatable, those same people passed on it in the first place because of the budget, no reason that would change now. Show has done well but it’s not some smash hit. If Netflix the streamer that was willing to invest more in it than anyone cancels it then financially it probably wasn’t good business, Netflix also has the most subs so it would have a huge budget and even less reach on another streamer"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"No reason to be sure like that. Cancelled shows getting picked up is an extremely rare thing (almost every cancelled show try that). I can remember like 2 instances in modern times, The Expanse and Brooklyn 99 (and that one was special because the owners were the ones picking it up)

If a show get cancelled, it's not because it's a huge hit everyone would fight over... It doesn't get cancelled if that's the case."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,It's honestly like the show runners/ script writers have never actually met an autistic person.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Will take a look thanks!
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I love the new foreign shows that pop up every week.  Lots of them end up being things that don't interest me but there are a lot of amazing shows.  I'd say that some of the best shows on the service are foreign shows and there are so many hidden gems.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Nice, I was looking at that one.  I'll def check it out now."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"As a resident of South Korea, please don't call it that. Keep the dumb abbreviations and portmanteaus in the USA."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Netflix pre streaming wars is to video content what Sears was to retail sales before Amazon.

They should've completely obliterate all competition but couldn't be bothered to figure it out."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"The Crown comparison is interesting, if it has the same cost because it seems The Sandman is more popular than the latest seasons of The Crown (or The Witcher actually). It's not a failure and if it isn't as expensive as reported... it has a lot of chances, especially for the prestige too. 

Netflix has indeed always worked like that, they count on the front page and algorithm to push a show and that has always worked for them."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Anyone picking it up would have to do it to lose money and just for building their brand and the prestige. It could be the case for someone like Apple that has infinite money but it's not a given. 

Apple also doesn't seem interested to go after big IP stuff to be honest. They have one adaptation of a big thing, Foundation and are mostly making original stuff like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, For All Mankind, See..."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Oh I apologize about this. I didn’t mean any harm. I’ll edit my post now. :)
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"The Sandman is nowhere near as popular as The Witcher s2. The Sandman is trending for around 36 million equivalent complete viewings over 4 weeks. The Witcher s2 got 57 million over the same time period and is one of Netflix’s most popular shows. 

Hard to say with The Crown. No season has released in the last year where we have the viewership hours data so we cannot compare performance. I’d not be surprised if The Sandman was more popular. The Crown is an awards juggernaut though and that prestige is something to balance out average ratings. I doubt The Sandman will feature at next years Emmy awards."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"You did nothing wrong, that guy was just being incredibly rude"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,No need to apologise.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"How was I rude? In my opinion, jamming words together to make them easier to say is lazy and sounds silly but seems to be popular in the US with both place names and celebrity couples. That's fine with me, but I'd rather the same trend wasn't applied to other places. What's next,  NewZea, SoFrica, and UnKing?"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,is english your second language? why would u be triggered by an abbreviation when it doesn't even infer racial connotation/misspelling etc
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"This is series is clearly one of the best surprises of the year so far, I know powers are cool but I really like the characterizations of the series, especially the friendship between Jen and Carrie that I could say, it anchored the series."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I just binged the whole season this week, it actually just kept getting better & better each episode.

My two favorite performances are probably Jizzlord learning how to be a human again, and when Carrie has her 'date' with the dead king. But everyone was entertaining, even all the supporting actors.

My only complaint is there should've been more Siobhan McSweeney, but hopefully if there's a season 2, she can feature more."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I just finish this show last night. It is really hilarious and the powers they introduce are done in unique ways.

I also love the absolute raunchy comedy of it. Very Fleabag-esque

Carrie was my favorite character by far. I did enjoy Jizzlord’s naïveté too."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"Carries use of her power and being such a great friend really moved me, I don’t want to spoil that one.

I will spoil when she summons Hitler just so they can taunt him with the realities of the world which would disgust him, that scene as so funny for me.

I’m excited for season 2."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"It's nice that stupid powers exist alongside the more typical ones.

I'm glad nobody did anything to that guy with his ass stuck out the wall."
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I loved it! Jizzlord is my fave
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,It’s so well written.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,Loving it. Feels like a cross between Misfits and New Girl.
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,I'm a few episodes in and it is good - hope we get more
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,"I loved this show. The episode with the vet was my favorite. Won't give any spoilers. Couldn't help but contrast the mom with her character in derry girls. 

I hate this new 8 episode trend"
The Worlds Most Extraordinary Homes,This show is made for HULU. There are random pauses presumably for ad breaks for the show on Hulu which can be very immersion breaking for the Disney+ version
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Next I bet we will get a new season of The Slayers lol
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"If this adapted the whole storyline, and without filler it would be great."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Nice
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Not a fan of the animation, the character drawing looks too clean, so much so it's giving me 2016 Berserk vibes."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,inb4 everyone hating on this because the author is a piece of shit.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Oh man, I’m excited to revisit this classic in a newer-looking form."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Animation looks cheap, especially if these are highlights they are choosing for the trailer. 

Nothing will ever top the Trust and Betrayal movies though. Wouldn’t mind a movie per arc of that quality. 

The recent live actions have actually been pretty good."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Surprised this is happening with the recent news of the Author
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"I loved this manga, so well done... but man fuck that author."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,That you are 😊
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Wish I could feel excited for this.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"This is unexpected but really a great news. One of the best shonen and one which doesn't have an annoying MC who want to be the best, the king, the strongest or any of this shonen dream-trop"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Hope it isn’t as preachy as the previous versions. I want to see good sword fight, not a ten minute speech about the heart of a warrior or the sword protects peace or some bs.

""When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk."" -Tuco"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Why did they not bring back Mayo Suzukaze to voice Kenshin? Weak sauce. And this trailer looks cheap as hell.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I just want Sony to adapt the dub. Bring chaos to the world.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,that would actually be incredible!
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Full reboot based on the novels, at least."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,We are getting a reboot of Urusei Yatsura next month (it ended in the 80d while slayers was in the 90s)
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I honestly usually don't care about the animations that much but 2021 and 2022 have really spoiled me with how good some animes can look and i do not like this trailer one bit. It feels very cheap.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,WOW. I had no clue. God damnit.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I can bypass and separate the work of JK Rowling and Harry Potter but I have an harder time with Kenshin and that piece of shiet
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Fun fact, he has so much CP(Real shit, not the ""grey area"" drawn content), that they thought he was distributing it.

Turns out he was not and had bought this shit when it was legal. When Japan somehow made it illegal, he ""forgot"" to turn it in to be disposed of, so the Feds going off of records, raided him and fined him about $1,500 


His punishment was to have his Manga(Kenshin Hokkaido arc) on hiatus a few months. He wasn't canned, because he's a big cash cow and Kenshin is still incredibly popular. 


Japan's laws against sex crimes are awful."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"I own the full collection of the manga (before knowing the author was a pedophile), and I have to say it's just OKAY. There's nothing remarkable about the series. Even the iconic character designs are all lifted from characters in other media (Watsuki himself admits to stealing a lot of Marvel character designs)."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I loved it as a kid but couldn't get past some of the like uwu scenes. Hoping this will address that
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,The fact that Studio Deen did Trust and Betrayal is always hilarious to me.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"What recent news?

I know he got arrested for child porn, but wasn’t that years ago?"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Same. I love redemption and atonement stories. Kenshin was the series that started my love of these stories even, but damn, I just can’t bring myself to support the author. Guy wasn’t even ashamed of what he did and almost 100% still buys child porn."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Reading through ""The Slayers: Special"" right now and would love a series that is closer to the books than the OVAs."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"This is a month old but I'm still shocked how easy he got away with possession of Child Porn. It's disgusting and that just highlights what's wrong with  Japanese laws. The fact that CP was legal at one point not that long ago in Japan is also very disturbing.

 I know people will say you can separate the content from the author but it's hard not to think about it when I see clips of Kenshin. At the back of my mind I always remember how the creator is a pedophile and  knowing that fact makes it hard for me to get hyped about this."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,The comedy is integral to the themes of the show in the earlier seasons.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"I’ve lost track of the studios at this point, you’re gonna have to remind me why it’s hilarious."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,You are right. I thought that happened this year for some reason
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"They did the original fate/stay night. Also did Samurai Deeper Kyo, which is basically a powerpoint presentation/slide show."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Ah. Just looked it up and they did Sword of the Stranger as well. Got some real stand-out animation movies and some really horribly animated TV shows.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Sword of the stranger was animated by bones not deen
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Didn't even know they did that. Such a confusing company.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Sorry, you’re right, I just searched Studio Deen and Sword of the Stranger showed up. Apparently they did the [in-between animation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1121794/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co)."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,\*walks into the thread completely naked\*
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,[deleted]
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"What I'd like to see is how they would handle the story of Zeus's father, Chronos, who was in the habit eating every baby that his wife gave birth to, as soon as it reached her knees. Zeus only survived because Rhea concealed a large stone in swaddling cloths and swapped it with her baby, so that Dad gobbled the stone and Zeus was whisked away."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Animated by Powerhouse Animation, the studio behind Castlevania! Sign me the fuck up!"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,[deleted]
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I am a little sad there aren't more anime based off of Greek/Egyptian/Norse/Celtic/African mythology. I feel you could get a lot of good stories to adapt from it. Would love something like an American gods like Anime with multiple pantheons.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Can we get a reboot of the Percy Jackson books that were failed movies into a nice budgeted Netflix series? 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,They could have just bought the Percy Jackson series and made it similar to how they did A series of unfortunate events 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"3, 2, 1


***Malakas***"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Speaking of Netflix anime has there been any update on when theyre releasing Evangelion 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Give me Percy Jackson damn it!!! But this is nice tho 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Please make this actual greek mythology not just the standard Christian version we get so often. Zeus was a much bigger prick than Hades.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Yassss this sounds cool. Hopefully the animation is good.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Netflix single handedly saving Anime.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"I mean, I'm interested but I want to see other mythologies too. *The Mahabharata* would make a pretty dope Anime, especially with the *Astras*, basically weapons used by heroes that are the ancient Indian equivalent of Final Fantasys Limit Breaks."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Oh please don't make it a 12fps 3D animation rendered in PS2 engine like Dragon Prince
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Sweet!!!  Would love to see more higher quality animation. I can’t stand CGI and live action with crappy actors.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I've always wondered: how would you animate the birth of a god born of the foam formed by a different god throwing the genitals of a third of god onto the sea? 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"For anyone interested in Greek Mythology, Stephen Fry has two great audiobooks on this called Mythos and Heroes, and he is a wonderful narrator."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"While cool, I’m a big side. I was hoping they would go for an art style that looks like Ancient Greek art. "
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Adam Jensen, or rather the voice actor BEHIND Adam Jensen, Elias Toufexis, said he’d be playing the big scary antagonist on the cover?"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Didn’t they have a mythology special already 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Saint Seiya AND this?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Iiya, Heracles-kun~!"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Order Tower of God you fucks.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Holy. Shit.

Some of my 2 favorite things are anime and Greek mythology! I'm fucking excited.

As a kid I watched a lot of great cartoons so as I got older my love for animated media matured too and I got really interested in anime. Now I love it, I just consider them adult cartoons.

As for the Greek Mythology, I used to play (okay still play pretty often...) a lot of Age of Mythology and something about Greek mythology really stuck with me. I love any kind of story that has to do with it and I know a lot about a bunch of different God's/demi-gods/heroes because of it. Any kind of book, movie or show about Greek Mythology always has my attention.

Definitely looking forward to this!"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"If they're doing this, then why not do the percy Jackson series and maybe some of the other mythology series they have too?????"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Good animation studio, questionable writer."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"If any medium could tackle this amount of incest, it is anime"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I'm always happy with more Anime :) I really think it's the future because there are no limits to one's imagination
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I’dike to see less CGI in anime 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Is it going to be a children show or is it going to be TV MA?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Isn’t anime just the romanization of the Japanese word for cartoon? Why not just use the English word for this cartoon? It’s not like it’s a Japanese cartoon. It’s like calling Spider-Man a manhua just appeal to audiences that enjoy Chinese comic books.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"I’ve been craving a mini-series to show the 10, er 12 Trials of Hercules in greater detail.  "
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,How can this top the Familia Mythology? There is no way this series has a better girl than Hestia.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,If its the digital animation... I’m going to pass. Haven’t seen one good show with those digital animations on Netflix 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,So why is it now the choice of animation is either anime or calarts style?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Greek mythology is so overdone. Focus on mythology from another culture. 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Meh. Ahhh those days of Hunterxhunter, Code Geass, Naruto, One piece, gintama..."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Another terrible anime by Netflix. 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Are they going to turn Greek mythological figures into moe girls (*Oda Nobuna no Yabou* style)?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Stop. My penis can only get so erect. 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Now this...Now this right here...this is what it's all about
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"You got me in the first half, not gonna lie"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Can we get a Norse Mythology??? I’d love to see anime Thor fight anime Jormungandr!!!!
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Bro Gods is the only series I want to see. 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Sign me up!
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,seems my daily emails to Netflix for a Percy Jackson animated adaptation is finally starting to get through 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Campione 2?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Berserk Netflix adaptation when?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Project link in the studio's Wikipedia page is redirecting to a Roman Mythology MMO Wikipedia page, dunno why."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Made by the same guys that did death note. I think I’ll pass. 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,I dont know about any of you but I cant wait for the episode covering Asterions conception
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Wonder if they’ll cover the Titanomachy. It’s supposed to be the biggest war of the gods and it went on for like 10 years before Zeus and the Olympians took over.  
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,wait that's not Berserk
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Niceeee !!!
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Yes! I am stoked!

&#x200B;"
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Hm. Neat.
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Can't wait for this to be released and not be available in my country 
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,"Would love to see an animated show about Egyptian God's as well. I've always found them very fascinating.

Norse God's would be cool too but I do feel they're definitely represented a lot more with the Marvel movies and comics and what not."
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Anyone know when this is supposed to be on Netflix?
Rurouni Kenshin: Shin Kyoto-Hen,Just give me that Dragon’s Dogma

Date A Live,My mind goes to Rex from Victorious
Date A Live,"Whoa, I think I stumbled into a subreddit world where ventriloquism does not exist. I thought it would be better."
Date A Live,"I suspect it's origin is in the 90s, since there was a popular child psychology theory then that kids would bond more quickly with a puppet than a human."
Date A Live,"I think the simple explanation is that hand puppets used to be common, and the idea of a hand puppet became conflated with the concept of the 'invisible' imaginary friend.

(In The Shining, Danny has an invisible friend and holds up his hand and moves his finger when his imaginary friend speaks.)

When I was a child my school would sometimes entertain us with puppet shows, and would encourage us perform with the puppets ourselves.

The local fair would have a puppet show.

Also, child psychologists would sometimes use hand puppets (or just a stuffed animal) to give a child an alter ego.

So the original trope was the imaginary friend and a hand puppet became a way to visualize that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary\_friend"
Date A Live,Also if there’s a better sub-Reddit to post this on please let me know! I wasn’t sure where I should post this
Date A Live,"A lot of live action kid's shows had puppets back in the day, sometimes attached to the puppeteer. I guess it's just a common thing that crept into animation when people got older. A recent favourite example is from the manga/anime Radiant, where Doc has to deal with crazy papa puppet to talk to his crush at the coffee shop"
Date A Live,"Did I just find a redditor who believes all ventriloquists view their puppets as genuine separate individuals and aren’t simply putting on a show for the audience? You do know that they don’t think their puppets actually have personalities of their own and free will, don’t you?"
Date A Live,"Did I just find a redditor who believes Mr Garrison is a real person who views his puppet as a genuine separate individual and not just a cartoon character putting on a show for the tv audience? You do know that South Park is not real and characters and events that take place on that television show are all make believe, don't you?"
Date A Live,"I sometimes forget how stupid Reddit can be. Do you want me to explain what a trope is and how fictional characters are made to have personalities? Take Mr Garrison for example. His puppet is supposed to represent the character’s closeted homosexuality, he does not just have the puppet to “put on a show for the audience”. That’s not how most television works, you poor man… Maybe you should take a film class or something, you could really use one."
Date A Live,"And it was like 15 seconds. After weeks of hype, they couldn't even but a minute long ad? Most pointless shit ever"
Date A Live,I saw another angle of it on tiktok. And it clearly was no good. But it was still a weird commercial and not sure how or why it would want me to gamble on sports.
Date A Live,It was bad and weird and I didn't see the lead up ads but he clearly missed the kick [as you can see here](https://imgur.com/8We0Dc3)
Date A Live,"If you slow it down, it appears that the ball does pass in front of the left upright, so it does seem that he missed.  But the whole thing looks completely fake, done on a soundstage and filmed so you can't really see what happens.  An old school extra point wouldn't be in the air that long either."
Date A Live,"[He missed it.](https://twitter.com/FanDuel/status/1624956254828351488)

I think the most the people around him thought it went in which is why they were cheering."
Date A Live,The whole thing was overdone. Looked fake. I am proud of the fact that I have made it this long without being even tempted with all the sports gambling.
Date A Live,"This was actually setup here in AZ a ways away from where the Super Bowl was happening, they shut down some mountain bike trail heads to construct the scene."
Date A Live,"That was it?  Holy fuck that was terrible on every level!

>  He clearly made the kick

What video did you watch?"
Date A Live,Wait you guys got to see it? For us it literally cut to black during the actual kick and it didn’t look intentional. Must be there marketing strategy to make it seem like some sort of conspiracy so we talk about it.
Date A Live,Looked like a fever dream
Date A Live,They only have out a free $5 bet anyway.  The whole thing is stupid
Date A Live,Pretty embarrassing considering they hyped it up and stuff. Like what.
Date A Live,high school level of production there
Date A Live,"Weird, I just thought it was intentional. Like make the event clearly not live when it isn't, have such a silly hook shot, and then the immediate celebration despite the miss. Was it not meant to be a joke?"
Date A Live,"He didn't make the kick. Watch it at .25 speed on youtube and pause it, it clearly goes in front of the goal post."
Date A Live,Can I get some context here? Who is this guy?
Date A Live,"There's an entirely different angle that shows it's real, and that he missed. 

Get your eyes checked."
Date A Live,">he clearly made the kick

idk, maybe if you're fucking blind, because he clearly missed it

you ever consider getting a job refereeing professional sports?"
Date A Live,"Also, if he supposedly missed, why are all the other ""fans"" around him jumping and cheering afterwards?"
Date A Live,"1. The idea of it being ""Live"" was just a gimmick. They weren't trying to trick you into thinking it was ""Live"". It was just a joke.
2. He clearly missed the kick in this video."
Date A Live,no matter what he was going to make it. If he didn't they had to make it look like he did
Date A Live,What a let down. I honestly thought they would have him win it and then give out like $5 to everyone. Just to give them that winning high and get them hooked
Date A Live,Yea this was a disaster lol.  You cannot hype something this much and have it be so canned and ridiculous.  And they only ran it as a :15!
Date A Live,Especially for how they hyped it to be live it was a total dud
Date A Live,I don't think Gronk lost on it.
Date A Live,"ITT: people still talking about a “terrible” commercial and the brand, proving the commercial worked."
Date A Live,"I´ve never watched American football, but the ball clearly went past the goal, not through it."
Date A Live,"gronk is annoying in every commercial anyway

like just a stereotypical bro and its really not funny, charming, or tolerable

go away"
Date A Live,"> I didn't see the lead up ads

Lucky you, I'm not even being sarcastic."
Date A Live,It was a huge hook for such a short kick.
Date A Live,Yeah there's one frame in this video you can clearly see the ball in front of the post.
Date A Live,"The problem is the ball shrinks too quickly.

Even though it passes in front of the left post its size gives the illusion its further away. 

Sloppy cg."
Date A Live,The refs aren't looking up at all either.
Date A Live,"Yup, can’t believe how many people keep saying he made it when the video definitely shows him missing it."
Date A Live,"I did once, I won, it felt like nothing so no reason to do it again. I hate how much the sports betting is now shoved into like SportsCenter and stuff."
Date A Live,"Yea, it was filmed in the Estrella mountain range per this thread that popped up yesterday.

https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/1108h2a/discovered_where_gronk_is_kicking_on_my_hike/"
Date A Live,"If only there was some type of organized event where those kicks happen frequently and they could practice how to film it to make it clear. Oh well, maybe next year"
Date A Live,"Retired American Football player and future Hall of Famer. FanDuel, a sports gambling app, ran a promotion where he'd try to kick a field goal live during a Super Bowl commercial and if he makes it customers get a promotion for some kind of free incentive. He missed but they're still doing the promotion."
Date A Live,"Those aren't ""fans."" That's his family, as it says in the commercial. Pretty sure the woman who runs closest to him before he falls down disappointed is his girlfriend, Camille Kostek. While they do all run in his direction and crowd him, if you actually look at what individuals are doing, they're not celebrating."
Date A Live,You’re asking why people wrongly thought he made it when you’re in that boat? Really?
Date A Live,He didn't make it though. The commercial is that he misses but they're still giving the same deal they said they would if he made it.
Date A Live,They gave out $5 anyway because it’s just a promo to get people gambling like you say.
Date A Live,His USAA commercials are borderline making fun of mentally disabled people. It's fuckin gross.
Date A Live,Its bendier than Beckham
Date A Live,The kick flies likes its a 50 yard field goal.  The whole thing looks wrong.
Date A Live,This is the issue. They shrunk the ball so small that it looks like it’s way past the goal posts already before it hooks.
Date A Live,"Yeah, if you slow it down you can watch the ball pass in front of the upright. They were always gonna do the deal lol"
Date A Live,"Yup, and they were always going to give people the money regardless of whether or not he made the kick. That’s how these promos go."
Date A Live,"True, but with him missing it was a lame consolation prize. If you’re going to script it anyways I would think you’d want him to make it"
Date A Live,Plus only military associated people can bank with them which is a tiny part of the population so where's the money going?
Date A Live,"""I want one!""

""A child?""

""No, a sticker!"""
Date A Live,"People on r/NFL talked shit on me when I brought up how much his ""But I'm special"" line bothered me. As someone whose mom taught special ed, and thus I volunteered to help in her classes a ton, it really made me feel like our society is regressing seeing those ads. Glad to see your comment and know I'm not alone in feeling like these ads are disparaging toward people with developmental disabilities."
Date A Live,Beckham bent a little too far in the SB last year
Date A Live,"Meh, it was free money either way so I don’t care if he made it or missed it. And I don’t think it was scripted even if it wasn’t live. Plus I won money in another sportsbook because he missed it so I’m fine with the outcome."
Date A Live,"If they're anything like Navy Federal, which it looks like from their site, all you need a referral from someone that's already a member. I got in Navy Federal through a family member, who got in through his wife."
Date A Live,Eh I use usaa bc my gramps was military. Neither of my parents or me have ever served so it can kinda spiderweb the potential user base
Date A Live,Those ads really bother me too. I do thingGronk seems like an overall good dude from other stuff I’ve seen of him but those ads really don’t do him any favors
Date A Live,"Man, people get butthurt over the most inane, innocuous shit."
Date A Live,"I remember the main problem at the time was the setting.  HBO wanted to chance the setting to US instead of Germany to make it more accessible and for their audience which doesn’t work story wise.   I think today this issue would be moot.  There have been a lot of internationally set dramas that have found a wide audience.

The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.   That just doesn’t fly in Hollywood.   Maybe if it became del toros passion project but nobody is putting up that much time and money without the rights."
Date A Live,"Fucking A man, totally agree with all of this. The anime is incredible, as is the manga. I’d recommend it for anyone **especially those who don’t like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime. It’s more comparable to a David Fincher film.

The story is just too good to never be adapted, so we’ll get it someday. But yeah, Del Toro would’ve been an ideal person to oversee an adaptation. He said they were shopping it to networks after the HBO deal fell through, but nothing ever came of it, so idk why no one would be interested in a Del Toro written and directed pilot. It hits the exact same demos of something like True Detective."
Date A Live,"Here is the opening and ending of the anime, to those that are interested.

Opening - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU)

Ending - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughzNttzA78"
Date A Live,"Monster is one of the, if not *the*, greatest anime of all time. I highly recommend it. It draws you in with the suspense and tension and then you stay for how amazing and layered the characters are."
Date A Live,"If you've never watched Monster, please, go watch one of the best pieces of media put out. Don't judge it because it's an anime. It's a long discussion about the nature of evil, the impact of genetics versus society on the formation of the individual, the rippling consequences of evil . . . I could go on. Johan Liebert is genuinely a frightening villain, and for a long time in the anime, I was truly debating whether he was the antichrist. An incredible show.

Edit: I just remembered the final scene and I'm haunted."
Date A Live,"Now that i think about it, the manga/anime reminds me of Zodiac, Mindhunter and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from David Fincher.

It explores a lot of darkness within humanity and the ways in which we judge morality."
Date A Live,This knowledge that you’ve given me that this adaptation was in the works but canned has depressed me. Excellent anime and manga in my top 5. Would’ve made a killer series
Date A Live,"I just don’t know that the animated Johan translates into live action, for numerous reasons. There are so many incredible characters that I think *would* work in a live setting, but I’m just not sure you could adapt the twins in a satisfying way."
Date A Live,"To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption. It's not like they don't have the talent to do it; all they lack is money, but if they were to work with some big streaming service that would give them enough freedom and a decent budget, then it should be fine. 

HBO and Del Toro would certainly do a good job, but they would also adapt it to the western taste. I'd rather have someone like Kurosawa do it.

Anyway, it will probably never happen, but at least we have a great anime adaption."
Date A Live,Sounds dumb
Date A Live,Considering all the other live action adaptations Hollywood has done over the years a Monster  live action series seems like the one with greatest chance of doing well.
Date A Live,Wish someone could do a live action of any Naoki Urusawa's works.
Date A Live,"I think now more than ever would be the perfect time to adapt it. Streaming services such as Netflix have proved that international productions work, and so if it were to be a German production (or perhaps Czech co-production) it would still likely find a pretty large audience. But I also wouldn't mind an English-language version so long as it's faithful to the setting (like Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). And whereas in the past you'd likely get a whitewashed version of Tenma's character, I'd think these days studios wouldn't forego an Asian lead."
Date A Live,"IIRC it was an interview with Del Toro in the past couple years, but I think I remember him saying it’s still on his list of dream projects. With Pluto getting an anime adaptation (*fucking finally*) I could see him revisiting trying to push Monster given the author is in the limelight again. He’s at the point in his career where he’s in his right to approach a studio with an IP or concept with genuine enthusiasm from the studio.  

Also yeah today things could be done in the US given the current political climate, but I also think HBO would be more receptive to having the series in its original setting nowadays."
Date A Live,"Who in their right mind would want it set in America? The setting, the story is German with literal nazi’s and eugenics."
Date A Live,">The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.

Good for him for having the balls to make that play. Hollywood has a horrible track record for live action anime adaptations, worse than video game adaptations. More mangakas should be way more protective about their IP when Hollywood comes knocking."
Date A Live,"Yeah, i guess the behind the scenes of this production would be a little more tricker than i expected.

The US setting would be a big No No.

I could see the german couple that did Netflix's Dark making a good adaptation.

Dark had a lot of 1980s Germany scenes in it and there was a lot of good character drama and exploration of the human psyche, alongside some philosophies of what it means to live and die."
Date A Live,"Honestly, that is also how i tried to convince some of my friends to watch it.

The **anime for those that don't like anime** and that is comparable to a David Fincher film/series, as pretentious as that may possibly sound.

HBO would have been the best network for it, beyond a doubt.

They could probably make 3 seasons of this, 10 episodes each.

The week to week releases as the mystery gets darker and darker would be great to witness in a live-action format."
Date A Live,"Unfortunately the tv spending spree is coming to an end. That said, Monster would be a much less expensive production than 98% of other anime adapted projects out there. There could be hope if there are people who really want to get it done."
Date A Live,"
>I’d recommend it for anyone **especially those who don’t like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime.

Haha,  that was me! I wasn't into sci-fi, ninjas, robots, or goofy comedy animes, but my friend showed me the 1st episode of Monster when it came out, and I was hooked. I'm a big Fincher fan too.

That was the gateway for me to get into Urasawa's other works (20th Century Boys, Billy Bat), plus other dark/psychological animes like Satoshi Kon's work (Perfect Blue,  Paranoia Agent)."
Date A Live,"The character studies in this are incredible. There is this short story told by this old man when he used to be a sniper. He was assigned to kill this businessman. He observes the man from distance, ready to kill him. The man is putting sugar in his coffee and the sniper thinks he'll pull the trigger when the man finishes stirring his coffee and take a sip of it. But the man keeps on adding sugar in his coffee over and over again and the sniper simply can't shoot anymore and quits his job. There is this another story of his man who killed a guy in a park and from that day on birds won't come in the park anyone. Or that story of the old couple going to visit their son.  Even the one-off characters are so layered."
Date A Live,One of the captured serial killers reminded me a lot of Ed Kemper too.
Date A Live,">To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption.

I feel like Japan would be one of the worst countries to adapt this given the material. Like the entire cast is white besides Tenma and a few minor characters, and the story being set in Germany is a pretty integral aspect of the series (there’s a whole subplot in the show about neo-nazi’s that wouldn’t make sense if they were played by a bunch of Japanese guys)."
Date A Live,so do most drama shows when you try to think about them.
Date A Live,"Good for him making an unreasonable demand? No show will ever get made like that. 

I could see saying that if he simply said “no” to development partners he didn’t like or trust. But you can’t just ask people to spend millions of dollars making something before deciding to sign off or not. It’s unreasonable. At some point you have to have some faith in the people you are choosing to work with."
Date A Live,For sure.  I’m torn now - I’d have loved to see this a decade ago on HBO with.  But these days Netflix is more likely to pick this up - theyve had more success with international shows and the 3 season maximum is a draw for their model - But I feel like a lower budget Netflix version would make me sad when this should get the HBO Last of Us/Westworld/GoT production value.  But I guess these days Warner/Discover is having their own $$ issues…
Date A Live,"I think 4 seasons would be ideal, just because there are natural season finale endpoints in volume 4 where >!Tenma is tied up in the loading dock by racists and the building is set on fire!< , and in volume 9 where >!Tenma sees Johan at the library and tries to kill him!< 

It would be so cool because although he’s the protagonist, Tenma goes in and out of the series a lot while you follow other characters. If they did 4 seasons, they’d likely have to do one season where the lead character is barely in it! 

It’s funny, because regarding THAT choice >!Tenma!< has to make at the end, I could see what he decided to do being extremely controversial nowadays and massively hated similarly to The Last of us 2 or The Last Jedi. But I thought it was great!"
Date A Live,Well said. Plus every single minor character has a role to play and some payoff. There isn’t a single episode of filler.
Date A Live,"Yep. 5 scoops of sugar, same as the sniper."
Date A Live,"I was mostly referring to the potential team behind it: the writer, director, composer etc. Japan has a lot of talented artists and it would be great if they took part in a potential global hit.

The best option imo would be a collab between Japan and Germany. That would make the most faithful adaption."
Date A Live,"yeah, i won't deny that"
Date A Live,"People make demands like this instead of saying no. There was probably some weird clause in the contract giving them rights based on other contingencies but you can weasel out of it by demanding too much.

It’s way more common than you think."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Something about watching rich people be miserable in paradise really scratches an itch I didn't know I had
Snow White with the Red Hair,I just love how every scene is punctuated by great art.
Snow White with the Red Hair,HBO is living proof that quality wins out.
Snow White with the Red Hair,I really need to binge this show starting S1
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Good show - good music - I can’t put my finger on it, but there is just something about the show that draws you in 🤔"
Snow White with the Red Hair,I am genuinely surprised to be saying this but I think the second season might be better than the first if it keeps this quality up.
Snow White with the Red Hair,I cannot believe there is only one more episode left.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I absolutely love this show, one of the best things I’ve watched this year."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Lucia is a goddess.
Snow White with the Red Hair,Mike White is brilliant
Snow White with the Red Hair,aubrey plaza nip slips will do that for ya
Snow White with the Red Hair,"This is one is the best shows I've seen this year. That title credit sequence and music is up there with Game of thrones, westworld, six feet under, true blood and all the other shows with epic music. (Damn, all my suggestions are hbo shows)"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I am genuinely curious how much of a boost HBO max is getting overall from HoTD.

It got me to do a first watch-through of The Sopranos and i’ll be giving this series a try next. Simply cause i see it on the viewer when i login"
Snow White with the Red Hair,Feels like it's rising every week
Snow White with the Red Hair,Tik tok and IG accounts obsessing over it and rolling out elaborate theories combined with all the episodes available for a quick binge in order to catch up is a perfect recipe.
Snow White with the Red Hair,Crazy how this season is even better than the first. Hope they stick the landing in the finale
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I love how there are no completely “good” or “bad” characters.  Everyone is flawed, everyone is complex."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Those two prostitutes that walking around spreading chaos is my favorite part!
Snow White with the Red Hair,"It's been a great season, so I'm not surprised. Excited to see where they go next. I saw some reports that it might be Japan. I also think a cruise could be pretty cool."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"You're welcome, guys. I binged the fuck out of season 1 an 2 and caught episode 5 hours after it aired and then watched 6 live. 

Just doing my part."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Mike White's earlier show Enlightened is also on HBO and comes highly recommended. Was very much under the radar when it originally came out. 

Two seasons, starring Laura Dern, Luke Wilson and Mike White himself."
Snow White with the Red Hair,I just want to know what the point of the faces is. I need it.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Between this and HoTD, HBO is absolutely killing it."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"The problem im having with this season is that EVERY reveal has had to be explained to me.

I didnt get it with e first photo as it just wooshed me.
I didnt get it with the sex scene as I couldnt see who it was.
I didnt get the last photo as I didnt recognise who it was.

Im having to come on reddit to have the twists explained to me, which is really killing the impact….

Is this a problem given im an idiot and cant recognise shit? Dunno.  Judt wish i got it first time."
Snow White with the Red Hair,I love this series! I want one season happening in Portugal!
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I have to say, I love having a new episode to look forward to every week. I have a set time where I sit down and watch the episode. And the show is quality of course."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Can I watch season two without having watched season one?
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Details:

>After reaching a series high of 2.3 million viewers with last week’s episode, “The White Lotus” has reached a new personal best. The sixth episode of season 2 brought in 2.8 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max on Sunday, a 22% increase from the week before.

The season finale is Sunday."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Someone finally made a show for adults. Thank you
Snow White with the Red Hair,Are people starting at episode 6? How are there more viewers than for previous episodes?
Snow White with the Red Hair,Take your time with this series folks. Much more enjoyable when you let every episode digest a bit.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I’m starting to enjoy this season more than season 1. With that said, I’d love for season 3 to be set at an upscale ski resort to change it up."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Season 2 cast took me a few episodes to really feel involved with the characters. But, damn if I’m not consumed with this show right now. The last handful of episodes have been amazing."
Snow White with the Red Hair,So what is this about.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I didn’t like this season as much as the last. To me, it finally got good in this last episode. I don’t know how a 7 episode tv show can do it, but it felt like it took to long to get to the point."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Best show currently
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Just watched the first episode tonight and wasn’t that impressed. Thinking it might be a show that gets better after a couple episodes, but idk. That warm sepia tone is thick!"
Snow White with the Red Hair,Last season was a warm-up; this season is better. The writing is fantastic. Sure the actors sell a series and have to wear it if the writing sucks; I'm always amazed at how humble writers are.
Snow White with the Red Hair,I didn’t mind season 1 but wasn’t as impressed as everyone else so I wasn’t looking forward to season 2 much. I’m so glad I watch it because this season has me hooked. I genuinely enjoy watching every character and look forward to it each week. It’s so good. Daphne steals the show IMO.
Snow White with the Red Hair,Both have seasons have been excellent
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I guess the show just wooshed on me, I watched like 5 episodes expecting something to happen and nothing happened.

EDIT: Not sure why the downvotes, that was my experience, if instead someone would explain what I should be looking for I could give it a second chance."
Snow White with the Red Hair,What am I missing about this show? I watched one episode of the first season and I don’t get the hype.
Snow White with the Red Hair,I’m just watching it for aubrey plaza
Snow White with the Red Hair,"White Lotus Season 3 Location?

I say Bali."
Snow White with the Red Hair,How does a tv show spike in viewership after ep 1?
Snow White with the Red Hair,i wish they kept the season 1 music it slapped
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Serious question.  Is this show really worth watching?

I turned it off half way through the first episode.  Does it get better?

And does Tanya McQuoid-Hunt stop being so annoying?"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I like the show but I hate that Coolidge is the continuity, she’s annoying.

EDIT:  I guess whiny over privileged women have some pull.

EDIT:  Just watched the finale, fuck you downvoting haters lol."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"unfortunate they had their worst episode, but I guess it's setup for the finale"
Snow White with the Red Hair,And the creator is none other than Ned Schneebly from School of Rock!
Snow White with the Red Hair,People want to binge shows. I watch the new episodes every week but almost everyone of my friends and coworkers are waiting for the series to be almost fully released before they watch it. The jump in viewership is most likely because of that reason for the rest of the public as well…
Snow White with the Red Hair,This looks nothing like an Avatar spinoff. Consider me disappointed.
Snow White with the Red Hair,Season 2 > season 1
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Big dicks = big viewership

Look folks, I don't make these rules, I'm just documenting them."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Can't believe Harper would do that to Ethan.
Snow White with the Red Hair,The way they build and break the tension on this show is just (chef's kiss)
Snow White with the Red Hair,"the score this season is phenomenal! it really adds to the intensity of the scenes! even the outside music is wonderful, i’m loving all the Italian pop (shoutout to este haim!)"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Is the increase due to showing Theo James' huge donkey-sized prosthetic cock, I wonder?"
Snow White with the Red Hair,Men love hookers! Big news story ? Not the best of Mike White.
Snow White with the Red Hair,[deleted]
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I think around episode one the audience RT score was 42%. Now it's 53%

First season was 65 -ish?

Watching people react to the show is half the fun. People interpreting things so many different ways."
Snow White with the Red Hair,So are people starting on episode 6?
Snow White with the Red Hair,Buh buh buhhhhhh
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Episode was a bit of snooze fest. 

If you’re so gratuitously going to do a set up episode, release both the episodes."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Far too much penis, even for HBO."
Snow White with the Red Hair,I don’t understand how that works. Like do people just pop in for random episodes?
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Would love to place a sizeable bet it cannot be one of the guest to die, except maybe Portia the personal assistant. Why? The idea the very careless and self-absorbed well-off have to pay for their errors is contrary to the concept."
Snow White with the Red Hair,It says I watched it even though I didn’t
Snow White with the Red Hair,"My dumb ass thought it was six episodes like season one, I’ve tried to avoid spoilers so…. last night I binged it and well— I enjoyed it and I’m excited for it to continue but I feel silly."
Snow White with the Red Hair,I like season two better than season one!
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I only heard about this show this morning, during a Peloton class I was taking, talked all about it.  Still have no idea what it is."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Do you watch Succession too? More rich people being miserable in rich places!
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Money can't make you happy, but it can sure as hell allow you to be miserable in comfort."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I go to these types of resorts with my rich in-laws, so for me, I can’t watch this show. It’s just like hanging out with my family, and I’m trying to decompress."
Snow White with the Red Hair,You too could be rich and misrable and murdered
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I love the opening credit scenes with all the tawdry images thrown in. 

Woman fucking a swan? Sure. 

One dude sucking another one's dick? Why not?

There's a ton more but the only one I really remember is the woman and the swan."
Snow White with the Red Hair,That or gorgeous scenery. Sicily is definitely a supporting cast member.
Snow White with the Red Hair,Man the fucking merger has got me worried for HBO keeping up that quality though
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Lucia, Valentina, and Harper carrying the show on the back of their toxic personalities"
Snow White with the Red Hair,Except for animation. HBO MAX Animation loses even if it’s quality.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"and to think we have The Last of Us in a month, HBO fans are truly feasting"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"No, no. We need four seasons of ""is it cake?"" And 30 new movies each Friday, with 3 Christmas movies that would make Hallmark blush. That's the winning strategy right there"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Is it?

Viewership from this article max for White Lotus is ~9-10 million. 

How is that winning out?

It’s a fun show, no doubt. Critics love it. But it’s an incredibly poor business decision for an entertainment company."
Snow White with the Red Hair,Show is so good.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"It’s my favorite streaming service for sure. Not just in content, but actual media quality too. It’s a real joy to me, to turn something on, and know I’m most likely going to be enjoying my little theater set up."
Snow White with the Red Hair,HBO is the perfect balance of quality AND quantity
Snow White with the Red Hair,The week-by-week viewing has been so much fun because of all the viewer engagement. You’ll have season 3 to look forward to for that :)
Snow White with the Red Hair,This season is better than season 1.
Snow White with the Red Hair,you can start with s2 and be completely fine
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I heard the rave of s1 through reddit and followed s2 on weekly basis, and it has been a good experience"
Snow White with the Red Hair,S1 was kind of dragging. S2 is miles better.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Go for it, it's the perfect show to watch on a second screen. It doesn't require full attention all the time, you're free to be on your phone or work alongside it."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Exotic locale, mix of international actors and the interpersonal dynamic of the characters makes it feel authentic."
Snow White with the Red Hair,"I think shooting on location helps, you just can't help but want to be there with them."
Snow White with the Red Hair,I love how subtly “thriller” it is and how both of the seasons start with a death and you’re left to try and guess who it is and what’s gonna happen. I love it.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Beautifully shot, edited, scored, and acted. Just a good show all around"
Snow White with the Red Hair,"What’s the premise? It’s a resort but is it a realistic drama? Or a tinge of supernatural stuff?

I’ve been intrigued, but never interested enough to actually hit play."
Snow White with the Red Hair,The music carry’s like 50% of the load
Snow White with the Red Hair,I’ve never had a hard time describing why I like a show. It’s just…so watchable.
Snow White with the Red Hair,"Music is definitely a big factor, but another thing I noticed was that the scenes and acting are all very tight,  and because it's an ensemble where all the characters are individually interesting, it jumps around  enough to keep you continually intrigued, without it feeling all over the place. I'm definitely glad I decided to give it a try cause it's quickly become one of my favorite shows. Casting director deserves accolades that's for sure."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"""Did he get EP?“

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,They never made a legitimate season 1.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with “Money for Nothing”? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I’m in.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,This show was… not good.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don’t get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would’ve enjoyed it more if it didn’t have the “Willow” label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn’t feed off the world the original movie built.

I’m all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can’t believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"It was … ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,But it’s so awful
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Won’t cry when they cancel it. It’s like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I didn’t even make it past the first episode.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I wouldn't bet on it.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Let’s do a Legend series instead
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven’t felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,This needs to be cancelled.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the “Women aren’t accepted as fighters/knights,” thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I’m sorry kid, I guess I should have named you “Maze Runner Divergent.”"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn’t rewatch the movie beforehand so it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random “wtf” moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won’t shed a tear if the show doesn’t get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
A Certain Scientific Railgun,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it’s Willow.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,this show needs to not be renewed.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
A Certain Scientific Railgun,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying “uuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!” to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series genuinely didn’t like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"There’s either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can’t quite figure out which."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it’s obsessed with modern politics over story once it’s out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn’t meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn’t that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Good luck with that Ron.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I didn’t enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,It’s an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
A Certain Scientific Railgun,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Does he have COVID?
A Certain Scientific Railgun,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
A Certain Scientific Railgun,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
ReLIFE,[deleted]
ReLIFE,If you haven't you should listen to the Conan podcast they did together it's comedy gold.
ReLIFE,He's so fucking good on Justified.
ReLIFE,Timothy Olyphant is just so...cool.
ReLIFE,My favorite is when showed the difference between [Stage acting and Screen Acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TEqxuJSS08)
ReLIFE,"Timothy O has been my movie star crush since I saw him in “Go”. I loved his appearance on Conan’s podcast. He’s so funny, handsome and charismatic and I would sit on his face over and over again"
ReLIFE,https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/timothy-olyphant-the-good-place-2.gif
ReLIFE,I loved the time he came on and talked all kinds of shit on Jim Carrey for that Man on the Moon doc.
ReLIFE,[This one](https://youtu.be/_IdgJOr1HSY) will always be my favorite.  I still laugh every time I watch it.
ReLIFE,"Timothy plays himself on a few episodes of The Grinder, it’s comedy gold."
ReLIFE,Wernt there olyphants in the LOTR universe ?
ReLIFE,Can we take a minute to mourn santa clarita diet?
ReLIFE,Yeah Tim would be a good contender for Joel in HBOs The Last of Us.  He has the connections so hopefully they screen test him.
ReLIFE,I still have a mad crush on Timothy.
ReLIFE,Timothy Olyphant is fantastic. I listened to and thoroughly enjoyed the [podcast he did with Marc Maron.](https://podbay.fm/podcast/329875043/e/1558940400) Starts 13 mins 50 seconds in.
ReLIFE,"I love him in literally everything he does, has an amazing range. Really wish I saw him in more stuff, I think he’s highly underrated."
ReLIFE,Danny Cordray
ReLIFE,"God damn he's an attractive man.

When he said ""in the house that I bought"" I was hoping he'd reference himself and say ""actually, in the house that Hitman bought."""
ReLIFE,[deleted]
ReLIFE,"""You're getting on Wikifeet""

LMFAO. Never change, Andy"
ReLIFE,Good opportunity to tell folks that Santa Clarita Diet was an amazing show and Timothy Olyphants character never ceases to make me laugh my ass off in it
ReLIFE,As a straight man I can 100% say Timothy Olyphant is a snack and a half.  I have the biggest man crush on him since Go!  If you feel the same about him check out Santa Clarita Diet on Netflix it's some of his best comedic work.
ReLIFE,The Crazies is one of my favorite movies.
ReLIFE,Is there a scientific formula to determine what level of cool/handsome you have to be to pull off a hat like that?
ReLIFE,That was a delight
ReLIFE,"I’m a simple man: I see an Olyphant/Conan video, and I go on a binge of all the Olyphant/Conan videos I can find."
ReLIFE,"Man, I miss Santa Clarita Diet."
ReLIFE,Justified!
ReLIFE,I was blown away after first time I saw him on Justified. Now he keeps popping up in Once upon a time in Hollywood and latest season of Curb your enthusiasm. Superb actor.
ReLIFE,"There's no one better....   
Norm Macdonald: Hold my punchline and watch this."
ReLIFE,"""In real life""? Is this proof we're all just part of a simulation?"
ReLIFE,"as a fan of the hitman games, imo, he really did the series justice."
ReLIFE,I love Timothy and this made me love him more.
ReLIFE,"Hells fuck'n yeah he is, love both these men."
ReLIFE,He's the most charismatic person I've ever seen
ReLIFE,I'll always remember him as Micky from Scream 2.
ReLIFE,Tim Olyphant will also get a nod from me for Justified.
ReLIFE,I wish I discovered Timothy Olyphant sooner.
ReLIFE,I think the anime character he was mentioning was Luffy from One Piece
ReLIFE,I think Timothy was thinking about the Geico Pinocchio.
ReLIFE,He ain’t wrong about the Tito’s
ReLIFE,I loved his guest spot on The Good Place.  He just seems like he is a genuinely fun guy to be around with a great sense of humor.
ReLIFE,I loved his cameo in The Good Place.
ReLIFE,wasn't Olyphant a jerk to Kevin Smith?
ReLIFE,"God, I miss Justifed."
ReLIFE,One of the best? Sure. But the best guest is Tracy Morgan. Hands down.
ReLIFE,Is it just me or does this guy look like an older Cristiano Ronaldo?
ReLIFE,Why do these shows have the random guy who isn't quite as attractive or funny as the host sitting there saying nothing?
ReLIFE,This title reads like it was written by a five year old
ReLIFE,That hat is too distracting and obnoxious. Fits the show i guess.
ReLIFE,"I really wonder why Conan continues with his show, I get he's contractually obligated but even A Little Late with Lilly Singh get's triple his viewers which is extremely embarrassing, dude is coasting on like 300k viewers a night. Why bother anymore? No shame in retiring."
ReLIFE,"Tim used to look normal, but lately his face looks very different.  What did he do to himself?"
ReLIFE,Bill Burr and Conan are not friends
ReLIFE,It’s Mr poopybutthole from Rick and morty https://www.google.com/search?q=rick.and.morty+mr+poopybutthole&safe=off&rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA697CA698&hl=en-US&prmd=isvn&sxsrf=ALeKk02CIjdaRvwBjmHQohxDPjKtd_nGBQ:1583544394046&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZht_ImofoAhWJQs0KHXMPCJAQ_AUoAXoECAwQAQ&biw=375&bih=551&dpr=2#imgrc=K9w0CjhSKsQMQM
ReLIFE,You get to know a man
ReLIFE,That’s damn right
ReLIFE,Fire in the hole!
ReLIFE,"It's probably my favorite one besides Chuck Barkley.

Just the hijacking of the ad reads alone is worth the first place"
ReLIFE,"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend is legitimately brilliant. Every single episode is worth listening too.

I think my favorites are Hannah Gadsby, Billy Eichner, Keegan Michael Key, and Tig Notaro. But seriously, listen to them all."
ReLIFE,"Feb 17, 2019 if anyone needs help finding it in a podcast directory"
ReLIFE,I love how on the podcast and the show Tim’s always selling things he’ll never get paid for endorsing.
ReLIFE,"Hell yeah, I'm glad you shared this existed because I have never laughed harder at Conan's show than when he comes on. Timothy is hysterical and their chemistry is great."
ReLIFE,The newer episode with Gaffigan had me dying.  It also had Sona and Gorly (spelling?) laughing harder than I've ever heard.
ReLIFE,"It's probably my favorite one besides Chuck Barkley.

Just the hijacking of the ad reads alone is worth the first place"
ReLIFE,"I was just scrolling through it for the first time. Was hoping to see Jack White on there, his hour long interview with Conan was great."
ReLIFE,They're all great.
ReLIFE,What’s it called
ReLIFE,Is this the Conan Needs a Friend podcast or another one?
ReLIFE,Lol not really. he’s got nice energy though. now the jim gaffigan one is comedy gold
ReLIFE,"And, on Santa Clarita Diet, he showed that he's an incredible comedic actor too. That show ruled, ans I am very happy to see the neighbor son being in lots of stuff now, he's truly great."
ReLIFE,He could be a good candidate for the Jack Reacher TV show.
ReLIFE,x4
ReLIFE,"""next one's coming faster"""
ReLIFE,"Timothy Olyphant is a Bohemian Californian cosplaying as a Texas cowboy, and I love every minute of it"
ReLIFE,"He would've made a great Iron Man if RDJ didn't exist, and he would have made a great Reed Richards if he was just a bit younger."
ReLIFE,It's sooo Justified.
ReLIFE,That guy’s the tits!
ReLIFE,One of my favorite actors....ever
ReLIFE,He's 50 gallons of man in a 10 gallon hat.
ReLIFE,"[Also love this clip](https://youtu.be/1ozIfSxda0Q) from the same episode. Him, Jeff Goldblum and Kristin Chenoweth are my favourite guests on Conan."
ReLIFE,Oh my god that was so good!
ReLIFE,Find somebody that looks at you the way deadsharkeyes looks at Timothy Olyphant.
ReLIFE,Shit I’m a guy and feel the same way hahaha
ReLIFE,"I first saw him in Girl Next Door and thought ''is that Michael Biehn?''. If they ever made a direct sequel to Aliens where Hicks survives and Biehn didn't come back, he'd be a good choice."
ReLIFE,"Dream your dream, baby"
ReLIFE,I just said the same thing. He was so good as the sleazy drug dealer.
ReLIFE,Was he in the Good Place in-character as Raylan Givens? He's got the exact same look there
ReLIFE,"My God, his facial reactions through that scene alone had me dying lol"
ReLIFE,I'm gonna have to find that! Jim Carrey was super mega cringe in that doc and shit-tallking it is one of my favorite things.
ReLIFE,Omg this was amazing.
ReLIFE,RIP The Grinder.  That show deserved a longer life.
ReLIFE,It was amazing.
ReLIFE,I tear up at what might of been...alpha Joel deserved his time in the sun...BUT NO! Netflix decided we didn't need to see it! Bastards...has made me every wary of getting into their shows.
ReLIFE,It deserved a final season.  Show was comedy gold.
ReLIFE,"Hmm, never crossed my mind, but that could be an interesting option, and also a bit different from the game's version. Though, this might just because i like Timothy Olyphant.

Does anyone remember a strong dramatic scene with him? I'm just thinking about the game's opening. As far as i can remember in Justified his character was pretty stoic. I never finished Deadwood, so maybe there was something like that."
ReLIFE,"I thought the same thing the moment thwy annoucned the show. Honestly, the more that I think about it, I could see him a little bit more as Tommy."
ReLIFE,"Eh, I kinda hope TLOU on Netflix is it's own story in the same universe. The game already told it's story well enough, it doesn't need to be told again."
ReLIFE,"Skipping the Maron part, as is tradition"
ReLIFE,Oh lol the interview episode with Michael in the surveillance room was hilarious
ReLIFE,I think he was talking about Rango
The Eccentric Family,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
The Eccentric Family,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
The Eccentric Family,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
The Eccentric Family,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
The Eccentric Family,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
The Eccentric Family,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
The Eccentric Family,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
The Eccentric Family,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
The Eccentric Family,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

The Eccentric Family,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
The Eccentric Family,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
The Eccentric Family,Needs more Jojo
The Eccentric Family,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
The Eccentric Family,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
The Eccentric Family,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
The Eccentric Family,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
The Eccentric Family,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
The Eccentric Family,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
The Eccentric Family,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
The Eccentric Family,Madoka magica ! 
The Eccentric Family,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
The Eccentric Family,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
The Eccentric Family,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
The Eccentric Family,Awh no your lie about in April 
The Eccentric Family,This is actually a really decent list
The Eccentric Family,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

The Eccentric Family,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
The Eccentric Family,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
The Eccentric Family,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
The Eccentric Family,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
The Eccentric Family,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
The Eccentric Family,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
The Eccentric Family,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
The Eccentric Family,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
The Eccentric Family,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
The Eccentric Family,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
The Eccentric Family,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
The Eccentric Family,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
The Eccentric Family,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
The Eccentric Family,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
The Eccentric Family,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
The Eccentric Family,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
The Eccentric Family,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
The Eccentric Family,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
The Eccentric Family,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
The Eccentric Family,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
The Eccentric Family,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
The Eccentric Family,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
The Eccentric Family,Black Clover?
The Eccentric Family,.
The Eccentric Family,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
The Eccentric Family,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
The Eccentric Family,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
The Eccentric Family,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
The Eccentric Family,[deleted]
The Eccentric Family,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
The Eccentric Family,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
The Eccentric Family,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
The Eccentric Family,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
The Eccentric Family,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
The Eccentric Family,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
The Eccentric Family,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
The Eccentric Family,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
The Eccentric Family,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
The Eccentric Family,[deleted]
The Eccentric Family,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
The Eccentric Family,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
The Eccentric Family,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
The Eccentric Family,[deleted]
The Eccentric Family,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
The Eccentric Family,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
The Eccentric Family,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
The Eccentric Family,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
The Eccentric Family,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
The Eccentric Family,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
The Eccentric Family,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
The Eccentric Family,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
The Eccentric Family,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
The Eccentric Family,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
The Eccentric Family,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
The Eccentric Family,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
The Eccentric Family,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
The Eccentric Family,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
The Eccentric Family,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
The Eccentric Family,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
The Eccentric Family,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
The Eccentric Family,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
The Eccentric Family,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
The Eccentric Family,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
The Eccentric Family,This show was hilarious
The Eccentric Family,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
The Eccentric Family,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
The Eccentric Family,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
The Eccentric Family,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
The Eccentric Family,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
The Eccentric Family,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
The Eccentric Family,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
The Eccentric Family,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
The Eccentric Family,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Seraph of the End,Whenever I think of cannibalism I think of prions.
Seraph of the End,Chopped into little pieces for sure. Just not how he hoped.
Seraph of the End,"i loved the ""what's this?"" the guy goes ""venison""  


and then you immediately see them pulling in the dead deer that hasn't been cut up yet. i was watching with my girlfriend and she didn't immediately pick up on that ahahahahah"
Seraph of the End,"Her performance was so good and when David was on top of her, I kept wondering how that actor who played him continued on when she let out that scream. Holy hell, I know it's acting, but I don't know how he did it"
Seraph of the End,[removed]
Seraph of the End,easily the most CATHARTIC twenty minutes of tv I’ve seen in decades. Died when Joel called her baby girl.
Seraph of the End,"it's weird how 2 IPs from the same developer went into completely different paths, Uncharted went the easy cash out route but The last of Us actually put some effort into making it a thing on its own, Great Job, hope more game adaptations like this get made."
Seraph of the End,"I would be dead so fuckin fast in this universe. When Ellie had her gun on the preacher I was like “aw come on he’s a nice guy, he’ll help you!”

And I had somehow not made the connection that they were eating people. When Joel knifed that guy and beat the other one’s head in I was like “Wow Joel is being a real jerk”"
Seraph of the End,Bella Ramsey tv line performance of the week. Calling it.
Seraph of the End,"Pedro Pascal episode absolutely killed (quite literally too) in that interrogation scene, which is one of the most badass scenes in the game for Joel"
Seraph of the End,"My wife (who didn’t play the game) was saying, it’s a crazy situation because he’s [David] is just trying  to protect his people, and Ellie is just trying to protect Joel. I just nodded my head in silence.

6 minutes goes by and she see’s David’s been feeding and eating the people of the town he’s “protecting” and it dawned on my wife. She instantly cheered for Joel murdering the psychopaths who captured Ellie lol."
Seraph of the End,I’m still recovering from the episode. It was so intense.
Seraph of the End,"I knew that Bella could play this younger version of Ellie but after playing TLOU Pt. 2, I was somewhat skeptical about her playing the older version.

This episode completely put that concern to rest for me."
Seraph of the End,What a great show.   It shows the dark side of how a human would really act if something like this happened.  I have a buddy who won’t watch because of the episode of Franks life. Their loss!
Seraph of the End,She deserves an Emmy for this episode alone
Seraph of the End,"I like (Borderline love) this show but now that we are onto the finale, I feel like we've sped through this. Take away Frank's episode and Ellie's episode, the Sam & Henry one was almost mostly dedicated to them too, we haven't seen enough of Joel and Ellie imo. I have played the games over and over so I KNOW the dynamic but a lot people watching might not get it yet. In the game, Joel is resting up for like 2months in that house, in the show it's like a few days. Everything is on this breakneck pace. It could have benefited from being like 12 episodes long with more action in the mix."
Seraph of the End,My one complaint about this show is it’s gone by very quickly. I feel like this current arc with David could’ve been two episodes.
Seraph of the End,"Watching this episode I couldn’t help but to think of this video: [How To Write A Character Who GROWS On You (The Last of Us)](https://youtu.be/8rjnU7Gl8aI)

In the video he makes a point about how Ellie starts out as a bright-eyed girl in a world where there’s very little to be cheerful about. From the final scene with Sam onward we see that break, and this episode is the nail in the coffin imo. The biggest tragedy in this show is people losing purpose and their reason to live. All that joy and playfulness is now gone from Ellie and we truly feel it. I’m sure the next episode will really hammer this point in. Ellie’s only reason to continue on now is for Joel and the potential for her immunity to create a cure."
Seraph of the End,"Someone very close to me was victimized as a child. The manipulative and abusive father figure, the physical and sexual violence, even the cage. Bella went to a very dark place for this episode. Ellie may never completely recover from this, but I felt nothing but pride and victory for her at the ending. Good for you, Ellie. Good for you."
Seraph of the End,"The minute I saw them standing around being preached at I couldn’t. I mean, big sign, cold weather, can’t bury the dead- hello. 

I did want to see if he was going to turn from her bite. That got me curious."
Seraph of the End,Yet another fantastic episode. I love this show. Bella is spectacular and Pedro is…well. Daddy I guess?
Seraph of the End,My only annoyance about this is that if people have been gone for a long time shouldn’t the world be absolutely teeming with wildlife? Like freaking deer taking over? Why would it be hard to find?
Seraph of the End,Bella is so fucking good in this
Seraph of the End,"Guess I'll be watching this alone. Told my partner about the game and where this episode was most likely headed. 

""That was in a video game?""

He was shocked and immediately read the video game summary. So yea, I will be watching this alone tonight."
Seraph of the End,[removed]
Seraph of the End,"“It’s not code”

It was code. Lol"
Seraph of the End,The Book of Eli told me that cannibalism turns you into a twitchy mess. I fully expected some of the residents to show signs of this condition.
Seraph of the End,She played the disassociation so well. It was Matthew Modine 1000 yard stare from Full Metal Jacket levels of good.
Seraph of the End,"She crushed this episode! Being a fan of both games and the show, I’m happy that Bella has mastered her portrayal of Ellie."
Seraph of the End,"I haven’t seen it yet, but every time my bf puts it on I get mad again about how cruel people have been to this actress. She’s soooo talented and yeahh, sorry, she’s freaking adorable."
Seraph of the End,This episode brought out so many emotions.
Seraph of the End,"I loved that we finally got to see someone go full Arya Stark stabbing the Tickler in the Inn.
It’s the perfect way to show someone snapping and no longer being the same afterwards.
That shit was so weak in the show. As if the show writers didn’t understand the work.

Thankfully, there is Last of Us"
Seraph of the End,"Removing comments openly discussing episode 8 is ridiculous. Given the title, the spoiler scope is implied and no one should have to tag e8 plot points."
Seraph of the End,"This was a hard episode to watch. 

I imagine it was even harder to act out.

Edit: the cannibalism didn’t even register. I just went full walking dead regarding  that. What got me? The religious grown man on little girl grooming and violence…..

I applauded when she went full axe murderess. Not gonna lie.

Edit: not just for Ellie, but that little girl the character kept slapping around in front of the entire town.

Edit: and before anyone comes out of the woodwork to yet again tell me how awful of a woman I am? 

I am a reflection of how I’ve been treated my entire life."
Seraph of the End,Was confused for a second like wait why are they calling her by a character name in GOT? Then realized that's just her real name... she played a Mormont on GOT.
Seraph of the End,"Maybe I missed them explaining it but I have literally only a single gripe with this show, and it was the worst in this latest episode: Where did everyone go? I seem to remember Joel had to kill like 30 people to save Ellie in the game but here, despite them showing a large group in the beginning, all but two of them disappear. Maybe it's just plot armor, but I kept wondering during the fight when more people would burst in and fight Joel but it never came."
Seraph of the End,Unbelievably hardcore intense episode. Holy cannoli. I don't know why I love such disturbing episodes of TV shows so much but there it is
Seraph of the End,I was wondering why it took them so long to show people starving in this world.
Seraph of the End,"Not sure if it’s just me but the part where Ellie gives Joel the knife and Joel looks at her helplessly reminded me of the scene in The Godfather where Vito’s in the hospital and Michael had to take control and provide protection. Vito had that same helpless look that was almost apologetic for putting Michael in that position. 

I wonder if that was intentional."
Seraph of the End,Very good episode.
Seraph of the End,"Really not a fan of this post title being a spoiler.

That's all I'm gonna say here in fear of more spoilers."
Seraph of the End,"Bella absolutely killed it with this episodes performance, she’s doing amazing!"
Seraph of the End,She went cray cray on that disgusting man!!
Seraph of the End,Was it implied the deer was infected to? Since Ellie could hear clicking just before she saw the deer?
Seraph of the End,Not seen it but what else has that girl been in she’s very recognisable
Seraph of the End,"my only crticism is when shes chopping the meat there was no sense of weight, as if she wasnt even holding anything"
Seraph of the End,"Greata acting and production as always but I feel like it did not quite live up to the game. They overplayed their hand with the immediate hyper evilness of David and any subtly was thrown out the window. Also, where’d all the people go for the last encounter?"
Seraph of the End,"Award winning stuff from Bella, but it was also so much more. Wow. Blown away by this episode."
Seraph of the End,"The show is brilliant and the people who are a part of it’s making are superbly talented.

Unlike all the cringey edgelords who go into posts like this to show everyone just how cool and contrarian they are. Just keep moving along, you’re not wanted here. If I wanted the opinion of a bigoted asshole I’d go visit my red hat wearing parents."
Seraph of the End, I played the game but fuck that spoilers title.
Seraph of the End,"My favorite part about the episode were all the parallels between David and Joel. So much focus on father figures, leaders and the followers choosing who to follow, violence as a survival tool, etc. Almost everything could be applied just as well to Joel, with the only difference being context and circumstances. We’re forced to ask “why would Ellie choose to follow Joel, but not choose to follow David?” And are David’s followers any different from Ellie? Is he any different from Joel? (>!Other than the cannibalism and rape…!<)

Absolutely beautifully written and acted by everyone, this is why I watch shows like these. I absolutely can’t wait for the final episode next week, I can’t imagine they’ll do anything but stick the landing now."
Seraph of the End,The show has the least amount of zombies of any zombie related show.
Seraph of the End,Now i am worried how I would survive anywhere because I really thought he was a great guy.
Seraph of the End,"My standard line In a situation such as this, is ""don't knock cannibalism until you've tried it."""
Seraph of the End,she was really great in that ending sequence
Seraph of the End,"Some of us can't watch it Sunday night because we have to get up really early. I hate writers who put up slightly spoiler-ish headlines, and yes I've played the game and I can guess which antagonist was up next, but it's still shitty.

Just write ""Bella Ramsey on the ending"" leave out the adjective that gives away an expectation. Dipshit."
Seraph of the End,"I don't like that the show removed almost all of Joel's combat, and his ruthlessness, and even his boss fight, yet keeps Ellies."
Seraph of the End,"the show has been good. But I think its getting a lot of love from fans of the game.  In a whole season there's been 30 minutes of action and and the rest REALLY side stories. (I did like the Offerman episode, because I liked seeing him build up his town).

I hope S2 brings more mainline story, or I feel it will become the walking dead 2.0"
Seraph of the End,"I was worried they’d tone that part down from the game but nope. They showed exactly who David is. Also Troy did a fantastic job as always!

I really wonder how they’re going to handle Part 2 though are they going to stick with Bella Ramsey for older Ellie?"
Seraph of the End,"The show's streak has pretty much been flawless, so far."
Seraph of the End,I cried a little at the end. Such an amazing show.
Seraph of the End,This series started off strong but it has not grabbed my full attention for the last two episodes. Teetering on boring
Seraph of the End,Show is extremely boring and overrated.
Seraph of the End,"Fantastic episode, probably my fav so far. Can’t wait for the season finale!"
Seraph of the End,Right... so this is making me realize I actually HADNT WATCHED THE WHOLE SEASON 1. And i thought i was safe to read the comment section ):
Seraph of the End,Wait is the season over?
Seraph of the End,"I know this isn’t the walking dead, but how is this not the walking dead?"
Seraph of the End,"Oh my god!! I literally cried when Joel called her daughter. 😭😭

It was the most favorite moment of mine, the most heart touching one."
Seraph of the End,Americans are incapable of not spoiling shit when things air there first
Seraph of the End,"I never noticed until recently, because the Waco show is going on, but The Last of Us’s David was inspired by David Koresh. And the show does a better job of showing the similarities than the game did, getting the point of view of his group."
Seraph of the End,Can we not post spoilers in the titles?
Seraph of the End,[deleted]
Seraph of the End,"I guess Joel and Ellie are superheroes now? 

Joel was barely conscious and almost dying from sepsis and then - somehow - manages to get up and take out two armed men on his own. 

Ellie's 2 kills of hardened, grown men were more believable, but I kinda laughed when she overpowered the preacher dude with a cleaver. Yeah, ok, she's like Arya Stark now - a teenage world-class assassin? 

This show is kinda sliding into campy violence, which is confusing because I thought the tone was supposed to be realism."
Seraph of the End,"[""Don't look back..""](https://ibb.co/vz13y4w)"
Seraph of the End,"Jesus Christ can we stop with the fucking spoilers in the title

edit: holy shit was that traumatic, I feel so much for Ellie 😢😢"
Seraph of the End,"No damn spoiler alert, just plaster the headline. People still haven't watched it, it just came out last night and now already know some shit gonna happen on end of episode, wtf people."
Seraph of the End,[deleted]
Seraph of the End,This episode was g rated compared to others. Good episode though
Seraph of the End,"I haven't seen the episode yet, so fuck this title for the spoiler. Shit literally came out last night."
Seraph of the End,"Article references a medical facility in Salt Lake instead of the university of eastern Colorado.  :(  Joel and Ellie haven’t visited SLC (yet).

“It's soon revealed, alas, that they knew the marauders who attacked Ellie and Joel at the hospital in Salt Lake City, one being killed by Joel in self-defence. “"
Seraph of the End,Feels like a spoiler if a headline eh?
Seraph of the End,FFS why do we need spoilers in the title? This isn't even the Last of Us subreddit.
Seraph of the End,"I’m not gonna lie… The Last of Us is giving me Walking Dead vibes.

I remember when they came across the Governor and his crew—the cannibals—etc.

I’d really like to see it be more about the zombies. Otherwise this show will find itself guilty of Walking Dead’s problem…

…just a run-on soap opera with zombies in the background.

EDIT: Oooh to all you hater down voters out there. Turns out I was right. From the creators themselves:

‘The Last of Us’ Season 2 Will Have ‘A Lot More Infected,’ Creators Address Complaints About Lack of Action: 

https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-more-clickers-action-1235546747/

Mic drop!"
Seraph of the End,"I feel as if I'm the kid saying The Emperor Has No Clothes.  No video game could have effected so many people so thoroughly and bond them together so tightly, to convince seemingly millions of people that this show is anything other than simply alright.  Bella Ramsey is doing passable work here, mostly wooden, mostly overacted, weirdly disconnected, acting.  I'm tuning in each week since it's the only prestige Sunday night TV out now but that's about it.  I guess all the overflowing praise is just people wanting to be excited about something, but not really caring what that something is.  This show is just ok.  I read these articles and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills."
Seraph of the End,Anyone else bothered with continuity? She explodes out of a burning building having just tenderized a guy to death; crawled all over the floor and survived all kinds of mayhem in the sequence…and her sweatshirt is basically clean and her face is dry with a couple blood spatters. It’s such a well showered show for the end of the world. 😁
Seraph of the End,"I think when it comes down, we'd all be like our pet dog, or cat, after a week we'd start eating the face of our fallen loved ones. Hell, I'm sure once we stop mass producing meat, your kids will go missing, their brains will be served up to the wealthy as a delicacy. I understood the sentiment, but thought, the chopping up of the rapist preacher, cannibal by necessity, child rapist by choice, was a little indulgent. I would have faded to black, just when it started to get a little uncomfortable."
Seraph of the End,Bad show
Seraph of the End,"Poor Pedro has to carry this whole show, Bella Ramsey is not good at acting. Her delivery is very stiff."
Seraph of the End,Maybe don’t put spoilers in the title
Seraph of the End,"> on the traumatic ending

Thanks for the spoilers, I guess?"
Seraph of the End,After watching the walking dead for several seasons I was expecting something different... it's the walking dead but instead of walkers they call them clickers... for some reason the show bores me to no end.
Seraph of the End,"Wait, wasn't her character raped in the game? And in the show she wasn't, so I don't get the ""traumatic"" ending?"
Seraph of the End,"I am truly wondering how anyone doesn't know about the cannibals...years later after the game?

So all those posting...never played the game?

Never saw the cinema playthroughs on YT?

Wow."
Seraph of the End,"The episode confused me.  People are saying the bad guy was a rapist.  I thought he was a cannibal.  At the end before he is killed, he says this line about the biting being the best part.  Apparently, it's actually ""fighting.""  I re-listened to it 50 times.  I swear he said biting.  The guy was going to have sex with Ellie in a burning building?

So the guy is a rapist and a cannibal?  And the town just blindly follows him?  i know this is a negative take, but bad guy casting seems really weird in this show.  The average adult male would beat the crap out of the actor who played David with relative ease.  I had similar complaints with the woman in KC and was accused of being a sexist.  Meanwhile, the show seemed to identify this issue in the KC-infected scene, because we finally saw a boss-sized infected leader."
Seraph of the End,Did David say where they got the people to >!eat!<? I can't remember if he said.
Seraph of the End,I don’t understand how the town has access to guns but the four guys that Ellie and Joel ran into didn’t have them. Is there an explanation for this that I missed?
Seraph of the End,Does the show spoil the second game?
Seraph of the End,"Hey, spoiler.....

....but, tbf, that could describe most of the episodes."
Seraph of the End,If I’m eating people I’m eating stuffed anus with ball sauce.
Seraph of the End,Series has been great.  I really wanted more zombies though.  Like they better have the zombies in the tunnel before the lab scene
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"My concern is what happens to the library content as it ages.

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"In 2009, Amreeka debuted at Sundance to praise and ended up with an 87% Rotten Tomatos score. It's a rare look into the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and in the United States that's not a gut wrenching documentary or thriller. It's a comedy, and a good one.

Nat Geo bought the rights to it after Sundance, and just shelved it. Not available to watch on any platform. If you want to see it, and it's good, you have no choice but to find a DVD copy somewhere."

There was a show called ""Nurses"" that had TV writer Brent Forrester (The Simpsons, King of the Hill, The Office) on staff (although he never was assigned a script and doesn't have a credit). Nowhere to be found.

It reads as if it's about to go in-depth on the trend, like maybe how certain creatives don't want to work with certain companies anymore, or how something not being publicly released makes it harder for people breaking in / with few credits to point to their previous work when trying to get the next job (I have first-hand experience here).

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"As opposed to traditional linear TV or movie theater model where content disappeared forever by design due to being limited by time slots? Or the old movie rental model where your selection was limited to what could fit shelves at your local Blockbuster?

I don't understand their argument against streaming. Streaming is just a more convenient rental business but still has the same inherit problems that rentals always had. 

If anything can be considered terrible is that we can't purchase digital ""hard copies"" of much of this content any more like when everything came out on VHS/DVD/Blu-Ray and are left to piracy as the only option to acquire removed content."

Have been saying this for so long, it's nice and convenient but we can't actually own anything on streaming sites, not having dvd or bluray releases really hurts the people creating the movoes or tv shows, the fans as well, in the long run vecause their work gets erased and for the fans, we lose all of thise badass stories we've seen and loved."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I love physical media for the exact reasons about what's happening, but it's worse now more than ever to protect things you love in a tangible manner: With streamers so intent on getting you to subscribe it has become exclusive media and now that we've seen nothing lasts forever, something we might've loved could be gone in the blink of an eye from history. A prime example for me is one day not being able to watch Love Death + Robots. *“It’s always about the work, and if the work’s good, it’ll be on the air. That’s how it works.""* This quote from Jerry Bruckheimer in the article scares me the most, it's a faith in that ideology that is incredibly misguided at this point: There are plenty of things we love that would be considered obscure and are more than good, sometimes works of art, but these companies don't care about *good work* anymore - just eyeballs on any given project. Everything can inform or inspire a generation that it didn't before, but we'll never know what could've happened if it's gone."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Just do how we did back in the days! Screw these entertainment conglomerates
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Micheal cera with dad body?
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I'm not sure many people read the article. Almost all the comments are talking about removing things from an existing catalogue, which is ofc a big problem with streaming services, but the article's about cancelling things before release.

I don't think canceling projects midway is a new problem but it definitely seems like a bigger issue now and, unlike removing existing films/TV from a library, it's not something piracy can fix."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Crave HBO. Boardwalk Empire? C’mon? U raised $ 3x since 2020 (well 2x,actually after promotion ended, but still. Wtf?  Hopped on the Snyder cut train. )"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Physical media will always be king.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Man, the anime crowd has been on this tip for the last 30 years."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I’m not hugely concerned because streaming is still relatively new as a business model. We’re going through a contraction of the industry, but they’ll be available in some capacity as long as there’s demand for it."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,There are too many platforms and too many shows. We really need a big culling to make it more manageable.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Corporate profits above all else applies to everything from the shrinkage of food charging the same for less to the entertainment industry catalogues so they don't have to pay residuals. It's all absolute greed more is never enough.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I think this snuck up on people,  and going forward filmmakers and actors will have a clause in the contract that says if it does not air within a certain timeframe, or with a certain frequency, the rights will revert to the filmmaker. That doesn’t necessarily mean it will be seen somewhere but people with the clout are going to want clauses that will keep their work from being lost or hidden"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Star Wars Episode 8 was horrifying.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"According to some people on here, it’s not a big deal because it’s always happened"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"It’s weird. Shows like Stargate SG-1 is just not available for streaming (at least in my country). I thought after Amazon bought it, but now it’s been a year and still nothing. 

It should be legal to pirate if they don’t even want to make it accessible for purchase."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan," Arr Arr, Pirates we! Treasure on the web arr fer free!"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,That's why at this rate I actually prefer streaming sites just to do a limited miniseries.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Loosing media is nothing new, how many TV shows and movies from the 50s-80s are lost media due to things like master tapes being destroyed, lost, etc.  Not to mention books going out of print. It’s OK guys - it was never made to be forever. Enjoy these things while you can, but they don’t really matter in the long run. You can always find something new to discover- I promise."

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Everything is for sale. Tough luck. Capitalism is as inevitable as Thanos. What’s the solution?
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"This is how they’ll milk that old cow, my 10 y/o kids will be paying someone to stream their favorite childhood content 30 years from now.."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"This is why I won't invest my time in watching ongoing series on Netflix. Because they cancel them without warning and without resolution.

If Netflix guaranteed series finales... for shows with 3 or more seasons for example... I would be happy to watch."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,This is one of many reasons streaming is bad. Pirating and physical media is the only way to guarantee the ability to watch content.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"This is the result of Hollywood unions forcing residuals on the studios. 

Streamers would rather not deal with all that and just remove the content from the platform if the shows don't generate enough money."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,So Westworld is just gone. I watched Seasons 1-3 but never season 4 and now I can never watch it. Who made this call.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Rian: “Its really bad. BTW catch my new show on Peacock and my upcoming movie on Netflix!”
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Anything with Michael Cera that disappears forever is okay with me.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Someone tell Rian Johnson the streaming providers are just subverting expectations.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Rian Johnson would know since he made Star Wars disappear from Pop Culture.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,This is about $$$ - Rian and Jerry are just pissed their royalties cheques are getting smaller.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Are you a bank or a studio? Yeah, I get you want to make money, but if that’s all, just become a bank. If you want to be a studio, put out some films."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,I stopped buying physical media because I couldn’t stand the clutter anymore and donated it all. But my itunes library has about 1800 movies and some of my favorite Tv shows. I don’t watch tv shows much
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"If you are able to gatekeep some content than you will be able to do it for any content. 
This is gradually happening since acta couldn’t been passed. 
  Lucky us that “they” want and need what they try to refuse to every other clear-net user : privacy and security. So while they have it we will have it ( privacy and security) , albeit it’s an individual task to accomplish nowadays in regards with “them”"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I find it really hard to care about that. It's extremely easy to find content you want, download it, and keep it in a hard drive. It's almost impossible for modern content to be lost."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,The fact that Rian Johnson is still allowed to make movies is perplexing
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"The same happens with music. I had an artist’s album on Apple Music one time and the other day when I wanted to give it a “spin”, it was no longer there.

It took me a 1/2 hour to dig up the CD from storage too. 👎🏻"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"So they’re just like regular Hollywood. There are lots of examples of older properties that have more content that after airing once are never seen again or were never released for sale in the physical or digital. If it’s not guaranteed to make enough to buy a yacht in these modern times, being available or released is not always going to be a reality."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,I have been looking for HBO “Dream On” forever.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"The part I hate the most is that it's totally possible and fine to tell an entire story, beginning-middle-*end* in a single season, but nooooo. Gotta leave hanging threads or just have a straight cliffhanger in case it takes off and they want to extend it into multiple seasons. I wish more TV would just show a small, self-contained story and forgo all the serial stuff that has become so ubiquitous.  
  
Edit: Ahh. We're talking stuff removed from streaming services, not canceled shows. OOps.."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Can you imagine Scrubs just.....going away? I need to look to a bay with pirates soon.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Arrrrgh ye scallywags must raise the black flag
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,This is one of the reasons why physical media still needs to be around.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Thing is, we're paying for these shows and movies twice now.  Once with our cable/streaming bills, and now Hollywood is double dipping by getting tax breaks for their expensive failures.

Hollywood is full of multi millionaires that take credit for other people's work and blame others for their own failures. It's amazing how the boomers are so thrilled with such an ass backwards system of worth and value."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I don't know why people look at me like I'm from Mars when I talk about this. Fine, use ""the cloud"" for backup and you exchange information, but keep your movies. Keep your music. Keep your family photos. To be dependent exclusively on some corporation keeping things running, holding up their end of the deal, not wrong writing the fine print to solely benefit them and not protect you, is preposterous. Is YOUR data. Keep it."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"So the actors and anyone who receives residual payments from TV and Film are being snubbed because streaming services: 

A. Are beholden to shareholders and constant quarterly growth. 

B. Overspent on productions and need to reel in spending.

C. Are adding commercials but commercial profits are not offsetting anything cause shareholders need money. 

D. Are canceling shows after 2-3 seasons to keep cultivating super watched, (culturally talked about) shows to draw new viewers (accounts) to satiate shareholders. 


The best thing consumers can do is watch the shows they want then abruptly cancel until there shows season is back on."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"The general public is dumping services they don’t use… it’s very easy to do. This is the nightmare scenario that they’ve been dreading sing everyone dumped cable services that could lock you in for years … 

I see big changes and more acquisitions on The horizon … look out for apple to buy a major player… thinking Sony … maybe Universal.  And of course Warner Bros is perpetually for sale . It’s all funny math."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"There's lots of old HBO stuff that isn't on their streaming service. That was going to be one of the big draws for me, getting access to some of the stuff they made back in the 70s and 80s when it was still kind of an underground thing and they were getting weird with it.

Barring that, how about a full set of the One Night Stands they made back then? So many comedians who later made it big, those old standup sets are fun to see.

That stuff must just be sitting in their vaults, probably never to be seen again. I have to assume a lot of what they're making now, the same thing will happen."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I've come to that realization as well, there's already films and TV shows from the 90s/00s that can't be found anywhere online, stuff I assumed would be around forever in some form. Arrested Development is the latest casualty, Netflix is losing the rights, hopefully another service picks it up, but what about shows that can't find a new home online? They're just gone. Makes me wish I had hung onto more of my DVDs."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Before streaming thousands of shows got cancelled and they disapperead into the ether.  Series having proper endings and being able to watch is largely something fairly  new actually new to this century.  There's probably more shows now that survive a second life on streaming that would have just been plum forgotten by all but a handful of people had they existed 15-20 years earlier.  For example the Series  Big Wave Dave's was created  by  2 people who were showrunners for the Series Mash and also wrote a bunch of episodes of Cheers. It was cancelled after 6 episodes in the early 90's and dissapeared into the ether despite fairly noteworthy showrunners and 2 notable tv actor(adam arkin,kurtwood smith). Had it existed 2 decades later it would have been streamed somewhere and been allowed to existed beyond the initial few weeks it airred  on tv."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Yeah, it seems like they see more profit in selling their shows to other platforms after a while... hopefully this could also mean they might consider blu-ray releases... the only way to truly own something..."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Over the last few years I've gone back to buying Blu rays just because I've lost trust in everything being available to me. The problem is fewer and fewer shows end up on Blu ray
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,or what heppenes when one of the services goes bankrupt
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"That's kind of how it was sold to us tbh. ""The whole Paramount catalog on Paramount+!"" For example. They don't mention ""Until we stop paying for the licensing.""

What they should do is, when a series etc. Is due to go off the platform, add a ""Buy Blu-ray"" button. Then they just charge your card and ship it out to you. The caveat there is that it does take away some ability to lure people back to their platform if it returns, but I imagine not everyone would bother to buy the disc media anyway."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Imagine that you are in some place in the time, 10 or 15 years ago. That is the same problem with a lot of movies and shows but is not for streaming, is because there are no stock or phisical version.

So... what is the diference?"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Yes, that was very naive."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,you know where stuff doesn't disappear and it's actually well kept? Piracy sites.
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,*Cough* pirating *cough*
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"As long as platforms have to pay to keep something on their catalog, they have no reason to do so eternally if it's profitable. The shows that are removed aren't (not watched enough compared to their licensing costs). That's the logical assumption, the other was just some misplaced hope not understanding how business works."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Piracy
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Just like projects being pulled, this has always happened and the only difference is visibility. We're more aware of it happening because things that were accessible to us are removed when in the past they just quietly disappeared from shelves and future projects get more publicity because it's a way to get people to subscribe for the upcoming stuff.

Calling it the ""hottest trend"", ""horrifying"" and a ""terrible practice"" as if it hasn't been part of the business forever is just ridiculous"
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"That’s remains my expectation. FOMO/vault strategies will get me to cancel. I was planning to resub to HBO for Last of Us, and the last 2 seasons of Westworld were part of my plan. Can’t watch that, and the service doesn’t have enough value for one active episode I care about a week. Didn’t resubscribe, and probably won’t until at least two seasons of TLOU are up. Needs to be worth the $15-30, and that’s not even close."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I went looking for some older war movies (battle of Britain, bridge too far, etc.) and I came to the conclusion I’m gonna have to get a DVD player and buy the DVDs if I want to watch them without ads or rent them every time."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"I've never believed in the notion that you don't need to buy anything in physical form or download it to your own storage since there are so many streaming platforms and ""you could access anything at any time"". And now it's becoming more ans more evident that it's not true at all and you don't actually own the content even if you pay a mounthly fee."
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,I remember my first day on the internet...
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Is there something like a Svalbard Seed Vault for films and series? I wonder...
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,Ugh this is such a good movie
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,"Any chance rights were bought with the full intention to ""make it disappear?""  or is that conspiracy theory BS?"

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,I’m sure I can find it in about 5 minutes sailing the high seas
The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan,I'm still trying to track down The John Larroquette Show. It runs Sundays on RewindTV but I can't seem to find complete seasons streaming anywhere or on DVD.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,“ I was convinced I was a butt baby”
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I was bullied too. Kids would tease me for being a bully.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,🧜‍♂️
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Peacemaker…


What a joke."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This show went from not even on my radar to one of my current favorites.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"John Cena is a such a wierd looking dude and I think I figured out why he looks so odd to me. He reminds me of a He-Man action figure come to life. His body proportions all look slightly exaggerated.

Hes fing awesome BTW. Peacemaker is must see"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,All a buncha Butt Babies.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"It's really the Vigilante Show, amirite? High five!"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I heard Superman is really into shit
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"It reminds me of ""Archer"".  The dialog is the closest I've seen and a bunch of the same character types:  the hot super badass girl is his ""handler"" that he wants to sleep with, the nerd he picks on, etc."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"> “I certainly don’t want to speak for James, but I think he has an uncanny ability to adapt when he sees something, even if it was unexpected. He’s okay leaning into it. His ability to pivot and adapt to what he gets also attributes to his uncanny casting and ability to pull performances out of individuals. Rather than just cling to the material, if he does see something, that he is unexpected to him, he’s okay leaning into them,” says Cena.
   
> Even then, Cena never imagined he’d have the opportunity to continue on with the character.
   
> “I guess my mind doesn’t work like that. I just want to try to do the best I possibly can and not let the people that I’m working with down because making a film is such an arduous task. And it asks a lot of everyone, whether you’re the person cooking food, parking the cars, holding the microphone or in front of the camera, and I never want to look past that opportunity. It’s okay to have a plan, but if you look past it and don’t invest in it you do a disservice to everybody in the movie. I wasn’t thinking about anything except showing up putting that ridiculous costume on every day and loving every minute of it,” says Cena.
   
He is brilliant."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Peacemaker is so good. Glad I gave the show a chance, even though I didn't necessarily like the character that much in suicide squad."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,The fucking cunts from riverdale
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I’m enjoying peacemaker a lot but the main comment I see in this article and throughout ready is that it’s a “comedy” and doesn’t take itself seriously, and I disagree with that. I was actually hesitant to watch because people talking about it made it sound like some
Big goofy joke or borderline parody. There’s funny moments and I would say the dialogue is comedic, but I find the overall plot line to be serious and the characters generally take things seriously. so if you’re liked me and hesitant to watch because you’re nervous it might just be one big joke, I say give it a shot."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"While Cena is really great as a comedic actor, Danielle Brooks is easily the most surprising part of this show to me. She really elevates almost every scene she’s in. She just riffs off of the other characters so well."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This might turn out to be my favorite show of the year. This show surprisingly gave Cena is a chance to show he’s a legitimately good actor. The music is incredible. Gunn is a master at making you care about characters you’re not supposed to like. Shout out to Vigilante.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Matt Murdock would turn a blind eye to such a silly declaration of war.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"My favorite part of peace maker so far has been that during a lot of the fights, the characters just scream “fuck you!” At each other. It’s what would probably really happen, instead of a monologue."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This show is golden. Peacemaker is slowly becoming one of my favorite superheroes. The characters in the show knew you entertained. I can’t wait to see how this season ends up going.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Can I watch it without having watched the latest suicide squad?!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,So i havent seen this discussed yet. Did anybody have Vigilante becoming one of your favorite superhero television characters on your 2022 Bingo list?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Also low key John Cena is killing it, things I didn’t think I would say ever lol"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Hasn't this superhero criticism and deconstruction been done in watchmen, mystery men, blank man, kickass, Jupiter's legacy, the boys, and probably 10x as many comics?

Edit: hit a nerve with some of you. I guess what I really mean is we’ve had plenty of examples of “a new take” on super heroes."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"It's easily enjoyable and a fresh take on a genre thats been overfilled with movies and tv-series lately

Edit:gonorea"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This show is like a 1000% better than it has any right to be. And that opening theme is fire.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I’m a marvel guy but, this show is sooo good! Cena is killing it!"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Eagly is the breakout star of the year!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Great show. I like jacked Ernest.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"That sounds great! I've never heard of this one, but I might give it a shot.

Never really liked the super self important superhero formula.. when I used to read comics regularly, I'd always pick up things like Booster Gold over things like Batman."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"He's no ""hero."" He killed Rick Flag, dammit."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"""What the hell is Bat-mite?  That's real?!?!?!?"" - Peacemaker"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"It really is so good. Better than the movie it's spun off from good.

Gunn just rocks the writing and Cena kills it."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I was skeptical and tried to avoid it. It looked awful…. But it’s not! I absolutely love it.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Is it similar to The Boys?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,All the posts praising Peacemaker make me realise how few people watched Doom Patrol and it makes me sad.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Good show, some jokes do stay a little longer than it should imo like the jerking off in the window one was like going on for 3minutes straight."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I feel like the only self serious super heroes came straight from DC movies until they pivoted and started adding more humor
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Wookies have teeth in their a**holes, that's canon! 🤣🤣🤣"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,The dancing intro had me from the start.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This show is phenomenal and Cena is killing it!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Peacemaker is one of my favourite shows right now, but there's one bit that they keep doing that really doesn't stick for me, and I'm curious if I'm alone in this. It's the comedy thing they do where one character will say something over-the-top ridiculous, everyone else will react accordingly, then the character will double-down and drag out the scene and make the dialogue nonsensical. I'm thinking, i.e., the Louie CK bit, the Mothra bit, etc. I see what they're trying to do, but that flavor of absurdism just really does not land for me."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I’ll watch anything John Cena after watching Cockblockers with my wife. My dude butt-chugged a beer with his whole asshole!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Disney firing Gunn over old comments was the dumbest move they could do. No studio should have that much power and I am glad it gave Gunn the chance to do some much needed good over at WB.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,For some reason the show did not click for me until episode 3. Each one after that has been really enjoyable. I think Vigilante being more in it has helped me like it a lot more. John Cena is honestly giving a nice performance in the show. Gunn really knows how to write characters for guys like Cena.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This show is fucking  awesome…..it ain’t just Cena that makes it good.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Dont know why everybody on this post were “surprised” or didnt even “care” about this show, Suicide Squad was a great movie & Peacemaker was a great character in that movie. It just seems that everybody was too busy hating on Cena for the Taiwan incident & were also hating on the show before it’s release."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,What an incredible take. If only the superhero movies marvel made were a little more silly and goofy. They’re missing the key ingredient of zany characters!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Cuz we've *never* had a superhero parody film before.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Do you want to taste it ?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,how is that super hero suit floating on its own
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,The tick.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,This is a product of someone that genuinely loves what they do and had the ability to do it the way they envisioned it.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Wasn’t a fan of it personally, but happy to see many of you liked it."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Pretty much every other Gunn made superhero project then. He can only make 1 thing in different skins these days.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"The boys and deadpool did the same type of thing already. I still love this show, but it’s not as innovative as the article makes it seems."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,But John Cena is still a simp.. to the republic of china.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Yeah, but is it as good as The Boys?"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Mystery Men did it first. Also the Tick in multiple iterations.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,John China?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Happy to see Cena getting a role like this. I love how he interviews wearing the outfit.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I did not expect to like this show at all. But for some reason, I love it. It is, I think, a lot to do with how unserious it takes itself. Not a huge superhero fan."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I may check it out myself.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Gunn seems to prefer working more obscure characters. Guess he gets a little more creative freedom that way.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Superhero meets it's always sunny in Philadelphia. I'm loving it.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,11th  Street.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I can’t take superhero’s who take themselves seriously, seriously. Glad someone recognizes how ridiculous the entire genre is and is directing work accordingly."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,How has there never been a KKK supervillain before?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,">Writer-director James Gunn’s take on the bucket-headed hero is a gloriously goofy sendup and a sincere character study rolled into one.

…so it’s a James Gunn project, then."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Best ongoing series out now
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,ARIANA GRANDE!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"The entire history of the character is cool too. He wasn't even a DC character, but rather a character that got acquired when DC bought Charlton Comics.

I love the design too, and the fact that it is 100% sincere to the original look."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I wasnt gonna watch this since I despised PM in tSS but its so irreverant that you kinda get pulled in, not all humor is in my wheelhouse but the soundtrack is killer."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I watched the first episode earlier and I'm already hooked
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I was playing a game at like 2am and was like what can I watch? Saw this came out recently and I enjoyed Cena in TSS and it was a movie I thought was pretty decent., thought might as well put an epsiode on before bed.   


Finished all the episodes that same morning. This is one of my favourite shows that I've seen in the past couple years, it's really fun. If you're on the fence about watching it then please give it a chance, for me it's really really worth it."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I mean i feel like it took what The Boys started and is running with it.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I love this show
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"The movie itself is so good too.  I went in mostly blind expecting the same Emo Joker garbage as the first one.  Instead it was great characters, directing, action.  It's one of the few new movies I've watched more than once.

Between this and Snyders JLA, DC is catching up a bit."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Why is there no one in the picture
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Im having a great time. Peacemaker is hilarious and stupid nostalgic fun.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,🧜‍♂️
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,this really is the correct tonal shift for the franchise. They need to embrace whacky dark comedy similar to preacher or the boys
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,So doom patrol doesnt exist? Rofl mmk
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,It's supesingly good unlike the book of boredom fet
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Is this the evil idiot from suicide squad?
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I think after how good Cena is in this show he’s going to be getting offers left and right to headline a bunch of projects.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Good comedy has always been home to some of the most honest and genuine critiques of society, media, and more (not meant as an all-inclusive statement). I don't know why people always get shocked by this."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,The show is so damn good.
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Peacemaker started with the feeling of too much, “Hey, this is funny. Right? You think this is funny? Huh? (Nudge nudge)”  but had won me over by the second episode. The intro of course cracked me up but I guess I’m in the minority because I’ve only watched it twice. Great show though. I wish I could say the same about Doom Patrol. I finished season 3 but man, has it become tedious."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Best new show!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I thought I would hate it, but if I said it wasn't one of my favorite shows right now I would be lying.

&#x200B;

""I'm supposed to tell you to run from a bomb?""

&#x200B;

Nearly every episode I'm on the hunt for the music. Gunn killing it with the soundtrack yet again. Sister Sin - Fight Song is getting blasted around here a lot lately."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"There's a lot of pointless and cheesy bantering and references, but I do enjoy the emotional honesty of these characters, which is actually really rare in real life, at least in the West.  Peacemaker opening up to Adebayo really shows that deep inside, he's not a racist like his dad at all, and it's not just lip service."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,It’s honestly one of the best superhero character studies that has been done
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Just because you’re handsome…
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Love this show!
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,These artsy fartsy writers. The show is good. Don't need to fancy it up
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,I thought the man and chimp were friends
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,Its a great counterpoint to marvel now.  Congrats to DC and JG this is what we needed
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"Some people are born to be certain roles. RDJ as Tony Stark, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool etc. 

John Cena IS Peacemaker"
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,"I seriously was not prepared for how awesome this show is. I hate Marvel/DC movies, but this show isn’t like the rest."
Maoyu: Archenemy and Hero,It's comedy. There's very much a place for serious shows.
Lucky Star,That elevator was the true mvp.
Lucky Star,That belter racer dude made me laugh. I love this show.
Lucky Star,I am thankful 113 times a second. 
Lucky Star,"If it get's the same attention and budget as ""The man in the High Castle"" we are in for a real treat. That ending, 1300 possible options... It has an opportunity to go anywhere. I'm super excited for season 4. "
Lucky Star,"I, for one, am glad it was cancelled from syfy... if it hadn’t, it wouldn’t have gotten the press it did, I still wouldn’t have heard about it probably, and definitely wouldn’t have watched it. But here I am, about to finish season 2 and absolutely LOVE this show! "
Lucky Star,Amos is my spirit animal. 
Lucky Star,This is my opinion the most underrated si fi series these past years . There is nothing better out here . I Loved watching it
Lucky Star,"So I'm. Guessing the earlier seasons will be pulled off Netflix uk?

Real shame as I prefer their UI to amazon's  "
Lucky Star,[deleted]
Lucky Star,"As a Dark Matter fan I'm happy for you, yet sad for me."
Lucky Star,"I have to agree. The ending was immensely strong. 

I am rather excited to see where they go next. I just hope that we get more Shohreh Aghdashloo, Cara Gee, and Wes Chatham."
Lucky Star,It was freakin awesome. I marathoned season 1-3 and just finished yesterday. It is going to be a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG year waiting for season 4!!!!! Big up to all the Expanse fans who must be so happy for all the success
Lucky Star,This show was amazing. I love the way that their idea of futuristic politics is set up. I'm honestly so excited for the next season that I might start reading the books. 
Lucky Star,One of the best scifi series I have ever watched.
Lucky Star,"The Expanse has some of the most competent, powerful portrayals of female characters I've ever seen on TV.  From Avasarala to Camina, Bobby and Naomi, I like the women in this universe more than most of the men.

Having read the books, it seemed pretty clear that Camina was filling the TV role of the character Bull from the books.  I thought for sure Camina [spoiler](#s ""was a goner in that elevator shaft.  I legit cried when the elevator came out of nowhere.  I can't get enough of her."")"
Lucky Star,"Wait Season 3 is released and finished?!

How did I miss that?

At least I have something to watch now that Westworld S2 finished lol. "
Lucky Star,"This is the best space sci fi show since probably Stargate, or Battlestar. "
Lucky Star,Woohoo! Amazon saved it! Time to buy Priiiiimmmmeeeee!
Lucky Star,"I'm curious, did Syfy cancel it so they could bankroll that new George RR Martin excuse to not write books?"
Lucky Star,"I'm so happy a billionaire with a video distribution giant picked it up.

The series has been great and the last season amazing.  The way they ended this season is a perfect balance: had they stopped now it would have been sad but things so far have been wrapped properly while simultaneously opening up to so many amazing possibilities and setup a captivating threat.

The game ""Subnautica"" seems to have taken inspiration from the books for it's lore as I found the reveal to have some common points."
Lucky Star,Is season 3 coming to a streaming service and when?
Lucky Star,"For those who haven't read the books , you haven't seen anything yet :)"
Lucky Star,"Me and my wife started watching the show as we are huge sci-fi fans, needed a new show to watch and heard nothing but good things. However we are about 5 episodes into season 1 and find it a bit slow/confusing. Does it pick up later, we want to like this show but feel like we are struggling to continue on. "
Lucky Star,Is this on Netflix? Everyone talks about this series i guess it's time to finally get into it.
Lucky Star,Will Amazon have all the seasons? 
Lucky Star,Really excited to hear they're interweaving the regular book 4 stuff with the background for books 5 and beyond for context.
Lucky Star,"totally fell in love with this series, if i wasnt over my head in school id read the books, another day maybe.. oh shit i have audible.... plz be on audible!!!!!!!"
Lucky Star,"Guys, for FUCKS sake, watch The Expanse. Making people watch this wonderful gem over turgid Marvel Netflix or whatever is incredibly exasperating and infuriating."
Lucky Star,"Real Talk, Is Expanse better than Firefly? I only saw the expanse and love it."
Lucky Star,I'm nearing the end of the first season and finding it a bit boring. Should I keep going in the sense that it gets better?
Lucky Star,"I started reading the books after watching most of season 3. I loved being able to visualize the characters and settings so well after having seen the show. I'm almost done with book 3 and can't wait to read ahead in the story. One of my favourite sci-fi universes by far. So many great characters. The story grabbed me right from the beginning and hasn't let go. I am so happy that the show will live on, I've been recommending it to everyone I know."
Lucky Star,"Thank you, now save Hannibal as well. Thank you in advance.
"
Lucky Star,Finally some good news!
Lucky Star,Is season 3 free on Amazon yet? And if it's not when will it be?
Lucky Star,As fun as the best Babylon 5
Lucky Star,"I love that show!, so many twists and turns! - have you seen ""The 100"" also? great show too"
Lucky Star,Oh yeah just started watching this. Pretty dope so far!
Lucky Star,Okay okay. I think I’ll watch this show. I saw an episode last night with a ring thing some maniac wanted to destroy. It looks like it is pretty good. So are the old episodes on  it on Amazon or Netflix?  Whichever. I’ll find it. 
Lucky Star,"Uhhh...yeah.

It was so great this season!"
Lucky Star,Season 4 will be a completely new show based on what happened at the end of seson 3.
Lucky Star,[deleted]
Lucky Star,"WHATWHATWHATWHAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?! THEY SAVED IT?!?!?!?!

YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  WOO HOOOOOOO!!! 

I was sure it was gonna go the way of Dark Matter, but I'm glad Amazon sees the potential of this show. Also, the production budget will probably be increased, won't it? I mean, SyFy to Amazon is a pretty big leap. I'm about halfway through the third season now.

I only wish someone would pick up Dark Matter."
Lucky Star,And here I am still needing to watch S01x02
Lucky Star,"I really want to watch this show, how do I go about it?"
Lucky Star,Yay I love Amazon now!
Lucky Star,"Not done yet because I'm celebrating Canada day early, but I'm certain Jeff helped our special show survive because he understands humanity needs to dream about the stars more.

We should all be dreaming about the expanse more."
Lucky Star,~~Amazon~~ Reddit
Lucky Star,"im in the middle of the 3rd season, its like, really good. Like you could even say, its OUT OF THIS WORLD! "
Lucky Star,So is this on Amazon Prime yet ? 
Lucky Star,I just got into the his show and I LOVE IT!! So glad Amazon picked it up!
Lucky Star,Serious question: can someone give me a spoiler free summary of why the show was almost canceled and how season three saved it? I'm afraid to read the article because I'm still only half way through season 2.
Lucky Star,"So what do we fans call our fandom?  What’s the cool-kid buzzword?

Expanses?  Exspansers?  Expanders?  Ex-pants-ers?"
Lucky Star,Haven't seen anything on this but the posts here. I should check it out 
Lucky Star,"I have never seen this show until recently, everyone was hyping up how good it is and that it needs to be saved. I am a huge scifi lover, from old to new, cheesy to well done, I like most all scifi. This show however I do not, I watched some of it and the acting(atlrast in the episodes I saw) was near horrific, the pacing was really slow, many characters were bland or unappealing. Am I missing something? I honestly wanted a new scifi show to look forward to."
Lucky Star,"I started this series late and it is an amazing show. By the time I got done with season 2 season 3 was still underway but I lost the chance to watch the first episodes leaving me behind a season. 

Does anyone know if season 3 will be available for prime members on Amazon?"
Lucky Star,"Is this show really this good? Reddit seems to love it. I love Westworld, Game of thrones, the leftovers. Is the storytelling and acting on par with these shows? Genuinely asking. Thanks."
Lucky Star,So I just recently started this show. I'm about 4 or maybe 5 episodes  in and so far I feel it's just OK. Was this a series that started a bit rough? Or at this point is it just not for me? 
Lucky Star,"Now if only they could save SGU, Firefly, Defiance, and a number of other good Scienc Fiction shows that networks have canned in favor of more mainstream crap."
Lucky Star,"Yeah whatever, call me when they start up Hannibal again. I'm feeling salty at all these other shows getting picked up. "
Lucky Star,"Why is this show constantly on the front page of Reddit whilst also not having the same following as the big shows such as GoT? I feel like this is some kind of advertising, people will watch what they want to watch, stop telling us about the Expanse."
Lucky Star,"I only watched the first 2 seasons since they were free with prime. I thought to the show was pretty mediocre. Maybe a 6 or 6.5 out of 10. I'd say this is a poor mans BSG. Definitely, not trash but the writing and characters were not really strong. I'm not sure how it has such a rabid fan base."
Lucky Star,"I think a lot of the love for this show comes from a ""need"" to fill the void of a great sci-fi show that's been missing since BSG ended.  Season 3 has definitely been a step up compared to the earlier seasons, but even a couple episodes after the time jump it's right back to the same issues as before, namely pacing.  An unintended consequence of expanding your cast and sub-plots so rapidly is that you have to divide up your episode runtime between that many more characters.  This leads to characters getting only a few minutes of screen time and since this show is definitely in no hurry to move along the plot, it can feel like nothing meaningful to the overall plot happens from episode to episode.  To me it felt like Holden was floating through space for 3 episodes.  I think season 4 could definitely benefit from an increased runtime per episode and a serious cut on the bloat and filler."
Lucky Star,We saved show.  I think these types of posts can be put to rest now.  Its exsessive at this point.
Lucky Star,"Nice, Beach House always delivers. My favourite song from Thank Your Lucky Stars has to be Majorette. 

Good job guys! "
Lucky Star,Any way to watch season 3 without paying for it? I have prime but only seasons 1 and 2 are free 
Lucky Star,*cries in corner with fear the walking dead*
Lucky Star,Heh. *Stellar.*
Lucky Star,"Anyone know if Season 3 (and Season 4 moving forward) will be on Amazon Prime in Canada, or will it still be stuck on Crave TV?"
Lucky Star,Sucks it’s not on Netflix. I wonder how I’m going to see this? I don’t think Sweden has Amazon Prime!?
Lucky Star,"Honestly, I passed on watching the third season knowing it was moving to a service I don't have. My home ISP is a mobile provider, and I don't have the data to stream much anyways. "
Lucky Star,What I NEED to know is when will season 3 become available for Amazon Prime members? I keep waiting for the icon to change.
Lucky Star,No way I'm watching *Night Flyers* on SyFy or any other of their shows again. The cancel *Stargate Universe*just when it was getting good and while it was their top rated show. Sci-fi requires commitment. They basically have shown they aren't willing to commit to good sci fi shows. No way I'm investing in their series' again. 
Lucky Star,Does that mean all the seasons will be on Netflix?
Lucky Star,"Is is wrong of me to want all the belters to just fuck off and die somewhere ;-D  


Book 3 and book 6 were both pills for me, but the series is doing a better job of telling these particular stories so far."
Lucky Star,So. Does it get better after the first three episodes of season one? Or is it likely that if I didn't care for those I won't care for the rest of the series?
Lucky Star,Might it have been...Interstellar?
Lucky Star,Where can you watch the 3rd season!?
Lucky Star,I've never watched this yet but I live good scifi and living in the age of binge watching. 
Lucky Star,Does anyone know if there's going to be a season 3 marathon? My DVR was accidentally set to only keep the 5 most recent episodes and on demand also doesn't have the complete season.
Lucky Star,Some would say... Interstellar.. 
Lucky Star,"Now save “People of Earth,” Amazon! Pleeeaaassseeee!!!??"
Lucky Star,I see what you did there...
Lucky Star,When can I watch it in the UK tho :(
Lucky Star,"The Expanse killed Dark Matter!

I still watch it because it is also a great show."
Lucky Star,Anybody know when the third season will be free to watch with amazon prime?
Lucky Star,when can we watch season 3 on Amazon for free?
Lucky Star,I wish Amazon saved Firefly.
Lucky Star,Omg I would have been so g damn mad had it ended there. Southland im looking at you.
Lucky Star,"*Stellar*, haha, I get it"
Lucky Star,"i haven’t watched this yet. compared to lost in space, how is it?"
Lucky Star,"I started watching season 1 because of all the season 3 hype. I’m almost done with season 2 now. It’s definitely getting better, but I hope season 3 is a lot better than 2..."
Lucky Star,"Right I need help.

I liked the first season. Wanted to watch the second season but when I loaded it up I was confused as fuck. It felt like I'd missed episodes. 

Did I miss something or was the gap between s1 and s2 really disjointed?"
Lucky Star,"Oh, I do."
Lucky Star,"Glad it'll be around. Haven't seen it yet, and I've heard good things.
  
The fact it was saved by a slaver billionaire takes a bit of the shine off the apple though. "
Lucky Star,"You got that right!
Absolutely awesome!!!"
Lucky Star,"""Cancelling"" it before the move to amazon was a deft PR move, I clap."
Lucky Star,It's cool that no character has to die. The technology is so advanced that they can pretty much cure anything. So one has to pretty much get 'spaced' to die. Lethal dose of radiation and broken spinal cord is a slight bump on the road. 
Lucky Star,The expanse was on the chopping block? I had No idea!
Lucky Star,I both hate and love the Belters accent.  Like I find myself thinking that way but also strain the understand it at times.
Lucky Star,Now for it to appear on Netflix Australia!
Girls Last Tour,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Girls Last Tour,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Girls Last Tour,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Girls Last Tour,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Girls Last Tour,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Girls Last Tour,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Girls Last Tour,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Girls Last Tour,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Girls Last Tour,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Girls Last Tour,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Girls Last Tour,Needs more Jojo
Girls Last Tour,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Girls Last Tour,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Girls Last Tour,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Girls Last Tour,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Girls Last Tour,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Girls Last Tour,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Girls Last Tour,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Girls Last Tour,Madoka magica ! 
Girls Last Tour,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Girls Last Tour,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Girls Last Tour,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Girls Last Tour,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Girls Last Tour,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Girls Last Tour,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show

Girls Last Tour,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Girls Last Tour,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Girls Last Tour,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Girls Last Tour,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Girls Last Tour,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Girls Last Tour,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Girls Last Tour,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Girls Last Tour,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "

Girls Last Tour,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Girls Last Tour,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Girls Last Tour,Black Clover?
Girls Last Tour,.
Girls Last Tour,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Girls Last Tour,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Girls Last Tour,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Girls Last Tour,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Girls Last Tour,[deleted]
Girls Last Tour,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Girls Last Tour,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Girls Last Tour,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Girls Last Tour,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Girls Last Tour,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Girls Last Tour,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Girls Last Tour,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Girls Last Tour,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Girls Last Tour,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Girls Last Tour,[deleted]
Girls Last Tour,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Girls Last Tour,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Girls Last Tour,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Girls Last Tour,[deleted]
Girls Last Tour,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Girls Last Tour,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Girls Last Tour,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Girls Last Tour,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Girls Last Tour,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Girls Last Tour,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Girls Last Tour,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Girls Last Tour,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Girls Last Tour,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Girls Last Tour,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Girls Last Tour,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Girls Last Tour,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Girls Last Tour,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Girls Last Tour,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Girls Last Tour,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Girls Last Tour,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Girls Last Tour,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Girls Last Tour,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Girls Last Tour,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Girls Last Tour,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Girls Last Tour,This show was hilarious
Girls Last Tour,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Girls Last Tour,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Girls Last Tour,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Girls Last Tour,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Girls Last Tour,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Girls Last Tour,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Girls Last Tour,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Girls Last Tour,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Girls Last Tour,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Children of the Whales,"While at first I question how is this a first, but I also don’t know the demographics of who is applying and how often they hire new puppeteers. What kind of pool do they have when hiring?"
Children of the Whales,"She is not just a puppeteer, but a ventriloquist as well. [Here she is doing nothing, taking all the credits, while her puppets do a all the hard work singing Whitney Houston.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mujgpFJoboc)"
Children of the Whales,Finally she turned her life around and got a real job.
Children of the Whales,I've actually worked with Megan on a show before! She is incredibly sweet and talented. I'm so happy for her!
Children of the Whales,Seems that she had a career in ventriloquism before this. Perhaps it being such a niche field it was hard to find work and that would explain the real estate part
Children of the Whales,Incredibly talented. Great singer too. Hope she gets some screen time as well.
Children of the Whales,"I grew up watching Sesame Street in the 70’s. They had a diverse cast of characters on that show from the start, and none of them were represented using stereotypes. If there were no black puppeteers until now, I think it’s safe to bet that they just didn’t have any talented black applicants for that particular job. Their record of diversity cannot be questioned as far as I’m concerned."
Children of the Whales,[deleted]
Children of the Whales,"""Piphus"" means ""Loony House"" in Danish.

Nothing real to add, but there it is."
Children of the Whales,[removed]
Children of the Whales,"I'd like to point out that they're blowing this up, but the man who was the voice of Elmo for years...trained by Jim Henson himself... was a black man. You know, the one they falsely accused of child abuse?"
Children of the Whales,"Are people really keeping tabs on who is the first <race, sex> for every single profession, no matter how big or how insignificant? Jesus christ."
Children of the Whales,"Black-female ahh. I was like 'Hellooo' (In Elmo's voice). I just wanted to know who her character is, Gabrielle, and [discovered](https://www.meganpiphus.com/about) she's been cool for a hot minute!"
Children of the Whales,Why are there so many songs about rainbows?
Children of the Whales,Wasn’t the original Elmo puppeteer black?
Children of the Whales,Crazy that this is a first.
Children of the Whales,Representation matters. You can’t imagine how I felt as a young Italian boy in 1990 when I walked into Toys-R-Us and grabbed a copy of Mario 3 off the display. “Papa! The man on the cover! He looks a-jussa lika me!”
Children of the Whales,"Finally!

If there's something I always cared about, it's the race and gender of the person manipulating a puppet. 

Remember.. *our race and gender define us as people!*"
Children of the Whales,"great news for Megan Peace, but it's hard to even pretend this matters"
Children of the Whales,"""OH THANK GOD FINALLY"" - Noone ever"
Children of the Whales,But is she trans?
Children of the Whales,"Cool, she has darker skin that the other puppeteers. How is that news? Do you think incessantly making race a qualifier helps?

Side note: is it racist that her puppet looks very POC? Why isn’t her puppet yellow or blue like the white people puppets?"
Children of the Whales,Who cares.
Children of the Whales,"This is amazing, wondrous progress. It's proof that no matter you barriers, you can change, you can overcome great challenges.

This is the sort of story we need more of in the world: a real estate agent going on to do something meaningful with their life."
Children of the Whales,Haha awesome! Sesame Street is Love
Children of the Whales,Wasn't Elmo's old puppeteer black?
Children of the Whales,Real estate so bad rn she turned to puppeteering.
Children of the Whales,How you go from real estate to puppeteer lol
Children of the Whales,Serious question. Is it normal for this sub to be so obsessed with race?
Children of the Whales,How does her being a real estate developer play into the story? She was rich AF and for a laugh decided to change careers? I don’t get the relevance.
Children of the Whales,[removed]
Children of the Whales,I really don't care about the color of her skin.
Children of the Whales,Are we pointing out every non white person who gets a job now?
Children of the Whales,[removed]
Children of the Whales,"Oh thank God! But no one is asking the real question, WHERE ARE THE BLACK FEMALE SINGLE MOTHER WITH AIDS ATHEIST PUPPETEERS?!?!

Seriously, why does this bode reporting? There are no black girls out there worried about ""the man"" preventing them from working with puppets."
Children of the Whales,"and of course they give her the black puppet,  because enough with race barriers"
Children of the Whales,[deleted]
Children of the Whales,Shouldn’t have to be a post about it tbh /: it shouldn’t have to be a achievement she got this job just another women living her life that just happens to be of color..
Children of the Whales,One less real estate developer? Nice!
Children of the Whales,"Wow. I grew up watching Sesame Street. My kids watched Sesame Street. 

I never once thought about the ethnicity of the puppeteers."
Children of the Whales,Kudos to her
Children of the Whales,"(Last month was a real estate developer)

Cool this is even more uplifting than ‘last month was a crack whore’"
Children of the Whales,I clapped.
Children of the Whales,"Congrats on the new employment opportunity to this woman, but also why is this news and who the fuck cares?"
Children of the Whales,"Elmo’s puppeteer is a black guy, so I guess Megan is the first black woman to join the cast. Good on her"
Children of the Whales,First Black female pupeteer? In 2022? Sounds highly unlikely to me.
Children of the Whales,How’s she get the job ?
Children of the Whales,"so like, she did puppeteering whilst being a real estate developer right?"
Children of the Whales,You know it never entered my head that they wouldn’t have puppeteers from all walks of life and all races maybe I just think differently
Children of the Whales,It has never occurred to me the Muppets have a race / colour.  We're all just kind of weird ass colours and things.
Children of the Whales,Good but I literally don’t care
Children of the Whales,It sounds kinda racist to celebrate someone being of a specific race.
Children of the Whales,Dang she’s pretty
Children of the Whales,Why does it matter she is black and female? Wasn't Elmo a black pedo?
Children of the Whales,This is an uncomfortable post and I'm sure she feels the same way. She's more than her skin color.
Children of the Whales,Real estate developer?  Couldn't they have hired like a convicted felon so they had someone who was a better person than a slimy real estate developer?
Children of the Whales,Beautiful! Carry on!
Children of the Whales,She looks so proud. I’m happy for her. You go you puppet master ☺️
Children of the Whales,How does one become a puppeteer? I’ve been interested in this profession for a very long time.
Children of the Whales,Who cares
Children of the Whales,"Does this really matter when the puppeteers are never seen on screen? I mean do they realize this is a show whose characters are literally multi colored puppets? 

Tired of these forced woke narratives."
Children of the Whales,"Jesus Christ, who gives a fuck?"
Children of the Whales,Nobody cares.
Children of the Whales,Elmo is technically black too.
Children of the Whales,"This is a nonsense article, christ they're reaching for ""news"". What do you expect from the post. I don't think there was some huge racial hurdle to be the first on that show. Seems probably more so that not a lot of black folks are getting into the competitive world of high stakes pupeteering."
Children of the Whales,Now I’m jest waiting on a first blue person
Children of the Whales,"When I was a kid, I never wondered about what the race or ""gender"" of the person was under the puppet. As an adult, I still don't really care about people's race or gender. Even when Eminem became a popular rapper or Vanilla Ice became a superstar back in the 80s and 90s or early 2000s, both white guys, in a genre dominated by black people, it never really mattered to me. What's the point of celebrating a person's race or gender when as a society, we're not supposed to judge them by the color of their skin or who they love? It's more important to focus on the importance of what they're doing and what they've accomplished because those are the things that truly have an effect on people's lives.

There's nothing special being born into a certain race. What makes a person great is their character and how they have positively affected the lives of people around them."
Children of the Whales,Can’t sell off these homes with this market. I’m going to become a puppeteer on Sesame Street.
Children of the Whales,What a beautiful happy smile. Good for her!
Children of the Whales,"About time! I love Sesame Street but this should have happened 20 years ago. Better late than never, I guess."
Children of the Whales,that’s cool! and she’s gorgeous
Children of the Whales,"There was already a famous black puppeteer on Sesame Street, I ha s been a big fan for a long time of the art.  Jim Henson has always been my hero.

How many adjectives do we keep adding to make people feel special?  Now it’s black female, next it’s disabled black female puppeteer, then lesbian black female puppeteer and so on."
Children of the Whales,This is the movement I support. The introduction of new characters who represent minorities into legendary shows. Not that obvious shit stirring wack ass job little mermaid is doing. It’s obvious controversy and people are gonna react and be divided.
Children of the Whales,"1) and of course it’s a black female puppet, which suggests to me they thought only a black woman could puppet a black female puppet.

2) who cares? Let me know when they hire their first korean/indigenous one-armed lesbian puppeteer."
Children of the Whales,Crazy that it’s possible to have a first on Sesame Street
Children of the Whales,I bet that career change pissed off loads of puppeteers who’s worked their whole lives towards landing on a show like Sesame Street.
Children of the Whales,10000% pandering for all the wrong reasons.
Children of the Whales,"As expected, a cesspool of a comment section"
Children of the Whales,They are a puppeteer.... Why should the color of their skin even matter?
Children of the Whales,"No one ever sees the puppeteers so who really gives a shit? As long as they do the job and do it well is all that matters. They could be a black nonbinary woman who identifies as a pink polka dot goat for all I care. Now if there were better qualified people on the application stack and just went with her for a headline, then I have a problem. And I'm guessing this was just for a ""look what we did"" article."
Children of the Whales,Token black character
Children of the Whales,I think she had to pull some strings to make that happen.
Children of the Whales,"That's nice. But I want to raise the point of ""who gives a shit""?"
Children of the Whales,"This is kinda random just considering sesame street was originally made for inner city children. I mean the first black female puppeteer in HOW many years? That’s wild, but good for her nevertheless."
Children of the Whales,This is great! I can’t wait to see what she brings to the street.
Children of the Whales,isn't she a muppeteer?
Children of the Whales,[deleted]
Children of the Whales,Looks like a crank yankers puppet
Children of the Whales,"Wait... this show has been on since *1969*, and they only *just* got a black female puppeteer?

EDIT: Doh! I left out a crucial word"
Children of the Whales,Audition: Can you open and close your hand rapidly?
Children of the Whales,[deleted]
Children of the Whales,"That is one fine woman, damn."
Children of the Whales,"Look, I know she used to be a real estate developer, something that has nothing to do with being puppeteer, and she working for the most famous puppet show in U.S. history.

But before we jump to conclusions on her abilities, can we please give Peace a chance?"
Children of the Whales,"I’m sorry but this is funny. people are really 
 stretching “the first____”"
Children of the Whales,"It’s 2022, and we’re still reading “the first black..” headlines? In 2022????"
Children of the Whales,Black women never fail to impress me. It just feels like they're smashing glass ceiling after glass ceiling.
Children of the Whales,Cant wait for the 4 Ben Shapiro videos
Children of the Whales,Congratulations for checking a box I guess?
Children of the Whales,"Wow, who cares. 

Headline should just read “ woman has just a puppeteer”"
Children of the Whales,Now what about the first black female left handed puppeteer whose favorite fruit is mango and loves pumpkin spice?
Jormungand,[deleted]
Jormungand,Mushi-shi and Kino's Journey would make for interesting anthology series.
Jormungand,"Black Lagoon

Jormungand"
Jormungand,"- 91 Days
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes
- Berserk
- Vagabond
- Vinland Saga
- The Promised Neverland"
Jormungand,Whatever Netflix is not looking at.
Jormungand,"seinen is pretty much the only genre that has a chance of not getting slaughtered by Western hands, something like Maison Ikkoku or Video Girl Ai, which are two of my favourite manga/anime. Spokon might also work, something like Slam Dunk doesn't feature too many supernatural elements so it could be done. But I sure as hell don't want a Western looking cast in them, which would be extremely ridiculous, and anyway the Japanese made a billion adaptations and only a few are actually good, great even, I can't imagine a westerner getting close to that"
Jormungand,Full stop.
Jormungand,Freesia
Jormungand,The Climber
Jormungand,"One Puuuuuuuuunch!

Edit: …man"
Jormungand,Helling could be good. It’s just Dracula fighting  vampire Nazis  in the uk. The story is simple so it would be hard to butcher. No race change issues because it’s mostly Europeans in it. Lots of action present.  Just depower the main character a little and you are good to go.
Jormungand,"Death note
I know we had the horrible movie but death note could easily be adapted"
Jormungand,"Kids on the Slope. 

No magic system, no power levels, no fanservice, no decades of canon to ruin, no spiky-haired underdogs who kill the spirit of darkness with the power of friendship. 

Just a down-to-earth, human story about three teens in 1960s Japan who bond over a shared love of American jazz music.

Seems like the perfect fit for live action. Plus it's chock full of awesome Yoko Kanno music."
Jormungand,"I'd argue that almost anything could theoretically work provided that the anime itself was great in the first place. Some may be more likely to be executed well than others, and some would inevitably look sort of weird in live-action, but that wouldn't on its own make them bad (if anything it might just make them stand out in a unique way)."

Jormungand,"Code Geass. If they can do the mechs justice in VFX, that's just a great revolution noir waiting to happen"
Jormungand,Ranma.
Jormungand,"I like Sci Fi, so that's the genre I would like to see a couple of titles adapted.

The first one is an old one, ""Kurau Phantom Memories"" from the early 2000s. The story is about a young girl that is bodyjacked by an energy Alien that enters her body during an experiment in a particle accelerator. The Alien proceeds to live her life and integrate to humanity and becomes a sort of security contractor/merc. The thing I love the most about that one is the world building as it shows Earth in the 2100s: it shows it not as a Distopia but a clean beautiful future, when a lot of serious problems like inequality, environmental degradation and war have been solved.
The others would be the Sci Fi classics from the 80s and 90s: Armitage III, Bubblegum Crisis, Battle Angel Alita, Dirty Pair and Ghost in the Shell. Those have excellent stories and until recently would be very expensive to adapt IRL, but I suspect recent advances in special effects might make it less so.
How a ""Legend of the Galactc Heroes"" or a ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" would look in live action?
 I would love to find out."
Jormungand,Holyland. It's a fairly realistic story about street fighting.
Jormungand,Monster is screaming for an HBO adaptation
Jormungand,"Ooh Monster would be interesting. Casting might be tough though, it's been quite some time since I saw Monster but doesn't Johan pose as his sister a fair bit?"
Jormungand,Netflix is doing a Death Note tv show with Duffer brothers producing last I heard
Jormungand,"That would cost way too much money to do. Just think about how much something like transformers costs. 

Plus anime like CG never translates well to live action."
Jormungand,"He did, you would probably need to find a pair of androgynous twins to play them"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I’d love a modern cheers. Maybe make it a coffee shop or something where it’s about the owner and their friends, not just a group of people that sit on the same couch for five years."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I want a return of ""My Name is Earl"""
Inu X Boku Secret Service,I wouldn't mind seeing some well written X-Files specials.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Just leave my Sopranos alone. Dont go getting anymore cute ideas about prequels or whatever the fuck that Many Saints movie was. 

Literally half the original cast has passed on, and I know even thats not enough to keep someone from trying to milk the franchise further."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Still waiting for that Stargate Universe restart.

Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Northern Exposure, please. It's all primed to revisit and reboot."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Id like to see ""Burn Notice"" come back as a more Wholesome version of ""The Americans"""
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Archive 81 deserves more seasons. Would work great as a connected anthology series where the actors and locations are different, but the stories tie together."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I would LOVE another season of ""Happy Endings"". 🤞"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Gargoyles and Batman Beyond would work today
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Netflix will forever be on my shit list if they don't bring G.L.O.W back for its final season
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Columbo

There is currently few* serial ""made for tv"" movie franchises. This is a niche that would be a great fit for streaming.

I remember binging these on A&E during summer holidays. A new feature daily! The very end of the run was still cranking out an occasional movie, which was a treat.

Mark Ruffalo looks a lot like Detective Colombo.

*BBC did this with Sherlock.
*ITV does this with Midsummer Murders
*Father Brown exists.
*i should have said North American. The Brits seem to love this."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Twin Peaks 4 -- both categories
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Can only think of the one I want brought back.

Do Over with Penn Badgley should have never been cancelled and be brought back. 

Boston Public 

Pushing Daisies 

Forever

Mercy 

Red Band Society

Pitch 

Paper Girls

G.L.O.W."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,I feel like Lost reboot is inevitable sadly
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I will add Rubicon and Lodge 42 to the list as well. 

New seasons of Rubicon could have cameo or two from the original stars. It doesn’t have to have the same cast, just the same organizations at work. 

For Lodge, you’d probably have to get most of the great original cast to sign back on. But one can dream!"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"The few I would want 
1. A modern Yes Prime Minister (set during the final weeks of Brexit. Yet I don't want Jim Hacker to be the face of this)

2. Moral Orel 
 I really want to see Orel as an adult. This show really hit me hard.

3. Garfield
 I want my fat orange cat

4. Upstart Crow
More David Mitchell as Shakespeare"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"and this would be the one time where a reboot with a more diverse cast would completely make sense and not take away from the story in any way

although I will say this (and Im black if that matters) but I liked Cheers and and I dont have a problem with there being no major black characters. I dont believe you always need a “token”. I like the Jamie Foxx show too and dont feel they need to apologize for an all black cast.

I absolutely think there should be a space for that type of casting as it does reflect life."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,2 Broke Girls called.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,That show had a weird but still familiar energy that I think could take off today and probably with a reasonable budget.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,This!!!!!!!!!!
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Only Murders in the Building is a great show!
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"> Columbo

I believe Poker Face with Natascha Lyonne is going to be a modern-day take on it."

Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Ok I just looked this up. OMG bro it looks amazing. I put it on My List for tomorrow night.

Have yourself a beer. Cheers mate."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Looks like no one got the joke!
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"The humor in this show is great, so goddamn dry it could almost be British. I'm not sure how enjoyable it is if you don't have some knowledge of French history in the 20th century (like the CIA speaking positively about Petain in that scene) but I loved it."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Y a pot ?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"The Rolling Stone article would have been more journalistically impressive if it had printed the actual SNL joke, instead of Mulaney’s later synopsis of the joke."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,I wonder if WKUK got investigated for [this sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg3_kUaYFJA)

Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Overreaction aside, watch his monologue on youtube.  I hadn't seen it before and he's really funny."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Not sure it will be enough to get him into the Lenny Bruce Hall of Fame, along side the likes of George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Redd Foxx."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,what was the joke?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,[actual report for those interested](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20459625-leopold-secret-service-foia-comedian-john-mulaney-snl)
Inu X Boku Secret Service,I didn't know Mulaney checked into rehab recently!  I knew he had previous substance abuse problems that he joked about in his specials but it sounded it was primarily his highschool and college days. Hope he's doing alright!
Inu X Boku Secret Service,John Mulaney is a comedic beast and I'd take him over Trump for president any day. At the very least the press conferences would be awesome!!
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Did the Lenny Bruce case teach the government nothing?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Hey! I thought all those freedom loving MAGAs are champions of free speech? I mean, he was just making a historical reference"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,It kills me how many threats were made about hanging Obama but as soon as you make a joke just slightly hinting and not even naming Trump they all loose their minds. It’s crazy how they want to call people snowflakes and yet do shit like this it’s mind boggling really
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"""in rehab for cocaine addiction"", wink wink"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Another reason to hate Trump if this had anything to with Mulaney's relapse
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"He should be banned from Twitter, Facebook and all social media. On a side note, he's not very funny."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Good.  That's what you get for being an asshole.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,This is such a waste of taxpayers' money.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,thats an easy way for the author to get investigated himself
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"What's particularly funny is that I don't think there actually is a ""Rockefeller Hewitt"" building, because if there was that might be a little too far to go for the joke."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,I do t even need to click the link. I know EXACT what sketch you’re referring to XD
Inu X Boku Secret Service,WKUK still giving even after all these years.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"The closest is the Anthony Elonis case where he quoted the sketch on  Facebook but replaced the word ""president"" with ""wife""."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"John Mulaney's Very Dangerous Plan.

Step 1: Get elected to the Senate."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"It’s good to see the third amendment get some love. It’s one of those things that made sense back in the day, and maybe is still necessary in isolated cases I guess? It always gets overlooked cause it seems useless"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"""America is like Michael Jordan."". Hilarious."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,On January 6th the reverse of that was attempted.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Not viewable in my country.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,The secret service investigates even the most esoteric of possible threats to the president's life.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,not really an overreaction since im pretty sure they are legally obligated to investigate every potential threat to the president or other political figures
Inu X Boku Secret Service,[deleted]
Inu X Boku Secret Service,you haven't seen his skit on the horse in a hospital
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Also ... how many amendments are as useless as the 3rd lol
Inu X Boku Secret Service,He looks like a newborn baby and he consistently gets funnier. he has time
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"“Julius Caesar invented Leap Year to correct the calendar. He was also stabbed by senators after going crazy, which is an interesting thing that could happen.”"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"nullbyte420  posted the YouTube link 

In short, mulaney reference Cesar getting stabbed in the back by his own senate. And he, mulaney, wouldn't be upset if that tradition got brought back."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"> USSS did not interview Mulaney.

> No further USSS investigation conducted.

So, the report is “yeah we saw it too. And?”"
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I'm sure quarantine doesn't help when you have money and addictions. Though I bet it's been a thing he's been dealing with for years; a guy who looks like John Mulaney could probably walk around holding a big wrapped brick with ""cocaine"" written on it in marker and not get arrested."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,There’s a horse loose at the hospital....
Inu X Boku Secret Service,The person who ordered the investigation should lose their job at a minimum. Clearly harassment.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,They didn't even interview him.  The report is posted in the comments here and they basically just opened a file since it was a very public performance and more people would be reporting it.  It wasn't considered a credible threat.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Well that’s disingenuous.
He doesn’t violate their terms of service by blasting upper-fueled tweet storms about racist, misogynistic, violent babble. It’s interesting that you’re trying to make a false equivalence when your argument is a comedian should be more accountable for his words than our president. 

Also, he’s hilarious."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,trumps cabinet was comprised of criminals and insurrectionists..
Inu X Boku Secret Service,What for?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,*tRiGgErEd!!!!*
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"What are you on about? 

The senate didn't stab him to death in the end. Trump so far has gotten away with being an asshole."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Nobody on planet earth has ever called John Mulaney an asshole
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Never go full retard
Inu X Boku Secret Service,That’s not how journalism works.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"I think that's supposed to the be EEOB in the graphic, but I could be wrong on my Washington DC geography."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,2: much tuna
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"There was a 3rd Amendment case a few years ago, where the police took over someone's house for a stakeout.  It was held by the Supremes to not apply in that instance."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,It seems useless because we’re used to the protections. Kind of like how vaccines seem useless because people don’t get sick as much.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,i think someone has to make a joke about that sooner or later.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,He said that the US senate should stab their leader like the senate did to Julius Caesar.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Then how do you explain the capitol riot?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,">""Although no direct threats were made, due to the popularity, it is likely concerned citizens will report this,” agency writes in report. 

you should try reading the article."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Yea they definitely did that for trump lmao
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"No lol, this was obviously a trump witch hunt to smear the guy. They are perfect capable of look into shit without it being leaked."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Yeah. They investigated Eminem over some Trump disses too. Obviously Eminem isn't going to kill Trump. Doesn't matter. They investigate them all.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"Sure this was obviously ordered by trump or his freaks. That's why it's ""leaked"" they are perfectly capable of checking in on something so silly without it being public."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"It was in response to Britain’s Quartering Act. The Act made colonists pay for barracks for British soldiers, and in some instances when troop numbers exceeded available quarters, colonists were required by law to house them in their own homes/barns/stables. 

Not that surprising they hated that and wanted to make sure it was illegal for the US government to do in the future."
Inu X Boku Secret Service,Newborn baby on mounds of c-caine.
Inu X Boku Secret Service,And SS investigated that?!?
Inu X Boku Secret Service,"its funny how often that lies are repeated.

Caesar was stabbed by wealthy elites because he tried to implement reforms so the few could not own all the land in rome.

Gamers!,At least it outlived Quibi by one month lol
Gamers!,"Gotta admit, I liked getting to see Ninja Warrior (the actual Japanese version) one more time though via “DVR” on YTTV, but honestly, other than the commercials that I mostly skipped, I had no idea what else was on G4. (But from the commercials it seemed bad…)"
Gamers!,"From what I saw, they tried to make it basically just like Twitch with random people acting as streamers.... They needed actual content beyond people talking."
Gamers!,RIP.  This type of channel just doesn't work in the modern ecosystem.  Sucks for the employees tho.
Gamers!,"G4 was really good in the 2000s and that's the problem, it feels really dated now. They didn't evolve and change when newer gamers came along."
Gamers!,Used to watch Kevin Rose and Kevin Pereira back in the day. I wonder what they are up to these days
Gamers!,[A full TV crew of nearly 200 people](https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1581797325789282305) for a glorified Twitch channel. The premise was completely deranged.
Gamers!,[removed]
Gamers!,"The original G4 was too early for this world.  


By the time this G4 was created, the world had passed it by."
Gamers!,Pretty terrible that this is how their employees found out.
Gamers!,"Internal Memo from Comcast Chairman and CEO Dave Scott

>As you know, G4 was re-introduced last year to tap into the popularity of
gaming. We invested to create the new G4 as an online and TV destination for fans
to be entertained, be inspired, and connect with gaming content.


>Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but
viewership is low and the network has not achieved sustainable financial
results. This is certainly not what we hoped for, and, as a result, we have made the
very difficult decision to discontinue G4’s operations, effective immediately.
I know this is disappointing news, and I’m disappointed, too. I want to thank you
and everyone on the G4 team for the hard work and commitment to the network.

>Our human resources team is reaching out to you to provide you with support,
discuss other opportunities that may be available, and answer any questions you
may have."
Gamers!,It’s shocking to learn that they had over 200 employees.
Gamers!,"Yeah, the audience you are trying to reach doesn't give a shit about traditional TV anymore. If you are trying to cash in on nostalgia, sure, but when the ones who used to watch G4 back in the day, especially as kids, we have a lot more brand new shiny things to interact with than old form content. I loved G4 as a kid in the 2000s. I'm sure as shit not going to spend my time as an adult watching 30-40 minutes of ads for 30 minutes of content. I got way better things to occupy my free time. Cashing in on nostalgia worked for some, but the effect wares off pretty quickly. G4 reboot was a doomed-to-fail project from the start."
Gamers!,"yeah this is the result of corporate trying to pull a how do you do fellow kids.  


Anybody with respect to the channel would have done it completely different.  Small guerilla operation channels under the brand umbrella not whatever it is they tried."
Gamers!,"G4 was the watered down, safe for the masses “corporate version” of TechTV. They treated TechTV like a chop shop. So grateful I was able to enjoy TechTV while it was around.

TechTV viewers were fortunate enough to have shows like the Screen Savers, Fresh Gear, Call for Help, Extended Play and more. Even the news was brilliant and engaging. You just got the sense all of people involved had a lot of freedom and really cared deeply about what they were doing. Plenty of it felt impromptu or thrown together at the last minute, but in a beautiful way. The synergy of the cast was incredible. 

They would even have LAN tournaments with the audience; playing things like Unreal Tournament 2003 on The Screen Savers; a show where you especially got to see a talented group vibing organically. People like Leo Laporte, Patrick Norton and Yoshi were so smart and creative. I felt like there was literally no topic Patrick wasn’t an expert on. Yoshi’s box (with all the game consoles and a gaming pc in-one is still so awesome). Then paired with Morgan Webb and Martin Sargent who were also smart but even more so funny and engaging; casually riffing off of each other. Such an incredible TV network."
Gamers!,"I see a lot of ""it just can't exist in 2022” comments. I totally agree with that, that the original G4 would have a hard time with how modern streaming/YouTube is. Here is the thing though, they never even attempted to recreate what G4 was in a meaningful way. 

The new G4 was way too chaotic. Attack of the Show/TSS used to have a format. Two hosts with a rotating panel of guests who would do reviews, news, interviews, etc. It was tight and you knew what you were getting. Kevin P, Olivia, Kevin Rose, etc. etc. You knew who was going to be there at 7pm.

The new AOTS had no structure. It didn't have segments like tech reviews with Hardwick or movie news with Gore. It was chaotic. Every episode was literally five to six random people sitting around with one or two hosting. Some people would be scheduled and literally not do anything the entire episode. Just sit on a chair and occasionally laugh. Besides Around The Net they didn't have any segments that felt ""meaningful"" for lack of a better word.

They didn't try to make content like Judgement Day, Icons and Code Monkeys. They could have lasted longer if they produced longform interviews and docuseries. That's what I loved about the old G4. I loved seeing documentaries about game developers or documentaries about significant moments in gaming. They should have focused on that. 

Instead they were really just chaotic. There was no set schedule. You weren't getting more than one or two episodes of AOTS a week and one was basically a podcast. They replayed shows constantly. 

So yeah saying G4 couldn't survive in 2022 is fair. But they didn't even attempt it. They literally based the new channel on having a rotating cast of ten people being random. There was so much dead air. There were no segments to actually care about and there wasn't enough new content to actually watch."
Gamers!,"As a former G4 employee, this is sad to see."
Gamers!,I mean this should’ve been a Twitch or Youtube exclusive channel. Putting it on TV was dumb. Their target audience probably didn’t know what channel it was on.
Gamers!,"Content was just not very good tbh.

I have nothing against the employees on camera but they just weren’t entertaining, insightful, or enjoyable to watch. I feel like whoever was in charge mistook passion for experience when hiring this G4 crew. 

The humor was too forced and too often times it interrupted any genuine discussion or insight they tried to give.

Some anecdotal advise would be to mainly find a group of people who serve better on camera. I personally never got attached to any of the core cast. Most of the content was spent on each person feeding us their overplayed millennial humor that felt like it came right off of an inactive Facebook gaming page from 2010.

Probably just nostalgia speaking, but Adam Sessler was the only real highlight but that’s not a surprise because he is a veteran of the industry. 

Edit: just to clarify, There is nothing wrong with millennial humor. Anything can be funny this just wasn’t. Just give me actual gaming journalism and media analysis. Not a Twitch livestream on cable fucking tv"
Gamers!,"TIL G4 came back, I saw some like random YouTube stuff about a return and then nothing in my feeds.

Did they forget that you needed to advertise?"
Gamers!,channel was dead on launch. know your audience.
Gamers!,So what is Kevin Pereira up to nowadays? Always liked him.
Gamers!,"whoa, color me shocked!!  /s"
Gamers!,They literally told their viewers to not watch
Gamers!,I tried watching this because I watched G4 when I was younger. It was hard to watch. The jokes were very childish and it felt very bro culture. It seemed like I grew up and G4 didn't.
Gamers!,I hope Scott got paid upfront.
Gamers!,RIP Donna
Gamers!,"Guess that’s what happens when your gaming site staff are openly disdainful of the medium and the people who enjoy it. 

Nothing of value was lost here."
Gamers!,But I thought calling your fan base a bunch of sexist pigs would have been a good thing.
Gamers!,Well that’s what happens when you tell your audience not to watch. Goodbye!
Gamers!,"(*Doing my best Adam Sessler clapping like a seal impersonation *) ""If you don't like it don't watch it, PEACE!"" Goodbye G4, From shows like Filter, XPlay with Morgan Webb and Adam before he went all nut bags , I will miss what you were but saddened what you became."
Gamers!,"How did they write that entire article without once mentioning Frosk? I think they'd have failed regardless, but she ensured they sped ran to failure."
Gamers!,I'll always appreciate the early days of Olivia Munn on AoTS...
Gamers!,I was a big fan back in the day but I almost never watched their new stuff because I didn't enjoy it. If they couldn't get someone like me who used to love the network to watch then they were screwed.
Gamers!,"I didn't vibe with the stuff they were doing, but it really sucks that all those people are now going to be out of a job. The production staff in particular."
Gamers!,"I think the network had the potential to make it, but between bad hires and only Kevin and Adam being the only people to return...it just didn't work. Adam's content was very enjoyable to watch and it felt like old G4, but that was about it."
Gamers!,if i had to sum up the entire experience in one word: cringe.
Gamers!,"This whole thread shows they marketed like dogshit. So many people saying they'd watch it on YouTube even though the shows were on YouTube the whole time. 

The TV channel even launched late and they started off just putting out shows online"
Gamers!,Their short lived DnD series was actually pretty good IMO. It got me into it.
Gamers!,"I stopped paying attention when Frosk told everyone to fuck off, shoulda brought back Morgan Webb when you had the chance"
Gamers!,"Didnt one of its hosts basically tell its core audience to fuck off? Then later bragged about not getting fired duringa couple rounds of layoffs?

If these are the headliners you pick then it seems like you didnt really have much of a chance then eh?"
Gamers!,Wow a channel that's biggest claim to fame was telling its viewers they shouldn't be watching them was shut down.  I for one am shocked.
Gamers!,Interested in Gaming content. Not interested in a cable package. Just move to a YT/Twitch acct. I'll watch there and so will others if you make decent content.
Gamers!,Rip bozo
Gamers!,All the shows was basically people poorly podcasting.
Gamers!,That’s what happens when you drive away your fanbase.
Gamers!,I didn’t know where to watch it. From this post I just now learned it was on Twitch.
Gamers!,I miss Olivia munn
Gamers!,Oh how I miss the old G4. Been so long I can’t remember any of the good shows besides ninja warrior and having a huge crush on Olivia Munn
Gamers!,What's worse is that most of the employees found out via the tweet about the network closing down
Gamers!,"I've heard that there was a lot of outrage around Frosk whom supposedly pushed the network in a political direction with mediocre commentary (not sure if this is true or not just what i've heard), this pissed off a significant chunk of fans G4 had, and then G4 chose to keep Frosk over those fans... viewership plummeted. Because viewership plummeted G4 staff were being fired left an right to cut costs. Supposedly Frosk then had some comments mocking laid off coworkers before she too was also fired.

A gamer focused network is inherently EXTREMELY niche, but even if 1/10th of the above is true that is way too much controversy to survive as you need every viewer you can get. You really need to focus on games / the gaming industry and remove every bit of controversy you can regardless how small just to keep your viewership numbers up."
Gamers!,There was so much competition already in the form of Twitch streams and LP’s and all that that it was going to be difficult for G4 to succeed. They also had the same problem that G4 faced before the TechTV merger—penetration. Linear TV still matters and they were not on every carrier or were hid behind premium packages and that is not workable.
Gamers!,That's what happens when a few months after relaunch you let one of your employees go on a rant and pretty much talk shit to your target demo. It probably wouldn't have lasted much longer but Frosk's little tirade certainly didn't help.
Gamers!,"Not surprised in the least. I loved the original Tech-TV/G4, and I was excited when I heard it was coming back, hoping it would recapture the vibe the original did. It didn't. The programming and streams were awkward and awful. 

Frosk's sexism rant did **not** help matters, and also turned so many people off. Also her bragging on Twitter about ""surviving"" while her colleagues were getting laid off was a terrible look. She's toxic. No one will hire her. 

The worst part about this, by far, is that the employees who worked here no longer have a job."
Gamers!,The original incarnation of X-Play was a hollow shell of itself from 2008-2013 and Olivia Munn was winding down her time on Attack of the show by mid 2010 after only 4 years and all the marketing for the revival made it seem like the original g4 had an epic iconic decade+ run of success with X-Play and AOTS thanks to the core 4 of Kevin/Olivia/Adam/Morgan.
Gamers!,Great. Tons of Frosk heads on YouTube thumbnails incoming.
Gamers!,if you dont like it dont watch it.....peace. Well done Frosk
Gamers!,"I still think a video game centric/nerd-centralized TV network could work.

How this version of G4 handled it though was terrible. There just was no concrete plan as to what the network was going to be and you could tell.

They launched the network with a lot of hype and then almost immediately took a two-week break for the holidays and lost any and all momentum. That would become a theme as the constant two-week breaks would happen and less and less viewers would return.

While I love the Attack of the Show cast, the overall show became a shitty version of like SNL. Trying to fit what was an almost daily show formula in the past into a once-a-week episode was just a failure and they spent so little time on things that made the old show great in favor of boring, not funny, way too long game show type shit.

XPlay completely lost its edge. I stopped watching it only weeks into it coming back. Adam is fantastic, but he was never in studio (for fully understandable reasons).

You cant flub your two flagship programs that hard no matter what other content you run. You can tell their deals with Will Neff/Austin for those two shows were god awful as well. They received zero boost from producing those shows, all of it went to the individual streamers."
Gamers!,[deleted]
Gamers!,Y'all can blame Frosk for this one.
Gamers!,"LOL, and a big thaks to Frosk-urine."
Gamers!,"I liked G4 back in the day (particularly Attack of the Show).

I was excited for G4 (and AOTS) to return!

Then…I could never figure out how to actually watch G4 and AOTS when they came back. So I never saw an episode."
Gamers!,"What can be said, the audience was going to be niche and small in the first place and then your hosts are peddling their politics on air and telling the people in that small audience to change the channel if they don't like it.

Why do they never see it coming?"
Gamers!,"I mean, why would I watch tv games “journalists” soft sell video games under the guise of news and features, when I could just play a game or watch a twitch streamer soft sell a game while it’s actually being played in full?  This channel concept just doesn’t work."
Gamers!,In theory watching stuff about e sports sounds cool. But id have to dedicate gaming time to do it. And watching a bunch of assholes clacking away at their mice bores me to tears.
Gamers!,I miss the old G4 days though.
Gamers!,Remember Sara underwood ?
Gamers!,"They killed their own product. They would find stuff that worked and got views but then stop doing. Vibe check, for example, when they first started it was good. But it was good because of Kevin. And when Fiona and Kass were on with him those shows were absolute fire. Kevin always brought new stuff to the table I had never heard of and gave me enjoyment, games to play, stuff to look up, etc. Then they started bringing other ppl on with him and the chemistry wasn’t as good. Then Kevin quit doing the shows and quit entirely and the writing was on the wall"
Gamers!,Rip tech tv
Gamers!,Maybe they should have avoided making everything so turbocharged political and activist. The old format worked because it was about gaming and geekdom in general. It wasn’t pretentious or used as a lecture pulpit for the most part. Most gamers didn’t care either way for the hoopla behind gamergate type stuff so trying to recreate some kind of activist moment is not a good business plan.
Gamers!,Poor Kevin Pereira can't get a break with G4
Gamers!,Was this that Frosk garbage where they decided to chastise their audience and found out they don’t have to watch?
Gamers!,So is this Frosks fault?
Gamers!,I use to love watching Attack of the show back in the day when Olivia Munn was on it
Gamers!,"I used to love Adam Sessler, but apparently he turned into a giant bowl of crazy asshole. 

Rip G4. Again"
Gamers!,"Never forget that Frosk openly mocked the other employees on Twitter after nearly every employee lost their jobs last month. The employee culture at G4 seemed terrible from the beginning, no wonder it didnt work out."
Gamers!,They told everyone to stop watching and so they did.
Gamers!,Keep politics out of the workplace. Alienate co workers and if you work in the public eye gdi. The saying is old as shit because it's true.
Gamers!,It had no chance to begin with. It was a glorified twitch channel with 200 employees. The content was trash and Frosk is insufferable.
Gamers!,"Again, it pandered to fake nerd girls and fly by night fans nothing about it was real. Just fake after fake after fake"
Gamers!,It doesn't help that I didn't even know they had revived it lol. Not that I would've watched normal tv just for it anyways.
Gamers!,"I watched a ton of their stuff on Youtube recently. Honestly, I really enjoyed it, but I didn’t hear about it until a few weeks ago when the layoffs started. 

Its a shame they never found their audience. It should have been more successful."
Gamers!,It brought nothing innovative. It was just nostalgia for something that doesn't exist anymore because hundreds of YouTubers do it better.
Gamers!,"I remember there G4 Madden Tournament coverage they did was entertaining with odd characters who enter the tournaments. I use to remember there Game Show called Arena fun times. 

The Drama really killed G4 if they would just stick to gaming instead of having someone rant about themselves all because people questioned this persons comments about Sony PlayStation takes there wouldn’t be all this drama."
Gamers!,"You know, if they played more of the programs that they aired for the nostalgia factor and put a mussel on Frosk, G4 wouldn’t be in this mess."
Gamers!,Oh no! Anyway
Gamers!,Froskbitten!
Gamers!,"I loved old G4 and then when I saw Adam Sessler pop back up on YouTube I jumped right back in and grew to love his Old Man Sessler vibes. 

Then I found out about his Twitter.. I like to think I’m a reasonable conservative, but it was clear Adam Sessler just doesn’t believe that’s even possible. He made it very clear he would despise me. I don’t like when politics influence everything but it was so difficult for me to feel like he just wouldn’t want me as an audience member. 

Then the Frosk rant happened… I don’t take issue with anything she said but there was a tonal shift where it seemed like they started to view themselves as against a portion of their audience. And when they drew that line in the sand, even though I don’t feel like I resemble the people they’re actually against, I felt like I got lumped in with them somehow. 

Basically, I really liked old G4 and really wanted new G4 to succeed, but it felt like they didn’t want me as part of their audience. So I stopped watching."
Gamers!,"damned this is frosked up, gg no re."
Gamers!,"This was how the end began 9 months ago: Frosk's Meltdown:
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFiVqFoi_lc

Now here's the coverage about G4TV's official end from today: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWI4qWGv4do"
Gamers!,"Go wokerg, go brokerh...amen."
Gamers!,"I remember G4 talking about Mass Effect 3 in 2012, and that was the last time it was a good show. Execs are out of touch in 2022, gamers typically don't watch cable television. I spend all of my time outside of work watching Youtube and Netflix and nothing else."
Gamers!,Don't like it don't watch I was told... now they peace-ing out?
Gamers!,"Wow she really gave them the mortal wound that ultimately ended up finishing the whole project off. 

Cheers."
Gamers!,"Maybe next time l, don’t talk down to your target audience and act like total assholes."
Gamers!,It was mostly frosk but most people are just ignoring that.
Gamers!,"It was never going to work, but it would have had a much longer life if frosk did not nuke it from orbit with her crazy rant on the very first episode.  The moment she did that, everyone said it was DOA."
Gamers!,Good job Frosk! What a piece of shit she is...
Gamers!,"I think it was telling how this was going to go when they had to license out YouTube content to fill up their catalog.

Like for instance, I love Scott the Woz and think the YouTube channel is super high quality. With that said it is hard for me to be excited about potentially finding a way to watch G4 when I could just watch Scott the Woz with no super long ad breaks on YouTube for free.

I'm sure they had some talented creators with creative shows, but the problem is that the only one I heard about is Scott the Woz. They needed to really advertise their original content."
Gamers!,No more Scott on tv 😞
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Can't wait for Homelander to  kill them in the first episode
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"I wonder if this is intentionally meta as FUCK. Unveiling ""new supes"" and going into detail about the costume design in a dumb-ass fluff newspiece is exactly the sort of corporate machination that the show was lampooning. 

Have we gone full circle?"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Hmm..... I wonder which one do you reckon is Sister Sage and which is Firecracker......
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Loved Valerie Curry in Detroit: Become Human, hope she does well!"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,New Maeve?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,My prediction is that Homelander is gonna kill one of them.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"This is one of those shows where I’m happy I haven’t read the comics, because it seems like TWD fans all over again with the divide of “the comics are soooo much better” side of fans, and the “I don’t know what’s supposed to happen next” side of fans.  Knowing absolutely nothing about the comics, I have thoroughly enjoyed the show so far and anyone who says “nothing really happens” or “the story is soooo slow moving” either knows something I don’t, or is watching something different.  I think the pacing is great, and the writing and acting is on point.

The only thing I hate about the show is the constant look on Hughie’s face like he just smelled a horrible fart.  He has that one expression and that’s it.  

Speaking of which, the guy who plays Hughie would absolutely crush it in a live action Rick and Morty movie as Jerry.  Tell me I’m wrong."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"ITT status quo comments even though a bunch of stuff happened and changed at the end of S3.

Rinse and repeat for every Boys related thread since S3 ended."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,All supes are bastards
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I just hope they stop stalling and move forward with the plot.  The don't seem to want to change things up with regard to Homelander and they are just running in circles because of it.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I love Sister Sage's costume colors. She looks fantastic.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I've learned to avoid any and all input by redditors on this show and just enjoy it.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"How original, now fucking kill em"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,More meat to the grinder
The Testament of Sister New Devil,The boys hit harder and harder each episode !
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Can't wait to nearly kill homelander again, but don't"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Hopefully last seasons finale isn’t indicative of what the rest of The Boys looks like, it was the first time The Boys looked like a MCU movie which is what it’s supposed to be subverting, just a bunch of superheroes with similar powers fighting over very thin pretext, I love the show and don’t want it becoming a caricature of itself"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,So Mauve is gone and Starlight is out and joined the Boys so they are most likely going to be their replacements to have female “representation” for Vought to show the world even though homelander is still being the most evil person there is. I wonder if they are going to play along and be evil or will they be another version of Mauve and Starlight? I also wonder what superhero’s they are parodying from?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Lot of people here seem to hate this show since they made it more clear Homelander is a villain....
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Maybe they can actually commit to a change of status quo for once. I was so excited for S3, only for it to just reverse literally everyone's character arcs and storylines back to S1-territory all over again. 

It's a show where a lot happens but nothing *happens*."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,They're deaths will be glorious and without impact
The Testament of Sister New Devil,">Supes Firecracker

My brain saw Supercrackers which made me think of Soup 'R Crackers which makes me think about how the Party Down revival is doing."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I’m liking the MC Lyte meets early 90s Lauryn Hill get up.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Let me guess....the black one is sisters sage.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"I get the appeal of this show, but man I just couldn't get into it. The dialogue sucks and Starlight's entire story arc is so bland. It sounds like the later seasons get better though."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,damn i thought that was Ellie Kemper and i got so f*ing pumped lol!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,You already know sage got that sassy attitude 😂
The Testament of Sister New Devil,AKA: disposable characters that are killed so the main characters can plot armour through the story while still claiming The Boys is shocking and revolutionary.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"And “Angry Woman, the worlds first black lesbian feminist superhero!”"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"After watching the teaser, I find it a little odd that there's gonna be a side love story between Huey and Ashley."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I would assume that Firecracker will be a stand in for Jubilee of the X-Men?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Nothing happens: the show.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,More targets for Homelander to hit 👺
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"meet new boxes checked, I mean new characters"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Have a sinking feeling that this is gonna end with everyone has a super power, and normal humans are extremely rare."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Aaaaand they’re dead
The Testament of Sister New Devil,S3 ended so badly it put me off
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Anyone else feel the ""gimmick"" of evil (or cynical) superman/superheros has run its course? Like the series is beginning to lack verisimilitude with how often people get ripped apart by supes but ""the world"" continues ""as usual"" ?"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Let’s hope it’s better than the dogshit that was season 3 and it’s finale
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"So as soon as Cara got her freedom she went ginger and applied to the worst company in the world?   
Welp, that's free choice for ya, folks."

The Testament of Sister New Devil,"They’re very hot 🥵

EDIT: why are you booing?"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Huey is a whiny fuck i dont care about, and most of the show is built around shock value."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,All this just for their faces to get bashed in on a roof
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Homelander is going to kill them at some point, isn't he."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I just wanna see how wrecked starlights face is now
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Firecracker's legs look absurdly shiny.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Sad times
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I fucking wish they would stop calling them fucking supes
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Gotta have more females on a show called ""The Boys,"" lol"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Looks woke!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,How do people watch this show. It’s so very cringe.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Susan Heyward aged oddly.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"/yawn

This show completely jumped the shark for me."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Is that the girl who got fired from ESPN?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Did anyone else find season 3 so poorly plotted, dialogued and performed that they couldn’t finish watching it? I may never make it to season 4…"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,This show is a total dumpster fire and honestly it needs to be cancelled. The trade paperbacks were 1000% better than what Rogen came up with. The good news is that it’s going to be over soon because they are so far away from the original plots that it cannot be saved.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Can’t wait for everything they do to not matter
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Gross
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"I mean this in the nicest way, I hope they get ANNIHILATED in the series."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,marketing team works year round!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I wonder how many obvious  fire cracker jokes will be made.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Can’t wait for Homelander and or Butcher to punt one of their heads off.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Looking forward to see how gruesome their deaths are 🤷
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"hopefully this will be better then season 3. also if homelander dies, then the serie is done, unless they bring another bad guy that is equally good at being bad. same problem you have now in the marvel universe. the reason why phase 4 does not take of, because there is no bad guy which is as good as thanos."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Women ☕️
The Testament of Sister New Devil,This superhero shit getting way too played out
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Those costumes look killer!! Compared to many of the over designed full-cg MCU costumes these are so much better!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I wonder which one is which.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Maybe Homelander's son kills them.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Then we spend the next few episodes pretending Homelander is gonna die? Then at the end he survives?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Gotta have a sex scene first where when firecracker orgasms like little pops are all over the place.

You know, normal supe sex."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"They look like they have unremarkable or novelty powers. They're so doomed.

Who are you? The guy who can change TV channels with his mind? Oh yeah enjoy being mopped up in 5 minutes."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Off-screen and without any resolution
The Testament of Sister New Devil,And then not a single returning character takes more than a scratch of damage in the entire season.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Or fuck at least one of them and have an entanglement
The Testament of Sister New Devil,But not before they both fuck eachother with superpowers involved...
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I love The Boys but its fair to say they have their cake and eat it when it comes to things like this.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Yes and irony evades far too many people here..
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"This show literally has an IRL YouTube channel called Vought International that has VNN, a news show that has The Boys’ version of Tucker Carlson; company ads for Vought, and music videos starring the superheroes within the show. Every piece of advertising for this show is meant to be meta as fuck"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Or it just isn’t as clever as writers like to think.  “I mean, that type of objectification is what the OTHER side does.  When we do it, it’s because it’s a cutting-edge satire on the film industry”"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,What a twist it would be if sister sage is the red head and is an Irish pagan hero that knows a lot about herbs!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"It’s meant to be marketing driven to a ridiculous extent so pandering names is par for the course.  I’m sure the show doesn’t mind a little controversy though.

Edit: marketing driven in the show"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Reminds me Mother Russia, Genghis Carnage, and Black Death from Kick-ass 2"
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Surprised her name isn't Sista Sage
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"Firecracker's the one in red and blue, if it helps. I recognise the actress from that shitty The Lost Symbol show."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Look at the belts
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Yes it’s definitely the black one.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I also shouted out sister sage when the link opened.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,Yo! Now im super excited about this casting !
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"The Tick, too!

Except now I've made myself sad about The Tick..."

The Testament of Sister New Devil,One of them? Try both!
The Testament of Sister New Devil,This show has deviated greatly from the comic. Reading the comic can't really spoil anything.
The Testament of Sister New Devil,I've never read the comics either but I get the feeling the general consensus even among the comic readers is that the show is far superior?
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"No such divide. Only edge lords  prefer garth's edge fest over the show. I've read all the comics, watched the show, and I'm glad the series drifted a mile away from the source material."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"The comics are utterly masturbatory and edgy well beyond the sake of edgy. It's not worth it imo, the show is much better in terms of being enjoyable."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"The comic is edgelord trash by design.

The show is a better product despite its flaws. You should see what happens in the comic version of herogasm."
The Testament of Sister New Devil,"the comics are actually pretty bad tbh, I havent seen a single person say they prefer them"

SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,24 had this dilemma multiple times per season. Though often times the choice wasn't 100% clear. Sometimes characters would have to choose to sacrifice 1 life to maybe save a large number of people or to maybe save 1 important person by sacrificing several others.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"
From chat gpt. My fav is from the good place. It's an excellent example. 


Q: Do you know the of having to choose between saving one person or letting them die to save many people? 

A: This is a classic ethical dilemma known as the ""trolley problem."" It is often used in discussions of ethics and moral philosophy to explore the trade-offs between the value of one life versus many lives. The specific scenario you describe is known as the ""bystander at the switch"" version of the trolley problem. There is no easy answer to this problem, as it raises important questions about the value of human life and the trade-offs we are willing to make in order to save the lives of others. The most common approach is to evaluate the problem from multiple ethical perspectives such as Consequentialism, Deontology and Virtue ethics in order to understand the different arguments for and against each possible course of action.

￼￼

Q: Can you give me a list of tv shows which have examples of this? 

A: Yes, here are a few TV shows that have explored the ""trolley problem"" or similar ethical dilemmas:

""Black Mirror"" - This anthology series often explores the impact of technology on society, and several episodes deal with the question of whether it is justifiable to sacrifice one person for the greater good.

""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" - This series often dealt with moral dilemmas, including several episodes that involve the question of whether it is acceptable to sacrifice one person to save many.

""The Good Place"" - This comedy-drama series deals with ethical dilemmas in an afterlife setting, and one of the main characters is constantly grappling with the question of whether the ends justify the means.

""The 100"" - This post-apocalyptic science fiction series deals with a variety of moral dilemmas, and characters are often forced to make difficult choices about who should live and who should die in order to survive.

""Lost"" - This show's characters are stranded on a deserted island and are often forced to make difficult decisions about how to survive and how to allocate resources.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and other TV shows may have explored similar themes.

SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I’ve been waiting for a show to come from these books. Very excited for this.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,God damned spoiler titles! The books don’t reveal the full setting for ages and it’s a huge part of the appeal. Let’s just slam the big reveal onto the front page and screw potential readers. This frustrates me a tad. Be more aware folks.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Common will play the part of... Common.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I love that apple is making a ton of sci-fi series. Quickly going to become my favorite streaming platform
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Ugh, I really liked these books so am interested in seeing this, but probably not enough to use another streaming service"
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"oh cool, i read the series awhile ago and thought it was very original and well done."
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I strongly recommend the books. They are written as a slow reveal. Very well done.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I loved these books!
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Apple seems to be banging out sci-fi / dystopia series and I’m here for it
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Sounds like hell.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Idk the books but the cast is loaded and it's written by the guy who created and wrote Justified? HYPE!!!!!!

But tbf, this show is right up my alley. I love concepts in which society has changed by a big event. Be it 'See' where a virus killed 99% of the population and left the survivors all blind or 'The 100' where a nuclear war left the Earth uninhabitable or 'Jericho' where America is hit by multiple nukes leaving towns cut off from supply chains and so on. 

My hope would be there's a big mystery/conspiracy/mythology to the series. They don't remember what set off the post-apocalyptic event so it's more like conspiracy theories and old-wives tales and religions built out of what came before (like Christianity) melded with what they think happened (""God is punishing us for \_\_\_\_\_ so he locked us down here for 1,000 years until the Earth is a new Eden untouched by human sinners, only the pure are welcome so we must cleanse the impure."" type stuff. Then eventually someone finds out they can survive by going up and so they do and it's all about trying to survive and learning the truth about what happened from the wreckage of humanity that was left behind. 

Whether or not it's like that at all, well I'd have to go read the books Wiki to find out."
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I love post apocalyptic content so much.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,This actually sounds cool
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Ooh loved the book got completely hooked. Glad it’s getting an adaptation
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,they making a show out of this? I loved the books!
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I’m glad they’re making this as a TV series and someone didn’t want to make it as a film trilogy. I think the episodic format fits the Silo series well.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Ove read this series, looking forward to this."
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Post apocalypse seems to be the heavy favourite for Apple TV sci-fi …do they know something we should know?
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Great series! I hope they have the budget to do it justice.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Common is a legit compelling actor
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Great books. Glad to see it’s getting made.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"This concept sounds a lot like the situation mankind finds itself in during the matrix films, which in turn, has me itching for a sci fi show set in the world of the matrix, have it set before the first film following the humans who make up Zion and their struggles both in and out of the matrix with episodes dedicated to flashbacks during the second renaissance and the machine war, give it a giant budget like game of thrones and you could easily have one of the best sci fi television shows ever made, the matrix is so full of content."
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Great books! Was wondering if they would ever turn into a series or film. Will be looking forward to this!
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Common is great. His music is amazing and love watching him act.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Yes!!! Love this trilogy!!
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Awesome had no idea they were doing wool!
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Oh, this makes my day.  Cheers to Hugh Howey."
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Damn...I absolutely loved the book, this is exciting"
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I absolutely loved Common in Smokin Aces. He will kill it.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,[deleted]
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,I’m still waiting for more utopian science-fiction like Star Trek was. I think I’m living on the wrong planet.
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Let’s go! Apple is making lots of good sci fi stuff and I love it
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,So it’s a common cast in a star filled series?
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Sooooo….Fallout????
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,"Oh, basically this is Fallout"
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,so its just like the 100 ?
SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesnt Exist,Seems like a played out premise.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I've only watched the first four episodes but so far I have been laughing out loud throughout all of them.  I really wasn't sure what to expect out of this show because of the weird marketing behind it but I have been very happily surprised by how funny and joke heavy it has been.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,You got my attention. Any show that can be compared favorably to Police Squad! must be worth checking out. 
Crisis: Special Security Squad,[deleted]
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"it reminds me of Sledge Hammer.
"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Until this weekend, I had no idea what this show was and certainly no clue it was a spoof police show. I really thought some network had cast Rashida Jones in a basic cable cop show.

I must now watch all of this thing."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I was dying at the first scene of episode 1 where it's Angie's morning routine omg
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I watched probably 6 or 7 episodes during the binge-a-thon and was laughing out loud through most of it.  Also Officer Hoffman was adorable.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I have them all recorded. Looking forward to watching them.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,It is simply awful.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Like an American version of touch of cloth. In that its not as funny and it lampoons cop dramas. 

The chase scene is a carbon copy of touch of cloth though, which is much funnier. I would link but I'm on mobile"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"It's been enough jokes landing per minute that I just end up getting caught up in laughing through out the show.   
That said,  for whatever reason ep 8 just killed me it was so funny. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Wait, I hadn't recorded the bingeathon because I was worried it'd fill my DVR too much, is there any way to watch the first season before? "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I can't get a straight answer on this. I've heard some stories saying that, but the listings on my cable and TBS.com say S1E1 is on next Monday. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Not the second season.. 1st season weekly episodes will air now,for those who missed the bingeathon"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"""No, it's not a silencer. This little doodad is my own invention. I call it a loudener."""
Crisis: Special Security Squad,[Sledge Hammer - Baby Kidnapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5mf7WCfcas)
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Oh, god. The British are SOOO much better at everything than the Americans. Excuse me while I go sip on some tea and eat a crumpet, muh lord."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,http://www.tbs.com/shows/angie-tribeca.html
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I have Verizon FiOS and they had the episodes up immediately after they aired OnDemand.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Same thing with me. I'm sure they'll change it.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,It's really Season 2. They are airing it like it is 10 seasons instead of one more season of 10.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Pretty sure it is season 2. That's why the whole season 1 binge thing is so unique.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Here's the scene -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B67xhWEOVlA

In my opinion funnier than the scene from Angie Tribeca"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"My bad.. Yes, you are right.. From 25th second season will air."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,DC Film acknowledging the CW in any capacity is an interesting turn of events after pretending it didn't exist for the last three years.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Yet another Super hero show I'll have to watch.  I like the current CW duo, but there's definite room for improvement.  What really excites me is the DCCU, which finally appears ready to crank out some quality competition to the MCU. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I know about legends of tomorrow, but what's this dawn of the justice league special?"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,it's centrally is the golden age of tv if even the CW is getting attention from DC and producing tv shows that don't make me feel like vomiting
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Great! Can't wait to see it in the Internet the next day and shrug with an audible ""meh"""
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Andrew Kreisberg said on the Kevin Smith podcast how big of a deal it was that they were allowed to add ""DC's"" to the legends of tomorrow title. It's pretty cool DC is internally pretty cool with all their different properties and this is a sign of solidarity."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Ezra Miller has a big shoe to fill after cws flash. 
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Yeah, it was pretty interesting that CW had a two-night crossover event and DC didn't have anything to show from their movies.  Wasn't the BvS trailer shown on Kimmel the same night as the Flash?"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,They did a batman trailer with Gotham this year 
Crisis: Special Security Squad,This. They should raise the budgets for the shows even though they probably don't need it.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"True. 

I just finished Jessica Jones and Daredevil their seasons are quite limited but great storytelling. However, with DC's deal with CW we get moaaar.

Also, I'm quite excited that it seems like their building the latter half of the Justice League (Green Arrow; Hawkman; Hawk Girl; Flash; and J'onn J'onzz)"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,It's about DC's upcoming movies.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,DC also has to realize that while their huge production companies come out with flops the CW has continuously turned out great DC programming. DC owes a lot to the CW for its amazing handling of their content.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Good thing Ezra is a far better actor than Grant. Grant is great as Barry but Ezra is the better actor. Period.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I don't know who Jimmy Kimmel got in his pockets, but he seems to get all the big trailers for his show."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,increasing the show's budget wouldn't help with their abysmal writing quality 
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"DC (Warners bro) owns part of CW

And supergirl for now has no connection to the CW"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Is it just like a talking head documentary thing or is it a narrative thing?
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I have to agree with this. There's a reason Grant is on TV and Ezra is in movies. 

That said, I'm still a bit skeptical about Ezra as Barry Allen. Though his excitement about the role in that one video made me excited to see his interpretation. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Yeah, it's not even close. They didn't pick Grant because he just isn't good enough to star in a movie like this"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Opinions, etc.

You can't just say someone is better than someone else and then end it with ""period"" like you get the final say.

EDIT: If acting was an objective thing, then there wouldn't be a Best Actor Academy Award. We'd just all agree that one was the best and it would go to him/her immediately. If you can somehow judge that in an objective capacity, you should contact the Academy Awards people ASAP."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"On the flash the writing is pretty good, even more as it is a 24 episode show. Sure there is the drama between live interest, but it was mostly concentrated in season 1. And still, it wasn't such a big deal. At the end of the day, it's one of the show that kept me wondering about lots of stuff.

Of course it's not really on the same level as, say, Mr.Robot or Fargo and such, but it doesn't have the same goal.

And if it's about arrow, I gotta say I agree, but think it will get better, at least as it was before."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"While I like the shows, I'm inclined to agree. Nothing about the writing is ever fresh or clever. It always feels very tryhard and hamfisted. And the way they push relationships is annoying and very CW, which is not a good thing. I honestly don't see how people say Flash's writing is better than Arrow's. Their writing both feel the exact same and you can especially tell this when they crossover."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Writing is fucking shit.

Edit: It is."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,A documentary more or less with clips from the films and cast/crew interviews.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"They didn't pick Grant cause they don't want to mix Movie with TV, which is fine, cause then there is the multiverse. :P"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Eh. I'll agree Ezra is a better actor but he's not going to be able to pull off Barry Allen, at least not as good as Grant does. I just don't see it in him."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,">You can't just say someone is better than someone else and then end it with ""period"" like you get the final say.

Of course you can. He/she just did. Clearly it was an opinion and one doesn't have to write ""I think"" or ""imo"" for people to understand that. You're just being pedantic."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Arrow's writing really wasn't very good before, people were just starved for any halfway decent super hero show. 

Frankly, with the way Marvel / Netflix is copying CW and DC's tv strategy, and still doing it better despite the years CW/DC had over them, I don't really have much faith that Arrow is gonna get better, or at least good enough to still keep interest down the line."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Get ready for 20 minutes of ""coming up... the new trailer"" by a gravelly voiced announcer followed by a 2-minute trailer."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Indeed, in DC they actually have a lot of paradox issues. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I think he will much better than Grant. Grant was such a pretty boy soft choice. Don't get me wrong, he's fine, but he's very much a ""CW Flash"" IMO."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I think Ezra will be fine. Whether he is better or worse, it's just going to be different. People didn't think Grant Gustin would be a great Barry Allen when he was announced, but now he is all people can think of.

I think it's great that they have 2 flashes, cause they can do things on the TV show that the movie can't and vise versa."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Idk Grant does a good job on that show but that isn't Barry Allen, just like as good as the dude who plays Arrow is, it isn't Ollie. Neither character is written like their proper comic part"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,">Frankly, with the way Marvel / Netflix is copying CW and DC's tv strategy, 

The Netflix shows are adapting their movies strategy to TV. "
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Very cool.  I went down this rabbit hold a few years ago.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"This is incredible! Thank you! A few years ago I started looking for an anime that aired on KTEH during this period. I was into Tenchi Muyo! and tuned in on what I think was a Sunday night expecting to watch it. I was around 12 and ended up seeing the ending (last 10 to 20 minutes) of a series or movie that's haunted me since then..

I've been going through this list, looking up episode synopses and going through episodes that are up on Youtube, but I'm not finding what I'm looking for so far, and there are things I've ruled out due to watching them as an adult.

I was wondering how much knowledge you have of the anime on this list. If I described those final scenes, would you possibly be able to tell me if you recognized what it was from? This has been bugging me for decades now"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Thanks for putting in the work!  Helped me nail down the specific dates for the recordings I had.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I happened to stumble upon this looking up KTEH. It will be 20 years since the last anime on KTEH/KQED in about 2 months. Crazy time flies by.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,That's amazing. I remember watching a few these shows as a kid.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I'm willing to try or can ask around!
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Happy to help!!
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Happy to bring back fond memories!
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Thanks for your willingness on top of all the work you've already done! I appreciate it immensely!! 

I'll start from the final scene because it's probably clearest in my mind.  

A spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere, and you see a group of very early humans in a field - I think with spears and loincloths - looking up at it in confusion or awe. I remember what was possibly a voiceover (or someone on the spacecraft?) saying something along the lines of how people are getting a second chance with this new planet and basically not to destroy it like they did the last one. 

I'm pretty sure after that the credits rolled. 

The part before that is a bit more confused.

When I turned on the TV I remember seeing a girl (preteen or teen?) in some sort of institution or school surrounded by a serene forested area. It was evening and the whole atmosphere was pretty dark. She was outside and I think she was doing some sort of chore or may have come into contact with a young man.

Suddenly some sort of disaster begins to take place, something like an earthquake or sounds of explosions, and I saw that the natural forested environment was actually contained either underground or inside a building, sort of Truman Show style.  The disaster happening is originating on the outside of the walls of that enviornment. I remember something like fire bursting through vents which were, I think, previously disguised to blend into the natural forest scenery. There is wildlife fleeing. The girl is frantic and trying to find an escape then somehow gets through to the other side of the walls - I don’t remember if it was through a door or some kind of ventilation system. On the other side there was a very modern looking city with skyscrapers that was being totally destroyed. I think it's on fire or being blown up.

Then there was a spacecraft with some people on it that leaves the planet. I don't remember whether or not the girl was on it, but the next scene is the first one I described where the ship enters Earth's atmosphere. 

This all happened very quickly, probably in the final 10 to 20 minutes of the anime. My impression at the time was that it was a movie because the ending seemed to have a finality to it, but if course I could be wrong. 

Thank you so much for reading all that. I hope it made enough sense.  I'm still going through the doc you posted but so far I haven't found it!"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I totally appreciate it
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"By the way, anyone who is a fan of Warehouse 13 NEEDS to watch a miniseries called The Lost Room. It has the same premise as Warehouse 13 but imagine if the artifacts weren't contained but different groups had control of them and were vying for power."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I liked the show, but when they did the time travel/alt timeline thing it went a little more dramatic and just didn't click for me... other than that, I liked it."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,There's a scene I still remember to this day. Rarely have I laughed that hard from a movie or tv show. I don't remember the context but the sheriff got electrocuted or something going in to or leaving an elevator. Hilarious show overall!
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Eureka. I watched the whole show but I have forgotten just about everything. Even reading your description nothing clicks about it in my brain. It was a fun but unmemorable show for me even back then. I used to watch it while doing some homework for class.

But Warehouse 13 was really good. I loved that show for a while."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Eureka didn't know what exactly it wanted to be so it never embraced a style and stuck with it. The show really suffered for that as they picked up and dropped plots and characters constantly trying to find their footing.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,">Just finished Eureka and I LOVED IT!!! Here's my review

You buried the lead. [Jo Lupo](https://www.google.com/search?q=jo%20lupo%20eureka&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CAEQpwVqFwoTCJCQyIOO0vACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAC&biw=1690&bih=861)"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I was rooting for Fargo and Claudia!
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"I just finished a rewatch myself. 

Tess was ruined because the actress got a leading job in another show IIRC.  But I definitely preferred her to Allison.

Larry was amazing!  I hated him at first, but the recurring donut gag was hilarious.

Parrish sucked, but honestly Wheaton kinda exuded charisma in that role which made him enjoyable."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Yeah I think this show will always be one of my favorites to come back and watch. It's just so wholesome to watch.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"If you like Eureka and Warehouse 13, try The Librarians."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Ok what's the run time of each individual episode?
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Hmmmm i don't recall that, he got electrocuted several others times, but I dont recall in an elevator. I know i should know EXACTLY what your talking about since I just finished it lol but I dont recall any electrocution in an elevator. Do you remember if anyone was with him?"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,It was the episode with the high school science fair. There was newly installed gravity plating in the floor.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Picked up and dropped character constantly?? Umm I disagree on constantly
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Huh?
Crisis: Special Security Squad,Already did
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"It's 6 episodes 45 minutes each, so 4 1/2 hours total."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Hmm just saw this reply in my messages, but ok, I do remember that episode, but can't picture him being electrocuted.

Ohhhhh wait, I think I just found that scene on YouTube, if its the right scene it wasnt electrocution which is why I was confused."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,They're saying sexy lady sexy.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,How? How does burying the lead mean sexy?
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"burying the lead means did not put the most important thing first.  

They are saying Jo Lupo is the most important thing about the show."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Ohh ok I kind of figured that, but I never said the way the names were listed was in any particular order which is why i was confused why they said that."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Product placement. American shows show basically nothing without being paid by the company they show. They can demand large numbers because they're shown all over the world and the US itself is over 330 million people with a lot of money to spend on this stuff. Other countries have smaller international presence and smaller local population. So they either don't expect a product placement payment at all or will accept a smaller one.


Yes, the American ones could take a smaller number because it's better than zero, right? Nope, because next time that becomes the baseline to negotiate and you're looking for more."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Those ‘fictionalised’ shows are actually Linux. It’s easy to make it look like anything you want. You want a scifi setup, use Linux. You want a machine to look like Windows/MacOS, use Linux.

Dead easy to skin, free, no license required. You’ll probably find those European shows are also using Linux. :)

[Edit] I know someone that builds interfaces for films and TV shows."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"It's always so lame and obvious when you see a cut to the computer screen and the mouse is moving slowly and deliberately to an icon and then clicking on it. Like, that's not how people use a mouse. Just use a real mouse, audiences understand what's happening."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Licensing is probably part of it, but also Hollywood has continually demonstrated that they don’t think highly of Americans and think that Americans need to be babysat. Hence, large bold fonts, unrealistically large interface elements, etc.

(Also why “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” was renamed to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” for the US, and why it was “Ford v Ferrari” in the US but “Le Mans ‘66” in Europe.)"
Crisis: Special Security Squad,I work in television post production and this is largely the reason.
Crisis: Special Security Squad,[deleted]
Crisis: Special Security Squad,You think Hollywood thinks people will have an easier time understanding make believe interfaces than the ones they use literally every day of their lives?
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"> (Also why “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” was renamed to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” for the US, and why it was “Ford v Ferrari” in the US but “Le Mans ‘66” in Europe.)

the US isn't the only country where Le Mans '66 was called Ford v Ferrari. there was a copyright issue iirc."
Crisis: Special Security Squad,"Wait, you don't think that money is changing hands? That's just patently false and I have no clue what would even make you think that. All you have to do is see all the times the products are there, even mentioned by name, and zero cross promotion. Most times."
Baka and Test,Damn. What a sad downward spiral Bam has had.
Baka and Test,Damn. My older brother went through the same thing. He died. Being placed on the ventilator was all they could do for him. His heart stopped eventually.
Baka and Test,Detoxing while on a ventilator with pneumonia and COVID sounds like an extra special slice of hell.
Baka and Test,Going from one of the biggest MTV stars to not even being allowed in the new movie has been a terrible spiral. His demons got the best of him. I hope he recovers from this and get the help he needs.
Baka and Test,"That is not good, survival chances after being placed on a vent are poor. 

&#x200B;

>reported mortality rates range from 50 to 97% in those requiring mechanical ventilation"
Baka and Test,Someone let Hulk Hogan know ASAP
Baka and Test,I hope he recovers and sees this as a turning point in his life. I would love to watch him pull a Steve-O
Baka and Test,Yeah that's not good especially when your health is not already the greatest. Crazy a lot of us adults now wanted to be like Bam growing up.
Baka and Test,[deleted]
Baka and Test,The Epically Later'd episode documents the whole story pretty well.
Baka and Test,was he vaccinated?
Baka and Test,"Alcoholism is a curse to the world. We lost our 52 years old cousin to it in October. It literally breaks my heart because a year and a half ago, we were all dancing at my brothers wedding (baraat)"
Baka and Test,Covid vaccine is the only drug he won't take.
Baka and Test,"Every now and then i think about how Ryan Dunns death really just broke Bam. Ill never forget seeing him crying on the side of the road,  and the following decent into madness and depression.  Poor Bam 😔 we all have demons but this man's truly haunted by something dark"
Baka and Test,He is going to go through DTs. It’s not going to be a fun time for him now.
Baka and Test,Bam was always a fucking idiot. His fans grew up. He didn't.
Baka and Test,Why does every article about Bam use photos from a decade ago? He doesn't look like that anymore.
Baka and Test,I’m bam margera and this is Covid 19 unvaxxed
Baka and Test,"“Free bam movement” - always interesting to see when fans believe they know what’s best for a celebrity, when we likely know only a portion of what’s going on"
Baka and Test,"I just want to put this out there because I always see everyone saying it’s too bad Ryan Dunn died because that’s what led bam to addiction and to spiral out of control. Like he was straight edge with his shit together before that happened. It might’ve sped up the decline and it might’ve been the final nail in the coffin but bam was fucked up way before Ryan died. He just hid it all better. Maybe when Ryan died he said fuck it and just stopped caring to try and hide everything. 

I’m saying this because this is such a common belief and bam himself is using Ryan’s death as an excuse to why he’s fucked up and to stay fucked up. Everyone needs to stop letting him use his friends death as an excuse to stay fucked up or he’s just going to continue to take the easy road instead of working on his problems. 

There’s not much we can do as the public except to stop giving him the excuse he’s been using for years. I say all this as an addict myself."
Baka and Test,"Ventilators are never a good sign, obviously. I've had far too many experiences with familial loss in the past 5 years, I've seen enough ventilators to last my whole life. :("
Baka and Test,Update on his instagram he is recovering well and will be discharged soon.
Baka and Test,Had a mutual friend in school. Found out he passed away. Talked to my buddy about him and he said “he kept drinking and not taking care of himself” he said to my buddy while having drinks in his favorite bar “I’m gonna die right here on this bar stool”. He died shortly after on that bar stool.
Baka and Test,Surely this cannot be the first time Bam Margera has contracted covid. Kinda seems like the person who would've gotten it on purpose just to prove a point in a series of very embarrassing vlogs.
Baka and Test,I saw bam at the Palm Springs airport with his family in March 2020. He just had a blank expression on his face and seemed lifeless. Remember feeling sad like I had seen an old time friend not doing well at all.
Baka and Test,Worst Cumtown guest ever
Baka and Test,Somehow most wouldn't be surprised he wasn't taking precautions.
Baka and Test,"If people haven't seen Brandon Novak and you want a recovery story. He's doing really well and I thought helping bam

https://instagram.com/brandon__novak?igshid=YzdkMWQ2MWU="
Baka and Test,"My cousins s/o was on a vent with pneumonia for about a month, but it wasn’t covid related. It was the most heartbreaking time. He passed away in June. My heart still aches for her and his family. It was absolutely a last resort for him."
Baka and Test,"Ahhh fuck, I hope he pulls through :("
Baka and Test,"I met him in a bar a couple weeks ago in Sarasota, he was a sweetheart, this is sad news"
Baka and Test,"I want to say good luck to Bam, however, his alcohol abuse, and probably drugs too, is probably going to end up killing him. I hope it doesn’t,and I hope he makes a full recovery and gets his life back on track, but let’s be real….he’s not the healthiest person to make it through Covid Pneumonia"
Baka and Test,Get your Covid shots
Baka and Test,I really do hope he pulls through and this wakes him up. On a positive if he pulls through is this will at least temporarily sober him up but whether he stays sober is entirely on him. Novak and Steve-o have apparently both tried to help him but until he wants to actually change there's nothing anyone else can do for him.
Baka and Test,"the only sympathy i have is for his parents and his close friends. other than that, he put himself in this position, multiple times. his poor mom has done literally everything for him, same as his dad. they’re good people, he is not."
Baka and Test,"once you're on a ventilator it's a coin flip

I can't stress enough that you have to keep up with your vaccines. I know people who are pro vaccine who have been slacking on getting theirs. The new Omicron one is very important right now. Even that one is showing weak results against the new variants. But it's way better than the originals and booster.

COVID variants and this RSV thing going around is looking very scary in terms of hospitalizations again."
Baka and Test,Hoping he will be ok. Decades of severe alcoholism has really done a number on bam.
Baka and Test,When fucking Steve-O is saying you’ve gone too far and you need help…is there a level past rock-bottom that isn’t dead?
Baka and Test,"He legit seems like a less than nice person, but the dude has made me laugh so much I hurt myself. I wish him well."
Baka and Test,"I have a strong feeling, given Margera's likely weaked immune system from being a hardcore alcoholic, among other things, he won't survive this situation.  I hope he does, but this just feels like it will be the end of his crash and burnout."
Baka and Test,Bruuuh I snorted coke for two years.. thought I would never stop.. had a son and I totally quit cold Turkey.. couldn’t have him see me like that. It’s been about a year and I haven’t completely ridden myself of the shit friends I had well the one is my neighbor.. (he supplied most of the action). I still have no desire to get highs in that way i will smoke some bud but that is it I love my son so whatever will make a better father in his eyes I’m gonna do it
Baka and Test,"Yikes, being on a ventilator is really fucking bad. Either his quality of life is going to drop once he’s off that thing or he’s going to die"
Baka and Test,I couldn’t think of a worse combination
Baka and Test,"I met him at a skate contest in the 90s in Europe. He was super cool, but totally mental on the board"
Baka and Test,"Dammit Bam, this ain’t the way to peace out. Rally and find your way back into the light."
Baka and Test,[UPDATE: Negative for COVID](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl-ZLqIOeoz/?igshid=N2ZiY2E3YmU=)
Baka and Test,"> The former “Jackass” star was admitted earlier this week in San Diego was a serious case of pneumonia

No time to proof read. POST POST POST!"
Baka and Test,Damn should’ve gotten vaccinated
Baka and Test,"I'm gonna say it, Bam looks like the kind of guy who wouldn't get vaccinated."
Baka and Test,R.I.P.
Baka and Test,He was a pretty well documented anti vaxxer too
Baka and Test,Surprised he didn’t test positive for anything else looking like that
Baka and Test,Looks like he wiped his ass with the back of his hand
Baka and Test,"I saw a clip he posted about dealing with addiction.  It’s sad because he knows he has a problem, but he just can’t overcome it.

Hopefully he gets through this and it gives him a new lease on life."
Baka and Test,Tiny hands
Baka and Test,The Demon of West Chester
Baka and Test,"I feel for him, I really do. I had Covid-19 and pneumonia last year, in hospital about a week, sick for 2-3 weeks. Still don’t feel completely better."
Baka and Test,Someone needs to take care of this dude. This is what you get when someone is suicidal but (thankfully) not able to take to take their own life.
Baka and Test,"F*ck. After growing up watching and emulating this dude and his friends my entire teenage life (this was all before Dunn died and he really started to lose it), reading this breaks my heart. I was really rooting for him to get some kind of control over his addictions and come back. At least to some degree. I figured Steve-O did it so surely Bam would follow suit eventually. 

I know his situation is pretty grim, but I just wanted to come here to say- I really hope he survives this and it’s what he needs to finally turn his life around. 

Godspeed, Bam Margera"
Baka and Test,Who?
Baka and Test,Crazy what can happen when you don’t prioritize your heath even a little bit. Anyway have a good day everyone!
Baka and Test,Fuck this is Bad. Bams downward spiral these last years has been frightening. I imagine now aside from all this his body will be going through Alcohol withdrawals too.
Baka and Test,"I make a lot of dumb decisions but being fully vaccinated was definitely not one of them

I hope he pulls through love Jackass!!"
Baka and Test,[removed]
Baka and Test,Hope he recovers. He was great in Tony Hawk Underground.
Baka and Test,"Cmon Bam, pull through buddy."
Baka and Test,"Not even a sentence in and they somehow managed to sneak in a typo. Jesus Christ 🤣 hope Bam pulls through tho. With everything, physical mental and everything in between. He helped raise me as a kid!"
Baka and Test,Covid is so destructive to our bodies and his body has been through so much already.
Baka and Test,I think some people (e.g. Brittney Spears) are just so fried that they aren’t coming back. Sadly I think Bam falls into this category as well.
Baka and Test,This is why people need to get vaccinated.
Baka and Test,This dude has had so many demons. I just hope he find peace within himself
Baka and Test,If only there was a way he could have protected himself…
Baka and Test,is he anti-vaxxer?
Baka and Test,"Honestly, I always figured overdosing would be the thing to get him."
Baka and Test,"He’s been through so much and on such an endless downward spiral, that I feel bad that I thought he had already long died."
Baka and Test,"Godspeed, Bam"
Baka and Test,Oh shit...
Baka and Test,I honestly thought he was already dead
Baka and Test,just getting over covid now kinda like a 2 week flu fml
Baka and Test,He will not live a long life
Baka and Test,"My uncle died like this from COVID a couple of months ago. ☹️ Of course he wasn’t well to begin with, he had Parkinson’s. Still I hope he is okay."
Baka and Test,Vent=death with COVID most times
Baka and Test,"He's just trying to die so he can prank Phil again, this is gonna be great!"
Baka and Test,"A couple of years ago, being put on a ventilator while sick with covid was basically a death sentence... I hope that he comes thru and maybe, somehow, gets his life in some kind of order..."
Baka and Test,Oh no. That’s the way my dad went. :(
Baka and Test,That’s what killed my friend a couple months ago. COVID that led to deadly pneumonia.
Baka and Test,"""Hi I'm Bam Margera and this is Jackass. This ones called the Covid-10 No Mask/No Vaccine Challenge."""
Baka and Test,"Yikes.

Guess that autographed copy of Elementality is gonna be worth something now.

But in all seriousness, I grew up watching Bam, he's part of why I got a job at a skate shop in college. This is terrible news, I hope he pulls through. It would be great if this *was* his wake up call, but I'm afraid for him, that it won't work out that way."
Baka and Test,"I’ve never been a fan, but I hope he pulls through. We’re all human."
Baka and Test, I figured he would OD not die from COVID — hopefully he will pull through
Baka and Test,"Man, I always hoped he would turn his life around it’s sad seeing someone who you thought of as a role model in your early 20’s live a sad life when the guy has tons to live for as he ages."
Baka and Test,It's no doubt gonna be coupled with alcohol withdrawal. That's not going to be fun. Hoping he gets better
Baka and Test,Dudes gonna die 🤷‍♀️ as soon as that ventilator gets involved it’s over
Baka and Test,Im Bam Magera and this is Covid Death Watch.
Baka and Test,Hard to feel bad for the guy. Hate it for his friends/family though.
Baka and Test,I thought he died years ago
Baka and Test,"Once you’re vented, the chances of you coming off are slim to none. Id be very, very surprised if he gets extubated."
Baka and Test,Anyone know if he was vaccinated?
Baka and Test,I'm surprised pneumonia is what has slowed him down... Dude has been on a tear for ages now.
Baka and Test,"Question is, was he vaccinated? Don't think they made a reference to this right?"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"For any of you seeing this saying “What’s the Owl House? Should I have known about this? Is it any good?” the answers to your questions are “One of the best cartoons ever made, accessible to adults and kids alike. Not necessarily, Disney undermarketed it due to disputes with the creator over things like lgbt inclusion, only to discover that when it hit streaming it steadily accrued a massive fan base through word of mouth. And yes, it is very good.”"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Unfortunately, thanks to iTunes and Disney Channel's continued ineptitude... the episode leaked 16 days early.

So a word a warning to those who still can:

#**AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS**"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"This post really makes me sad, since it highlights the poor marketing Disney is giving the series. 

It's been [known](https://twitter.com/DisneyAPromos/status/1600624288855658496) for nearly a month, yet there are still people out of the loop/it wasn't established enough to get hype. This, coupled with iTunes leaking it, will hurt it when it ultimately airs."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Looking forward to this. Will be terribly sorry to see the show end though, it really hit a hell of a stride."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,[removed]
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Neat. Can't wait.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,S3 taking so long to drop and in 3 chunks makes me just give up on it. It's not as good as Amphibia or GF but it sucks S3 is getting such a shit treatment.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Didn’t they cancel it?
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I would also argue that the latter half of S2 was as true an heir to the good episodes of Buffy as I've seen. The sense of genuine desperation against the terribly high stakes hits that same bittersweet note.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"It's very weird to me how persistently iTunes Canada, specifically, leaks *everything*, from Disney shows to indie albums. I used to be a music blogger, when that existed, and they were *notorious* for it even then."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Do not go on YouTube and any socal media storm since there are filled with spoilers for that special!
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"What ever you do, stay off the internet for the next two weeks. The special got and people are already posting screenshots and reuploads."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Sort of, but yeah. Instead of an actual season 3, there are three final extra long specials to wrap up. 

This one is the second of the three, and then there will be one final later one."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,What GoT intro did right was orient you to the world of Westeros/Esso with key locations and important houses. I think HotD was trying to show the Targeryen bloodline but I wish they made it easier to understand
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"This was honestly the biggest surprise of the episode to me, I was expecting a grand new theme to at least somewhat separate this series but nope...same intro/main theme."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Did you get the impression there would be a lot of blood? I felt like they were hinting at that. Couldn’t quite place it though, you?"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I think they are going the route of having a ""familiar"" sound to tie everything together. If someone chooses to watch the GoT universe in chronological order, it will just feel like it's all one show."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,This episode was incredible
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I imagine Ramin Djawadi working on a new opening theme for weeks and months trying to outperform his previous work and then going “nope. Fuck this, let’s go with the old one”"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Hearing it again felt like I was stepping back into a toxic relationship.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I think it’s great. It ties it in and makes it feel like it’s all part of the same universe. Like you are watching the same GOT show you loved, but just with different characters. Like they a made a new season of GOT and set it as a prequel. I love it."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I miss the days when GoT was on and was good and it felt like the whole world was collectively gathered around the TV and enjoying the same thing, I hope this series can stay consistent and capture that magic again"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,It felt amazing. Like stepping back into a comfortable pair of shoes.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I would've preferred a new theme honestly. The old one is classic but I think we've heard it enough
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,This look like a scene from Blade the movie
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,They ended the show in episode 1 with the GoT theme. Which was kind of cool. But  didn't think it was going to be the opening theme also.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"It is not *exactly* the same, to be a bit pedantic. They have edited out numerous ostinatos (the 'BUM-bum ba-ba-BUM-bum' that starts off the theme music) between each section where the melodies are heard."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Does anyone else hear weiner weiner weiner ?! No? Just me 😅
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I was kinda thinking about this because I'm learning the Westworld theme. It has an arpeggio that sounds similar to the GOT theme, which Ramin also cribbed from part of his score in the first Iron Man movie. It seems like Ramin has a habit of using some elements from his old songs for his newer songs. This time he straight up just uses the original theme. Which I honestly have no problem with. It's a great tune."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,They could’ve at least given us a new arrangement. Add some harpsichord or something.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,At first I was disappointed that they used the same theme but after a few seconds I got hit with massive nostalgia and I have to say I just love that theme and it's a good choice to use it again.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I like the familiarity! When I heard the intro/theme to GOT, it warmed my heart!"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Lol bro I was like a child on Christmas when I heard the first note. Had me giddy as fuck
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"If it's not broke, don't fix it. It's an iconic theme"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I get why they did it that way, but I still found it a little disappointing they didn’t write a new theme."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"They need to cut down the focus on the blood river by at least 50% and have the camera linger on the different sigils of the various players/factions in the Dance of Dragons. As it is right now, the intro is a mess. 

Just like the GoT intro informed you of the geography of the world and where the action will take place in the episode, the HotD needs to show you who are story will revolve around."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"*Peter, Peter, Peter Dinklage, Peter Dinklage ...*"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"It just felt weird to seemingly be the exact same recording. It makes it seem like a new season of the same show instead of something new. I'm surprised they didn't do a new arrangement of it at least to feel fresh and distinguish itself. Different voicing or layered differently, just something to help the show stand on its own. 

It isnt really surprising they used it, since the first episode had familiar music too. But if I were told they were using the same theme, I would have at least expected it to sound 200 years older in the instrumentation or something."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,this seemed so lazy on HBO’s part. This whole series is going to pander to the people who named their kids Khaleesi.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I understand why they did it like this... but this is definitely a split among the casuals and book readers.
It essentially is the family tree of the Targaryen line and has some incredible depth too. I also love the crowns that represent the different kings/queens.

Also, for the people who ask themselves: Why not the map?
This show won't visit as many places. So they would only show off like three or four towns every episode. Two of those would constantly be King's Landing and Dragonstone... while the other two would  change each episode. So 1) It would be extremely pricey. 2) It would be rather short. 3) It sets the wrong expectations."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,All I heard was wiener wiener wiener
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I'll be honest, I kind of hated it. The end of the original show left such a bad taste in my mouth that I really don't need to be reminded of it each week. Something new would have been appreciated. That said, the show itself is fantastic so far, and I did love the visuals of the intro."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I was expecting that Violin motif to be the main theme.

This wasn't a good choice for them."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Disappointed they didn't even try.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Leonard liked this post.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"It would have been nice if they used a map like the GoT intro so we could understand everything going on, like Crabfeeder’s movements, the Dornish incursions, House Velaryon’s holdings and fleet, etc…"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I'm so conflicted about watching this show at all, but the return of the music was like *damn, I remember when this music was so important to me.*  Now it's just nostalgic."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I literally was pumping my fist in excitement after speculating about the new song for the past week - I love the choice so much. The song just tugged at my heart 🥲
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I get why they did it but man I wish they had a different theme
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Ramin was too busy doing subtle covers of Radiohead songs for Westworld.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Would have preferred a new theme song
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I really did not like that they used the same song again. It felt cowardly.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,It's representative of what they're trying to accomplish with this show: nothing new.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I kinda wish they arranged a new theme just for House of the Dragons.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Was disappointed. I like the song but wanted something new.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Not a fan. I wanted a new iconic theme.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,They just ran out of time/missed a deadline and don’t care about the music. They shouldn’t be using GOT music for House of the Dragon imo. Different show.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"It’s a good theme, but I do wish that they had gone the Star Trek/L&O route with a theme that definitely harkens back to the same elements to tie things together, but different enough to stand on its own.

The visuals, though, I enjoyed.  I liked the map thing of GoT, but I also dig this thing with Viserys’ model."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Man you guys really will bitch about anything, huh?"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"You mean they cant be bothered? Wow, that really subverted my expectations"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Honestly, I think it's sad that this is where capitalism has taken art. No more new shit. Familiarity = money. We've all gotten too scared to take risks and it's made it all worse."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"They should have used a Rod Stewart song, like in Star Trek Enterprise.  Might I suggest, “The first cut is the deepest”"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"The intro was good at first, but in my opinion it was very repetitive after the first 15 seconds. The GoT opening did a great job of orienting you to the world, the different houses, and the landmarks of the world. HoTK was just blood leading to valves that lead to more blood that flowed to more valves which released more blood which led to more valves, and so on for far too long. I get what they were going for…it just left much to be desired IMO."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I think HotD King is actually building the 3D model of GoT opening credit
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I have mixed feeling after the second episode. It’s clear they’re trying to reinstall the sensations we had for the original series, but it seems forced. GoT took the time to present us a world in its first few seasons and House of Dragon relies on us  being already completely well versed- which is why the gore and political intrigue seem so rapid fire. I hope they get into place, setting, and characters in a deeper sense that the original series gave us"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. It’s an extension of the show, so let’s just tie it together with something already very familiar."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I would really like to see a series done on the Doom of Valyria
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Im very happy about this.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I was expecting a remix of the main theme. Honestly, something with heavier drums and bass."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I wouldn't have been mad at all if they just didn't bother making an intro because the first one is so hard to top. But this was a really good compromise. Just new enough but gives you that cozy nostalgia of when the original series was at its peak. 

Thrones is back, baby. They dragged me back in, kicking and screaming."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Quite the surprise but I’m not a fan. The music so far has been really strong (no shock considering it’s Ramin) so I was disappointed a new theme wasn’t composed to match the intro.

A new theme would’ve been just another tidbit to help the show standard apart from GOT’s legacy. In fact, I honestly thought The Prince Who was Promised would’ve been a great theme. 

That said, if this is the most of the shows worries? We’re in for some good television. We’re only two episodes in but they’re already hitting their marks."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,One wiener next to another wiener…
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"all i heard was some suited executive demanding brand synergy. HotD is already unmistakable enough as a thrones property, why can't it build its own status and stand on its own as well?"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I feel like it’s just to ensure people know it’s the same universe. I’m not upset by it.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Didn't like it. Didn't know what I was looking at. Watched Emergeny Awesome...explained it all. Still don't like it.

[https://youtu.be/U-zELLf92YU](https://youtu.be/U-zELLf92YU)"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,The theme is an analogy for the show itself. It's not bold or fresh. It's early to mid GoT. Nothing more. No alarms. No surprises.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"So, if I've forgotten a good bit of the GoT story since it ended, is there a video or something that will bring me up to speed for HotD? I know it's not a sequel or continuation of the story but still something to refresh the info so I'm not lost in the new show?"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I wish they had gone with something different. Would’ve cemented the series as a more separate entity. I liked the opening though.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I'll never know
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I liked it? I liked the respectful nod. I hate how untactical she is, but then it kind of makes sense."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"On one hand: it’s a different show and I feel like it should have its own theme music

On the other hand: it is frankly an iconic composition and I’m not upset to hear it again"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,[deleted]
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Needs more boobies
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Yes!
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Seemed to lazy to me that they re-used the theme…
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,The way they gave some of these people platinum hair on often peachy red-undertoned skin makes them look like uncooked chicken in sick costumes
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"They had a different theme at the opening on the first episode, with the dragons flying over the city walls. I thought that was going to be the intro, and tbh would've preferred it. A new song, using the GOT melody to anchor the new show. Anyway, didn't like the intro, and was mostly because of the song. Will be skipping from here on out."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,It’s actually seems smart to me. When I heard it felt comfortable and familiar.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Wanted it to be a surprise 😓
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,It’s an incredible theme but I was definitely disappointed they didn’t go with something new.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I was so disappointed when the first episode didnt have it.  Already this made episode 2 infinitely better
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"Only disappointing thing about the show, wish they did their own thing. Everything else has been awesome so whatevs"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,No intro first episode. Reused intro for second. Not promising.
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,I loved it
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,it was awesome - HBO doesn’t miss on opening credits
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"My biggest concern about this show is that it will play it too ""safe"" and be overly deferential to *Game of Thrones* in its aesthetics/plot/characterization. That it literally just recycles the theme song when you're employing Ramin Djawadi is a bad sign to me. I don't want a risk-averse, paint-by-numbers repeat of all the same things from the original"
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Made me feel uneasy
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I would've preferred a new theme to signal that this is it's own thing, but I guess they felt the need to hit people over the head with ""GET YOUR GOT FIX HERE"", which is understandable from a marketing perspective. The titles were abysmal though. Firstly they're murky and you can't make out what any of the knobs are, secondly they're absolutely meaningless and serve no purpose. The GoT titles were a clever device to give the viewer a grounding in the world of the story, HotD titles are a convoluted mess devoid of (discernible) meaning."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,"I was surprised, I dont like that they used the same theme for some reason."
Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Was the newest episode really boring or was I just not paying enough attention?
SHIROBAKO,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
SHIROBAKO,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
SHIROBAKO,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
SHIROBAKO,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
SHIROBAKO,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
SHIROBAKO,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
SHIROBAKO,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
SHIROBAKO,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
SHIROBAKO,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

SHIROBAKO,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
SHIROBAKO,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
SHIROBAKO,Needs more Jojo
SHIROBAKO,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
SHIROBAKO,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
SHIROBAKO,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
SHIROBAKO,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
SHIROBAKO,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
SHIROBAKO,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
SHIROBAKO,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
SHIROBAKO,Madoka magica ! 
SHIROBAKO,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
SHIROBAKO,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
SHIROBAKO,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
SHIROBAKO,Awh no your lie about in April 
SHIROBAKO,This is actually a really decent list
SHIROBAKO,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list 
SHIROBAKO,"You're forgetting

SHIROBAKO,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
SHIROBAKO,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
SHIROBAKO,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
SHIROBAKO,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
SHIROBAKO,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
SHIROBAKO,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
SHIROBAKO,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
SHIROBAKO,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
SHIROBAKO,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
SHIROBAKO,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
SHIROBAKO,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
SHIROBAKO,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
SHIROBAKO,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
SHIROBAKO,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
SHIROBAKO,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
SHIROBAKO,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
SHIROBAKO,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
SHIROBAKO,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
SHIROBAKO,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
SHIROBAKO,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
SHIROBAKO,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
SHIROBAKO,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
SHIROBAKO,Black Clover?
SHIROBAKO,.
SHIROBAKO,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
SHIROBAKO,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
SHIROBAKO,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
SHIROBAKO,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
SHIROBAKO,[deleted]
SHIROBAKO,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
SHIROBAKO,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
SHIROBAKO,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
SHIROBAKO,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
SHIROBAKO,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
SHIROBAKO,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
SHIROBAKO,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
SHIROBAKO,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
SHIROBAKO,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
SHIROBAKO,[deleted]
SHIROBAKO,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
SHIROBAKO,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
SHIROBAKO,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
SHIROBAKO,[deleted]
SHIROBAKO,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
SHIROBAKO,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
SHIROBAKO,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
SHIROBAKO,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
SHIROBAKO,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
SHIROBAKO,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
SHIROBAKO,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
SHIROBAKO,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
SHIROBAKO,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
SHIROBAKO,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
SHIROBAKO,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
SHIROBAKO,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
SHIROBAKO,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
SHIROBAKO,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
SHIROBAKO,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
SHIROBAKO,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
SHIROBAKO,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
SHIROBAKO,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
SHIROBAKO,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
SHIROBAKO,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
SHIROBAKO,This show was hilarious
SHIROBAKO,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
SHIROBAKO,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
SHIROBAKO,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
SHIROBAKO,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
SHIROBAKO,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
SHIROBAKO,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
SHIROBAKO,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
SHIROBAKO,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
SHIROBAKO,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I recently watched March comes in like a lion on Netflix. 

Technically it's about Shogi(Japanese Chess) but it's really about how an orphan with a difficult foster situation finds a second home/found family when the oldest of three sisters takes him in like a stray cat from the streets.

I think its far better then most shows I've seen at depicting depression loneliness and lasting grief (and the occasional bursts of anger https://youtu.be/6Y0dYq6ovJ8).

but it counteracts it by having some of diabetes-level sweet scenes of loving supportive family(both genetic and found family)."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
March Comes in Like a Lion,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
March Comes in Like a Lion,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

March Comes in Like a Lion,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Needs more Jojo
March Comes in Like a Lion,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
March Comes in Like a Lion,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
March Comes in Like a Lion,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
March Comes in Like a Lion,Madoka magica ! 
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Awh no your lie about in April 
March Comes in Like a Lion,This is actually a really decent list
March Comes in Like a Lion,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

March Comes in Like a Lion,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
March Comes in Like a Lion,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
March Comes in Like a Lion,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
March Comes in Like a Lion,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
March Comes in Like a Lion,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
March Comes in Like a Lion,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
March Comes in Like a Lion,Black Clover?
March Comes in Like a Lion,.
March Comes in Like a Lion,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
March Comes in Like a Lion,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
March Comes in Like a Lion,[deleted]
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
March Comes in Like a Lion,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
March Comes in Like a Lion,[deleted]
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
March Comes in Like a Lion,[deleted]
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
March Comes in Like a Lion,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
March Comes in Like a Lion,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
March Comes in Like a Lion,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
March Comes in Like a Lion,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
March Comes in Like a Lion,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
March Comes in Like a Lion,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
March Comes in Like a Lion,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
March Comes in Like a Lion,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
March Comes in Like a Lion,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
March Comes in Like a Lion,This show was hilarious
March Comes in Like a Lion,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
March Comes in Like a Lion,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
March Comes in Like a Lion,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
The Laughing Salesman,"I mean this is a fairly pragmatic view point for the good of the many, but the entire point of the finale is to confront pragmatism and idealism. Joel would rather the Fireflies fail than Ellie die. His reasons are personal, but it makes no difference to him, he wouldn't sacrifice Ellie in the same way that I probably wouldn't have the strength of will to sacrifice my child, even if it was for a greater good.

It is a controversial story beat and the debate is great! Entirely intended. I don't see a problem with it."
The Laughing Salesman,"I'm having a hard time understanding the point of your argument. This nuance to the trolley problem has been a moral dilemma that folks struggle with since ancient times. 

Are you just saying you don't enjoy philosophy that much? Or are frustrated that people don't agree with your world view? I think, as a species, we enjoy finding hyper specific situations and then wondering if we would have done the same, or if actions taken in those moments were justified. I would go so far as to say this isn't a problem in fiction, debates like this happen all the time over history. See: The dropping of the atomic bombs for one easy example.

It's just a very human question, and there's no right or wrong answer. So we have fun talking about the situations where it comes into play"
The Laughing Salesman,"Are we talking about the season ending ep’s dilemma between the life of Ellie for the cure and Joel’s choosing to protect her over saving the world, supposedly?? 

I ask, because what struck me as so needless in this dilemma and portrayed disingenuously is…..no research doc worth their salt would go with an experimental cure and plan for it, and kill the only living patient they got their hands on if they were WRONG. 

They would absolutely be wanting to keep her alive if their first best estimate failed."
The Laughing Salesman,"Well, yeah, that's the idea, Joel loves Ellie and sees her as the daughter he lost. People felt that emotional connection and put them in the ""good"" category cause it's a nice trait that they want to have, and there can't be flaws in a role model.

Never.

So, yeah, AJ was a fucking dick, no discussion there.

Also unrelated but the ""arguments"" about the doctors not knowing what they were doing is dumb af. The show itself states that's the only possible way, a doctor in the show dies trying to keep Ellie on the operation table. But suddenly everyone is a neurologist and can refute the science of a fictional show that was surrounded by the infected for 20 years

That's, again, people rationalizing Joel's decision to absolve him from any wrongdoing so he can be the good guy again, and therefore the perfect role model"
The Laughing Salesman,">If the finale had been about the Fireflies needing to dissect Sam, and Joel still went on his rampage, you would not see the moralizing ""Joel the hero!"" posting you consistently see on this sub, you would see the constant ""sacrifices need to be made and sheltered Hollywood writers can't make hard choices"" posting you see everywhere on Reddit.

Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

>If Game of Thrones presented the option that the Long Night had a chance of being averted if they burnt Olly at the stake, then everyone would want Olly burnt. 

Depends - is this before or after *he became the chief figure in a mutiny that got a beloved character and, in-universe, a competent leader killed*? If he had never become ""Fuck Olly"", then people wouldn't want to see him punished. Stannis' daughter was in the exact position you're talking about and the fanbase went fucking apeshit over her death.

>If the Sopranos presented the option that the gangs *might* leave Tony alone if he drowned AJ in the pool, everyone would want AJ drowned.

WTF? This is just wrong. Nobody has ever wanted Tony Soprano to be an even *bigger* asshole to his kids.

>This is why I think the creators got the exact reaction they wanted: When it is *demonstrably true* that fanbases will jump to immediate moralizing to defend a character they're attached to, then they're effectively in the exact same mindset as Joel. This is why I have issues with even engaging with fiction as I get older (especially in an age of anti-heroes), because at the core, the nature of media is an appeal to charisma and entertainment value.

You're talking as if the only reason people ever support anything is some kind of shallow popularity contest that they jump through hoops to justify. I wanted Joel to kill the Fireflies because they were liars who were about to do something apocalyptically stupid (kill the only known immune person on Earth) to someone without their full, informed consent. If Ellie had been told exactly what she was volunteering for and went ahead with it anyway, then it'd suck, but I wouldn't want Joel to gun down a whole hospital because it'd be objectively wrong. Hell, even the way he went about it was wrong because he didn't give Marlene the chance to wake Ellie up & come clean."
The Laughing Salesman,"Are you talking about the doctor, who had no problem killing a kid when neither he nor Firefly had any idea about the cure, into a saint that in the sequel rescues animal just to show how evil Joel is? They've made zero progress while investigating previous infected people. They apparently lost personnel at a previous research base when some idiot let infected monkeys out of the cage instead of destroying them, and the purpose of killing Ellie seems to be nothing more than getting better access to her infection on the assumption that something is different about the infection itself. 

That being a rather dubious line of reasoning they seem to have rushed into. You have the only immune human and instead of starting with things like blood tests, transfusions, they just go right to cutting out her brain. No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing, except a scan. Just carve up her brain growth and see what's up. Then the group rushes the experiment even before waking her up, not even letting Joel see her for the last time, or attempt at persuading Joel into see things from their perspective. [Watch Joseph Anderson's analysis to see how incompetent the Fireflies were.](https://youtu.be/ma4DJbvO84I?t=11151)

In retrospect, The Last of Us failed to convey two sides of hypothetical morality. The game presents an utterly incompetent group that is written like a bunch of assholes, yet it wants us to feel conflicted and bad about you going against them in the hosptial. *""Hey, we made you walk across the entire country with this girl that you'd inevitably grow close with, we didn't tell you that she was going to be disected at the end, nor are we planning on telling her. Instead we're basically gonna drug her, drug you and then cut her open and hope that we might get a functional cure... Also, we're not paying you and there's about a 60% chance that we're just gonna shoot you in the back once you leave.""* Like, how is this a conflicting choice. They are best described as untrustworthy and incapable, so even though Joel is acting for emotional reasons, the rational thing to do if you want to kill Ellie to develop a cure is to kill the Fireflies and take her elsewhere like FEDRA. There's not much of a dilemma.

The Fireflies is a shallowly written organization in terms of writing. They are not fleshed out or explored. Are you asking me to sympathize with the group because they are fighting FEDRA--the government we don't even see if they are tyrannical or not? No part of the story makes me think that maybe they’re good people forced to do morally questionable things for the betterment of humanity, especially when we barely get to know who even Marlene is. Compare this to Lady Eboshi and the Irontown from Princess Mononoke, which actually explored those two sides. Even if the story ultimately judges them to be in the wrong, it is not confused by what each side is trying to convey, how it's conveying that, and the pros and cons of each side's method.

And I had hoped they execute this part better in the show. Instead, they made them even dumber."
The Laughing Salesman,"I’m not defending Joel when I say people shouldn’t scoop a kids brains out without telling the kid and with no guarantee of success.

I probably wouldn’t go mass shooter since I wouldn’t know how, but one can easily side with the moral dilemma and not think Joel is a hero for the tough choice."
The Laughing Salesman,[removed]
The Laughing Salesman,"He was ultimately selfish, which makes him a realistic character. He has done bad things before sometimes to survive and perhaps even sometimes just for benefitting from it when he could have walked away, that's his character. he chose to save Elie because she gave him a reason to live beyond just survival.

He made the selfish choice to kill all of those people, and potentially humanity, over losing his ""daughter"" for his own benefit more so than for Ellies.. 

but pragmatically speaking the fireflies should have been impregnating women and getting them infected to recreate multiple Ellies rather than wait 14-16 years. Kind of bleak and morbid and evil to do, but pragmatically speaking it would have yielded better outcomes as I assume the virus being in a baby or a teenager would not matter. Again i know morbid and evil."
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not about the show, it's about the repetitive nature of the debate and the double standards applied over the course of an entire decade. I genuinely don't like engaging with it because I really get the sense that human beings only care about characters insomuch as they find them entertaining and charming, which is nihlistic in my view."
The Laughing Salesman,Well also you wouldn’t need to kill the patient to get the T cells needed for a vaccine
The Laughing Salesman,"Yeah, the Last of Us is not written super well at points. I said this when I was 14 and I still say this at age 24. But there's a difference between narrative execution and narrative intent. The idea presented within was supposed to be that Joel sacrificed a potential chance at a cure for (selfish) love, and for the audience to debate who they sympathize with in the scenario. Instead, the fanbase just debates semantics and moves goalposts. The line of defense in 2013 was

>oh, well, they're extremely vague about their methods of cure, so it won't work

And then the series explains the chemical messenger thing and the debate then shifts to

>well the Fireflies don't have access to infrastructure to build a cure so the whole thing's a bust"
The Laughing Salesman,"Oh my god I’m so glad someone said this. People critiquing the fireflies really bend over backwards and are suddenly medically trained professionals while ignoring that the information WE know from watching, is not what the world knows…. 

WE may know the cure probably wouldn’t have worked because WE saw the mycologist in episode 2 explain there is no vaccine for fungus. One lady in Jakarta who was bombed shortly after and didn’t get the chance to speak with anyone. Not to mention that so many of the medical breakthroughs of the last 20 years we know they went without. Time and knowledge stopped for them in 2003! Stop judging them by 2023 science!! 

THEN the fact that people think it was pointless because of the medical infrastructure. I’d hate to be in the apocalypse with those people because nothing would be good enough or worth trying since we don’t have creature comforts we’re used to anymore."
The Laughing Salesman,"> Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

Note how you didn't have a response to the Ben/Clem thing, because I feel like it outright proves my point."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"Yeah, I enjoyed the show, but I think the game benefitted from its limitations. Less is more, sometimes."
The Laughing Salesman,"They were never planning to wait 14 years. Joel kills their research scientist less than 9 months after anyone realizes Ellie is immune, no one knew she was until the Riley incident. For all we know, they were impregnating women and planning to do this, and decided to use Ellie because she was there before any baby and they weren’t sure infecting pregnant women would work — who knows what the time window has to be, after all? They don’t even know that’s the cause of Ellie’s immunity — Marlene was told Anna has already cut the umbilical cord before being bitten, so all they’ve got is a theory about what *maybe* happened, and if it happened *maybe* caused the immunity, and which *might* be reproducible, and no idea of how long they’d have to wait to cut the cord to get that effect. From a researcher’s POV it’s still definitely worth getting your hands on Ellie, who’s confirmed immune and can be examined right now."
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not characters, it's how people engage with the world in general. It's only natural for people to favor who they have emotional bonds with. We don't care about strangers or the harm that comes to them nearly as much. And of course there are double standards, humans are full of contradictions. Not just in fiction, but in life. We're not robots, everything we do is subjective and varies based on our feelings at any given moment. Sure, we try to be consistent, but often fall short of doing so. 

I guess I don't understand your comment and point further than ""I dislike prevalent human nature"""
The Laughing Salesman,"They weren’t looking for T cells tho. They are thinking the fungus primarily grows in the brain so to get it from her and synthesize they’d have to kill her to harvest her brain

But medically, this doesn’t hold up. and obviously being untried they’d wanna keep her alive to find another way if the first way didn’t pan out

Sry for typos. I have lost my reading glasses nd can’t replace them till tomorrow"
The Laughing Salesman,"Also, I didn’t take it Joel acted out of selfish love only. He has remarked with sadness she’s never had the chance to have a life. That’s thinking of her and what it’s like for her"
The Laughing Salesman,"I didn't have a response to Ben/Clem because I never played that far in those games, so I'm responding to the rest of the points you made because I'm familiar with them and wouldn't have to guess or be talking out of my ass.

Your overall point seems to be ""if anyone isn't completely in love with a character, they will act like total sociopaths towards them"" and that's horrifying.

>My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

You're saying that the audience would support child murder simply because it's a different innocent kid with less character development. I know there's a subset of every fandom that is, shall we say, *more than amenable* to swapping a black boy for a white girl when the situation is life-threatening, but they're by no means a majority, especially not ""90%"".

>My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Again, you're saying that we will be okay with *child murder* simply based on whether or not we have spent an arbitrary amount of time with the character and like them. You're stripping away and & all context except for whatever you need to twist to make your argument.

>Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him."
The Laughing Salesman,"There would be no reason to flesh it out imo.

It’s where they are at. 

The story is not meant to make our issues with the morality any easier. Nearly every big scene or conversation was in one way or another foreshadowing the fireflies, Joel, or Ellie.

I thought it was brilliant in how it made me remember other discussions."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"I guess it's ""I dislike a debate that is by its very nature a personal one that wouldn't be had about anyone besides this highly charismatic character being passed off as if it's a logical and/or moral one""."
The Laughing Salesman,"They could have set it up better. They needed at least an episode where the fireflies were being nice and running tests. They figure something out but determine she won’t survive the procedure. They lie to Joel and Ellie, but Joel figures it out and rescues her."
The Laughing Salesman,">There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him.

lol check out the comments on this vid

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-zd9Srk3y4"
The Laughing Salesman,"I agree. I think people are unintentionally remembering the mycologist and how she said there is no cure for their arguments for Joel without realizing that’s only something WE the audience and her knew. That wasn’t common information to the world because they bombed her country shortly after. 

Saying “they should’ve known it wouldn’t work” makes no sense because they WOULDNT know. They were not privy to that discussion."
The Laughing Salesman,"In the cutscenes, dude. And I'm not saying that all video games are like this, just the Naughty Dog style of mission-based games. Also, the caveat is made for the talking head scenes of Joel and Ellie, which is the game's strength. I'm simply saying that actual *cutscenes* are by their nature quick and need to get exposition out ASAP."
The Laughing Salesman,"But it's not about putting different characters in Jole and Ellie's shoes. It's about if you were Joel, would you sacrafice or save Ellie l given the information you had. The debate is not about whether you would go on a rampage to save any old kid. The specifics of the situation matter. They're the only thing that matters. Change the situation, you have a different moral dilemma on your hands.

It's the personal nature that makes it worth investigating."
The Laughing Salesman,"I see a lot of people making fun of him for pretending to be a tough guy and then crying & pissing his pants when actually confronted with danger, but not a whole lot of ""I wish the bear woulda ate him!"" Are you getting this from somehow sorting your whole life by Controversial?"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"I *know*, reread my OP post, it's not about the game, it's about what the debate around it has effectively devolved into after a decade. You are preaching to the choir."
The Laughing Salesman,"Discussing limitations of a medium in which art is presented is not necessarily looking down upon said medium at all. I am a 24 year old zoomer, you don't need to tell me that video games are art, I can give you a whole dissertation. I'm generalizing for the sake of trying to explain why the scene of Joel being given the escort job is 2 minutes in the game vs 12 in the show (I highly prefer the game, btw).

I will edit my initial post, though."
The Laughing Salesman,"Your dislike for what the debate as devolved into reads like ""But if we change key elements of this problem, people's choice would be different, therefore there is no merit in the debate"" which seems nonsensical to me. It reads that your point is people are discussing their personal choice, but because there is no objective right choice, any discussion around it is pointless.

There is value in knowing where people's morals stand situationally. This is why we as a species talk about it when these moral grey areas come up. And if, on a wildly extrapolated, primal instinctual level, we view someone's personal choice to be a threat to the community, it makes sense to debate and try to get them to change their opinion. 

Maybe I'm still missing it, but my ultimate thought is it makes sense to debate personal choices, they're arguably the only thing worth debating about."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"I think that there's value in pointing out that, when a debate turns into moralizing, saying ""you would not have this debate about someone else"" effectively torpedos the supposed objectivity of the debate. When people consistently say ""Oh, well the Fireflies' plan wouldn't have worked cause yada yada yada"", I genuinely just don't believe they'd go through the effort of making the debate if it wasn't about someone they're emotionally attached to, which *removes the stance of objectivity that side is taking* and renders their point moot."
The Laughing Salesman,"No, I'm...speaking generally. You can *choose* to take my point as clearly intended, which is ""cutscene-based games with single mission campaigns often don't have time to have talking head segments explaining every little detail like HBO shows do"", but instead you're choosing to hyperfixate on my exact wording so you can pretend I'm looking down on video games."
The Laughing Salesman,"Just to make sure we keep on that same page, what I'm understanding is: 

People claim saving Ellie objectively the right thing to do. But that objectivity is contradictory because they would not do the same thing for another less liked character?

If that's your point...ok? People are really bad at terms and use ""objective truth"" to gain some sort of advantage in arguments all they time. They can squak about objective truth all they want, it doesn't make their pov objective. I dunno, my comment there is don't let poor use of terms ruin your fun debating, assuming you enjoy debating"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not just use of terms, it's the existence of the debate in the first place and hyperfixation on details that wouldn't happen otherwise. I don't wanna keep explaining it, because I feel like you get my point, but you understand why 10 years of the same cyclical debate gets tiresome."
The Laughing Salesman,"Sure dude. Whatever you wanna believe I believe about video games. Please send me whatever ""It's Just a Game"" youtube video playlist you have that lets you feel like a victim."
The Laughing Salesman,"The frustration with the fixation on details is the part I don't get, and haven't gotten since the beginning. 

I feel there's a disconnect between what is actually being debated. Your stance is that fixating on these details is irrelevant or unjustified when they're actually **key**. The details define the situation. People aren't talking about the trolley problem, they're talking about in this specific circumstance, with this specific relationship, and this specific world, what would you do. 

It doesn't matter if people would make different choices if Ellie was a different character, or if the fireflies were more or less believable, or wouldn't care about x or y thing if she was less charismatic...that's not what people are talking about"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,You are pushing me for answers over and over in a way that makes it seem like you feel insecure for liking video games while simultaneously feeling like I'm misrepresenting them when the reality is I *slightly* misspoke in a way that was trivial to my point.
The Laughing Salesman,Renewed for season six and they are discussing spinoffs.
The Laughing Salesman,"The show is so much fun. They don't take themselves seriously and neither should the audience. Hell yeah it goes off the rails. The scene when Johnny discovers the internet will never get old. 

I'm hoping Daniel's wife kicks some ass in the final season."
The Laughing Salesman,"show has always been a LA manga and that final episode was shounen to the max, they even put the ""hero dying til he has a vision and regains his strenght for the last time"". Love it"
The Laughing Salesman,"I really enjoy the show, and the ridiculousness is part of the charm, but my one complaint is that the show pivoted away from Johnny being the main character over to Daniel."
The Laughing Salesman,Season 5 was actually my favorite. Hilariously over the top and resolved a lot of silly teen drama that had been weighing down  the show.
The Laughing Salesman,">""Just watch the first season and skip the rest, then it goes off the rails""

I'm glad you didn't listen to those people because that's a dumb take. CK is one of the few shows that manages to evolve and introduce new aspects that keep the show fresh.

There's a lot to pull from with the movies and the series does it well. If Hilary Swank doesn't show up in S6 I'll be pissed."
The Laughing Salesman,"If you're a slowpoke, I must be a sloth as I would have never picked up on that if you hadn't pointed it out. Pretty funny though."
The Laughing Salesman,"Cobra Kai caught me by surprise.

I cringed when I first saw the trailer for it because I was worried it was going to be lame.

I watched it after the 3rd season premiered because I was like ""okay, this can't be that bad if it got a 3rd season."" And I was shocked how good it was.

Such a fun show."
The Laughing Salesman,I just want a spin-off of johnny figuring out technology. The moments when they highlight that are great.
The Laughing Salesman,">I thought the last episode was a bit too ""didn't tie up any knots at all, almost.""

That was by design.  They weren't sure if the show would be picked up again, so they closed as many loops as they could, while leaving just a little bit open for another/final season.

If the show had ended there, fans would always want more, but they at least got a cohesive ending, which is unfortunately more than a lot of popular shows get."
The Laughing Salesman,"OP...  You haven't seen the dope as shit trailer for [Season 6?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVYAh0MQtiI)  No new footage, but it hyped me the fuck up.  Cannot wait to see this.  
  
Also keep an eye out for Obliterated.  Its a new action/comedy show by the Cobra Kai people.  They say its Die Hard meets The Hangover meets 24.  Stars Nick Zano from Legends of Tomorrow."
The Laughing Salesman,"Hey, that's great. I hope they invite a bunch of guest martial artists who can show off their form."
The Laughing Salesman,"I’m going to absolutely despise any spin-off not focused on original characters.

Edit: by “original” I mean from the movies"
The Laughing Salesman,Isn’t the 6th season the last? The trailer/teaser seems to imply it is.
The Laughing Salesman,Never heard that expressed before. Did the showrunners themselves admit to being inspired by manga? Nothing on the wiki about it.
The Laughing Salesman,"The Japanese angle did take a lot of ground, indeed, but I liked >!the turnaround when Johnny found a second wind after seeing the image of the sonogram. Typical eagle throwing its fangs around.!<"
The Laughing Salesman,"This shames me a bit as a cineast but I've seen neither KK3 or KK4. And definitely not the Jayden one.

Now I have a motivation to watch 3 and 4, thanks for reminding me!

Yes, I do think the show evolves, because it can manage to stay on the absolute lowest rung of the ladder with silly humor like ""penis breath"" and I still take it seriously when I see Kreese at the halfway house and I feel bad for him.

So yeah, stoked about S6."
The Laughing Salesman,"You should check out the other great Youtube Original.  Its on Amazon now, called ""Wayne"".  It's very important that you don't watch a trailer, the big trailer that Amazon put out ruins the entire show and the smaller trailers seem to have vanished.  Basically its about the crazy kid in town you don't fuck with.  Its written by the guys behind Deadpool. It should have got a second season, but nothing on youtube got watched and Amazon couldn't get viewers with their shitty trailer so it died.  It's fucking fantastic though.  
  
Its not about Batman."
The Laughing Salesman,Same. It started out on YouTube TV and that just didn’t get me interested. Wasn’t until it hit Netflix that I decided to give it a go and glad I did.
The Laughing Salesman,Sounds reasonable.
The Laughing Salesman,"Tasty video. Also, will look for Obliterated, sounds up my alley."
The Laughing Salesman,"Personally, I am hoping for a Chozen spinoff set in Okinawa"
The Laughing Salesman,"I don't know but as someone who's been reading and loving them since the late 80s, especially shounen, the similarities and typical plot progression, which are very very simple in that genre, struck me almost immediately"
The Laughing Salesman,"The 4th isn’t related to the rest but it does star a young Jennifer Garner.

Edit: This comment is almost completely wrong. I’m leaving it up as a monument to my hubris."
The Laughing Salesman,"I don't doubt it. I could totally see this whole thing shot as an anime, with Johnny being a blond and slightly dumb hero that just attracts trouble."
The Laughing Salesman,"It has Mr Miyagi in it, plus it's a young Hilary Swank :)"

Seriously was it the suicide theme lead in or the back to back ""steal their happiest life"" episodes for Gordon and Issac? Maybe Mercers abandoned pet child or torturing the sex change kid? Nah having her parent disown her was more fun than the torture. Lol

Super fun season.... Lol... It was trash.

Season finale was great though reminded me why I started watching. Rest was shit.

The Ancient Magus Bride,"I'm not an anime watcher but there are some series that are so good and pour into the mainstream and AoT is one of them. For me only Death Note and AoT managed to do that even though I know there are probably lots of animes that are also worth watching.

Really looking forward to the new season. I almost forgot about the series until I read last week or so here that season 2 is finally starting. It's so bizarre that an anime of this caliber has been drawn out for so long. Makes me wonder why they would do that and not invest more into it seeing how well received the show was. Then again they split up the season and we'll have to wait again.

I'm hyped nonetheless for season 2.

"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"The 1-cour part bothers me. The stepping off point will be rather unsatisfying, and will probably end up feeling like a massive deus ex machina without appropriate explanation. I doubt first time watchers will leave satisfied.

In case there's confusion, I'm referring to [spoiler](#s ""Eren using the coordinate against the smiling Titan being the point where the season is likely to end, which won't make much sense to anyone without the subsequent Uprising arc"")"

Idk why the OP/mod bothers to give legitimacy to anyone who thinks the last arc in the manga (and this current new one that just started) aren't good. Figuring out the truth behind the basement and how much it opened up the story was fantastic. Not to mention the battle we got at the climax of the last arc was the best the manga has ever had. 

If you want to go ahead and read the manga do it. You won't be disappointed in the long run."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"So I'm cheap, but legally cheap. Do you know when crunchyroll will release the episodes to all viewers and not just subscribers?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,It's on Hulu in the US right now.
The Ancient Magus Bride,If I want to read about season 1 and not watch more movies where should I go?
The Ancient Magus Bride,I don't watch any anime except for Voltron (if it even qualifies) and Attack on Titan and I only saw the latter dubbed. What exactly is SimulDub? Is that the same as the dubbed version of AoT S1? 
The Ancient Magus Bride,Excellent! Thanks for the info!
The Ancient Magus Bride,Did they release any significant OVA or movie I should watch before watching season 2? 
The Ancient Magus Bride,Thanks for putting all that information on here it was very helpful. So hyped.
The Ancient Magus Bride,[deleted]
The Ancient Magus Bride,wat is cour 
The Ancient Magus Bride,I think it's a bit dubious saying season 3 won't be out till 2019. We have NO confirmation that it won't be this year or next and the speculation that it's going to be 2019 is flimsy at best. 
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Thank you for the comprehensive FAQ!  Been waiting a very, very long time for this season to finally release."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Heard a lot about this show. As someone who really enjoyed Avatar, FMAB and Death Note, is this series for me?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"If you are from Italy you can also watch it legally at VVVVID.it, you should add it to that list!"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Isn't this:

>Why did it take so many years?

>Two reasons:

>Firstly, they wanted to wait for enough manga material to come out. Season 1 covered the first 33 chapters and the manga had reached Chapter 50 by the time Season 1 was finished, so they had to wait at least a year or two. 

contradicted by this:

>Where will Season 2 end?

>If it's only 1 cour, then it will likely end around Chapter 50."
The Ancient Magus Bride,">I want to read the ***Comic***, where do I start?

*triggered*"
The Ancient Magus Bride,Yes! She will be in Season 2 for sure. She'll get quite a bit of focus in one of the early episodes. I won't say anymore than that.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Sasha! My favorite, if only because she's the one person not perpetually brooding. 

I love the brooding. But the comic relief is appreciated."
The Ancient Magus Bride,">Is the potato girl still there?


Even if she isn't, there's always the doujins. "
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Yep, just noticed that as I was making the post for /r/anime. Am fixing it now."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"You should try Cowboy Bebop. It's basically the default ""you should try"" anime, but it really does live up to the hype."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Uprising and this arc should have been included together. You get the insane action of this arc + the in-depth explanations of the other. Not to mention uprising is probably the ""worst"" arc (not to say that it's bad per se, just in comparison) so it would have been better to package it with one of the best. Also, the climax of uprising is actually really satisfying so it would have been a nice place to end."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"> Idk why the OP/mod bothers to give legitimacy to anyone who thinks the last arc in the manga (and this current new one that just started) weren't good.

Opinions vary greatly, and I wanted to keep it fairly balanced so people go into it without expectations one way or the other.

^^^Also, ^^^I ^^^personally ^^^am ^^^one ^^^of ^^^the ^^^people ^^^who ^^^didn't ^^^like ^^^it. ^^^We ^^^exist ^^^and ^^^our ^^^opinions ^^^are ^^^legitimate ^^^as ^^^well."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"They generally release them for free viewing one week after it airs. It'll be lower quality, though."
The Ancient Magus Bride,The Attack on Titan Wiki has good summaries. Don't read past the battle in Stohess.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Not sure if this is what you're after but [Wikipedia episode list?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Attack_on_Titan_episodes)
"
The Ancient Magus Bride,Simuldub is basically the dub of the new season being  released at the same time of the sub version 
The Ancient Magus Bride,Yes. The Ilse's Notebook OVA will actually be relevant to the plot.
The Ancient Magus Bride,A set of roughly 12 episodes.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"There's no way it'll be out this year. WIT is banking heavily on Mahoutsukai no Yome which is 2 cours and will spill over into 2018, and then Kabaneri S2 will come soon after that. I don't think they'll have the staff or resources to get AoT S3 out any earlier than 2019, if even then. "
The Ancient Magus Bride,"If you liked those shows, you'll probably like AoT as well. There are many similarities. No guarantees, of course. But it's certainly worth checking out."
The Ancient Magus Bride,". . . Yeah, pretty much.

So it's just entirely due to the Studio and Production Committee not considering AoT to be a priority."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Just so you know, the Japanese do also use the term 'comics' for manga especially when talking about the compiled chapters sold in volumes."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I mean if you didn't like those reveals, the art which was the best of the entire series he has done so far, and the feels then idk what to tell you man. You honestly probably won't like the rest of the manga since this is the main story now."
The Ancient Magus Bride,Thanks. That's a big help.
The Ancient Magus Bride,Thanks.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Oh ok. It's not a ""type"" of dub that's inferior in quality then. "
The Ancient Magus Bride,"13, isn't it?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Ah I found an old summary I wrote:

In short:

Year 845, humanity has been living in the Walls safe for about 100 years. Then suddenly the Colossal Titan appears and destroys the Shiganshina Outer Gate. Then the Armoured Titan appears and destroys the Shiganshina Inner Gate. Eren's mother is killed. Eren, Armin, Mikasa, and many others become refugees while 10 000 people die in the attack. Wall Maria is lost, humanity loses 1/3 of its land. Another 250 000 people are sent out on a suicide mission by the nobility to solve the food shortage.

2 years later they join the military. 3 years after that, they graduate. On the day of their graduation, the Colossal Titan shows up and attacks Trost District, the southernmost city of Wall Rose. People die. Eren almost dies but then somehow turns into a Titan. They convince the military that Eren is a good asset and are able to seal the hole using a giant boulder.

Most of the characters join the Survey Corps and head out on a mission to reach Shiganshina District, since they believe Eren's father and the Basement might contain answers. Eren's father disappeared around the time Wall Maria was attacked, and Eren has memories of his father injecting him with something.

On the expedition, a Female Titan appears that has intelligence. It kills a bunch of people. But the expedition is a trap and the Survey Corps manage to capture it. . . but it breaks free and almost escapes with Eren. Eren is rescued by Levi and Mikasa. They return the Walls, defeated.

They figure out that the Female Titan was actually Annie Leonhart, a soldier in the Military Police, in disguise. They lay a trap for her, but it goes badly, and a battle breaks out in Stohess District. Ultimately they manage to stop her, but she seals herself within a crystal. The Survey Corps decide it will continue fighting for humanity, trying to solve all the mysteries, and defeat the Titans. The epilogue scene shows a crack in the Wall, revealing that there is a Colossal Titan inside the Wall.

Hope that helps. "
The Ancient Magus Bride,"A cour doesn't have a specific length, it can vary a bit. I've seen some shows with only 11 episodes. But yeah, 12 or 13 is the norm."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"This was perfect thanks, everything came back."
The Ancient Magus Bride,">But, hey, not all conspiracy theories are bad. If you don’t like Hancock’s story about the super-intelligent advanced civilisation being wiped off the face of the planet, here’s another that might explain how Netflix gave the greenlight to Ancient Apocalypse: the platform’s senior manager of unscripted originals happens to be Hancock’s son. Honestly, what are the chances?

Ah there it is"
The Ancient Magus Bride,I haven’t watched the show although I had planned to. Is it really any different than a show like Ancient Aliens that presents plausible sounding arguments but in the end is just cherry picking interpretations?
The Ancient Magus Bride,The 24-hour news cycle strikes again!
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I liked that it showed places I did not know existed. That was neat. And maybe more research will go into some of those places. That’s neat. It’s not like he has the last word on this stuff… I was entertained. Now a team of archaeologists can make a better documentary about how he’s wrong. I’d watch that too. 

Idiots are out there watching the bachelor and you’re mad about this “dangerous” documentary?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,This article is absolute rubbish! Should drag the writer out into the open and critique his work.
The Ancient Magus Bride,This article is more sensationalist than the documentary is. What a crap piece of writing.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I’ve watched it and I can say that they really do try to sell you on the idea that ‘mainstream archeologists’ are choosing deliberately to ignore key information and just don’t want to be proven wrong.. It gets a bit tiresome after about the 15th time it’s mentioned..

However, this show has definitely peaked my interest into ancient archeology, so take that info as you will"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"This show is incredibly tame compared to something like Ancient Aliens, which for some reason it gets compared to.

Graham claims that there are archeological sites that defy modern expectations of human history, yet people are not willing to dig them up.

He doesn't claim aliens built the pyramids or that Atlantis had teleportation technology. He claims there are huge gaps in human history and we might be able to fill in those blanks if some sites were investigated.

The editing is overly flashy, the Joe Rogan interview clips cheapen the documentary, and I'm sure not 100% of his claims are without fault. But the pushback against him and his show is completely out of proportion."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Media literacy is important, for both consumers and this writer. Will just have to wait it out at the moment."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Great documentary, if you have read any other books on human history, he is not saying anything new. Fascinating information."
The Ancient Magus Bride,That is such a guardian headline lol
The Ancient Magus Bride,This is the most Reddit of articles.  Like a post from r/politics just re-worded for some shitty TV show.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I studied Anthropology and all I can say is that my profs very much acted just as Hancock says... they stuck to the 'Clovis First' message despite reports of much older evidence. It's like they couldn't fathom the idea that the stuff they studied in school could be off the mark - and I can't blame them, as in many cases their entire Thesis and thus, PhD, was based on older ideas (outdated ideas) --- so in some ways maybe they feel their positions are threatened?

&#x200B;

\[edit\] - thanks for the gold - it's my first!"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I’ve watched the series and it’s a mixed bag. The episodes on Gobekli Tepe and Gunung Padang were interesting, but the underground sites in Turkey not so much.
Hancock makes plenty of valid points about the possibility of an earlier lost civilization. Until recently no one would have believed that a site Gobleki Tepe was possible.
It’s hardly the most dangerous show on television."
The Ancient Magus Bride,This article sucks
The Ancient Magus Bride,I'd rather watch this than a show glorifying murderers.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I watched this show pretty much all in one sitting, and the guy is like a dog with a bone.  Maybe it’s not meant to be watched that way, but he clubs you over the head with his hypothesis and then shows a bit of evidence each episode with the only connections between the dots being his own hypotheses. 

I didn’t find it any more dangerous than Ancient Aliens, which is a complete joke."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Can someone give me the TLDR why this is dangerous please?

Because it seems like some of you never watched the History channel in the 90s"
The Ancient Magus Bride,Ahh yes this show about a dude visiting old piles of rocks is more dangerous than “cuties” which promotes actually dangerous ideas
The Ancient Magus Bride,"one of the saddest, bitchiest, most pathetic articles you will see

'the most dangerous show on Netflix'...for asking questions about things that may have happened thousands of years ago?

it's a ridiculous assertion, given that Netflix has a show ('Cuties') that openly sexualises pre-teen children"
The Ancient Magus Bride,Yeah an old guy with an alternative theory that he's trying to prove so dangerous lmao
The Ancient Magus Bride,Dumb article
The Ancient Magus Bride,"This article doesn’t explain why it’s dangerous or even bad. It just says it’s boring. 
Didn’t want it, not interested. But just got done listening to Handcock on the JRE. He has a theory that civilization is older than what we think, that there was potentially a pretty advanced human civilization on the America,s, that got destroyed 12,000 years ago or so. What is dangerous about this theory? 
Im mot saying I believe it, I can’t judge it. I found it interesting to listen to, it’s a guys theory. Why on earth would that be dangerous? That’s how we learn."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"The author is hilariously mad lmao, this reads like a r/rant post, not an article"
The Ancient Magus Bride,Absolute joke of an article.  Who cares if the show has nonsense ideas or who greenlit its place on Netflix?
The Ancient Magus Bride,"I read Hancock's books many years ago as a conspiracy obsessed teenager, and lapped them up. Robert Bauval too.

Life happened and other things became more important. 2012 came and went without incident. I eventually grew sceptical. I went from Mulder to Scully.

A couple of years ago I got curious and decided to reopen ""the files"". Expecting to find a heap of evidence to disprove all of Hancock and Bauval's theories I found... nothing. Nothing except a handful of sensationalist headlines claiming some new evidence disproves the ancient civilization theories. When in fact, just scratching the surface of the new ""discoveries"" proved no such thing.

I've only watched a couple ""Ancient Apocalypse"" and while it's a little over-the-top, I accept this is probably due to an attempt to appeal to a modern audience. But what's becoming more clear to me is that *nothing* has changed in established archeology since Hancock released his first book on the subject."
The Ancient Magus Bride,definitely feel like this article was written to express the authors’s negative bias on Hancock’s theory
The Ancient Magus Bride,Most dangerous show on Netflix lol… some bs
The Ancient Magus Bride,I thought the CGI reconstructions were cool. It’s always cool to see what super ancient constructions could’ve looked like in their prime. Dangerous? Nah
The Ancient Magus Bride,Everything is “dangerous” now. You people have never faced real danger before and it shows.
The Ancient Magus Bride,Not it’s fucking not
The Ancient Magus Bride,The author of the article probably doesn't know what word 'dangerous' mean
The Ancient Magus Bride,What an opinion piece without any substance. Tell me why it is preposterous and I will decide whether or not it has merit.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Is this guerilla marketing? I had never heard of this show, but now I'm definitely going to watch it."
The Ancient Magus Bride,Has anyone at The Guardian ever watched anything on the History Channel or National Geographic?
The Ancient Magus Bride,"This article misrepresents the point of view of the series. The points made I’m were not that Hancocks theories were facts. But rather that the archeologists in control of the sites wouldn’t even entertain other theories. Science evolves through new theories. For example the authorities once believed that the earth was at the centre of the solar system, or that it was flat. We’re constantly finding new evidence that changes the current narrative. the book 1491 has some excellent examples of that. It’s also very true that archeologists have egos as do many authorities, and that does play a role in considering new theories and evidence. With a science like archeology no one can know the full truth as it would require a time machine. We can only interpret the evidence."
The Ancient Magus Bride,*Dangerous* please fuck off
The Ancient Magus Bride,How exactly is questioning the narrative considered dangerous?
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Damn, now I really gotta watch it!"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Why is people's first instinct to say something shouldn't exist? If you think he's an idiot, let him talk and he'll prove you right. Why are ""journalists"" so anti free speech?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Garbage article. The absolute best way to encourage critical thinking is to present said “thinkers” with opposing viewpoints.

But NOOOOO. Americans can’t think critically precisely because of bullshit like this. There is ONE story and no one better question it."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"A bit unhelpful for the Guardian to say it’s watched by people who shout at you on Twitter. I consider myself moderate liberal and will give anyone a bit of time to explain their theory even if it causes offence or outrage to others.

And I get yelled at mostly by the people of r/australia who seem to have the open mindedness and patience of uni students who have just discovered socialism.

Perhaps someone could ask Mr Hancock, why did the comets wipe out the smart humans or beings or whatever they were and leave the rest of us dolts to squabble among ourselves?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Imma watch this not because im a conspiracy cucko but because I like these fantasy thought experiment. Sue me, odd guy at the Guardian. 😆"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"The Guardian had been smearing Hancock across his career. Every criticism I’ve read of him is just dismissing him out of hand without a single example what he’s misrepresenting. Ultimately Hancock is a journalist bringing stories of ancient mysteries to the public. The narrative of a lost civilization is what he sees when all the similarities from these mysteries align. Nothing about his approach is unprofessional or misleading.

I don’t like how close he is to Joe Rogan but when you push alternative voices to the fringe you can’t also vilify them for associating with fringe characters."
The Ancient Magus Bride,">the platform’s senior manager of unscripted originals happens to be Hancock’s son

Now, *that* I did not know. No freaking wonder."
The Ancient Magus Bride,This article is a hit job. Watch the show and judge for yourself.
The Ancient Magus Bride,"It's funny seeing everyone jump on the ""it's all a dumb conspiracy Train"" this guy was actually right about humans having advanced civilizations around 8k to 10k bc.  

This documentary is obviously a bit over the top with the hate on modern academics, but to guys credit, he made a claim 30 years ago that everyone said was crazy and we are  ow finding out has some serious validity."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"WHY IS THIS ALLOWED 🤪🤪🤪

OMG someone notify the Ministry of truth, a silly tv show is doing a hecking wrongthonk."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Why are people so against other theories? There interesting and they challenge what we think we know. I choose to keep an open mind with just about everything. Anyone that thinks this is bullshit, not sayin it is or it isn’t but have there minds made up because they hate joe Rogan or some other issue that has nothing to do with the evidence presented are missing out on truly incredible ideas. Cherry picking ideas/evidence and presenting them is what you’ll do in any kind of documentary that’s what they are. Again I don’t understand the hate. And how is this in any way dangerous?"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Using the word dangerous , implying that people can't think critically and for themselves and therefore information is dangerous and should be regulated, is pretty pathological.   
Information shouldn't be regulated. People should be better informed if anything."
The Ancient Magus Bride,Cuties
The Ancient Magus Bride,"This article is absolutely dumb, calling a show a conspiracy without even stating a simple fact. 

If it’s such a drastic conspiracy than prove it wrong. Show how those structures he is talking about are not what he says they are. 

Who would feel proud writing that article"
The Ancient Magus Bride,"My favorite was “did all of these ancient civilizations just individually come up with pyramids! There is no logical answer that makes sense.” 

I yelled at the tv - there are plenty of logical answers!These weren’t all built at the same time and logic says these cultures constructed a lot of buildings - pyramids just happen to be a design that survives the test of time. Correlation =\= Causation. Rant ended."
The Ancient Magus Bride,"Watched this.  No different than anything that’s been airing on the history or travel channel for years?!? 

Dangerously easy to fall asleep to would be a better description."
Fruits Basket,"Is it just me, or is the music WAY loud and it almost sounds like they're yelling to be heard over the music?

I like that there's nothing that references the chapter 1 plot twist, so if you're a newcomer you'll be totally surprised by it. "
Fruits Basket,"The trailer tells nothing about the plot. I imagine if you are not familiar with the anime or manga and you go into this by the trailer, alone, thinking it's going to be a cute, run of the mill high school drama then you are going to be...shocked. Or at the very least, weirded out. ""Wait, that guy turned into a seahorse? A seahorse?!"""
Fruits Basket,"Well, Laura Bailey is back in the anime game again. "
Fruits Basket,"Aw man, the animation looks kinda lazy and not very dynamic. Regardless, I’m really excited to relive this story from my childhood! "
Fruits Basket,Is this an old show? It feels old 
Fruits Basket,"I am really looking forward to this. This was a property we all assumed was never going to get a proper adaptation. While I will always love the first anime, It made a lot of changes from the source material and because of that it left a sour taste in the manga creator's mouth. I am happy to see that it will get a proper FMA: Brotherhood style adaptation. I was surprised to see the author insist on a whole new cast since doing a massive re-casting is rare in Japan. That said I was always planning to watch this with the dub as that was how I saw the first series and I was beyond thrilled they got Laura Bailey back to voice Tohru. She dosen't do a lot of anime work anymore, mostly vocusing on video games. So when you see her in a new anime it's really cool."
Fruits Basket,Cuz its on this sub for some reason I thought this wouldve been live action.
Fruits Basket,It doesn't look like the manga art style.
Fruits Basket,I'm still conflicted about this. 
Fruits Basket,"So this is some serious weeb shit, eh?

No hate, it just seems very... anime."
Fruits Basket,">Who's in the forest strolling?
>The birds and the bees sing Momiji!

😢😢😢😢"
Fruits Basket,"None of this makes sense but I'm hoping that in some random scene he just turns into a literal seahorse that's like... 3 inches long and then is just in a fish tank. None of the other characters react like this is a big deal. He's just a seahorse now. He doesn't speak, he doesn't do anything that a seahorse doesn't do. Other characters say hello to him, and feed him, but in no other way interact. Because he is a seahorse and does not have the ability to communicate."
Fruits Basket,So far the only roles not reprised by the original cast are Kagura Momiji and Tohru's two friends. That is pretty much because aside from a recurring role in say DB Super or maybe One Piece or MHA most of their original VA have moved on from voice acting or acting in general. Parisha Fakhri who played Arisa Uotani has a recurring role on Seal Team but other than that the others have more or less fallen off the face of the earth.
Fruits Basket,"Actually they already confirmed she's coming back to reprise her role.

As are a good portion of the male voices as well."
Fruits Basket,It still looks a million times better than Sailor Moon Crystal. Like they spent more than 3 seconds on each frame.
Fruits Basket,"Yeah, pretty generic animation. At least we'll get the full story, and it only took eight years lol"
Fruits Basket,"There's been an earlier version. I think this one will be fully adapted from the manga. But yeah, it's almost the exact original animation style, so feels a bit dated compared to recent anime."
Fruits Basket,Original manga ran from July 1998 – November 2006. The first anime was in 2001. 
Fruits Basket,why? at least it gets to adapt the full manga =) 
Fruits Basket,"> but I'm hoping that in some random scene he just turns into a literal seahorse that's like... 3 inches long and then is just in a fish tank.

Wonder Twin powers activate!"
Fruits Basket,"We need more full manga adaptations, I'd do a lot for a Trigun Maximum anime.

A lot."
Fruits Basket,Although I do not watch with the dub. Huyay! There’s no such thing like enough Laura Bailey. Can’t get her enough actually.
Fruits Basket,I was really on the fence but I adore Laura so I'm much more intrigued now! 
Fruits Basket,Yay!!!!
Panda! Go Panda!,"I really really wanted a fourth one, but this'll do for me. Hopefully, they explore the characters more. It probably won't have the OG actors returning, but I'd like to see this one being more Furious Five and Shifu focused than the third movie, which sidelined most of them, barring Tigress..."
Panda! Go Panda!,The first Kung Fu Panda is one of the greatest American martial arts movies of all time.
Panda! Go Panda!,I read Jack Bauer at first instead of Jack Black and was very confused for a few seconds
Panda! Go Panda!,Why is this going to Netflix instead of Peacock?
Panda! Go Panda!,"I think I'm the only person who only likes the first movie and doesn't remotely get why the second caught on so well, but when I say I like the first movie it's an understatement because I'm just as obsessed as I was at 12 and I would love to love something else from the franchise as much. Going to give this my best shot."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I just hope they eventually make a spin-off series/movie of the Furious Five without Po. If it worked for Puss In Boots without Shrek, then it can work for them."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I hope characters from Legends of Awesomeness return like Taotie, Bian Zao, Temutai, Hundun, Peng, Song, Wu Kong etc."
Panda! Go Panda!,Fantastic!
Panda! Go Panda!,Wasn’t he the ”dragon warrior” and not the ”dragon knight”?
Panda! Go Panda!,"idk much about kung fu panda, but the article says ""Legends of Awesomeness"" ran from 2011 to 2016, and then ""Legends of Awesomeness"" ran from 2018 to 2019. is this a mistake?"
Panda! Go Panda!,"Kung Fu Panda teaches the wrong lesson when you think about it.

Tigress worked her ass off to get to where she is (so did the other members of the furious 5) whereas Po got to be the Dragon Warrior and superior warrior, why? Because he was born special. He never worked for it like them. So the lesson ended up being you can work as hard as you want but some people are just born special and can pass you in an instance. Po doesn't have anywhere near the disciple nor experience as them yet he surpassed them and even Tai-Lung (who dedicated his life to martial arts) in a short amount of time.

Tai-Lung worked hard but didn't react well at all to the rejection but Tigress handled it as well as most people could have in that situation."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Cool, but I wish he’d do something for adults again

Edit: guys. Come on now. Downvoting the literal mildest of opinions lol."
Panda! Go Panda!,Please make it stop
Panda! Go Panda!,Disappointing- so many amazing comedic Asian actors that would be just fine.
Panda! Go Panda!,As long as the animation is better than “Legends of Awesomeness” I’m game
Panda! Go Panda!,This is going to be like the 3rd spinoff show they've done.
Panda! Go Panda!,The villain of the fourth movie should be a dragon
Panda! Go Panda!,"I feel like there’s a possibility that Lucy Lui and James Hong could return to voice Viper and Mr. Ping, as they were the only movie actors to continue voicing their characters in the other Kung Fu Panda tv show(s)."
Panda! Go Panda!,I'm the opposite. I think Po's story is done. They should continue the story on a new generation of kung fu fighters. Jack Black can still voice new characters. Make Po and the Furious Five take the role of Sifu and Oogway.
Panda! Go Panda!,I prefer the second one because it knew when to be serious. It never turned the big bad into a joke.
Panda! Go Panda!,Tai lung escaping from the prison is one of my all time favourite animated scenes
Panda! Go Panda!,"Jack Bauer has saved the world enough times so that if he wants to move into voice acting, he's more than earned it."
Panda! Go Panda!,Kung Fu Panda has to torture some terrorists!!!
Panda! Go Panda!,DreamWorks has had a deal to produce shows for Netflix for ages
Panda! Go Panda!,">and doesn't remotely get why the second caught on so well

Gorgeous art direction, Gary Oldman as the villain, excellent score. Not much of a mystery."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I thought the first one was basically perfect. Didn’t see the second one in theaters and didn’t think it looked that great, finally saw and thought it was not too bad. And then I saw the third one and thought it was amazing, like seriously the 3rd movie is actually really good and captures the magic of the the first in a great way. If you haven’t seen the third I’d def check it out cause it was really enjoyable!"
Panda! Go Panda!,"The first kung foo panda is my favorite movie of all time. The second and third are just bonuses, I enjoy watching my characters come back to life in another medium."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Tai-Lung is such a great character he made the first film for me. Although everything else in the film was great.

How do you feel about the 3rd film?"
Panda! Go Panda!,The 3rd one didn’t float your boat? I saw it first and tried to watch it passively while cooking for my kids and ended up GLUED to the TV. I was awestruck!
Panda! Go Panda!,it's a mistake
Panda! Go Panda!,"> Because he was born special 

Welcome to possibly the oldest literary story structure of all time. See also: the Bible, Superman, The Matrix…

The Savior, The Messiah, The One… is about as classic story as it gets. 

Not that you’re wrong, but if you feel KFP has a bad message then you also have a problem with thousands of other works of fiction. 

Also, the isn’t really the message/theme of KFP, that’s just the story telling/character device used to set up the actual themes of identity, perseverance, justice, family, dedication…. And things like that. The “lesson” isn’t really  “be born better/special” but it’s totally easy to see how that interpretation can come about."
Panda! Go Panda!,"But isn't the message of the whole film that he believes in himself and that's what makes him special? That the villain may have worked hard but deep down he needed that scroll to believe he was good enough, while Po just believed in himself already?"
Panda! Go Panda!,The lesson of Kung Fu Panda is about accepting and loving your family. Both in Panda accepting his adoptive father and Tigress accepting Panda. But it does show there is a limit with Tai Lung’s behavior being unacceptable (being like a son to Oogway).
Panda! Go Panda!,"But he wasn’t. He had to work equally hard. He wasn’t built as a perfect weapon like Tigress, he had to learn from 0, get his ass constantly beaten, then he was thrown in the middle of all and figured out that he had to embrace who he was to succeed, it is acknowledged constantly how inferior his technical skills are compared to the rest, but it was his heart and love for his friends and the way that he cared about everyone that made him who he is. 

That’s the lesson I choose to see in this movie."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I mean isn't that life as well?

You can work your butt off but if someone has an talent for something they still can pass you. 

It does suck though"
Panda! Go Panda!,"Although it's not discussed overtly in the film, I think the lesson re Tigress is that dedication and hard work must be their own reward, or they will become obsession and madness, a la Tai Lung. Just my 2 cents."

Archie is very, very intelligent, probably the most capable man in all NY, but he is still a commoner, not a genius able to see the invisibile dots, that's Nero. That's Po"

Panda! Go Panda!,"I love Tai Lung to death. I don't remember anything about Shen(?) other than his cool design. Still have to watch 3 of course, kind of kicking myself I haven't given it a chance yet.

Zigzagging to your comment about KFP teaching the wrong lesson, I can see where you're coming from but I think Oogway realized Tigress wanted it for the wrong reasons. She *wanted* to be the Dragon Warrior. Po was passionate and humble and I think that's what he saw and wanted to choose. There is an unfortunate chosen oneness to it as well that I don't quite like, but I *don't* think that's the single solitary reason he was chosen ultimately. Po still had to work hard and he did and for all the right reasons. Still....it's true I wouldn't have minded Tigress as the Dragon Warrior. In terms of sheer effort and dedication she's ""won"" already."
Panda! Go Panda!,Kung Fu Panda has the greatest screenplay I’ve ever seen in an animated movie. If the characters were human it would definitely be nominated for some awards
Panda! Go Panda!,">but if you feel KFP has a bad message then you also have a problem with thousands of other works of fiction. 

I do.

>And things like that. The “lesson” isn’t really “be born better/special” but it’s totally easy to see how that interpretation can come about.

I get the lesson is meant to be don't base a book by its cover."
Panda! Go Panda!,But for the majority of the film Po didn't believe in himself. This was focused on quite a bit with him doubting himself. Tigress believed in herself from the start and was confident in her abilities. So no I don't think that was the message of the film.
Panda! Go Panda!,">The lesson of Kung Fu Panda is about accepting and loving your family. Both in Panda accepting his adoptive father and Tigress accepting Panda.

That's more like the message of the third film."
Panda! Go Panda!,"He really was. He learnt all that in a few weeks and surpassed people who had trained for years.

That's the lesson they want to present but that isn't really the case. He was just naturally gifted because he was born as the dragon warrior."
Panda! Go Panda!,I guess that's true but the movie kind of paints as a good thing.

I didnt know there were 2 spin off of kung fu panda, I was thinking of spin off of other movies"
Panda! Go Panda!,No a Chinese dragon
Panda! Go Panda!,Exactly. Tai Lung was great until the final battle where Po is sitting on him and beating his ass Barnyard style. That's what killed Tai Lung for me as a child and even more as an adult.
Panda! Go Panda!,I fucking cry every time
Panda! Go Panda!,">Po was passionate and humble and I think that's what he saw and wanted to choose.

Yeh those are good traits although Tigress wasn't the most humble she was certainly passionate. She dedicate so much time to it and respected immensely.

>Po still had to work hard and he did and for all the right reasons

He worked hard for a couple of weeks before fighting Tai-Lung, she worked hard since she was a child. Passion and humbleness are great traits but so is dedication, respect and maturity things she displayed far more than Po ever did."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Also, and I’m being mega pedantic here because work in development, but we don’t really do “lessons” in writing/developing films. Generally it’s all about theme, and most good films naturally have multiple strong themes, maybe one or two that the filmmakers were focused on as what lies beneath all of the story/character and then others that form organically from there. Being an animated kids movie, theme can often be much more
overt or literal, so it’s easy to feel like the film is trying to teach you a lesson, but it’s not really. It’s, like most films, an exploration of theme and character, it just happens to be wrapped in fun action comedy package in this instance. “Lessons” are more of a very little kids tv thing as opposed to big budget international theatrical films. 

“The One” isn’t really a theme writers explore. It’s basic structural device or character archetype. And you see it a lot because it really does work well. But like all devices/tools in the writing toolbox it’s all about execution. When devices are done well (or at least adequately) we think of them as tropes or archetypes. When down lazily or poorly we think of them as cliches or cheats."
Panda! Go Panda!,"> But for the majority of the film Po didn't believe in himself. This was focused on quite a bit with him doubting himself.

i think he has too much of a good guy thing going on seeing him in an R rated movie would be jarring."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Idk why you got downvoted. Sometimes people misinterpret the intent behind your comment, and sometimes they’re just in a weird mood.

Big Hero 6 is a Disney property (while the others you mentioned are Dreamworks) so maybe that was a factor, too."
Panda! Go Panda!,[deleted]
Panda! Go Panda!,"All true. I guess it's more that I think just because it was handed to Po and there was another worthy candidate he's not undeserving. It should also be remarked that there's a mystery to how Oogway operates so I'm sure he had additional reasons we can't possibly fathom. 

I wonder now too if Oogway thought Po making an informed decision to train whereas Tigress was practically bred to be a warrior factored in at all."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Po was not the chosen one because he was the bestest or greatest with qualities others can't measure up to, but because he had the right stuff at the right amount.

His ability to resist the pressure point attack is one factor, his personality another. However, you could consider him a prodigy who mastered the Wuxi Finger Hold in a couple of weeks and thanks to his ability to resist Tai-Lung's pressure point attack he was able to comfortably 1 on 1 him.

Love the movie btw. I pretty much consider it a ""perfect"" movie from start to finish."
Panda! Go Panda!,The point they made was Po became the Dragon Warrior because he believed in himself. I was pointing out that isn't the case because he was chosen to be the Dragon Warrior before he believed in himself. Maybe read properly.
Panda! Go Panda!,">He didn’t really surpass anyone. Tigress was still a significantly better fighter than him and so was Tai Lung. He won over Tai Lung by basically accident and because Tai Lung underestimated him. Nothing about the fight was because of technique. It was because he was a fat panda. The only exception is the wooshi finger hold, which is definitely a cop out. But rewatch that fight. There is no “chosen one” aspect to it.

So, as luck would have it, I randomly did decide to watch Kung Fu Panda this evening, and just finished a few minutes ago. The first half of the fight, you're right. Tai Lung wasn't fighting him at all, they were just both chasing after the scroll. But after Tai Lung gets the scroll and finds out that there's nothing there, he does go all out on Po. And loses horribly. Po grabs Tai Lung's tail and uses that as a rope against him, making him bite his own tail at one point, while effortlessly dodging the rest of Tai Lung's punches and kicks. Even the final hit shows Po squaring himself up against Tai Lung's final charge so that he can use his ""fat panda""-ness to redirect the attack and bounce Tai Lung 500 ft into the air."
Panda! Go Panda!,"He figured out the wooshi hold something Tai-Lung didn't manage to learn in all those years.

If you saw the sequel films Po clearly became a master fighter."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I agree, I didn’t know it was such a controversial opinion though"
Panda! Go Panda!,"No, a Chinese dragon. There are literally ones that have already appeared in the Kung Fu Panda series"
Panda! Go Panda!,">too if Oogway thought Po making an informed decision to train

But wasn't it kind of just pushed on Po?"
Panda! Go Panda!,">with qualities others can't measure up to, but because he had the right stuff at the right amount.

>His ability to resist the pressure point attack is one factor, his personality another

Those two qualities? One every Panda has. Besides that again is just something he is naturally born with not earnt. Which is my point.

>However, you could consider him a prodigy who mastered the Wuxi Finger Hold in a couple of weeks and thanks to his ability to resist Tai-Lung's pressure point attack he was able to comfortably 1 on 1 him.

Could consider? He definitely is there's no denying it.

>Love the movie btw. I pretty much consider it a ""perfect"" movie from start to finish.

The movie is great I am not saying it's bad just that the message isn't the best."
Panda! Go Panda!,It shouldnt have been. Reddit gonna reddit.
Panda! Go Panda!,Not really? He could leave if he wanted and was being actively pushed. If Oogway couldn't see into the future he knew how Shifu and the others were going to react and he wasn't going to stop that. Tigress never had a choice.
Panda! Go Panda!,"The movies message isn't a single thing. The movie teaches us that obsessing over something or achieving a singular goal can corrupt your intentions.

It teaches us that there might be dormant potential inside of you, you just need to find the right method of learning to awaken it.

It also teaches us that you don't need something else or become something special, being the best version of yourself is plenty special.

It's never to late to get into something you are really passionate about, that's another lesson one could draw.

Saying the movies ""message isn't the best"" because it uses the ""chosen one"" trope is a bit of an undersell in my honest opinion, especially considering how strange a story would feel if the main character isn't ""special"" in some way. It makes you question why the story is even centered around that character.

One could argue that what makes Po the chosen one is not simply his physique (although that does play a role in the movie), but because he loves martial arts ITSELF. 

Even tigress, for all her virtues; is still hunting Shifu's approval. Po is motivated no matter how shitty he is, no matter how much it hurts. The only moment he wavers is when nobody believes in him, but he's still supposed to face certain death.

And when it turns out that the dragon scroll is actually nothing, he turns around, alone, to face Tai-Lung 1 on 1 without even thinking he has a chance of actually winning the fight.

If you cut out the end fight, by having Tai-Lung be convinced by Po that fighting is pointless, the majority of the movie could still stand as is. His physical victory over the antagonist was a way to quickly and cleanly wrap up the plot.(and reference back to the finger hold) Po had already won the true struggle at that point, showcasing why he was worthy and Tai-Lung was not."
Panda! Go Panda!,"If you're told you're the Dragon Warrior by someone like Oogway you would have a sense of obligation to try and become the person that's fit for the role.

>Tigress never had a choice.

We don't know that. All we saw was her training as a child maybe she chose to take up martial arts? She could have left when she got older too but she chose to stay."
Panda! Go Panda!,"I feel like the position Po was in versus Tigress definitely leaves more enthusiastic consent wiggle room, plus Tai Lung's escape wasn't something anyone could have foreseen and so it's not like they thrust Po into that pool without any floaties from the get-go.

I just feel like Tigress could've been set on a path she might not have chosen if as children we can understand the sacrifices we have to make to become an expert in anything. Maybe Oogway felt remorse about this, just a suggestion."
Panda! Go Panda!,">I just feel like Tigress could've been set on a path she might not have chosen if as children we can understand the sacrifices we have to make to become an expert in anything. Maybe Oogway felt remorse about this, just a suggestion.

The issue is that's all pure speculation."
Panda! Go Panda!,"Obviously, like I said his methods are still a mystery.

But I think the movie supports it. Tigress wanted Shifu's love and didn't necessarily get it. That's a direct consequence."
Panda! Go Panda!,"And Jack Black touching the hearts of another generation, but I still want a second Tenacious D movie"

Main villain Ordell is meeting up with bail bondsman Max Cherry and discussing business in Cherry's car, turning on the radio for some background music. He then notices that Max has been listening to the Delphonics.

Earlier on in the film, while trying to kill Jackie, he learns she's a massive fan of the same band. What he doesn't realise at the time was that Jackie was also meeting up with Cherry as part of a plan to screw him out of all his money and get away with it."

But the narrative that he got caught cos of his pizza slip up is clearly untrue. No matter how incompetent the Romanian police force is, they absolutely already knew the location of the loudmouth foreigner who drives a Bugatti and live streams his location constantly.

In the two minute video of him flexing on her, he grabs some pizza boxes off screen. The pizza was from a Romanian pizza chain called Jerry's Pizza. This then alerted the Romanian authorities he was in the country. He had an arrest warrant for human trafficking. This slip up from Tate saw him and his brother arrested just hours later.

All because he could not refrain himself from responding to Greta. A fucking pizza box brought down a human trafficker."

The Familiar of Zero,"Wow so not only did he respond with the worst fucking comeback ever (saying ""wow I guess we know you have a small penis based on your email address"" to a biological female is not much of a burn), he also accidentally outed his location to the authorities in the process.

Truly this man deserves his stance as hero to misogynistic 12 year olds everywhere."
The Familiar of Zero,"> This then alerted the Romanian authorities he was in the country.

I think this is actual nonsense put out by the media for clicks. The authorities would already know he was in the country because he would have shown his passport to get in."
The Familiar of Zero,"The redditors have gotten themselves a little over excited. The golden child has slain the big evil dragon, using her devastating wit and genius cunning, Greta baited Andrew into revealing his previously hidden location. What a slip up! What a victory for all that's good in the world!

They don't need party poopers like me coming in and ruining the fun with all my silly facts. Totally lacking in nuance, they see any deviation from the accepted narrative as a defense of Tate, because why else would someone be questioning what we all already know to be true? Must be a Tate lover, there's no other explanation! 

In about 24 hours no one will believe the pizza fable, and no one will admit to ever having believed it.

In the meantime, they seem to honestly believe that the crack team of Romanian sleuths hunting for Andrew were just patiently waiting for him to order a pizza and inadvertently reveal his location.

""Soon, Andrew will order a pizza. Then we'll have him.""

""Why don't we just go to his house right now?""

""He'll order a pizza soon, let's just wait.""

""But I know where he lives. We already arrested him at his house a few months ago. We were both there, don't you remember?""

""He'll order a pizza, then we'll contact the pizza place and use their delivery info to narrow down the search.""

""We could just follow his rented Bugatti, the dealership keeps them GPS tracked, for insurance. Plus there's only like 4 Bugattis in the country.""

The Familiar of Zero,"No, he suggests at some time in the future he regenerates and looks like Tom Baker again and that he becomes a curator instead of a doctor for a time."
The Familiar of Zero,I always assumed it was a future incarnation of the Doctor I guess. He mentions that he likes to revisit old faces. I think they also established that the Doctor’s regenerations can be influenced in a way by past interactions (to help explain Capaldi playing as Caecilius in Pompeii episode)… so it makes sense that the Doctor could eventually learn how to control what they look like when they regenerate.
The Familiar of Zero,I kind of liked that they kept it ambiguous.
The Familiar of Zero,"Head canon time — my hypothesis is that in “Logopolis,” the whole thing about preparing for his fate was that the Doctor continued on in a fifth regeneration while the persona of the 4th lived as a separate mortal entity for a few more decades, during which he became a museum curator."

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
A Korean Odyssey,"Aside from the documentary, I’d love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That’s a documentary all to itself."
A Korean Odyssey,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
A Korean Odyssey,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
A Korean Odyssey,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
A Korean Odyssey,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family’s involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea’s search engine. Creepy stuff."
A Korean Odyssey,"OMG!!! I’m actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
A Korean Odyssey,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It’s the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more “man of God” using the scriptures to literally screw children."
A Korean Odyssey,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
A Korean Odyssey,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they’re trying to hide.
A Korean Odyssey,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
A Korean Odyssey,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
A Korean Odyssey,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
A Korean Odyssey,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
A Korean Odyssey,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
A Korean Odyssey,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
A Korean Odyssey,Reverend Moon?
A Korean Odyssey,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
A Korean Odyssey,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
A Korean Odyssey,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
A Korean Odyssey,Cool now do the Catholics of America
A Korean Odyssey,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
A Korean Odyssey,Do jehovah's witnesses next
A Korean Odyssey,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
A Korean Odyssey,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
A Korean Odyssey,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
A Korean Odyssey,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
A Korean Odyssey,Will this involves the moonies?
A Korean Odyssey,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
A Korean Odyssey,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
A Korean Odyssey,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
A Korean Odyssey,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
A Korean Odyssey,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
A Korean Odyssey,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
A Korean Odyssey,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
A Korean Odyssey,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
A Korean Odyssey,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
A Korean Odyssey,Netflix sucks haha
A Korean Odyssey,[removed]
A Korean Odyssey,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
A Korean Odyssey,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
A Korean Odyssey,The world is really fucked up.
A Korean Odyssey,">3rd March

btw"
A Korean Odyssey,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
A Korean Odyssey,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
A Korean Odyssey,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
A Korean Odyssey,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
A Korean Odyssey,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
A Korean Odyssey,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
A Korean Odyssey,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
A Korean Odyssey,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
A Korean Odyssey,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
A Korean Odyssey,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
A Korean Odyssey,"I say, do the USA next!"
A Korean Odyssey,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
A Korean Odyssey,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
A Korean Odyssey,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
A Korean Odyssey,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
A Korean Odyssey,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
A Korean Odyssey,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
A Korean Odyssey,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
A Korean Odyssey,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
A Korean Odyssey,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
A Korean Odyssey,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
A Korean Odyssey,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
A Korean Odyssey,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
A Korean Odyssey,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
A Korean Odyssey,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
A Korean Odyssey,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
A Korean Odyssey,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
A Korean Odyssey,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
A Korean Odyssey,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
A Korean Odyssey,Name?
A Korean Odyssey,Is this related to the unity Church?
A Korean Odyssey,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
A Korean Odyssey,just put the CC on then
A Korean Odyssey,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
A Korean Odyssey,"I can’t do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
A Korean Odyssey,That’s what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
A Korean Odyssey,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
A Korean Odyssey,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
A Korean Odyssey,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
A Korean Odyssey,I feel so sick watching the former victim reliving the scene where she waved mops to jms. This documentary weirdly focuses on male gaze
A Korean Odyssey,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
A Korean Odyssey,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
A Korean Odyssey,Then do a series. All American religions.
A Korean Odyssey,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
A Korean Odyssey,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
A Korean Odyssey,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
A Korean Odyssey,🙃
A Korean Odyssey,Well it’s made by Netflix so I’m gonna assume no
A Korean Odyssey,You showed them.
A Korean Odyssey,"*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey* and *the Keepers* are both pretty interesting"
A Korean Odyssey,"Give Jesus Camp a watch if you haven’t already, gave me some un-invited flashbacks."
A Korean Odyssey,"Dude, delete this. There are tons of documentaries on US evangelicals and the shit they get into.  This just shows you're too lazy to look before posting."
A Korean Odyssey,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.
A Korean Odyssey,There's actually a ton of them.
Myths and Monsters,Love this show. Really hit all the right spots for me. 
Myths and Monsters,"I’m kind of a sucker for mythological stuff, so this excites me!"
Myths and Monsters,"The article says it's a real Netflix Original Series, but it seems it's not available in Germany. Does anyone know why?"
Myths and Monsters,This was such a good show! I hope they make a season two. I've listened to the Myths & Legends podcast quite a bit and it gave great visuals to some of the stories that were told on there. 
Myths and Monsters,Me too!!

Myths and Monsters,"Left out the part where The Doctor stabilizes that chick as a paving stone.

Alive, conscious, stuck in that guy's house pretty much forever. Wholly dependent on him for socialization and locomotion. Probably unable to feel anything past her face and most likely unable to appreciate a wide array of comforts of any kind. 

Probably undying, too. 

Shame."
Myths and Monsters,Oh no not this one.
Myths and Monsters,Was that Moaning Myrtle?
Myths and Monsters,Worst. Episode. Ever.
Myths and Monsters,"The only episode I tried to convince my gf to skip on her first watch through the show, this one is really rough."
Myths and Monsters,You left out the part where they admit to her and the guy still having a sex life.
Myths and Monsters,It is. I had to IMDB it. Shirley Henderson
Myths and Monsters,Fear Her? Kill the Moon? Rosa?
Myths and Monsters,Did your monster not win the Blue Peter competition then?
Myths and Monsters,"First time through, I'd kind of agree. Started a rewatch of the series recently and the episode actually had a lot of charm to it. This scene in particular cracked me up with the exchange about not being from Raxacoricofallapatorius, and instead being from their neighboring planet Klum.

While not a particularly outstanding episode for Doctor Who, the amount of heart it carries is splendid. If you go into it expecting The Impossible Planet or Don't Blink, you're going to come away disappointed. The whole episode is almost like one big joke with the punchline being that making Jackie Tyler cry was a bigger offense than the alien that just murdered four other people."
Myths and Monsters,No worse than anything in the last 2 seasons.
Myths and Monsters,"Kill the Moon was THE worst, by far."
Myths and Monsters,Kill the Moon was the episode that made me drop the series.
Myths and Monsters,"Yeah, I give this episode a lot of grains of salt due to the fact that it was a child's prize winner idea. Also had great use of music."
Myths and Monsters,"I just rewatched this episode and I'd agree! Couldn't stand it first watch, was annoyed and considered skipping but figured it'd be fine for right-before-bed brain-tired tv, and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of heart! ""We forget because we must"" is a great line, and the jokes were actually pretty well timed. Not brilliant, but overall better on a rewatch and I thought it really harnessed some of the charm of older monster-of-the-week style TV."
Myths and Monsters,I don't even remember that one.
Myths and Monsters,There is something to be said for that....
Myths and Monsters,I looked up the synposis... wow that sounds aweful.
Myths and Monsters,Marc Warren is great though.
Myths and Monsters,"Not the bees Ahhhh my eyes Ahhhh Ahhhh 

Hopefully it matches the 1978 movie’s tone and style/vibe. If you haven’t seen the 1978, not that movie with cage , then do yourself a favor. It’s got Christopher Lee."
Myths and Monsters,"For me, a series that really “gets” the vibe of The Wicker Man, while adding some fresh elements was the HBO/Sky production ‘The Third Day’."
Myths and Monsters,"The movie starring Edward Woodward is a classic - so incredibly menacing in a quiet and ""friendly"" way

This will be interesting to see"
Myths and Monsters,But why
Myths and Monsters,"Y'know what'd really make this show ""over the top"" levels of great?!?! 

Selecting a cameo from the up and coming Love Boat reboot to stuff into the about-to-be-immolated titular figure at the end of each season."
Myths and Monsters,">Almost 50 years after the release of Robin Hardy’s horror classic, Andy Serkis and Jonathan Cavendish’s The Imaginarium and Studiocanal-backed Urban Myth Films are turning The Wicker Man into a TV series.

>BAFTA-winning Misfits and War of the Worlds writer Howard Overman has penned the script and Urban Myth and The Imaginarium have acquired the rights from Studiocanal. They are in the early stages of pitching to potential broadcasters, Deadline can reveal."
Myths and Monsters,Wasn't *The Third Day* enough? :)
Myths and Monsters,I just don't see how this could be good.
Myths and Monsters,"what a movie. it also has the best ""throw a dead cat on the table"" scene, only with a hare"
Myths and Monsters,"It's also got the fantastic Edward Woodward, star of the original version of The Equalizer."
Myths and Monsters,"It's nice to see people mentioning that show, no one ever talks about it even though the first half was amazing"
Myths and Monsters,Underrated series!
Myths and Monsters,Don't question. Consume product.
Myths and Monsters,Have you seen the original? An absolute classic. Why couldn't it be good?
Myths and Monsters,WatchMojo over here
Myths and Monsters,And that amazingly atmospheric but very old cold war spy series Callan
Myths and Monsters,"An odd one definitely. The 12-hour long thing was planned as an immersive event for the public, but then Covid happened."
Myths and Monsters,You're so right! The billion dollar franchise of the Wicker Man.
Myths and Monsters,I just don't think it would translate well to a TV show. It did well as a movie...I just fail to grasp how this is a good concept for a multi-season TV show.
Myths and Monsters,"Huge fan of the original here. 

This doesn't sound like a good idea whatsoever. I'm open to being proved wrong, but I just don't see any point to it."
Myths and Monsters,I actually watched it being streamed live.  Very strange indeed.
Myths and Monsters,Anthology perhaps?
Myths and Monsters,I can imagine it suiting a slow burn series
Myths and Monsters,I can't believe how much I'm enjoying Hacks. Everyone feels like a real fucking person.
Myths and Monsters,[deleted]
Myths and Monsters,"This, Made For Love, and Only Murders in the Building were way better than I expected."
Myths and Monsters,"My favorite show at the moment, and it’s already ending."
Myths and Monsters,"Crazy living in a time where Better Call Saul comes out on Mondays, Hacks comes out on Thursdays, and Barry comes out on Sundays. Not to mention Stranger Things coming out today (Friday) and Orville next week. Insane how so much great TV has converged into this short time frame."
Myths and Monsters,Still in Season 1. The 2nd lead is really good in this. I really like that she starts off as a stereotypical annoying self entitled millennial character. And midway she finds out even people her age think she's a bit self centred.
Myths and Monsters,"Started season 1 a couple of days ago and I'm almost done, excited to see season 2 next."
Myths and Monsters,"This show has been my go-to for the past year, and it really deserves all the love."
Myths and Monsters,"I was so relieved the show finally had an episode that actually showed the two characters working on actual material for the new act, it was seeming like it had been dramatizing everything BUT that."
Myths and Monsters,I’m sorry; the **myth** of self-betterment?
Myths and Monsters,This show is fantastic
Myths and Monsters,"The series showcases so much effort and talent. All of it is betrayed by thin writing that never brings it up to the greatness it could have been. The lack of epiphany, life lessons or depth leaves me disappointed every episode. I'm still hoping it'll deliver."
Myths and Monsters,Season 2 has been even better than season 1 for the most part but I thought the last episode was a little boring
Myths and Monsters,"It's entertaining, but I'm at an age where I just don't care, Showbiz people are garbage aren't they? Petty and soulless. Nothing at all to learn from them, still it's amusing and passes the time but then so does the Mary Tyler Moore show and the Golden girls."
Myths and Monsters,"Eh, it's the same repackaged middle class guff as a hundred other shows churned out in the last decade or two."
Myths and Monsters,"Ya no más

They're grooming children's sexuality to conform 

Very dangerous."
Myths and Monsters,"Except for Kayla lol, but I mean that in the best way."
Myths and Monsters,"I too am really (really) enjoying the show.

The only negative thing Id say about it (other than being 30m) is its hard for me not to think Jean Smart is sad behind her incredible acting. But this might very well just be me projecting after hearing about the death of her husband last year."
Myths and Monsters,"As someone who did comedy and quit because there was no stability, this was a great episode. I knew way too many people who did comedy and kind of made it, but were in their forties still living with roommates and had no health insurance. It’s not a life for the faint of heart, and it’s definitely a gamble. 

Also, I liked how that episode showed how it’s easier for men to take risks and break into comedy than it is for women. Men can easily have a family later in life, while it’s more difficult for a woman. They have more time to be living on the road and spending all of their free time writing new jokes. Deb went for it after she already had a child, but we al know how damaged DJ is. 

Anyway, I like how they showed someone who quit because they wanted normalcy and stability, yet they were still happy. It’s a nice juxtaposition to the choices Deb made."
Myths and Monsters,Watching this show always makes me feel better about my own mistakes.
Myths and Monsters,I gotta dig in again. The season seems meandering to me
Myths and Monsters,The Other Two also got lost in the mix. Really good HBO Max comedy
Myths and Monsters,"Just finished Made for Love, it's crazy good for how little attention and hype it got."
Myths and Monsters,Wow didn't know Made for Love existed and it has Cristin Milioti? Will definitely watch
Myths and Monsters,Add Minx to this list!!
Myths and Monsters,Check out the movie Valet.  It’s amazing heartfelt and the funniest thing I have seen all year.
Myths and Monsters,Season 2 is the last season...?
Myths and Monsters,I hope you're not a surgeon. . .
Myths and Monsters,I gotta also recommend Under the Banner of Heaven. It’s crazy good.
Myths and Monsters,Was just listening to a podcast where some professional tv watchers were talking about how even they just don’t have time to keep up with every piece of “good tv” these days. Always figured there’d of been a longer drought post-Covid.
Myths and Monsters,">annoying self entitled millennial character

She's Gen Z. Marcus is the millennial character."
Myths and Monsters,Her quips continue into S2. It works because she’s always told to shove it.
Myths and Monsters,[deleted]
Myths and Monsters,Middle class guff? What? Literally nothing about this show feels “middle class” to me?
Myths and Monsters,Kayla is delightfully absurd.
Myths and Monsters,"Is that the girl with the thong pulled up last episode? I feel like I see a lot of Asian Twitter with that super sexualized style, was wondering if there was a term for it."
Myths and Monsters,Did these guys in their 40s own Debra Vance spice racks? :)
Myths and Monsters,[deleted]
Myths and Monsters,The other two is about the un-famous siblings? That was funny.
Myths and Monsters,Love this show! Definitely underrated!!
Myths and Monsters,Same. Just finished it like two days ago. Cannot believe it hasn't blown up yet. It even cured my Severance itch!
Myths and Monsters,"> Made for Love

well shit

never did hear nothin bout this. But it looks fucking good. Looks like I will be binging this shit tonight"
Myths and Monsters,I didn’t even know season 2 was out. Definitely watching it this weekend
Myths and Monsters,Didn’t know season 2 was out! Love this show
Myths and Monsters,I always say the same about Cristin Milioti
Myths and Monsters,"I hope not, but the last 2 episodes of this season will air next week."
Myths and Monsters,Will put it on my watchlist!
Myths and Monsters,"Ugh, I just started this, and couldn't stop. So good, but the opposite of comedy."
Myths and Monsters,Millennials are like 40 now!!
Myths and Monsters,"She’s “elder” gen z lmao, pretty sure she was 25 at the premiere"
Myths and Monsters,"Oh yeah. The girl is clearly Gen Z but the ""annoying 20 year old/millennial/genz"" stereotype has largely stayed the same."
Myths and Monsters,I'm curious about S2. A large part about the show is the friction between them. I wonder how they'll play if up every season or deal with them being on good terms.

Dope,The new movie was awesome. Please please don’t fuck this up
Dope,Were his GoT episodes any good?
Dope,"""A TV sequel to the film “Blade Runner 2049” (itself a sequel to the landmark original “Blade Runner”), the new series comes from showrunner/executive producer Silka Luisa (“Shining Girls”). Ridley Scott is also an executive producer on “Blade Runner 2099,” which comes from Alcon Entertainment and Scott Free Productions. Also joining the writers room is Tom Spezialy (“The Leftovers”), who will also serve as an executive producer."""
Dope,Does he understand brightness vs contrast?
Dope,"Listen… I like Bladerunner for all the obvious reasons, but it needs to be understood that the non-dialog moments of silence in the movies are extremely important. Don’t make it nonstop conversation like in many modern movies."
Dope,So replicants have entirely taken over the earth and fixed it. But a renegade band of humans invade earth and are hunted down by bounty hunters?
Dope,Rumor is they cast Jodie Comer.  I'm sort of looking forward to that.
Dope,Has Amazon ever done anything original before or do they solely do remakes of classics that nobody asked for to piss off the nerds
Dope,Ok but who is writing it?
Dope,Why can't they just make a new cyberpunk IP? Hollywood has grown so fucking lazy this past decade.
Dope,You know what would be great: If Hollywood would stop trying to strip-mine the 1980s and 1990s and actually produce original stories.
Dope,can you please let Blade Runner rest? the original movie is a perfect masterpiece that starts end ends on its own. PKD is dead and that's all. move on and start writing something NEW !
Dope,Oh shit some live action cyber punk series. Sign me up. Now give them a billion jeff.
Dope,"I'm a huge fan of both the Blade Runner films and it's easy to be cynical about this project, but I actually think it will be good. Forget that the director of the pilot was involved with some of the weaker seasons of GoT (which suffered from poor *writing*), the actual direction was often very strong. You've also got a writer from The Leftovers, too. As much as I criticise some of the ideas Ridley Scott has, there's no doubt that he still has a great eye for visuals and that's such an important element of BR."
Dope,"If that Adult Swim anime was any indication, I'm really not expecting much."
Dope,Amazon creating a blade runner series while moving us closer to bladerunner as a society every single day. The irony is almost too rich.
Dope,"gota love how they keeping making Do Androids dream on Electric sheep story straight 

&#x200B;

instead of the mindfuck this novel have"
Dope,Not good news
Dope,Maybe we’ll finally see c-beams put to film.
Dope,"The creator of Shinning Girls, the writer from The Leftovers finale and a Game of Thrones director, sounds like a solid line up."
Dope,I really hope it leans into the Neo-Noir aspects of the original and doesn't try to be more action oriented like BR 2049. That doesn't work well in a TV show.
Dope,Will they bail on the last season
Dope,I hope it's not too dark (in terms of lighting)
Dope,Game of thrones alum is probably not as desirable on the ol CV as it used to be.
Dope,"Wow, nobody here has mentioned the Blade Runner comic series, 2019, 2029 and 2039!!! I highly recommend reading these and I hope they pull some stuff from the comics to the series"
Dope,"First movie is on par with 2001 a space odyssey. Masterpiece movies.

The second was good.

Cant wait"
Dope,It’s Amazon don’t keep your hopes up
Dope,"For the love of gawd, could someone please just invent something new."
Dope,didn't game of thones have one of the worst possible final seasons?
Dope,RemindMe! 7 months
Dope,">‘Blade Runner 2099’ Series Pilot to be Directed by ‘Game of Thrones’ Alum Jeremy Podeswa



ALRIGHT YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!


>at Amazon


FUCK



Please don't Wheel of Time my Blade Runner."
Dope,Noooo please don’t make this
Dope,Amazon hasn't exactly impressed with other similar projects.  Call me concerned.
Dope,"Damn. I had high hopes for this show. Sounds like they're doing everything possible to make it a boring as possible. ""Walking around and discussing who should be king"" does not make for compelling sci-fi."
Dope,Not a fan of another time jump.
Dope,"Lordy no! Stop with the series based on films. Is originality dead? Innovated damn it, make unique films. 🎬"
Dope,I should probably watch Blade Runner some day.
Dope,Love the Blade Runner movies! Cnt wait to see this 💪🏾💪🏾
Dope,"You’ll never think the directors who did Community will be able to pull off something like Infinity War and Endgame. 

Never doubt"
Dope,"GoT writers were shit once they got ahead of the books, but the director shares the blame. So I'm not counting any chickens..."
Dope,Don’t tell me this dude made anything after season 4
Dope,Fuck leave it alone
Dope,I swear to god if they fuck this up....
Dope,"Whenever I hear about it being part of a failed franchise like GOT or LOST (or really any of Bad Reboots corral of hack writers), or someone who wrote 2 episodes of said franchise's shows and are now for some reason a showrunner, you know it's going to be a shitshow. And given how Amazon handled LOTR, you know it's going to suuuuuuuuuuuuuck."
Dope,🤮 worst news I’ve heard all day.
Dope,"Please, Please, Please don’t RoP it!"
Dope,Gonna be a future of meh because we can't leave well enough alone anymore
Dope,I was excited till reading Amazon. So it’s gonna be shit
Dope,I feel like Amazon is just absolutely fucking up IP’s with zero disregard for the fans of said IP’s.
Dope,"People need to quit whining about the ending, sure, it was a let down and was rushed. But GOT as a whole is still some of the best tv to ever be produced, learn to appreciate the journey more then the destination. Can you really devalue season  after season of  extraordinary television because you disliked the ending?"
Dope,Surprised this is getting a shot since the move underperformed.
Dope,Can't wait for a third blade runner property to bomb initially and then be beloved years later
Dope,Blade Runner at Amazon? The future is dead
Dope,I wonder why they didn't go with D & D.
Dope,"Can we just, like, not?"
Dope,"""at Amazon"",=gonna be bollocks."
Dope,"Nooo Amazon doesn’t have budget like HBO to do big VFX heavy sci fi worlds justice. 

This is gonna look and feel cheap :/"
Dope,"Jesus, sci fi used to be weird and different and challenge our thinking. Now it’s just superhero-adjacent franchises and prequels and sequels and reboots. Can we have some new characters, universes, worries?"
Dope,Oof. The game of thrones names brings much I'll intent. The last think blade runner should be like is a long sprawling series where everything is explained. Thst world is best left 90% not understood. It gives a sense of immersion.
Dope,"Seems like in the only one in the thread 
that didn’t like BR2049 compared to the original?

Visually stunning, but way to much dialogue and over-explaining that ruined the mystery  and tension of the original. Dave Bautista’s scene was great, but pretty much all downhill from there."
Dope,since its from amazon its gonna suck
Dope,I already predict this will be turned into woke garbage.
Dope,"Lol, nope. 

The production team ran game of thrones into the ground. 

I'm just going to view this next dumpster fire from a distance, thanks."
Dope,Deckard is now recast as a androgynous transitioning mixed race sexually fluid he/they/she/him/them.
Dope,He ruined “in my opinion” GOT so not really sure to expect much and honestly I would like to see him fade
Dope,So… a lot more rape scenes? Please no
Dope,"i never understand why people liked blade runner 2049 so much compared to the original.

so my question is. why do you like blade runner 2049 so much when you also have watched the original? because i do not understand it. watching blade runner 2049 to me is like watching alien 4. enjoyable but can not handle a candle to the first one."
Dope,"How on earth can this possibly work as a TV series, and still look and feel like a Blade Runner???  

This money grabbing schemes of recycling and destroying every possible movie is really getting on my nerves."
Dope,2049 was made by someone competent and it was already not that great and unnecessary. I can't even imagine what a mess this will be.
Dope,Amazon? Blade Runner? Game of Thrones Director? This is probably going to car crash.
Dope,Jesus leave shit alone..we don't want got people anywhere near blade runner
Dope,Why does it have to be a series 🙄🙄🙄
Dope,[deleted]
Dope,Please don’t fuck this up.  Being Amazon I expect the worst…
Dope,We're at the point where the assumption is this will be forgettable and drab. Hoping to be surprised.
Dope,"I've always kind of hoped Blade Runner would become a Hollywood tradition - each time we reach the year the previous film was set in, a new Scott/Villeneuve-calibre director creates a new installment."
Dope,"If Miguel O'Hara isn't in it, don't bother."
Dope,He directed some real dogshit GOT episodes.
Dope,"Calling it, its going to suck."
Dope,"Great. Another series to captivate audiences for a while for a huge cash grab, only to inevitably disappoint in the end. Can't wait."
Dope,Thank you in advance for ruining yet another beloved franchise.
Dope,"Hope it's not just a ""Strong female replicant"" series"
Dope,Yeah GG
Dope,Why da frick
Dope,Just look what he did with Dune. I am a huge fan of his work but I genuinely hope they get TV show right. I actually think they can tell a better story via a tv show.
Dope,Why do we need a series of movies that do well? Why can’t they stay just movies?
Dope,I’m surprised Marvel doesn’t have the TV/film rights for “2099.”
Dope,"""Blade Runner 2099"" - alright, sounds interesting...

""Directed  by Game of Thrones Alum"" - panic!

"" Jeremy Podeswa"" - phew, alright...

"" at Amazon"" - fuck.

Let's hope for best, and keep our expectations low for now."
Dope,Can't wait
Dope,"This guy is responsible for directing episodes in seasons 5 6 and 7 of GoT, so nooooot something I'd exactly want on my resume."
Dope,It had better have good scenes for my sigma male videos in it.
Dope,O no
The Toys That Made Us,"Finally. 

Doesnt the title song say ""8 part documentary series"" but there are only 4 episodes."
The Toys That Made Us,I need a TMNT episode in the next season.
The Toys That Made Us,"Cool. This was a fun series.

I'll really be looking forward to the episode on Transformers. Hopefully they talk about the comic book tie in, because that was always much nearer to my heart than the cartoon. And in particular, the Marvel UK comic, written by Simon Furman.

I also wish they'd do an episode on some of the shorter-lasting toy runs of the 80s. MASK, Visionaries, Rock Lords, Battle Beasts and Centurions."
The Toys That Made Us,[deleted]
The Toys That Made Us,"I've really enjoyed this show, happy to hear it got another season.  It also shows another side to netflix programming, and seems to be quite popular.  I hope they do more 'light' documentary series like this - it's nice to watch something new and interesting, without it being horribly depressing  
  
Also i love the fact that so many of these iconic toy brands were basically made through random accidents and 'making the best' of bad situations"
The Toys That Made Us,Can't wait to see an episode on voltron .
The Toys That Made Us,Maybe they'll finally explain [Jill Barad's chair](https://twitter.com/thatkevinsmith/status/944969518731771905?lang=en)
The Toys That Made Us,Great show... also I had no idea toy makers could curse so much.
The Toys That Made Us,Can't wait until they do Fleshlights.
The Toys That Made Us,WWF Hasbro would be my dream come true
The Toys That Made Us,What the boy in me wouldn’t do to see some Dino riders 
The Toys That Made Us,"Hoping for Hot Wheels, Super Soaker, Nerf, Atari, and Nintendo."
The Toys That Made Us,Had a blast with this show.
The Toys That Made Us,Fuck yeah!
The Toys That Made Us,Just finished this last night and loved it. Also I don’t know if anyone else noticed this but I laughed when it seemed like someone else also wanted to be interviewed. [I like toys too](http://cubeupload.com/im/zWyNG4.jpeg) 
The Toys That Made Us,"!! great to hear. was a really fun binge when i was home sick, look forward to the next half of the season without cold sweats. "
The Toys That Made Us,"As a farm kid, I’d love to see them do the history of Ertl. "
The Toys That Made Us,"I finished watching this series (8 episodes currently available) today. Very well put together, quite funny, and surprisingly moving in some parts that made me teary-eyed. One thing that I also thought was interesting was how all these American toy makers were claiming ""*I'm* the father of this toy,"" and ""no *I'm* the real father of that toy"" while the humble Japanese guy who designed the Transformers toys was like, ""here, now it's your world."" Quite a contrast."
The Toys That Made Us,It’s about time!
The Toys That Made Us,is it worth it? i see it on netflix but i think i would waste my time.
The Toys That Made Us,:-0 I could have I missed it ?
The Toys That Made Us,I need She-ra and Jem episodes!
The Toys That Made Us,"The fact there wasn’t a Transformers episode made insane. 

I’m meow less insane. "
The Toys That Made Us,Cool. Great series.
The Toys That Made Us,I love the concept for this show but I wish it was better.
The Toys That Made Us,"Going just by the Masters episode I found the presentation a little overbearing. I'm not ten anymore, I can handle things going a little slower. 

Also, get off my lawn."
The Toys That Made Us,"Yaaaaaay, great and interesting show, can't wait for the rest of season one.

I hope they do Ninja Turtles, superheroes, and toys based on R-Rated movies from the late 80's and early 90's. Curious to hear the marketing/thought processes behind those."
The Toys That Made Us,I couldn't get into it. I watched 3 episodes and it was eh...
The Toys That Made Us,"awesome news, i really enjoyed the first 4 episodes!"
The Toys That Made Us,I actually really enjoyed this show. Had a nice balance of energy and story telling. It wasn't all gags and it wasn't Ken Burns Toys in America either. 
The Toys That Made Us,I liked the show. I'm requesting Transformers/Go-Bots and M.A.S.K. 
The Toys That Made Us,"Tried to watch this, but the presentation wasn't for me."
The Toys That Made Us,"The He-Man episode really got to me.  Like I always knew intellectually that the cartoons I loved as a kid were created to extract my parent's money.  However I thought there was at least SOME level of art and storytelling involved but nope, it was just a huge marketing ploy to sell toys."
The Toys That Made Us,Really great show.  I've seen them all except the Barbie one.  I'll watch it eventually lol
The Toys That Made Us,I'd like to see a whole episode from this Netflix show on not a toy but Toys R US a toy company.
The Toys That Made Us,How do they renew something they haven't finished?
The Toys That Made Us,Wait... how did I not know about this show. It sounds awesome.
The Toys That Made Us,I can't wait for more episodes.
The Toys That Made Us,Cool!
The Toys That Made Us,Can we get a Voltron episode?
The Toys That Made Us,i wanted gundam and zoids to be there but they are not technically toys.
The Toys That Made Us,I’m pals with the guy that narrates it. Super cool guy. Cool show
The Toys That Made Us,"I'm glad they renewed it.  But I was disappointed that their ""season"" was only 4 episodes.  It's like they wanted to rush it out before it was ready. I'd like to see them have more episodes ready -- this is a cool show to binge watch. "
The Toys That Made Us,"Season one is 8 parts. 4-8 will be Transformers, Hello Kitty, LEGO and Star Trek. They got a second season. It's a great show."
The Toys That Made Us,The first season is 8 episodes and they’re being released in two halves. Not sure when the second half of season 1 is coming out. 
The Toys That Made Us,"Yeah, we found that pretty confusing too, considering Netflix normally releases a full season all at once."
The Toys That Made Us,That’s where all my money went in the 80s.
The Toys That Made Us,"TMNT, Hot Wheels, Cabbage Patch Kids, My Little Pony, Super Soaker, Tyco RC. Its hard to think of many more that are really iconic. "
The Toys That Made Us,"Mighty Max
Polly Pocket"
The Toys That Made Us,And Power Rangers!
The Toys That Made Us,Highly recommend a great documentary on the creation of TMNT and all its wackiness called “Turtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”. 
The Toys That Made Us,They probably will since they covered the comics for GI Joe and He-Man
The Toys That Made Us,Wow I haven't thought about MASK since I played with them.  Now that's good nostalgia!
The Toys That Made Us,I forgot all about visionaries. I loved that show so much
The Toys That Made Us,">I also wish they'd do an episode on some of the shorter-lasting toy runs of the 80s. MASK, Visionaries, Rock Lords, Battle Beasts and Centurions.

There are so many, they could do half a season just with this concept!  Monchichis, Pound Puppies, Care Bears, Glo Friends, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, Silverhawks...  I may be having a nostalgia stroke.
"
The Toys That Made Us,Realllllly hoping for Nerf and Polly Pocket
The Toys That Made Us,"- Go-bots

- Mega-blocks

- Bag of 100 green plastic army men, none if whom stand up properly

- Garbage Pail Kid stickers

- Headless Barbie

- The box the refrigerator came in

- Socks

...Goddamn it, my childhood sucked!"
The Toys That Made Us,Hope to see a Power Rangers episode at some point. Maybe once we get past the big 80's toys. 
The Toys That Made Us,TMNT and Nerf was my childhood. 
The Toys That Made Us,Please hot wheels. 
The Toys That Made Us,Knight Rider and A-Team better be in there. Always wondered what the My Pet Monster story was. 
The Toys That Made Us,"I like that list, I would only include Playmobil and I'm not sure about Pokemon, that's too recent for this show I think, maybe they can do some episodes about classic board games like monopoly or clue?"
The Toys That Made Us,"They could cover a lot with Nintendo, they were a toy company before they discovered video games and have been around for a long time. It might be too broad to cover but I think it'd be eye opening to a lot of people."
The Toys That Made Us,Lmao wtf! 
The Toys That Made Us,"It has to be some rich person art bullshit. Like she bought it for $250k because some random NYC artist was like ""I created this with a deflated sex doll to show how us women are treated in society and in the workplace"" and then she the *CEO* of a huge company bought it thinking ""yeah us women are treated terrible in the workplace"" The artist was like ""yep you're right white rich *CEO* lady"" While the artist rolls her eyes. 

edit: Before I wake up to replies. My point was that women are treated unfair in the workplace I was making a statement about her being a fomer CEO and talking about being opressed. She is literally the agent of change and can make change happen.  "
The Toys That Made Us,The He Man episode was the best ..............  BONGGGGG.
The Toys That Made Us,"""It was always so much trouble. I was always sitting in a theater with my date. I had to get up, get a popcorn bucket, cut a hole in it, stick my junk in, get hot butter and popcorn crumbs on captain stiffy, just for a chance my date would touch it, and then my nuts smelled like artificial butter for weeks. I thought, 'There has to be a better way'""."
The Toys That Made Us,"""The toys that made no one"""
The Toys That Made Us,"I had the big T-Rex fucker, I got it for Christmas. One of my most cherished childhood toys. Also had the Triceratops and some smaller ones, man Dino Riders was awesome!"
The Toys That Made Us,"It's very interesting, even if you just have a passing interest in the toys themselves it's enlightening as sociology and learning about the market. I never played with any of the toys in the first set (apart from prequel-era Star Wars, but that episode mainly focuses on original trilogy Kenner) but it was fascinating seeing how these franchises were built. Plus you find out how other media like movies and tv shows and advertising tie into toylines.

One thing that does rub me the wrong way is that it veers into a more goofy tone a lot. The narrator has a 'funny' voice, there are occasional over-the-top cheesy reenactments, and their visual aids are definitely designed to be more humorous. Overall I enjoyed the lighter tone but it was obnoxious at times."
The Toys That Made Us,Did you watch the He-Man ep??
The Toys That Made Us,BONG!
The Toys That Made Us,That's what most toys are. 
The Toys That Made Us,Easily saving that for season 2. 
The Toys That Made Us,Those didn't come out till like 2001 in North America.
The Toys That Made Us,They could do Voltron.  I had those when I was a kid (80s)
The Toys That Made Us,Parton Oswalt...? You mean you’re friends with Patton Oswalt?
The Toys That Made Us,The first season will have 4 more episodes. But they should have come out sooner I agree.
The Toys That Made Us,"So all those AND another season

Damn this show is so fun"
The Toys That Made Us,When? 
The Toys That Made Us,might find out if the Optimus Prime combat deck was IMPOSSIBLE to buy or possibly forgive my parents. 
The Toys That Made Us,When did they came out?
The Toys That Made Us,I didnt kno that. Just thought they got cancelled after 4.
The Toys That Made Us,Nice.  Lego will be fun and of course Transformers.  Star Trek tho?  I didn't know they even had toys lol
The Toys That Made Us,"Wait, no more episodes? What about other toys like Voltron? :("
The Toys That Made Us,They have started doing halves for some stuff. Like voltron season 4 is actually the second half of season 3.
The Toys That Made Us,I’ve worked on a series netflix split in two and referred to as different seasons airing 6 months apart. It’s all part of their business model to dump large amounts of content at once but still split it up to maintain subscriptions. 
The Toys That Made Us,"Cabbage Patch Kids, Strawberry Shortcake, Smurfs, Thundercats, Shogun Warriors which included Tranzor Z aka Mazinger Z and represent one of the earliest anime/toy shows in the USA, Construx, Lincoln Logs "
The Toys That Made Us,Lionel. A model trains episode could be cool
The Toys That Made Us,Ghostbusters.
The Toys That Made Us,Micro Machines.
The Toys That Made Us,I've seen it. It's fantastic. 
The Toys That Made Us,Wondering if they'll cover Go-Bots in the Transformers episode.  They're probably too obscure to get their own episode.  M.A.S.K. should absolutely be featured in season 2.
The Toys That Made Us,MASK and Sky Commanders were my 2 main toys when I was a kid. Man those were the days...
The Toys That Made Us,"Occasionally the damned theme song will get stuck in my head, but only the first few lines."
The Toys That Made Us,Pound Puppies!  Ugh.  Nostalgia!  Glo Worms.  Monchichis.  Dude.  
The Toys That Made Us,My cat would love your childhood
The Toys That Made Us,Don't you dare talk shit about my beloved refrigerator box. That thing was awesome.
The Toys That Made Us,"> It has to be some rich person art bullshit.

Yep.

The Toys That Made Us,Wait. What?
Once Upon a Time... Space,"At first I thought OUAT was a terrible concept. Then I started watching and realized, oh, this is a great concept (and mostly great acting)! Then kept going and went, oh, they’re doing this very poorly."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Fuck that.

It's called FABLES. The show Once tried to be but gave up. 

And the game A Wolf Among Us

That's what I want"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Fuck that, Galavant season 3...let's fucking go!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"They tried something similar from the same people who made Once Upon A Time but didn't greenlight it after making the pilot. 

>Epic, the Disney-themed fairy tale anthology, is not moving forward at ABC.

>The Disney-owned broadcast network has opted to not pick up the drama pilot to series. Ordered to pilot in January under new network topper Craig Erwich, Epic would have marked a homecoming to ABC for Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The duo exec produced Epic alongside writer Brigitte Hales, who previously worked with Horowitz and Kitsis on Once Upon a Time and their short-lived Apple anthology Amazing Stories.

>Sources say the pilot didn’t come in strong despite execs being excited about the script. The pilot was filmed in Ireland, and, because of the pandemic, Kitsis and Horowitz were unable to go on location for the shoot.

Once Upon a Time... Space,Once Upon a Time was awesome. It was so batshit insane that your cant even deacribe story arcs without sounds like you arent on large amounts of drugs
Once Upon a Time... Space,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Space,Disney+ should bring House of Mouse first
Once Upon a Time... Space,I’d rather they do another galavant type Show
Once Upon a Time... Space,Basically the comic Fable?
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I think you're onto something. The actors who depicted those characters in OUaT are not the same people who depicted them in previous adaptations of those stories:

In the 'real world' of OUaT, the story of Cinderella existed which means that the movie where Julie Andrews played the character can exist. But the in their world there is no actress named Dania Ramirez, instead that body/face belongs exclusively to their real world Cinderella.

Now take the same logic and apply to a new Disney property like Star Wars. In our world, the story of SW exists. But if a SW version of OUaT was made, it would play out a scenario in which the 'real' SW characters traveled through a worm-hole the show's version of Earth. In that show, a new actor could depict Luke."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I like the idea of combining the OUAT concept with the Brothers Grimm movie concept that Matt Damon and Heath Ledger starred in. 

Don’t just like “make it dark,” but put a spin on it that makes it more interesting than just “what if fairytale characters existed in a small town.”"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"They would never do it, but they should adapt the Fables comic. Shit would be amazing. Like Twin Peaks meets X Files meets Shrek. 

It’s Once Upon a Time. But… actually good (I’m sorry it was so hammy)"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I feel this way about Greek mythology. Can we get like a game of thrones, high quality show about the Greek gods?"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I love remakes of fairy tales and was prepared to adore Once, but it was awful. The first entire season was the main character literally not believing the basic premise of the show. And then it was just shoe-horning in a ton of properties to try and ""say the thing"" and get people to watch."
Once Upon a Time... Space,or hbo should just make fables instead of this horrible disney abc garbage rip off
Once Upon a Time... Space,Disney is too conservative to do fantasy right.
Once Upon a Time... Space,"The concept of Disney properties having a crossover with each other?

That sounds a lot like Kingdom Hearts lol, but with a dash of anime

Oh yeah, what happened to that Kingdom Hearts Disney+ show that was announced a few years ago?"
Once Upon a Time... Space,What you want is Live Action Kingdom Hearts which is basically Disney’s Game of Thrones.
Once Upon a Time... Space,ABC-fied or woke garbage?
Once Upon a Time... Space,"In the “lost pilots” thread that was posted here a few days ago, there was a similar concept set in monster lore (Frankenstein/Dracula/werewolf/etc)."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Watch the 10th Kingdom. It's a miniseries so only a few episodes.
Once Upon a Time... Space,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Space,"As much as I'd love that, there's no way in hell Disney would adapt Fables literally. I mean, OUaT was a bit dark at times but Fables has GoT-level messed up stuff. And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse. I could see it in AppleTV+, though; CGI-heavy shows with grounded but twisted stories are right up their alley."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"The fucked up thing is that ABC picked up Fables for an adaptation, then dropped it, and then almost immediately launched Once Upon A Time. Given the nature of the property, you can't really say they're violating the IP since it's all based off the public domain, but OUAT is very obviously a Fables rip-off"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"YES YES YES YES YES.

And give it an actual ending, instead of the build up at the end of the comics leading to pretty much a thank you from the creators. Which was nice, but damn.

Hmmm, actually Fables deals with a lot of hardcore stuff. So send it to Hulu I guess."
Once Upon a Time... Space,THIS PERSON FUCKING GETS IT
Once Upon a Time... Space,Amen. Fables was an amazing journey.
Once Upon a Time... Space,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Space,Tad Cooper needs his day in the sun.
Once Upon a Time... Space,What do y'all think of the writers absolute refusal to let Mr. Gold be redeemed? It was ultimately why I stopped watching after Mr. Gold fought so hard to be a good person and threw it all away yet again for like the 4th time. Sort of just felt repetitive.
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I know! When I was watching all those years ago I would tweet just bits of info, my mind was being blown and I had to share it with the world lol.  Then I tweeted the spoiler about Red and finally my brother (one of my 3 followers lol) was like “I know this is about that show you watch, nothing you tweet makes sense, I guess I have to watch it now” He was hooked (😉) from day one!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Yes.

But is difficult. If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action, and that would imply lots of money.

Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, especially since KH2, it would require a massive rework.

Then it's finding children and all the problems associated with it.

First, let's see how Percy Jackson and the Olympians performs..."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"> but is the Kingdom Hearts series still in development?

Yes, KH4 got a trailer drop months ago but it doesn't look like it'll be involved with the Disney stuff, at least from the initial trailer."
Once Upon a Time... Space,THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME
Once Upon a Time... Space,Man Zeus would make it awkward real quick. But it would/could be incredibly fun. Double fun cause my dogs name is Zeus and gets confused when he hears it on tv.
Once Upon a Time... Space,For it to be a tax write off?
Once Upon a Time... Space,Agreed. They carried that show.
Once Upon a Time... Space,Fables is also owned by DC. So yeah Disney can't adapt it.
Once Upon a Time... Space,"If I told you Disney would make a mini series of Pam and Tommy’s sex tape, and Chippendales rise and fall, would you say the same thing?"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I agree with everything you said.

I still won't budge. Too good not to make and if they can simply read a comic then it would be amazing. If someone can adapt fucking Sandman to tv then a true Fables is possible.

Fables or bust not another half ass like Once. I want the whole ass!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"> And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse.

If Mattel was willing to burn Disney with a rival to Disney Princesses despite being the company making Disney dolls I don't think any company fears Disney in regards to new expressions of public domain characters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After_High"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Yup, gave up.  

Instead of making something potentially revolutionary they went literal ABC and made a completely forgettable show.

It's not too late. Fables remains such a high quality that if you just do what Sandman did then you'd have a great show. Learn from the  Y Last Man and Runaways mistakes."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Not sure if you know but Fables came back in 2022 with 12 more issues. Keeps going after 150
Once Upon a Time... Space,Strong jaw and perfect hair!
Once Upon a Time... Space,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Space,Thanks. Now that’s running through my head as I’m working haha
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Man Rumple went from one of the most interesting characters to one of the most annoying. They should’ve just let him stay dead after his sacrifice in season 3, that was a perfect end to his character."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Im not buying that it needs to be live action to be a hit
Once Upon a Time... Space,"> If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action

They literally designed Sora to look like a cartoon so that he could more easily hang out with all the other cartoons he was going to meet on his adventure through cartoon worlds, why would you want a live action version of that?"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"
>Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, 

I will use any opportunity to post this video.

https://youtu.be/4YVTBQCbezQ

I can't even tell you how many times I've watched it over the years."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"KH story would be easy to simplify, just delete 90% of it.  

Nothing of value was lost."
Once Upon a Time... Space,They literally showed Endor in the trailer lol
Once Upon a Time... Space,Hades shows up at the end of the trailer what are you talking about. Well not shows up but its him talking and throwing the fire to donald and goofy
Once Upon a Time... Space,Disney can't adapt it *for free*
Once Upon a Time... Space,ABC did work on a version of Fables in 2008
Once Upon a Time... Space,"But those are not fairy tales, which are one of the main pillars of their brand. I really don't think they are very keen on turning formerly family-friendly characters into assassins, psychopaths, and brutal dictators. Or maybe they are, who knows, Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Oh, I actually didn't. I remember a few years ago that they were planning a mini arc, but I didn't know it was released.

I'll look into that, cheers!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,Cojones out to there
Once Upon a Time... Space,A real ear worm.
Once Upon a Time... Space,No it definitely does. It's not like Disney is famous for its animation or anything like that.
Once Upon a Time... Space,doing it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit would be sick
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I didn't say I wanted that.

I only said that if they want it to be a megahit the easiest way (and, at the same time most difficult way because of the problems it may face) is that. ;)"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"DC, I’ve come to bargain"
Once Upon a Time... Space,">	Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT.

 And in the disney+ rescue rangers movie"
Once Upon a Time... Space,There was no hero quite like *GALAVAAAAANT!*
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I guess if was more of a rhetorical “why would *anyone* want that?”  It’s supposed to be a cartoon, let it be a cartoon.  Kingdom Hearts 3 had multiple cutscenes so long my Xbox tries to turn itself off.  And there were worlds where it was like “long ass cutscene, fight three headless, long ass cutscene, fight two heartless, long ass cutscene, walk into another room, long ass cutscene.”  They clearly want to make a cartoon, just let them make a cartoon."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Sup Marvel, we got The Batman and uh..Peacemaker!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,Tough! Plus every other man-ly value!
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Because Sora looks like a human and is a human. This is the dumbest argument, why would you want a Live Action Avengers if they are drawn as comic characters? Makes no sense"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Mess with him, he'll disembowel you!"
Once Upon a Time... Space,"YEAH! He ruled in every way!

A fairytale *cliche*."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I'm willing to bet that they would have Abuela making a deal with Rumple for the magic candle, and the magic is dying because of him."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Isabella would own a flower shop like snow queen owned ice cream shop. Antonio would be the town's animal control. Camilo would be actor or town arts director. Julieta a doctor. Feel like all those could be added easily. Dolores a... Detective?... But why wouldn't we meet her before? Maybe there's a new page in Henry's book that prophesies some crazy shit (Bruno) and abuela comes in to calm everyone down while (I like your theory) she's bartering with rumps to get her candle back. Mirabel could be under evil queen's spell and freeing her is the trick to save the town
Once Upon a Time... Space,Abuela turns out to somehow be Regina's long-lost grandmother.
Once Upon a Time... Space,"At the end of one episode, we see the silhouette of a woman standing in a hallway while two characters have a super important conversation. Camera zooms out, it's the girl with the super hearing listening to the whole conversation! What? It ends up the whole family is in Storybrook to help out Rumpelstiltskin. But why? Because Mr.Science, aka Frankenstein is sick of getting beaten on by people with magic, so he recruits some magical people he met on his journeys across the world. Then he starts hooking up with another non-magical person who is surrounded by those with magic, since they can understand each other. An older Mirabella."
Once Upon a Time... Space,It turns out the family in Encanto is related to the main character... and rumple.... and a few other characters.
Once Upon a Time... Space,That show ended how many years ago. And was trash
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Haha I haven't thought about Once Upon a Time in quite a while, but yeah it would be amazing to see them keep adding more and more disney stories.

Imagine if they had started the series now, and could put a proper disney+ budget behind it."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I have the feeling that it would be better for Netflix long-term if the original content they have has some form of conclusion. Without a conclusion, many people will decide not to even start a show, because they don't want to be left hanging at the end. Shows that got ""finished"" will be stuff that can still draw people to stay on Netflix. Completed shows is something that will stay forever as a viable offering and strengthen them as unique selling points for Netflix.  

I think that is something they need to consider going forward, but I doubt they will do this retroactively for shows that were already cancelled. 

But maybe I am wrong, maybe it will turn out that only very extreme good hit shows actually have any potential (like Friends or Office) to be seen 3+ years after release."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Netflix wanted to have its own catalog of content to stream but its turning into an archive of unfinished series. I come and go as a subscriber but if this trend continues I'm going to be less likely to start new content with them.  I suppose their numbers are driving their decisions but I wonder what their numbers will look like in 5 years when people have more options and have observed a history of their favorite shows ending early.
Once Upon a Time... Space,even though i'm not a biggest fan of this show (i definitely enjoyed season 2 though!) i really hope another outlet picks this show up and continues the story of the OA!
Once Upon a Time... Space,"To be fair, Netflix was truly a beacon for unique programming. The criticism that they have changed their content model is fair, and subscribers can make their decisions on the platforms they chose. 

I dont agree that people have gone ballistic, rather in this circumstance a beloved series is in jeopardy of fading into the nebulous because of unnecessary broadcast/streaming rights. It paints viewers into a corner to fight for the show's renewal on its current platform."
Once Upon a Time... Space,I get tired of finding shows that last 1-2 seasons and then get dropped. Get so old investing that much time.
Once Upon a Time... Space,Season 2 really set the show up to be so much more. Super disappointed to hear it was canceled JUST as it was about to get better
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I know it's been reiterated a hundred times in this sub, but Netflix's failure to issue a legitimate cancellation notice is uniquely odd here. Even after receiving a request from Forbes, Netflix referred to Cindy Holland's statement, which is....lacking finality?

But not joining the tinfoil-hatters. Nope. The OA is gone. For now. Maybe."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Nobody cared about Santa Clarita Diet, one of the more creative and consistently funny netflix shows."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I'd cancel Netflix if my wife didn't watch some shows on there.
The platform has been going down hill for a while now.

The OA was one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and I am not surprised at all that Netflix cancelled it. That seems to be their MO these days."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I like the show but let's be real, the time between season 1 and 2 was unheard of (Part 1 came out in December 2016 and part 2 came out in March 2019) in any format except for shows that have had revivals and it hadn't earned the audience or the money that Stranger Things had to justify another long production before they could push a new season.

While i do think there is a major issue with Netflix cancelling their original programming (which is going to be dangerous for them considering they're going to lose a large portion of their licensed library sooner rather than later) i don't think The OA is the hill to die on when there is justifiable reasons for cancellation."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Maybe semantics, but didn't Netflix already give the show and its creators ""a chance"" by buying and releasing it?"
Once Upon a Time... Space,Wasn't a huge fan of The OA but it seemed good enough to justify finishing up the story. It was better than a lot of the cringy comedy specials (often by popular actors or whatever who are shitty standup acts).
Once Upon a Time... Space,How is this show?
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I think the main point here is that the creators and writers would have approached the entire series differently if they knew they were only getting 2 seasons. The plan was to tell this story over 5 seasons and there's no way that Netflix was unaware of that when they agreed to make the show.

A fair compromise would have been to tell them during the making of the second season that they would only have three seasons to tell their story. ""Seasons"" of tv shows are shorter than ever and people are gonna stop making ambitious shows if they think they're only gonna get 16-20 episodes."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Business acts like business, people go ballistic."
Once Upon a Time... Space,The show hasn't really been canceled. We are all now part of the show.
Once Upon a Time... Space,"netflix is trying so hard to the be the next generation bargain bin...

this is what happens when you run your company solely on statistics and forget about the art."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I'm not a religious person, but I will be praying for the safety of future Altered Carbon seasons..."
Once Upon a Time... Space,Idk if I agree with that sentiment even though I wish OA wasn’t cancelled. Russian Doll for example is fucking whack and beautiful and fantastic and definitely is not in the wheelhouse of a normal cable company
Once Upon a Time... Space,"Or maybe when it turns out people don't like a show that much, it doesn't make sense to continue making it.

Being willing to axe shows that don't work is a critical part of the shotgun method of giving a wide spectrum of ideas a chance. 

If they don't catch on, you have to stop making them, as continuing to produce hundreds of shows so long as anyone at all wants to see them is a surefire way to go out of business. 

They either make a lot of shows and cancel the ones that don't work, or they make fewer shows to begin with and give them a longer chance. Producing a lot of shows and giving them all a long chance doesn't make sense."
Once Upon a Time... Space,"I've never seen The OA but I've felt this trend, not just for Netflix but among most of the streamers. Streaming used to be an upstart industry taking risks and building up the few original shows they had but now it's big business with many originals in the portfolio and they have to make bottom line decisions the way big businesses do. I still want that happy middle ground where they're big enough to put out cool stuff but not so the big they'll cancel it if it isn't an overnight hit. Like Tom Waits... he's been famous for decades but never a megastar. I want the Tom Waits of streaming services."
Once Upon a Time... Space,You either die a hero or live long enough to become Viacom.
The Indian Detective,I miss Alice. It's a pity they couldn't get her back for this.
The Indian Detective,"Season 1 was good, season 2 was mostly passable, but seasons 3 and 4 were corny cliche-ridden rubbish IMHO. Hope it recovers with this movie."
The Indian Detective,"kind of unrelated but Idris Elba produces EDM on the side and he actually has some BOPS

I love body shot"
The Indian Detective,"Hmm, how to leave a useful remark, without any kind of spoiler? Here goes...the writing of The Fallen Sun is as if a mis-matched team of adolescents thought it would be funny to take the post-it's they'd written of every half-remembered superhero pic and lotto-ball-bowl them—it is that coherent - sheesh. The first three decisions Luther makes or are made against him, as so wildly out of character, I had to stop the stream to check that I wasn't watching a parody. The pacing of the story build/development is as if they just raced to check every box 'yes'; yes,  we've covered a, b, c, etc. Illogical, nonsensical, VERY different vibe from 'Luther'. Whiplash inducing. If you like the Luther series - skip this."
The Indian Detective,"Saw this in theatres. Absolutely loved it. It was a dark pulsating crime thriller with a great lead and a compelling villain. They don't make movies like this anymore. It wasn't exactly Fincher but the tone reminded me off Girl with the golden with the dragon tattoo.

If you can see it on the big screen, you should. Its miles better than the mediocre Marvel DC movies that are the standard these days"
The Indian Detective,"The show never recovered after the first 2 seasons, don't know if I want to come back."
The Indian Detective,Perfectly cromulent.
The Indian Detective,"Can't wait to see this.

> released on Netflix

Oh, for fuck sake."
The Indian Detective,Police are portrayed as useless.
The Indian Detective,Stupid! Too many scenes were beyond pathetic and unrealistic. We couldn’t finish it! The writers were horrible.. Come on Idris you are better than this!!
The Indian Detective,Went to shit after season 2
The Indian Detective,"The movie was horrible.  so predictable, horrible acting/script.  I'm so disappointed as I was really looking forward to it.  I know it was BBC, but it seems like almost every Netflix movie is a dud lately."
The Indian Detective,You might want to finish the last episode of season five…
The Indian Detective,Oh... Well at least I know this beforehand now.
The Indian Detective,Great Villain and a great actress.
The Indian Detective,"No duck face flapping all over the screen?  Couldn't have asked for a better denouement to Luther's story.  This makes me retrospectively like her even more as a character since now I know that the writers didn't wear out her welcome like a bad penny.

I'll refresh my memory on season 1 before I pick up and start season 2 blind."
The Indian Detective,Can you just give us a rundown?
The Indian Detective,"Can anyone else chime in with their opinions on this? I've never watched Luther but I like Elba. I'm wondering if I watch it, whether there's a point where I'm better off stopping."
The Indian Detective,"I really enjoyed season 2, but the death of a certain character in that one really spelled the death of the show imo. It just wasn’t the same afterwards."
The Indian Detective,"and he's not bad. Driss the Londoner was his nom de plume in clubs, not sure if he still uses it"
The Indian Detective,"First comment I’ve actually agreed with, this film was so jarring it felt like one of those screen plays written by an AI, absolute shit do not watch this film"
The Indian Detective,"Tamer, less gritty than Fincher. It was an ok film with some great moments"
The Indian Detective,It's in theaters too.
The Indian Detective,Because they generally are
The Indian Detective,"There was an interview recently where they heavily hinted at bringing her back in a sequel, so I would say that scene was as ambiguous as it was supposed to be."
The Indian Detective,You might want to watch the last episode before you watch this
The Indian Detective,Sure thing Charles
The Indian Detective,"Do you like police dramas with ever-more-ridiculous criminals? Do you like like individual detectives squaring off against masterminds that somehow entrap and kill entire SWAT teams, yet stop to taunt the detective? If yes, you’re going to fucking LOVE Luther. 

And I don’t mean this ironically. I enjoyed all seasons."
The Indian Detective,"It's a police procedural set in a world that's intentionally a bit comic booky.

The character of Luther is not a good man. He has a strict absolute view on what is right and what is wrong. He is right, so anyone in his way is wrong. And anything he does to stop the villains in his life is right. Even if that's someone who isn't actually doing anything wrong.

The bad guys of the week aren't just normal detective show killers, to match Luther's self perception of himself as a hero, they're proper villains, typically quite cartoonish. 

The show presents itself as quite grounded but it doesn't take long before it shows its true colours, and it rubs a lot of people the wrong way if they went in expecting something different. 

It's a show that is more interested in being entertaining that realistic. 

The other aspect is a character that is introduced in the first episode called Alice, who is a fan favourite and an agent of chaos whenever she's on screen. She is not around for the whole show, so a lot of people perceive a drop in quality when she is not in a series.

In general it is a fun show to watch, with a unique approach to the genre, but it is a bit rocky at times. The good thing is that there really aren't many episodes, so it's an easy watch. The longest series was series 1 with 6 episodes."
The Indian Detective,"I'm the same person from above, but it's a British show with typically British very short seasons, so it's not a huge time investment. Season 1 is only 6 episodes and that's the longest one. Season 2 is only 4 episodes. It's a steady progression downwards in quality IMHO, so if you find season 2 bad, you should probably stop there. I didn't learn my lesson until later, but unlike a show like Heroes\*, the time investment wasn't so enormous that I felt like I wanted a receipt at the end so I could collect those hours back at the end of my life and use them to watch grass grow or paint dry instead.

*\*Obligatory disclaimer that the writers' strike supposedly ruining Heroes is a viral internet myth. It is misinformation. The show was ruined because the writers were idiots; also note that the strike was between seasons 2 and 3, not between 1 and 2. Spread the word in every Heroes thread.*"
The Indian Detective,"Nah just watch it all, season 3 is good, 4 is a step down but then 5 is better and this is apparently goodish"
The Indian Detective,It's a [Batman show without Batman](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/luther-is-a-batman-show-without-batman/)
The Indian Detective,"A lot of Luther is elevated by Elba’s performance, if you like him you’ll definitely enjoy it. Though earlier seasons are definitely stronger as the later seasons become burdened with trying to keep raising the stakes. Similar to Craig’s bond films, your suspension of disbelief gets called on more as the series progresses"
The Indian Detective,"Yeah, good take...perhaps it felt so jarring because Sydney/Bing was hallucinating - heh, also, your comment helped me clarify what I actually felt slogging through the parts I did watch - annoyed. It was NOT Luther."
The Indian Detective,"You're right, I never did finish it actually. Might as well start from the beginning before watching the movie. Thanks for the heads up."
The Indian Detective,"I suppose it depends on how plausible we're talking. Are they well written villains? Is there a valid reason why they're able to do what they do? Or are we talking ""Sherlock season 3"" here?"
The Indian Detective,"Those final two sentences really threw me for a loop, but points for internet comment originality. I am forced to like this comment.

I guess being a big fan of shows like Homicide: Life on the Street kinda disqualifies me from understanding the appeal of a show like this (unless Ruth Wilson is there to chew the scenery, I'll watch her in almost anything)."
The Indian Detective,"5 is mostly trash but it’s still watchable because alice is in it. 

Once Luther leaves the force it became a very different show tbh and the whole police doing it by the book vs Luther’s methods is pushed to the background. Will be checking this out to see how they handle it."
The Indian Detective,"Ffs just watch a couple episodes and make your own mind up. You say you're an Idris Elba fan, yet you haven't seen arguably his most prominent role?"
The Indian Detective,"More Season One (consistently), if Sherlock was a normal detective. In addition, no character (other than Luther himself) has plot armour."
The Indian Detective,"Enjoying an actor's work doesn't mean that I immediately run out and watch everything that they've ever been in. Considering the amount of high quality TV that's out there, I also prefer to know whether a show goes in the toilet at some point so I know when to stop watching. Do you also recommend that people watch every single episode of Heroes or The Walking Dead? 

But no, God forbid that we should try to discuss television in a television discussion forum. Why do we even have this review posted here anyway? Everyone should have to watch every single piece of entertainment for themselves to find out whether it's any good or not."
The Indian Detective,"There's like 12 episodes of Luther lol if you're curious watch it, if not don't."
The Indian Detective,Yes it was. And Suchet was the best Poirot
The Indian Detective,"Suchet is the only actor to ever have the blessing of Agatha Christie’s family and full support of her estate. They gave him unpublished books and unfinished stories to work with along character studies and background research with confirmation that he is everything she intended. To date, he’s the only one who has been welcomed with open arms to the family. According to the descendants of Christie, *he is Poirot*."
The Indian Detective,I was never big into detectives or Agatha Christie but my mom loved Poirot and I used to sit there and watch this show with her because it was so good and Suchet was such a great Poirot.
The Indian Detective,"This is by far and away my favorite detective series. Suchet is a force of nature as Poirot. Honestly, I can't enjoy the new iterations of the character because of him. I mean, they did every single short story and novel, for better or worse."
The Indian Detective,My mom introduced me to this show years ago and I now have a BritBox subscription solely for it. It’s just so good.
The Indian Detective,"This is 100% my comfort rewatch show, it’s seemingly on a constant loop for me. Worth every penny of my britbox subscription."
The Indian Detective,"David Suchet shows us how he does Poirot's voice

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MZJpGq6W1bw"
The Indian Detective,He is the reason why I cannot watch the new one. Its a parody in comparison to this man.
The Indian Detective,"Myself and the mrs constantly throw out his variously butchered idioms, his one about the ‘sleepy dogs’ especially."
The Indian Detective,Ah Hastings
The Indian Detective,Anyone going to mention Joan Hickson as Miss Marple? I can’t think of anyone who was more fit for that role. Her and David Suchet even met for the Agatha Christie centenary special.
The Indian Detective,This style of detective show is a true interactive experience as you try to work it out before Hercule.
The Indian Detective,It's a really fun show to spot famous actors in smaller parts.
The Indian Detective,"Imma let you finish, but allow me to offer Granada's Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett for your consideration."
The Indian Detective,Suchet on a broadbean!
The Indian Detective,I can’t bear to watch my of the Kenneth Branagh ones. It should be a crime to cast anyone else as Poirot while David Suchet is still working.
The Indian Detective,"It set up the clues honestly, was careful and immersive, confident and charming, subtle, had one of the most faithfully written and portrayed versions of Poirot ever... Pretty much had everything going for it. No wonder it lasted as long as it did."
The Indian Detective,It is truly remarkable to see an actor that dedicated such an enormous portion of their life and career to play a singular character. David Suchet is an example other actors should follow.
The Indian Detective,"I began reading Christie as a child because my mother loved her so much, and we watched this show (and still do) along with Miss Marple.  It will always have a special place in my heart."
The Indian Detective,"One of my favorite shows. Rarity in pacing, direction and acting."
The Indian Detective,"I love this show. It was my first mystery series, I watched with my parents all the time. Still have some of the DVDs."
The Indian Detective,"If you love this series and enjoy audiobooks, I highly recommend Murder on the Orient Express narrated by Dan Stevens. I knew Stevens was a good actor, but his version of Poirot is superb, sounds just like Suchet."
The Indian Detective,The Art Deco scenography is so beautiful
The Indian Detective,It also had a great Art Deco graphics intro and wonderful theme song.
The Indian Detective,"Loved the show until they got rid of the side kick (Captain 'I say!' Hastings) and Miss Lemon. 

From there it went downhill and we quit watching."
The Indian Detective,"I have read the whole Poirot series, and agree that D. Suchet acting was on the spot, also, he matched the description well (egg-shaped head is mentioned way too often, though).  


Nevertheless, the quality of the series is inferior to Sherlock Holmes, unfortunately. The introduction of Poirot's brother is made with self-irony by the author, yet still looks like a cheap out of nowhere move."
The Indian Detective,I'm looking to get into the Poirot show. What are the top 5 episodes I should watch first?
The Indian Detective,Columbo has entered the chat
The Indian Detective,Because Suchet was perfect Poirot. It is that easy.
The Indian Detective,I watched somewhere how he got into the character of poirot and apparently he has a special coin he used to help him get the right posture and uptight look he has. That and the moustache.
The Indian Detective,I’m Benoit Blanc pilled and I do believe Benoit owes his existence (in part) to Poirot. I pay homage
The Indian Detective,"He's the definitive Poirot. Like they should not try doing it with someone else for a long time

Jeremy Brett, to a lesser extent, is the classic Sherlock Holmes for me. Somehow, Sherlock Holmes as a character is more open to different takes / interpretations / incarnations, whereas there's just one Poirot"
The Indian Detective,Harry and the Hendersons was here.
The Indian Detective,Where can one watch this?
The Indian Detective,I know what I am watching tonight
The Indian Detective,"While Suchet was awesome, I will never get these ""whoevers family"" as the people judging how close anything is to what the author was aiming for. They're mostly just after them moneys, not authentic/close to books presentation."
The Indian Detective,Colombo was better! Downvote if you agree!
The Indian Detective,Rian Johnson should adapt this instead of doing a derivative with more knives out stuff
The Indian Detective,[deleted]
The Indian Detective,SPOILER ALERT!!!
The Indian Detective,"Suchet was fantastic and I can’t imagine another Poirot. However, the show is way too formulaic and a bit derivative for my taste.

Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett. That’s the good stuff."
The Indian Detective,"those were some great times when this show aired. trying to figure it all out before the end of the show. 

i wonder why we do not get a new kind of hercule poirot tv serie or miss marple show. but finding the right people for that is maybe just as hard in finding the new james bond."
The Indian Detective,“Madame is mending the car!”
The Indian Detective,"Absolutely loved it.

Finally watched Curtain a couple of years ago long after it aired.

I was ugly crying lol"
The Indian Detective,"I totally agree. Ustinov and Finneys takes were not bad, but different. The Branagh Orient Express felt like a modern take, kind of what Daniel Craig was for Bond (but not as good). 

Edit: Yes the Branagh-mustache was ridiculous, just as the complete Death on the Nile, but his Orient was quite ok imho. 

By the way : if someone happens to be in western germany, there is a small town called Hillesheim in the rural ""Eifel""-Area. You can easily enjoy nature there, but there is a [Hotel with crime themed rooms](https://www.krimihotel.de/) and solid german food (the food is good but nothing special). They also have crime-dinners and escape rooms.  [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFAf0FoaU5/) are some of my private pictures.

Also there is a [murder mystery themed cafe](http://www.kriminalhaus.de/cafe.htm) with nooks and tables decorated for various series of murder mysteries and a book store. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BztBDHandFi/) are private pictures again."
The Indian Detective,"I still don’t know how I feel about him making Poirot so religious by the end, though"
The Indian Detective,"I had read somewhere that Agatha's daughter Rosalind met David Suchet back when the show first started and had said she wished her mother had met him because he did such a terrific job.

Edit: I went back and found the article

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/arts/television/david-suchet-reflects-on-25-years-as-poirot.html"
The Indian Detective,I believe Joan Hickson was given the nod by Agatha herself when they met many years ago and she said to Joan that when she was older she will be her miss Marple…
The Indian Detective,"Same….except I cant watch this or many other shows now because a Covid induced Heart attack took my 70yo mum back in October and they all remind me of her and I sat on the couch binging on them together. 

At some point I hope this situation reverses where I can watch these shows again to remind myself of our time together but at the moment its still too painful."
The Indian Detective,"I’ve never read one of the books, or intentionally sat down to watch one of the shows or movies, yet even I know this has to be one of the best adaptations ever made in any genre."
The Indian Detective,"I think the only notable one they didn't do were some short stories that were rewritten later on as well as the play ""Black Coffee"". Suchet did do a live reading of the play and considers it ""complete""."
The Indian Detective,"For one, Branagh has the wrong head."
The Indian Detective,The whole show is free on YouTube tho
The Indian Detective,uhh the whole series is on youtube lol
The Indian Detective,It’s always such a shock to hear Suchet’s real deep and velvety voice. He really makes it seem like a little magic trick turning into Poirot :)
The Indian Detective,"That is incredible, the transition to Poirot's smile, such a talent. Thank you for the link."
The Indian Detective,"It butchers the character. Poirot has to be a rather ridiculous, physically awkward man. That’s why people continually underestimate him despite his fame; he doesn’t match the British standards of masculinity."
The Indian Detective,Branagh is TERRIBLE as Poirot. And his Russian accent in Tenet is utterly pantomimist. I’ve liked him in other productions but his obsession with awfully camp accents is destroying his legacy.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"

Ultimate Beastmaster India,I would love to see an obstacle course show without the added hours and hours of backstories and shitty commentary like American Ninja Warriror.  
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ♥
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,/r/UltimateBeastmaster
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I thought there was a xenomorph when I saw the thumbnail
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Wow Sylvester, where did you get the crazy idea for an obstacle course show?"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,That looked fucking stupid.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,This is like something you'd see on 30 Rock as a parody of a show. 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster India,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I felt the book was the author blowing himself for hundreds of pages.  Especially his karate stance and magic first aid kit.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Couldn't last through one episode, i enjoyed the audio book."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I enjoyed this book but it is also has some of the most over top cringey dialogue ever.

He's so preachy and self righteous that his line about cigarettes actually made me quit smoking

“I smoked in those days because, like everyone else in the world who smokes, I wanted to die at least as much as I wanted to live."""
Ultimate Beastmaster India,It was cancelled after one season so you weren't the only person who disliked it.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,One day they might actually cast an Australian to play an Australian
Ultimate Beastmaster India,The book was so self-indulgent that it felt cringey.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"We can agree to disagree on this aspect. I felt he approached his life with shame and humility. Among other things, I wish the tv show had focused more on Khaderbhai’s role as Philosopher-King and father figure to Lin. I will say, however, that the character of Lin was not the most interesting character in the novel, probably the least in fact."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I am with you on that.  The guy made himself a savior and Batman.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I appreciate your view.  I loved the beginning of the book but by the end, I was so tired of the author.  I have many Indian coworkers and at first I was hoping that the book was more descriptive of life in India.  By the end, I knew i would never discuss the book with anyone from that country.  I might have had the wrong expectations going in.  I felt like it was a romance novel for an audience of one."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Running around saving lives, righting wrongs, fighting people, dealing drugs, making love to women, being a gangster. I don't really believe half the things he's writing, especially that the whole time he's doing all these objectively bad things, we're supposed to consider him to be a man of peace. Also, he was a bank robber and escaped jail in Australia. He's pretty unsympathetic."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,the worst thing for me is that he sets up what is basically a burn center and he has nothing but a first aid kit.  good luck with the band aids and dried up ointment from 20 years ago.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"The Get Down was popular with a totally different demographic than Bill Nye, than Marco Polo, than Sandler movies, than Fuller House... They don't give a fuck about quality. It's 100% about spreading out to people who didn't previously subscribe and who now do. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I don't think so, because they aren't trying to be a high quality brand, but a something for everyone brand, like you said. Hence everything from Trollhunters to Bloodline to Sense8.

They obviously want to dominate the market and having fewer but generally stronger products aimed at one specific group (people looking for high quality drama, whatever that means), probably won't work for that.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,You might hate them but people are apparently watching the fuck out of Fuller House and those Sandler flicks.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,I don't think Netflix has ever been synonymous with quality. Hemlock Grove was one of their earliest productions.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Netflix has had shitty shows for a long time. You just weren't hearing about them
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"People currently seem to give Netflix the  newcomer ""can do no wrong"". But if hbo or ABC puts out one crap show in a season they get hell. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"In a way, yes. I don't think they have the same quality control that HBO has. By quality control I don't mean completely interfering with a creator's vision, but sort of, using their expertise to help guide the show towards something good; maximize the probability that it'll be successful. Netflix, I think, is great in some ways -- like the way they use data to figure out on a surprisingly granular level what type of shows they want. But the downside is, I think their priority right now is to just to keep making new content that they know their audience is likely to watch. They have a certain number of hours they want to produce every year to meet their ultimate goal of having half of their library be Netflix originals. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I believe Fuller House is actually the most watch Netflix original worldwide. 

Anyway, I think ""everything for everybody"" is exactly the thing that works for them. It's what makes whole families stay subscribed non-stop cause everybody can find something to watch.

As for the prestige, with more and more original content, it won't be the so much the Netflix brand that will make you check something out, but the news that famous director x or academy award winning actress y is doing something for/with Netflix."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"No, because their goal was never to be HBO. They want a big market share, not to be a niche product. Fuller House and those Sandler movies are more watched than any prestige drama they have. Netflix is so big they have no need to choose what to specialize in, they can specialize in everything and you don't have to watch everything they put out just because it says it's an ""original."""
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I wish they would buy old shows. I fully believe they should have Mash, Beverly Hillbillys, Knight Rider, Threes Company, Golden Girls, and older cartoons/cartoons from the 90s, etc. Especially since they are putting more and more original content in the library."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,Netflix doesn't do prestige programming. Their model is to have something for everyone.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"I think buying so many bad independent movies hurts their brand and customer base. Most subscribers would better watch a Sandler movie than a disappointing original movie (think The Discovery or many other recent ones).
Regarding the TV series, these need to be for every demographic and cover many international territories too. Half of the ones you mentioned I liked a lot, and probably there are many outside here that liked the other half just as much."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Netflix for a while now has dropped the ball on adding new and good quality videos. We have a Family Video store near my house which is exactly like block buster and I'm always looking at the older movies and going "" oh yeah this movie is great , they don't have this on netflix."" And I still don't know why I pay for it. They don't update their episodes either until like years later it seems. I'm thinking of truly droping them. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,They are like what major music labels used to be. Sure they will sign Britney Spears in a heartbeat. It's the bread and butter that affords them to expand their horizons and allow more risks. 
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Speaking only from experience I would agree with you.

The ""Netflix Original"" banner no longer means anything to me personally.
Maybe it was pure chance, but seeing that pop up used to be a ""seal of approval"" almost, and I could expect a solid show.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,The 13 episodes per season doesn't help either
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"The vast majority of Netflix originals are bad, even the majority of the TV shows Netflix has continued are just bad. Add to this that the streaming movie library is so much direct to video garbage.


But they do have enough great shows to keep me subscribed and the quality of the streaming and the UI are still top of the line and the gold standard. 
  "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Personally, yes. It's getting to the point where even if you WANT to keep up with all the shows, you can't do it. Netflix benefits from not having to program their shows within timeslots like cable TV channels. But the downside of that is that they're putting out too much volume with little controls. They keep releasing new shows every week, but are the new shows actually worth watching? Are they worth keeping alive? How many Netflix viewers actually finish every show? 

Say what you want about Hulu, but they've been pretty good about keeping their Exclusive originals lineup lean and manageable. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,You don't get what they're doing. At all. They were never HBO.  
Ultimate Beastmaster India,there is no demographic for bill nye saves the world
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"That's interesting.  I can understand that.  

You're not likely to cancel a fairly inexpensive membership once you're on board, right?"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Netflix isn't trying to be exclusively high-brow entertainment, but they certainly want to be viewed with the same level of respect as Amazon Prime, HBO, and FX. Otherwise they wouldn't keep trying to break into the Awards circuit."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Around the time Marvel announced their Netflix shows, Netflix was the golden boy of TV. House of Cards had just been nominated for a fuck ton of awards and Kevin Spacey made that speech saying that binging is the future of TV."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Well, HBO doesn't put out that many new shows. So a bad show sticks out like a sore thumb.

ABC puts out all kinds of crap. They almost don't even belong in the ""quality television"" discussion."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"A lot of it has to do with the way ABC/CW/etc. treat their shows.

Netflix appears to give the creators free reign over the show, which can be awesome or it can be bad. The other networks always have their fingers all over the show and you can tell because shows on the same network will have a lot of thematic similarities. "
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"You wouldn't consider House Of Cards or The Get Down to be ""prestige"" programming?  Or do you mean that they don't, as a brand, promise to do it across the board?"
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Yeah for every show like House of Cards or The Crown, there's Marco Polo, Fuller House, or Iron Fist."
Ultimate Beastmaster India,They sure as fuck wanted to be HBO.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,That's fair.
Ultimate Beastmaster India,"Yup, bounce rate. As long as people stay subscribed, they don't need to be thrilled. They just need to stay a member."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"**INFORMATION ON THE SHOW:**

The 10-episode event series will feature 108 competitors, 18 from each country, in total.

Ultimate Beastmaster China,"""The medium amount of reefer smoked by 18-34 year olds during the program was considerable."" Best quote of the article. "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"as a 26 year old, I always thought of adult swim as way pavers. I remember falling asleep on the living room couch of a 4 room, 700 sq ft apartment instead of in my bed so I could watch some samurai champloo before bed at 11 at night as a 14 year old. I even vaguely remember flcl and even after all these years, the one thing that stood out was the fu-ri-ku-ri television robot. 

are millenials the generation of nostalgia? have we progressed to quickly? "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"I'll never forget that fucking April Fool's Day. 4 years ago.

Midnight, seeing what Adult Swim had in store for this April Fool's. Steve Blum apparently made a vague random tweet earlier that day. But I didn't see it.

Soon The Room played. Again, like last year. but then suddenly *boom*. Motherfucking TOM. Then Bleach started playing. Thought it was a good joke. Then the bumpers played. ""No way."", I thought. Then I was watching the end of the Cell Saga. Holy **SHIT.** Then it was Gundam, then Trigun. Goddamn. 

Ironically it was one of the highest ratings Adult Swim got in years. A month later, Toonami was back. It went through a bit of rollercoaster of ratings. A few duds(Casshern, Samurai 7) but also a few golds(Kill la Kill, Space Dandy, One Punch Man).

Now, Toonami is going to give us a new season of Samurai Jack, and new season of FLCL, a new Production IG series(people who made IGPX), and (next month) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Ultimate Beastmaster China,I was in a really bad place 15 years ago and this late night spot gave me smiles as a preteen. Lots of laughs and some great anime. It really brightened up my life till college. I actually met my husband on the adult swim message boards. He still watches some of the shows :) 
Ultimate Beastmaster China,You didn't mention Robot Chicken. The Star Wars specials are some of the most priceless stop-motion gems ever.
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Awesome post.

I tried to think of why they would cancel ATHF, and I now believe that it has to do with the fact that Adult Swim is stronger than ever. That makes me feel confident that they will bring back ATHF when they need a boost in ratings. The show needs to recharge for a few years.

Master Shake and Carl are two of the greatest characters in the entire Adult Swim lineup."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,Wow this is incredible. I didn't realize I witnessed the birth of Adult Swim. What a ride it's been. Thanks for this fucking amazing post. 
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"No mention of ""Venture Brothers"". For Shame."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,">(The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?)

I care."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,I used to stay up till 2 just to watch Gundam Wing uncensored. It was such a happy jolt to my 16-year-old self when the characters would swear. I also had a huge lady boner over Quatre.
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"I'd point out that season 3 or Moral Orel was quite serious, but I guess it wasn't really serialized that much. Still one of my favorite shows."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"I remember when it first started. I was a teenager, and was just wowed by the abject absurdity of shows like Space Ghost, Sealab 2021, and Aqua Teen. It also introduced me to anime through Cowboy Bebop. The downside, at the time, was that it only aired on Thursdays and Sundays at midnight. I'd not yet accepted my night owl tendencies, so I didn't get to catch it every week. But it was definitely a reason to stay up late. I was particularly obsessed with Space Ghost and Brak. It was the Napster era, and I made an entire playlist of Brakisms. Over an hour of nonstop Brak. It was a good time to be young and weird."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,Holy fuck I miss Mission Hill

Ultimate Beastmaster China,And yet Korgoth was never picked up :(
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"I got the honor to meet and chat with C. Martin Croker, voice of Zorak and Moltar on Space Ghost. He said originally that Lazzo wanted to create new Hannah Barbara serials from old animation reels of A-List characters like Yogi Bear. They were told no and instead could purchase the animation reels, and rights, to D-List characters like Space Ghost and Sealab 2020. 

Of those reels was the Wacky Races, which Lazzo wanted to take and create something called ""Wacky Races Coast-to-Cost"" which would take all the previous episode animation reels and make one big event out of it. And, as Croker said, Lazzo had a fever dream the night before of production of the prototype in '93 and instead told the team they'd be creating a new adult themed cartoon talk show. Long story short, the prototype is presented, green lit, and aired as Space Ghost Coast-to-Coast. "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"adult swim bumps basically created my current day taste in music

also, adult swim has saved many shows. why wont they bring back wonder showzen?  why was that on MTV2 and not adult swim?  best show ive ever seen"

For those who wish to reminisce on the old CN and includes Adult Swim. Plays out like you're actually watching tv back then. First timers should check out the schedule to see what it's all about.

Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Space Ghost Coast to Coast, pre-Adult Swin days, were just amazing. I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it, but I remember watching it at my grandparents house when I was about 8--- and my mother walking in to see why I was up so late and what I was watching--- and laughing significantly harder than I was. 

The entire thing was bizarre.

I also remember those old Hana Barbara Space Ghost + Bird Man + Herculoid episodes that were airing late at night with laugh tracks that my father found both nostalgic and hysterical.

I loved it, because my parents would watch cartoons with me, even though I didn't really understand half the jokes."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"I don't even watch TV. Never really did. But I've always kept up at least a little with Adult Swim. These days I like getting stoned and watching Off The Air. Superjail satisfies my twisted side. I want Brak back.

Brak 4 President"
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"This is a great write up.  I was in college when it started, we had a fun group meeting up to watch that insanity when it was on. Sealab was my favorite.  When Venture Bros. hit, though, wow. 

It's also where I first saw Cowboy Bebop, unreal.  "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Man...I remember staying up late to watch FLCL when it first aired. I was 13, and wasn't supposed to be up that late, so I had to turn the volume almost all the way down where I couldn't even understand the dialogue. All I heard was mumbling and the (amazingly done) soundtrack behind the crazy visuals, and together it made for such a surreal experience, it was amazing. I remember craving the feeling it gave me and I'd scour the internet for anything related to FLCL. This was long before youtube so the best I got was a fanmade page with some sparse info and I must have read it over 20 times just waiting for Sunday night to come again.

 The whole thing had such a profound effect on 13 year old me and I attribute so much of my taste in movies/TV/music to sneaking episodes of FLCL on adult swim. 
"
Ultimate Beastmaster China,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Great write up, Adult Swim revitalized the animation industry in some aspects, leading to more animation jobs within the country, and given entertainment the ability to ""be weird"" again. I don't think we'd have Bob's Burgers, Archer, Bojack Horseman, and more without it."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Alan Resnick is just by favorite person in the world, and I follow all of his writings, and took part in the ARG, and I can't wait to see what's coming next"
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Most importantly. It gave us Rick and Morty.

In all seriousness, I remember watching adult swim as a child and being engulfed. I would stay up late to watch these not so child appropriate shows and giggle my ass off. Thank you Adult Swim for bringing joy to all us TV addicted kids around the world. "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,">It boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P

Funny thing, I barely knew about Adult Swim and never watched before I started listening to MF Doom, Madlib and Dangermouse. Those guys legitimized the channel for me. The first time I watched it there was a commercial or promo that used ""Accordian"" and I was sold. "
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Frisky Dingo was everything. I love how you can see and hear the roots of so many Archer memes, while still having a show that stood on its own and was honestly edgier in many ways. Although no bus driver ever knows how to respond when I ask if they go to all pet stores."
Ultimate Beastmaster China,And now Adult Swim has turned into a game where you try and find the Adult Swim sign hidden in pictures
Ultimate Beastmaster China,"Oblong ....

Anyone? "

Ultimate Beastmaster France,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ♥
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.

Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster France,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Ultimate Beastmaster France,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it’s be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don’t care. Evidently there’s something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what’s going on. 

It’s one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn’t going to understand the world—isn’t given enough information to—and likely isn’t going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn’t get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn’t be the norm."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"It’s a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren’t up to snuff in 2020.

I’m worried it’s not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they’re not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,This is a great primer but you shouldn’t have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I’ll watch season 2.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,Appreciate the help!
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Ultimate Beastmaster France,It’s a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you’d feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Ultimate Beastmaster France,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn’t at all hard to follow
Ultimate Beastmaster France,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven’t played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."

Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"The Get Down was popular with a totally different demographic than Bill Nye, than Marco Polo, than Sandler movies, than Fuller House... They don't give a fuck about quality. It's 100% about spreading out to people who didn't previously subscribe and who now do. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I don't think so, because they aren't trying to be a high quality brand, but a something for everyone brand, like you said. Hence everything from Trollhunters to Bloodline to Sense8.

They obviously want to dominate the market and having fewer but generally stronger products aimed at one specific group (people looking for high quality drama, whatever that means), probably won't work for that.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,You might hate them but people are apparently watching the fuck out of Fuller House and those Sandler flicks.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,I don't think Netflix has ever been synonymous with quality. Hemlock Grove was one of their earliest productions.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Netflix has had shitty shows for a long time. You just weren't hearing about them
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"People currently seem to give Netflix the  newcomer ""can do no wrong"". But if hbo or ABC puts out one crap show in a season they get hell. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"In a way, yes. I don't think they have the same quality control that HBO has. By quality control I don't mean completely interfering with a creator's vision, but sort of, using their expertise to help guide the show towards something good; maximize the probability that it'll be successful. Netflix, I think, is great in some ways -- like the way they use data to figure out on a surprisingly granular level what type of shows they want. But the downside is, I think their priority right now is to just to keep making new content that they know their audience is likely to watch. They have a certain number of hours they want to produce every year to meet their ultimate goal of having half of their library be Netflix originals. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I believe Fuller House is actually the most watch Netflix original worldwide. 

Anyway, I think ""everything for everybody"" is exactly the thing that works for them. It's what makes whole families stay subscribed non-stop cause everybody can find something to watch.

As for the prestige, with more and more original content, it won't be the so much the Netflix brand that will make you check something out, but the news that famous director x or academy award winning actress y is doing something for/with Netflix."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"No, because their goal was never to be HBO. They want a big market share, not to be a niche product. Fuller House and those Sandler movies are more watched than any prestige drama they have. Netflix is so big they have no need to choose what to specialize in, they can specialize in everything and you don't have to watch everything they put out just because it says it's an ""original."""
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I wish they would buy old shows. I fully believe they should have Mash, Beverly Hillbillys, Knight Rider, Threes Company, Golden Girls, and older cartoons/cartoons from the 90s, etc. Especially since they are putting more and more original content in the library."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,Netflix doesn't do prestige programming. Their model is to have something for everyone.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I think buying so many bad independent movies hurts their brand and customer base. Most subscribers would better watch a Sandler movie than a disappointing original movie (think The Discovery or many other recent ones).
Regarding the TV series, these need to be for every demographic and cover many international territories too. Half of the ones you mentioned I liked a lot, and probably there are many outside here that liked the other half just as much."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Netflix for a while now has dropped the ball on adding new and good quality videos. We have a Family Video store near my house which is exactly like block buster and I'm always looking at the older movies and going "" oh yeah this movie is great , they don't have this on netflix."" And I still don't know why I pay for it. They don't update their episodes either until like years later it seems. I'm thinking of truly droping them. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,They are like what major music labels used to be. Sure they will sign Britney Spears in a heartbeat. It's the bread and butter that affords them to expand their horizons and allow more risks. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Speaking only from experience I would agree with you.

The ""Netflix Original"" banner no longer means anything to me personally.
Maybe it was pure chance, but seeing that pop up used to be a ""seal of approval"" almost, and I could expect a solid show.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,The 13 episodes per season doesn't help either
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"The vast majority of Netflix originals are bad, even the majority of the TV shows Netflix has continued are just bad. Add to this that the streaming movie library is so much direct to video garbage.


But they do have enough great shows to keep me subscribed and the quality of the streaming and the UI are still top of the line and the gold standard. 
  "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Personally, yes. It's getting to the point where even if you WANT to keep up with all the shows, you can't do it. Netflix benefits from not having to program their shows within timeslots like cable TV channels. But the downside of that is that they're putting out too much volume with little controls. They keep releasing new shows every week, but are the new shows actually worth watching? Are they worth keeping alive? How many Netflix viewers actually finish every show? 

Say what you want about Hulu, but they've been pretty good about keeping their Exclusive originals lineup lean and manageable. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,You don't get what they're doing. At all. They were never HBO.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,there is no demographic for bill nye saves the world
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"That's interesting.  I can understand that.  

You're not likely to cancel a fairly inexpensive membership once you're on board, right?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Netflix isn't trying to be exclusively high-brow entertainment, but they certainly want to be viewed with the same level of respect as Amazon Prime, HBO, and FX. Otherwise they wouldn't keep trying to break into the Awards circuit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Around the time Marvel announced their Netflix shows, Netflix was the golden boy of TV. House of Cards had just been nominated for a fuck ton of awards and Kevin Spacey made that speech saying that binging is the future of TV."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Well, HBO doesn't put out that many new shows. So a bad show sticks out like a sore thumb.

ABC puts out all kinds of crap. They almost don't even belong in the ""quality television"" discussion."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"A lot of it has to do with the way ABC/CW/etc. treat their shows.

Netflix appears to give the creators free reign over the show, which can be awesome or it can be bad. The other networks always have their fingers all over the show and you can tell because shows on the same network will have a lot of thematic similarities. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"You wouldn't consider House Of Cards or The Get Down to be ""prestige"" programming?  Or do you mean that they don't, as a brand, promise to do it across the board?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Yeah for every show like House of Cards or The Crown, there's Marco Polo, Fuller House, or Iron Fist."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,They sure as fuck wanted to be HBO.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,That's fair.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Yup, bounce rate. As long as people stay subscribed, they don't need to be thrilled. They just need to stay a member."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Their family comedies have been pretty good. Modern Family, Fresh Off The Boat, Real O'neals, Blackish are all high quality comedies."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I think it's more of a bad Netflix show can be shuffled into the unknown regions and never seen or discussed. But HBO is appointment viewing--you aren't missing it and if it sucks you're pissed, you wanted it to be good. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Netflix doesn't give the creators anything, they aren't involved in any of it. Netflix just buys content on the market. They don't make or do anything. Someone hands them a hard drive with the content. 

It is these companies like NBC, ABC, Sony making the Netflix shows "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"What does ""free rein"" mean exactly? Do you know that for a fact or just based on what you see?  I'm guessing that Netflix isn't just allowing producers to send in shows without their notes, but I guess I could be wrong?  Seems unlikely, though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,The CW is basically just an extension of Netflix at this point though. As long as their shows remain globally popular on Netflix they tend to keep producing them. The CW seems to be one of the few traditional stations that understands in this new world of streaming that stuff like Nielsen isn't the only way to measure success.
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"I meant the latter, but I think the former is true too (in terms of quality)."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"They don't so prestige programming, exclusively. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"Right, that's exactly my point. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"That's not true.  They most certainly commission their own shows along with licensing others.  Granted, they all get the ""Netflix Original"" title, so that could be a little confusing."
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"A lot of show creators have publicly spoken about how Netflix basically allows them to do whatever they want. 

The only specific one I can think of right now is Tina Fey and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Apart from that I can't think of any others, though I do recall reading it about 3-4 of them.

I also think it shows in not only the type of shows that Netflix has but just the writing in general. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Spain,"> The CW is basically just an extension of Netflix at this point though.

They put their shows on Netflix consistently = They are an extension of Netflix ?"
Wormwood,"Awesome series.  Eric Olsen stole the series, in my opinion.  He was captivating to listen to.  Does he know all that stuff off the top of his head, or did he do a bunch of prep before filming?

Also, assuming you were the interviewer opposite him, why do you have your hand raised up in so many scenes?"
Wormwood,"Do you think that there's a link between mk ultra and the many cults that began to spring up in the 60s and 70s throughout the United States? Great series btw, I really enjoyed it and learned a lot from it."
Wormwood,"You're commitment to the use of high quality, well placed, archival material is astounding, and something I was in absolute awe of while watching the series. How hard was it to track down some of the stuff? "
Wormwood,"In Wormwood it seemed like most of the people that could be held responsible had died leaving Olson with this knowledge that he could do nothing about. Are you considering looking into mysteries that may be a little more current in the hopes that exposing those potentially responsible could actually lead to them being held accountable?

Great series btw. Loved the way it was done."
Wormwood,"In exactly 10 words, why should people watch this show? Give us your best pitch!"
Wormwood,what inspired you to create this documentary?
Wormwood,"hi Errol! off topic, but i loved Vernon, Florida! "
Wormwood,"Have you noticed the acceptance of MKULTRAs mere existence by more and more people just in the past year, and a growth in conspiracy culture in general? It seems to me just a year or two ago if you mentioned MKULTRA , you were considered a nut by the uninformed, now the same people seem to just shrug and say ""of course MKULTRA is real."" To me, the digestion of such ideas has finally happened, but with a whimper. Still, thank you and shows like Manhunt which talked about MKULTRA as well. Just wondering why we don't see any outrage. "
Wormwood,"I have to get back to work, but you can continue asking me anything on Twitter. Thanks."
Wormwood,"Have you seen the Documentary Now parody of Thin Blue Line?

How do you pick music for your projects?"
Wormwood,[deleted]
Wormwood,Are there any other mysteries you might want to make into films? 
Wormwood,How did you first learn of [Frank Olsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Olson)? 
Wormwood,"Have you taken LSD? If so, how was your experience?
"
Wormwood,Why do you think Robert McNamara was a bit more apologetic about his culpability in the destruction of Vietnam and Donald Rumsfeld wasn't the least bit sorry about the destruction of Iraq?
Wormwood,[deleted]
Wormwood,how can you convince me the government didnt kill you after making this and that your not a look a like 
Wormwood,[deleted]
Wormwood,"Thoroughly enjoyed the show. I definitely learned something. Did the research reveal any other topics that fascinated you? ""Tentacles"" leading into other areas? "
Wormwood,"This was departure in the filming style of the interviews for you.  Why abandon shooting through the teleprompter for this film?  My assumption is that the multiple angles and flipping back and forth of certain shots serve as metaphor for a story that can be seen many ways.  Really liked it, but didn't have the Errol Morris feel about it.  "
Wormwood,Do you agree with Seymour Hersh's decision to not report on the story?
Wormwood,I had a difficult time with the blurred line between a strict documentary and a standard scripted drama. Was this style intentional and how would you best pitch this to someone like me who felt trapped in between 2 genres and unable to continue watching?
Wormwood,"Have you heard about the death of Danny Casolaro? His investigation into ""The Octopus?"" Would you consider doing a series about that? "
Wormwood,I think Peter Saarsgard is a criminally underrated actor. What was it like to work with him?
Wormwood,"Have you ever listened to the Last Podcast on the Left? That's actually where i first really learned about the MK Ultra experiments, Frank Olson's mysterious death, and a lot of the other CIA/LSD experimentation/testing. Their research is incredible with it also being hilarious, so it was really enjoyable to watch your documentary and seeing the connections and research visualized.  "
Wormwood,Do you have any interest in ever finishing your project on Ed Gein?
Wormwood,"Errol, It was a pleasure working for you on Wormwood. I was on the Frederick unit. It was cold and rainy but an absolute blast. 

If you need a question.... Boxers or Breifs? 
"
Wormwood,"I've enjoyed your work, thank you!

How was working with Netflix? They seem to be funding a lot of good projects."
Wormwood,"Did the CIA do any work exploring how LSD could serve a social good, or were they solely focused on it as an instrument of war? "
Wormwood,[deleted]
Wormwood,I found Wormwood to be an excellent representation of what it’s like to live with childhood trauma. Thank you for making it.
Wormwood,Not sure if this is public knowledge but what type cameras/lenses were you using for the interviews? btw 6 angles blew my mind! Thank you!
Wormwood,"Why do you believe Jeffrey MacDonald is not guilty when he clearly is? He's a liar, sociopath/master manipulator, and not even a good one, either. Are you just gullible, very naive, and a horrible judge of character?"
Wormwood,owen wilson said your films were his favorite movies and often inspire him to stay funny when he's in the middle of shooting (at a panel at this year's vulturefest). are you a big owen wilson fan?
Wormwood,"What is your dream documentary subject, and why?"
Wormwood,"Any info on the quality between CIA LSD and other known chemists at the time, i.e. Owsley  Stanley or other clandestine chemists of the time?"
Wormwood,"First off Loved the Documentary. Second, How did you feel and what went through your head at the time when Netflix gave you the green light for this Documentary?"
Wormwood,Did  James Earl Ray kill MLK?
Wormwood,"I've never seen a ""doc"" like Wormwood before. It's genius. Did form follow function on this or vice versa? What were the narrative difficulties you overcame in executing this unique format?

Thank you for your amazing contributions to life and doing the AMA!"
Wormwood,What story have you most wanted to tell but weren't able to? 
Wormwood,"You rock! Thanks for all your curiosity, courage, and hard work! What are some other recent documentaries that you've enjoyed watching?"
Wormwood,Father and I sat down to watch this. He immediately was hooked because his father worked at Fort Detrick. Did you get any insider info from inside the fort walls?
Wormwood,Hey Errol! Loved Wormwood! Would you ever consider doing a paranormal type doc?
Wormwood,How do you try to persuade a reluctant potential interviewee?
Wormwood,Which conspiracy theories do you think are the least valid?
Wormwood,"- What are the top subjects you wish *someone* would cover--though you wouldn't necessarily do them yourself?

- Also: *when* are you gonna finally do a doc on aliens?!"
Wormwood,"I think The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara is the best documentary ever made, what are your favorites?"
Wormwood,9/11: Government conspiracy yes or no?
Wormwood,"At the age of 14, back in 1970, a woman landed with a family in my neighborhood with a harrowing tale of being kidnapped by the CIA. She stayed with this family while putting her life back together. I totally believed her story and I’m glad I found out about stuff like this at such a young age.

Fast forward to 1980 in a different city, a friend of mine’s father claimed to be a former CIA agent who had been dosed with LSD. This guy was totally mad, babbling, practically homeless. But he looked like the perfect clean cut CIA retired agent. I believed him because it was too weird to make up."
Wormwood,Do you personally believe that Frank was murdered? Was there anything that was left out of the docu-series that you would have liked to include but needed to cut?
Wormwood,Have you noticed that the CIA did the exact same thing everyone who's taken acid has always wanted to do
Wormwood,"Great documentary.  I had known about this but not how it all unfolded.

My big question involves the window and forensics involving the jump site.  I would expect the trajectory of a body to be different depending on whether it was thrown, pushed, or jumped.  Has an analysis been done on this.  I doubt much was done by the NYPD at the time but what about later utilizing photos and measurements?"
Wormwood,What was the last meal you ate?
Wormwood,"Recent research, and my own personal experince with LSD has been a very honest revealing effect. I think it could hold a number of uses yet to publicly be released. Overall Is there reason to believe that the CIA see LSD as a key to some more honest perspective of our current social reality? "
Wormwood,"What is it like to work with Randy Bell?
"
Wormwood,"Who are your favorite interviewers in radio, TV or podcasting?"
Wormwood,"There are so many conspiracy theories that are so crazy it's hard to believe so many people believe in them, what is your favorite and why?"
Wormwood,"It seems that no documentary series has supplied Hollywood with more material than *First Person*.  
...Any chance of reviving that on Netflix?"
Wormwood,This doesn't pertain to LSD but explicitly banned substances at the federal level. Do you think that our experiment with legalizing pot to varying degrees at the state level will ever translate to the swamp creatures at the federal level?
Wormwood,I’ve been following Hamilton’s content for quite awhile. Do you have any ideas for projects to work on together or would you be involved in an episode of Hamilton’s Pharmacopeia?
Wormwood,"Errol, huge fan of your films since childhood. Have you considered picking up ""First Person"" again? I found the series incredibly fun and entertaining. "
Wormwood,"Do you know what REALLY happened about the Kennedy assassination?

If so, what is the truth they are hiding?"
Wormwood,What does the CIA think of Wormwood?
Wormwood,"Hey Errol, your work is a big inspiration. I wanted to ask about Nub City, which has always fascinated me. Did you ever manage to shoot anything usable before you were ran out of town, and did that experience effect the way you approached filmmaking on subsequent projects? "
Wormwood,"Having not watched the show yet, how much of it is reporting and how much (if any) is re-enactments?  I feel the re-enactments rarely add value to a documentary unless describing something very visually difficult so I am hoping there is little of that. "
Wormwood,Do you think Werner would be willing to eat another of his shoes after this?
Wormwood,How did you create those amazing LSD trip scenes? The one in the lake was especially over the top.
Wormwood,Has there been much change in the effects (in strength) of LSD from when the experiments took place in the 50s versus now?
Wormwood,"Any tips on launching a documentary filmmaking career? I've made a series of web shorts and currently editing my first feature, but I'm struggling to actually make any money doing this."
Wormwood,"Mr. Morris, I'm a big fan and I can't wait to watch Wormwood. What are some other lesser know documentaries that people should check out? Maybe some that influenced you? 

Also, did you see the episode of Documentary Now! that spoofed The Thin Blue Line? It's amazing."
Wormwood,"...Were you as annoyed as me that Ken Burns chose to skip from WWII straight to Vietnam--instead of covering the conflict that's much more relevant to us today and much *less known*? (...Probably not, I expect.)"
Wormwood,"We watched Standard Operating Procedure for a college course on Photography & War and I just wanted to say thank you for your work on it. 

It was very eye opening and incredibly interesting to hear their stories on what happened at Guantanamo. "
Wormwood,Where do you stand on the JFK assassination? Do you think it was really Oswald?
Wormwood,Is it better than Herzog having to eat a shoe?
Wormwood,Watch the first episode and it is unwatchable. 
Wormwood,"Too late, but I wondered if you'd seen *Jacobs Ladder* and your thoughts on it. "
Wormwood,Was this more or less fun to make than Standard Operating Procedure? I was a big fan of that so I'll be sure to check this out.
Wormwood,I think what the CIA did was a good thing. Would you agree?
Wormwood,What is this series adapted from?
Wormwood,"Love you Errol.  Have you considered that Sy Hersh may have been inventing his supposed source he says he's protecting?  He claims that he can't say more about what his source told him because it would let his bosses track him down. And yet what the source does say seems like enough for his bosses to figure out he was snooping in the files.  Hersh's huge ego, and need to seem like he's still the most well-connected man in journalism, would accord with this reading as well. 

Separately, do you ever speak to Fred Leuchter?  

Thanks for the great new show!"
Wormwood,Why don't people name their kid Errol anymore?
Wormwood,"Errol! Many thanks for doing this - I consider **Fog of War** one of my favourite films of all time, it really illustrated the nuance of War and I found Robert S. McNamara a very sympathetic character, grappling with the guilt of the choices he had to make in the past (and a perfect counterpoint to Rumsfeld in your sort-of follow up film The Unknown Known. Rumsfeld came off as a sociopath or, perhaps worse, as completely stupid). Fascinating character study and something worthy of a place in the Smithsonian or the Congressional Library. Every warhawk should watch that film as a cautionary tale.

My questions for you are

1. Do you think LSD and psychedelics have a place in modern medicine?
2. As much fake news is peddled by the alt-right (and the left, to some extent), what is your take on the so-called ""deep state""?
3. What has been your favourite documentary of the last decade?
4. whats next for you?"
Wormwood,"Tried watching, fell asleep.  Maybe next time."
Wormwood,I feel like we would all be better educated if all documentaries were made this way. Outstanding job keeping the viewer engaged.
Wormwood,"Back to Frank Olsen...I'll always believe he was ""disposed of"". Did anyone ever do enough studies on glass in the room, outside the room, on the lamp, and his injuries? Can a man physically throw himself through and out of a window that thick?n I do believe he was a tormented soul, though.
  I guess I will always be a conspiracy theorist anyway, about a lot of things. Wonder why some of us always question things, and others always question our questioning!?"
Wormwood,"I doubt you're still monitoring this Errol but the story and the filming and cinematography styling of your series is incredible. I just started watching and was up 2 hours past my bedtime last night. 

Could never fail to mention Eric Olson. What a strong, intelligent man to use creativity so wisely to deal with his confusion and grief in life. I wish he and his remaining family as well as you and the rest of your staff all the best. "
Wormwood,Have there been any surprising repercussions or revelations since the series has aired?  
Wormwood,"I really like your name. Its a great name for a writer in my opinion. How do you feel about it?  

Do you know of a connection between Jungian psuedo-science experiments (Im not thinking of anything specifically, just the general mystical/psyschological bullshit) and MK-Ultra? "
Wormwood,Hi Errol! I sent you a copy of GOOD LITTLE SOLDIERS! I hope your assistant let you have it! 
Wormwood,When are you gonna tell us how this relates to Aliens
Wormwood,I was the interviewer. I wasn't really aware that I had my hand up so much of the time until I started editing the film. I'm not sure why. 
Wormwood,"Thank you. When you've spent 60+ years investigating a story, chances are you have a good understanding of the underlying materials. Having said that, Eric Olson was a fabulous interview. Thoughtful, intelligent, and emotional."
Wormwood,"MK-ULTRA is catnip for conspiracy theorists. You have all the basic ingredients: mind control, memory replacement, programmed assassins, enhanced interrogations... What's there not to love? And the fact that Gottlieb, the putative head of MK-ULTRA, attempted to destroy all the documents just adds to the paranoia. "
Wormwood,"Food for thought: I wish I had more, but listen to this. Some years ago I'm working at non-profit research organization. A researcher is speaking to me as a librarian about his work in the personal papers of  Paul Myron Anthony Linebarge, author of 1948's ""Psychological Warfare,"" literally THE book about the practice of fooling people, disinforming, misinforming, propaganda, cultivation of falsehoods, etc. The guy knew whence he spoke. 


This researcher told me that Linebarge also wrote pulpy sci-fi under the name Cordwainer Smith. I said something to the effect of ""oh, that's interesting, that's what L. Ron Hubbard used to do as well."" The researcher was not familiar with this, and was very surprised. He then told me a strange coincidence; that within Linebarge's unpublished papers was a self-authored document that was very very similar to LRH's ""Dianetics,"" the foundation text of Scientology. He said that LRH and Linebarge were actually associates at one point, and since this wasn't the focus of his research, he wasn't sure if Linebarge had appropriated LRH's writings, or if LRH had incorporated Linebarge's ideas. 


I was on fire when we were talking about this, speculating wildly that Scientology could have been some break-away project of the CIA that got away from them, designed by the father of psychological warfare. Probably not true, but stranger things have happened (literally, two seasons of it are on Netflix). "
Wormwood,Finding archival material that not everybody else has used is hard. How hard was it to track down some of this stuff? On a scale of 1-10? 9.3. 
Wormwood,"...also, Giorgio Tsoukalos had most of the stuff in a locked safe beside his hottub."
Wormwood,"I am still interested in pursuing the mysteries in *Wormwood*. Like all mysteries, *Wormwood* is a shaggy-dog story that leads into other mysteries. And I would like to continue to pursue them."
Wormwood,"If you don't, I'll physically assault you."
Wormwood,The need for continued employment. 
Wormwood,Thank you.

Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Okay.  Bart simpson, chris griffin and fry from futurama."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,My animated tv teenage superhero dream team would be Kim Possible Danny Phantom Ben 10 and Max Steel.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I wanted to include her, but she technically isn't a superhero. She fights enemies with superhuman powers and has used technological gadgets to enhance her base-abilities (Ex- *So the Drama*'s battle suit). But she herself has no discernible superhuman abilities.

&#x200B;

She's a martial artist with peak athletic physicality, but that's about it. It's not the same as Iron Man's suits, since he technically did gain superhuman abilities even without a suit (depending on continuity) thanks to his Arc Reactor. It's pedantic, I know, but details matter.

&#x200B;

One could easily pull the Batman argument, but he technically isn't a *""superhero""* in the traditional sense either despite being classified as such. He is a hero, absolutely, and earns his place among the Justice League, but Bruce Wayne himself is only human.

&#x200B;

The characters of *Three Delivery* and *Juniper Lee*, while also human martial artists, have used supernatural means (Ex- *Three Delivery*'s mystical recipes) to enhance their fighting abilities before, as have *Shaolin Showdown*'s protagonists with various supernatural tools.

&#x200B;

One could argue that using supernatural means to perform superhuman feats is the same end result as using tech., but it just didn't seem appropriate to the criteria. Kim Possible was always marketed more as a children's take on the action-adventure espionage genre.

&#x200B;

One of Kim's songs, *""It's Just You""*, also states in one lyric, *""Not a superhero, it's just you""*. These other properties by contrast fall more into superhero territory. Even Jimmy Neutron, as his theme song makes clear, has a *""superpowered mind""*. That's just my reasoning."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,What no Bobby Hill?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I'd say she's about as skilled as Black Widow, who I definitely consider a superhero. Though I guess Black Widow would fall under the same category as Batman under your definition of a superhero.

I guess we just have different definitions of qualifications of what a superhero is."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Nah, not a fan. Id take gene from bobs burgers over him."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I picked Kim Possible for my animated tv teenage superhero dream team with Danny Phantom Ben 10 and Max Steel those 3 guys are power houses and I could use a girl and a badass normal plus she’s hot just like how the Avengers have Black Widow a hot badass normal female along with the big 3 members Captain America Iron Man and Thor.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,In a fight might be better with Louise.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,True but id want the most useless team to make me look like less of a loser. 😂
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Only if we get to see gimple return to the character by having him team with Rick grimes as a 45 year old safety patrolman
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,The amount of effort you put into that cast list....
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,the fuck is fillmore?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It's better than expected. A bit confusing that they keep switching from Spanish to English even though they are supposed to be speaking Spanish the whole time. 

I will definitely keep this in my watch list. I hope they keep the momentum and pace of the pilot. "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Anyone know the song they had in the trailer? The one that went ""I'm in beast mode""? "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"The discussion thread in /r/QueenOfTheSouth is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/queenofthesouth/comments/4pn4zg/series_premiere_s01e01_piloto_discussion_thread/). It's a new subreddit; hopefully people can come and make it more active :)

I was not really a fan of that premiere. The plot moved way too fast for any character to get any real development (except maybe Teresa, though even she didn't get much characterization beyond ""secretly a badass for no apparent reason""). It was often not clear why Teresa or any other character was doing what they were doing. As such, I was not very interested in what was going on.

There was also quite a bit of untranslated Spanish; even though Teresa presumably understood it, most viewers - including me - probably didn't.

Also, [this review](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/queen-of-the-south-review-season-1-usa-not-mr-robot-1201691574/) nails my thoughts on that rape scene (and on the show in general):

> More to the point, much of the desired feminist kick is deadened by some predictably ugly attempts to be “dark.” Rape is used far too casually to court the desired effect — “We dare you to look away,” to which I say, “OK” — and the stark gore that explodes midway through feels too nasty after near-constant on-the-nose narration. Plus, it’s hard to empathize with a subject whose most identifiable characteristic is claiming to be the source of our “weed for our stupid weekend dinner parties.”

All in all, not the greatest start to the show. I guess we'll see if it gets better now that the necessary setup to the plot is mostly done."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Worth the watch? Aside from Mr. Robot, I have not liked any USA show."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Interesting so far.  I watch next week see where it goes from here.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,So she just abandoned the others?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Seems to me she should keep that book
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Is this a remake to the spanish series?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I thought the writing was good and the pilot was better than I expected.  I hope the lead actress grows on me. I plan to keep going and watch another episode. 
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It wasn't bad, but I agree with the general sentiment that it moved WAY too fast. 

I'll give it a chance though. Something to watch on Thursdays in the summer."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Slow start.  Hope it picks up.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Hey, guy, does anybody know if the episode title ""Piloto"" means ""Pilot episode"" or does it refer to Güero being an actual pilot?"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Shit
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Nice
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It's definetly more serious in tone than USA's other shows like Monk, Burn Notice, ect. and more in line with Mr. Robot when it comes to high production values and a more serious and mature themes.  I think the pilot is worth checking out for sure.  I enjoyed it and will check out where the show goes from here.  "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,So much happens so fast that it's almost cartoonish. There is no time to care about what is happening because the scenarios change instantly after being introduced. I watched it but longed for more depth.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Psych? Burn Notice? White Collar? Monk? Suits?

USA is fantastic "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Suits is okay for the first one or two seasons - but then it becomes shitty and repetitive
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,same.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,They seem to always abandon one another. 
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Si. 
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Is that a joke?  How bad is your ADD that *this* is considered a slow start?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"The former (or at least, that's presumably the intent). Most shows have their first episode titled ""Pilot"", this one went with ""Piloto""."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"This is what I worried about.  I enjoy good stories, the trailer progressed so fast.  I thought it seemed like a rushed action show like a Burn Notice."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"White Collar was good for a season or 2, didn't care for the others.  :("
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Isn't the Spanish  series based on the novel?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I meant the first 15 minutes.  The comment was in real time.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"White Collar and Burn Notice are the same for me.

Neither are the best shows ever made, but they're both so much fun to watch. I love heists and spies, so they're both right up my alley. 

Psych is fuckin' perfection, though. 

All of these shows are some of my go-to shows for background noise. I've watched them all so many times, that I just need to have them playing in the background while I read or play games or whatever, and I'll still be able to know exactly what's happening."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Si.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,[What's your name?](https://youtu.be/1DOEDT6XGBk?t=81)
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Loved it! Really good show, Holly Was favourite character "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I've been wondering if I should watch this. Is the 1st season self-contained?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It was one of the better SK adaptations - really looking forward to Season 2 
"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"i thought it was fucking great

and i LOVED every minute of brendan gleeson"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"One of the few of his books I haven't read, but I LOVE this show. I didn't like to hear it got a second season because I thought it should have ended, and to not drag it out. They did this with 'The Affair' and pretty much ruined it for me. (but I haven't seen the season finale yet, so I'll reserve judgement) "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It was fantastic. There are so many suspenseful moments and the characters are really well developed. I didn't care much for the romance subplot towards the middle of the season but everything else I loved. 
"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I’ve been thinking of watching this but haven’t read the book. What’s the general premise and what should I know about the books before watching? (Without spoiling)
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Haven't seen the final episode yet, but I have enjoyed it immensely. Great GREAT casting... from Brendan Gleason to Holland Taylor to the Supreme Electronics crew.  The T-Bone Burnett theme music. The bland Ontario locations standing in for bland Ohio locations. Even the low budget. All of it works in the show's favor. "
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Oh shit I forgot about this! I loved the book. Definitely gonna watch the series.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I think it's pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of the changes but they aren't that bad, IMO.


I didn't see any plotholes in the books so I'd disagree with that."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,It was an amazing show. I can't wait for the second season. 
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Brendan Gleason is such a fantastic actor. He really deserves more attention. He made Hodges sympathetic where as other actors could have made the role very one dimensional. 
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I thought it was great. The montage near the end made me tear up a little. It was cool watching without knowing what was gonna happen.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I read and enjoyed the book, struggling with the TV show, not because it’s bad but because Brady’s Mother creeps me the fuck out..."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,How close was this to the book and how fast was the book covered in the show? I haven't read it yet but I loved the show so I want to give the book a read
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Is Season 2 going to be Finders Keepers?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I also loved it and Holly was my fave as well! I found the actors did a fantastic job and can't wait till next season.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,">  What do I think?

My thoughts are I hope to hell it will be on Netflix or Hulu so I can watch it."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Wish I could watch it, anyways around have audience network to watch it legally?"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Fantastic show and cast. I want to hug and marry Holly ;(

"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,<removed>
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"season ended fucking terrible , was that really how they caught him in the book ?"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I just finished the series and I thought it was really well done. Considering the adaptation of most of Stephen Kings stories go south quickly. I did not read the books, so I may have a different view.
5/7 would watch again."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I didn't think they would pull it off! Before it's hard for me to imagine a 40 years old(in the book) woman who dress and looks like a teenager without looking like Japanese woman doing an anime cosplay.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Yes, it is. It's kind of a happy coincidence that the attempt to prolong character arc into another season actually made a few of the characters more likable than the book. That doesn't happen often on TV. And the additional characters are also smart choices. 

Not dissing Stephen King, but the first book is quite sloppy. The show made it much better."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"He's a gem, I would imagine a different actor would make the character too much(try fat Clint Eastwood). He has such a dad charm on him."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"The Mercedes story is concluded rest assure, I mostly certain the second season would start with the second book of the trilogy. Would be a hell of a confusing show name though."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"the idea is that Bill Hodges (played by Brendan Gleeson) is a retired police detective, who gets contacted by the perpetrator of probably the worst crime that he was unable to solve before his retirement- a man who stole a car (a Mercedes, hence the name) and drove it through a crowd of people lined up at a job fair.

I don't think there's really much you need to know about the books, because the show covers everything pretty well (definitely not a case where you need to have read the book to enjoy it)."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It was filmed in South Carolina, they have a tax grant card and thanks to Charleston SC in the credits

Also a coincidence that [King was in South Carolina when he conceived the story](http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/stephen-king-mr-mercedes-it-movie-what-scares-him-1202518482/)"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I guess some of the computer stuff? I don't remember the detail but I remember rolling my eyes a bit while reading it(not that the show version is completely not r/itsanunixsystem material). Also-on top of my head-you really can mistake Janey as Hodges just because of a fedora? It makes Brady feels dumber in this kind of stuff; that arms dealer bust, came out of nowhere; and when Hodges use another serial killer to bluff Brady, if Brady is as intelligent as the book have us to believe, why would he fall for that? Stuff like these. I don't know, I read it very fast , I might missed some details, and it's a coincidence that the show changes all of these above, even Pete is not an asshole anymore."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"It's not. It's more like a blockbuster ending in the book, make less sense but also more ""exciting""."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"the 40 year old aspect never made sense to me (in the book), just seemed like an overly complicated detail that didn't add to the story in any way. I really like the show's change, making her younger and even a possible friend/romantic interest for Jerome.

Was surprised that she ended up being my favorite character too, when in the book she was probably my least favorite."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Mr. Mercedes gave us the first two episodes to watch if you wanna check it out? http://start.att.net/exclusive/audience/mr-mercedes/episodes
"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Loved the show, loved the title sequence, hated the bulldog for happy slapper switch, but I understood it. My favorite scene in the first book is when Hodges protects the kid outside the diner with it. It was a really well told story and season and I hope more people discover it. 

[All Hodges Books Spoiler](#s ""How do you figure the mercedes story is concluded? The third book is literally all about Brady again. They kept him alive, so this is not out of the realm of possibility to do in the show"")"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Thanks. I have purposely not read any kind of synopsis of the book so it wouldn't spoil my enjoyment. A friend today told me about the trilogy. Had no idea.  
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,You're right. I knew that. Don't know why I flaked on it.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I didn't read the third one! No wonder I thought the ending was such a deliberate cliff hanger, but also typical things to do with  Norman Bates like characters. Damn now I need to finish the book!"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Don't it's awful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Watch_(novel)
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Awful?  I enjoyed it.  Finders Keepers is the strongest in the trilogy IMO but End Of Watch was fine
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I dislike the supernatural aspect that was added.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"Totally fair - it was more than a bit out of left field.  Also - I just upvoted you, I don’t know why you were downvoted"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"I believe I nominated American Dad, Bob’s Burgers, Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty and The Simpsons."
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,I hope the nominated Primal because it is a masterpiece but I'm very doubtful.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Bojack’s View from Halfway Down is the best episode of television I’m glad I never have to watch again.  It’s the “Requiem for a Dream” of tv episodes.
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"My picks would be American Dad, BoJack Horseman, Duncanville, Harley Quinn, Primal"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Good choices dude!
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Nominations on Tuesday the 28th
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Why not watch again?
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Good picks
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,"If you watch the show, you’ll understand what I mean.   It’s panic attack-inducing but when you can step away from it, you can appreciate it"
Jenni Rivera: Mariposa de Barrio,Ah okay didn’t understand thank you for explaining to me.
Death Parade,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Death Parade,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Death Parade,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Death Parade,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Death Parade,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Death Parade,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Death Parade,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Death Parade,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Death Parade,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia

Death Parade,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Death Parade,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Death Parade,Needs more Jojo
Death Parade,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Death Parade,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Death Parade,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Death Parade,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Death Parade,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Death Parade,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Death Parade,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Death Parade,Madoka magica ! 
Death Parade,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Death Parade,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."

Death Parade,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Death Parade,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Death Parade,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Death Parade,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Death Parade,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Death Parade,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Death Parade,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Death Parade,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Death Parade,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Death Parade,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Death Parade,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Death Parade,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Death Parade,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Death Parade,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Death Parade,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Death Parade,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Death Parade,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Death Parade,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Death Parade,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Death Parade,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Death Parade,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Death Parade,Black Clover?
Death Parade,.
Death Parade,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Death Parade,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Death Parade,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Death Parade,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Death Parade,[deleted]
Death Parade,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Death Parade,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Death Parade,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Death Parade,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Death Parade,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Death Parade,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Death Parade,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Death Parade,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Death Parade,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Death Parade,[deleted]
Death Parade,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Death Parade,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Death Parade,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Death Parade,[deleted]
Death Parade,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Death Parade,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Death Parade,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Death Parade,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Death Parade,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Death Parade,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Death Parade,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Death Parade,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Death Parade,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Death Parade,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Death Parade,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Death Parade,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Death Parade,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Death Parade,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Death Parade,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Death Parade,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Death Parade,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Death Parade,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Death Parade,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Death Parade,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Death Parade,This show was hilarious
Death Parade,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Death Parade,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Death Parade,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Death Parade,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Death Parade,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Death Parade,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Death Parade,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Death Parade,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Death Parade,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
The Windsors,"This is the cool new thing to do on Reddit, automatically conclude that anyone who doesn't agree with you about subjective things must have been bribed lol"
The Windsors,"it was pretty obvious the frankly boring and overblown discourse around season 5 was more an excuse to talk about anything surrounding it than the actual show itself. I have read reviews that had nothing to do with reviewing but just drawn out reflections about how the journalist remembers these facts and bla bla bla. And of course, the show is as good as ever"
The Windsors,"It was awesome imo and I enjoyed it as much as other seasons (not finished it yet). Don't think critics were paid or sth honestly, but I found some of them completely wrong. I didn't like how they were not talking about the show itself and were reviewing what they had in mind or expecting or just going meta and talking about the talkings about the show (maybe nothing wrong about it, but I am watching the show itself, not the whole world around it). 

I'm just gonna add, Elizabeth Debicki gave one of the best actings I've seen recently, totally Crown level. Can easily say she is great."
The Windsors,Paid*
The Windsors,"I've watched all of season 5, and it was correct (when it comes to known facts), and the 'made up' parts were believable."
The Windsors,"The main fault of season 5 is that the actors don't much look like the people they are portraying.

Nonetheless, season 5 is still pretty good."
The Windsors,"Just look on how different opinions of audiences and critics for this season please. It's night and day from metacritic I think is 80 with 9.4 on audience, IMDB with 8.4, rotten tomatoes being 60 with 91 on audience score and other major reviewers."
The Windsors,Sorry English is not my natural language.
The Windsors,Thank god you’re here to keep everyone on track.
The Windsors,"Yeah, sometimes critics have a different take than audiences.  Critics loved The Leftovers, audiences love The Big Bang Theory.  Are all those critics being *bought!?*"
The Windsors,"No worries, most Americans don't know which to use either.   (I don't know about brittish)"
The Windsors,No worries
The Windsors,"So this season is bad, like game of thrones season 8 bad"
The Windsors,"No, that's not what I said.  I'm pretty sure you can read."
The Windsors,"The idea was that he would give up the idea of marrying Wallis and would marry ""proper"". Then he would have children, etc. They would have become the heir.

But let's say Edward's proposition was taken and he was allowed to marry Wallis and his children weren't in the line of succession. In that case, yes, Elizabeth would have taken the throne in 1972 (I mistakenly said 77, his age) when Edward died.

The tweak in 2013 only removed the bit that put male children ahead of female children in the line of succession. For instance, if Elizabeth had a younger brother, he would have been next in line of succession at the time."
The Windsors,"**Spoiler Alert for Season 2 Episode 6 in the link**

I think you are right. Elizabeth didn't have any brothers so the tweaked act of succession wouldn't apply anyway. But that version of history looks kinda bad. Elizabeth still gets to be queen but has to wait until 1972. Meanwhile you got [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII#/media/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-17964,_Ordensburg_Kr%C3%B6ssinsee,_Herzog_von_Windsor.jpg) sitting on the throne.  
"
The Windsors,"If Edward hadn’t abdicated, had married someone else and had had children they would be heir apparent. King George was heir presumptive before taking the crown."
The Windsors,"I thought as much but wasn’t sure. I’m more of a student of the medieval monarchy than the modern one, which is probably part of the reason I’m enjoying The Crown so much. I know the broad strokes of a lot of the events, such as the Great Smog or the Suez Crisis but I feel like I’m learning the kinds of details that make me a history buff."
The Windsors,"This episode has been my favorite so far, maybe because it touches on issues that have been much on my mind lately. That being said, Paul Sparks’ appearance is, IMO, Emmy-worthy. I’ll avoid spoilers but he plays someone I have vivid memories of, and Sparks almost scared me with how good his portrayal was."
The Windsors,"True. Got all the various title things glommed together.

Edit: And then I realized that their specific position would have been dependent on their sex. So that hypothetical child could be either the presumptive or apparent heir."
The Windsors,"That’s true, Edward’s hypothetical daughter would have been Presumptive. But she would have been ahead of George and Elizabeth. "
The Windsors,WGN TV in Chicago owns Bozo. They have the archives. I'd start there.
The Windsors,"You're hung up on some clown from the 60s, man!"
The Windsors,"Windsor station CKLW,... Bozo was portrayed by the late Art Cervi a fantastic Bozo actor who for a time was also an official Bozo trainer for the license owner."
The Windsors,"Did you find any footage of your Dad? I was on The Bozo Show with my Brownie Troop in 69/70 In Dallas,Tx. A memory I will always hold dear to my heart."
The Windsors,"WGN does NOT own Bozo the Clown.

 WGN like many other stations licensed the Bozo show idea. Sadly, many of the early shows from both WGN and other stations were done live. OR if they were taped the tape was shown and reused. Many stations have nothing in archive or no more than a few clips. Finding specific shows from stations in NEARLY impossible."

Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Keep it going, Jefe!"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,It's certainly cheaper and less time consuming than doing a live-action show. As I do remember Bruce Campbell saying he was burnt out by the production shoots towards the end of Ash vs. Evil Dead. This way they continue the show and Bruce gets his voice work done in a single weekend. Honestly I'm down. Hopefully they don't go super cheap on the animation and can still bring the great fun performances through voice acting as well as the fun chaotic tone of the live-action show.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I hope it continues from where the live action series left off and uses the same characters. I still miss that show.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Well, this seems like a great idea. Ash VS Evil Dead was half a cartoon anyway."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,That honestly makes a lot of sense
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Hail to the king, baby"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"""talks have begun"" has to be the absolute lowest bar for news about a tv show

let's get this in motion.  Ash vs The Evil Dead was the best evil dead in the entire franchise.  do more of that nonsense."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"That's awesome news, Ash vs Evil Dead was everything a fan of the movies could have asked for. Hope they'll be bringing back the rest of the cast as well, the question is whether the animated show will take on the ending of the series >!which involved Ash being transported in a post-apocalyptic future a la the other ending of Army of Darkness that they didn't go with at for the start of the show.!<"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I want a Pizza Papa show.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Sweet I'd Def be down for my ash v evil dead
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I'll take any Bruce Campbell possible, hope it has a good art style"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Bruce had said he could no longer play the role physically due to the stunts, etc.  This is a great way to keep it going.

https://www.cbr.com/evil-dead-bruce-campbell-ash-done/"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Good now bring Back Brisco County jr in animated also please
Ash vs. Evil Dead,OMFG YES YES YES
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"For a brief second when I read the headline, I was kinda hoping they were making a ""Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'?"" and Evil Dead crossover."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Please don’t be on Starz. 

Please don’t be on Starz. 

PLEASE DON’T BE ON STARZ."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I don't think many people know how cononical ""The Evil Dead/Army of Darkness"" is in two beloved I.P's, and the Necronomicon was specifically retconed in the AOD comics to be their Genesis: Herbert West used in Re-animator to make his Syrum, and Jason Vorhees mother used it to bring him back, the ""Freddy Vs. Jason Vs. Ash"" series are direct sequels to the film.

The Comic crossovers are rich with possibilities for this series.

Re-Animator, Freddy, Jason, Darkman, Xena : Warrior princess, Danger Girl,
Hack/Slash (fought Jason and Chucky herself), Vampirella, and Bubba Hotep.

And we can't forget how important he was in the Marvel Zombies comics... Which is being made into a Disney+ animated series.

Excited for this.

Edit: I always thought it was a missed opportunity on the first episode of the Starz series, when it showed him giving a narrative synopsis of the last couple decades, over a map... They could have showed him stopping at Crystal Lake, to hat-tip the comics."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I actually love this idea. So much of the Evil Dead world can be found in comic books of video games—why not add animation to the list
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I watched the first three eps of the Ash TV show. Haven't resumed it. Is it worth finishing? Good action?
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"How many times has Bruce Campbell said he's done playing Ash, then comes back again?

Not complaining, I genuinely find it funny, just curious how many times now haha"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Great idea, he says he loves the character but can’t physically put in the work, let’s hope we get a Freddy crossover with England doing the voice work."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Bring in Jane Levy for an episode or so.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Could be cool but only if they spend a bit of money on making the art look nice and nothing like these countless mass produced and painfully flat looking cartoons where the sharp angled characters look like they've been coloured in with a fill tool on a computer in about five minutes and the animation amounts to about three frames per second.

Bring back detailed, evocatively drawn cartoons - like what used to be the norm when I was a kid growing up. *Ulysses 31, Dungeons and Dragons, Gummie Bears...*"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Bruce Campbell is like a cool uncle, Brennan Frazier is the close friend that you don’t see a lot but it’s always great to see again"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I wonder what style of animation?
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"This sounds like a great idea, I'd love to see it on HBO Max. They go crazy with the animation in ways they couldn't do in live action.

I also hope the new movie does well. I love this franchise so much, and so far it has never disappointed."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"If it picks up in the future apocalypse, that would be great. It better have Pablo and Kelly to some capacity."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I feel like if the show had been on Netflix we would have gotten at least one more season.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I don’t know bout an animated series but I always wanna see more AVED
Ash vs. Evil Dead,No.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Oh please God yes. I need some more Ash in my life
Ash vs. Evil Dead,while i would prefer a proper live action finish to the ash vs dead show if this means we actually get a ending thats a good thing.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"This is a horrible idea.  

It should be a proper live-action Season 4 only."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,It was a real shame series 2 of that got buggered up by an internal power struggle in the writing room.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"If it isn't R rated, I'm not interested"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,he is the king of B Movies
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"After Ash vs. Evil Dead is canceled 

Bruce: ""I will never play Ash again.""

Offered money for new video game and cartoon show about Ash.

Bruce: ""And then I saw all the zeros!"""
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Overrated. The evil dead people had a good thing, let it go, innovate. It sucks Raimi still insists on using his outdated “jokes” and gimmicks in far superior productions as it was multiverse of madness. Raimi single-handedly ruined dr strange."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Oh god
They really milk this thing don’t they"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,We already have this. It’s called The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I’m sorry, what’s so special about this guy again? I saw him in Dr. Strange and heard he is friends with Sam Raimi but that’s it?"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Well that’s some positive news for the day.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,YES!!!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I was sort of hoping for another Evil Dead film with Campbell, but this works just as well."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy baby
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Pumped to see Kelly and Pablo still around
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Yes!!!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Sounds like a good idea. Campbell’s voice acting in Dead by Daylight and Evil Dead: the Game sounded perfectly serviceable, so he’ll probably do a fine job."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,God I hope he’s nice in real life
Ash vs. Evil Dead,You will never obtain the Necronomicon!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I really wish they would just do a season 4. It was such an amazing show
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Pizza Papa always gets paid!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Come on Bruce, one last movie. You got this. Give me that post apocalyptic sci-fi Army of Darkness!!!"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Very Groovy. Loved the show.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Seems like the world is not going to complete shit
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I love the Evil Dead and will watch anything with Bruce Campbell in it. I wish it was live action though. Even just one more season or movie to conclude the story. It would be “Groovy” to see Bruce as Ash…one last time.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,As long as the animation isn’t cheap this could be really great
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"My Reddit feed shows a post about Joe Manchin, followed by this, a picture of Bruce and his huge man-chin. Classic!"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I wish they would make a ""sky high 2"" of sorts. Just sayin."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Fuck..  some good news
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Awesome, hope it continues where the show left off"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I’d love more, just a shame we don’t get the old evil dead style in live action tho, it was just so much fun."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Good. Would preferred live version, but this will have to do"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"That you, Mitt?"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,It should be good then!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Groovy
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Okay, I’ll give Bruce a pass but deadites should always remain practical FX.

They better Ralph Bakshi this bitch like Cool World, or I’m not interested."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Loved that TV series.  Dunno how animated one will go. Be interesting to check out
Ash vs. Evil Dead,He’s primed for the Mitt Romney biopic
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Please! I'd give just about anything for more of Ash, Pablo, and Kelly."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,i smile everytime pablo refers to ash as jefe in the show
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"He's not exactly a young guy, and I'm sure the physicality of Ash was pretty draining.  The show was left pretty open to continuing and Animation is an excellent way to do it."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,yeah we can to retire the character as a live action but that's why he voice Ash in the new game as well
Ash vs. Evil Dead,A Titmouse animated Evil Dead show sounds amazing
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"He was also covered in gore almost all the time. So, I'd imagine him doing the VO work is a lot easier on his schedule/life, plus also allows them to do crazier things with the budget."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I need this to fill the void in my heart since venture bros isn’t coming back!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"The video games were pretty good, and Bruce Campbell's voice acting was a big part of that. I hope they do another single player one again."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Bring in the Archer people to animate!
Ash vs. Evil Dead,[deleted]
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Same. I think about that cliff hanger a lot :’(
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I would accept the concept of season 4 being animated and voice acted by the original cast.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Could you show me on this puppet of Ash where it was not a cartoon?
Ash vs. Evil Dead,The scene where a deadite shoves his head up her(?) ass might have been the only scene that I have ever watched awestruck.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,The best Evil Dead in the entire franchise was Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I would love it if the deadites were in charge but they steered humanity onto new technology and we get cyberpunk deadites cities.  I'm tired of seeing the same wasteland crappy future
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"An animated series would be perfect for if they wanted to pick up where the show left off, yes."
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"I imagine so. They've teased apocalypse ash twice now, it'll be a shame if that idea never materializes"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,pizza papa always gets payed
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"its been forever since the last HAWP episode, i was thinking everyone forgot about it lmao"
Ash vs. Evil Dead,My dude it's wonderful
Ash vs. Evil Dead,Def also gotta watch the movies. Or at least Evil Dead 2
Ash vs. Evil Dead,They both came back for Evil Dead: The Game and their careers aren't exactly packed with other offers in spite of their talent so I don't see why they wouldn't come back for the show. I hope they do. They're both fantastic.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"At this point it's kinda ""Take what you can get"""
Ash vs. Evil Dead,I Think Bruce may be too old to be on screen again.
Ash vs. Evil Dead,"Bruce physically can't do it anymore.  It's animation or bust, and I'm more than game for an animated Ash Vs. Evil Dead."
Dark,One thing that I appreciate about Succession that I don't see in too many other dramas is how _damned funny it is._ I've laughed my ass off countless times to this show.
Dark,"This review is right on the money and I am glad to see the the show specifically adresses exactly what I disliked about season 3, that it was just running in circles and it was getting old."
Dark,The Conheads are gonna love this!!
Dark,Did critics get every episode?
Dark,"""IN THE 25-ODD years that HBO has been serious about producing original programming, the pay cable giant has given us some of the greatest comedies and dramas television has ever seen. Succession, in whatever genre box you choose to place it — and I think of it more as a dark comedy with pathos than a drama with jokes — has certainly earned its place in that pantheon. But as it begins its fourth and final season this weekend, it has a chance to do something that very few HBO shows have before it. By choosing to wrap things up relatively early, Jesse Armstrong has the opportunity to offer a great finale, while also getting off the stage before anyone begins to feel the show has lost a step.

You can’t really say that about most of its predecessors, and certainly not the most iconic ones. (The Leftovers hit both benchmarks, but it ended so soon in part because barely anyone was watching.) There was a lot of grousing about the last two Sopranos seasons, and the end remains divisive. The Wire fans consider the final season’s newspaper/serial killer plot to be that show’s one big misstep. Veep stumbled just a bit once real-world politics somehow got even stupider than the Selina Meyer administration. While the Six Feet Under finale is universally loved (the last 10 minutes especially), there wasn’t a lot of enthusiasm about the drama’s later seasons prior to that one. And it’s hard to find anyone willing to defend most of the Game of Thrones home stretch.

Given how much Succession has dominated both the Emmys and the TV conversation over its previous seasons, HBO surely would have let Armstrong keep making it for as long as he wanted. But he comes from the UK, where television trends more toward short runs that don’t overstay their welcomes. He no doubt could see what many of us saw in Season Three: that despite a spectacularly high level of execution on all fronts, Succession was just telling different variations of the same story, again and again. The kids go after Logan (Brian Cox) in some combination, he wins, and the game of musical chairs resumes. You can get away with that level of formula for a really long time if you’re as good at it as Succession is. Eventually, though, hitting these same notes over and over — “Different, but the same,” as Shiv (Sarah Snook) says in an upcoming episode — was going to fall flat, maybe as soon as this year.


Instead, Armstrong and company find a way to make this final season feel the same, but also very, very different. The notion of ending hangs over everything from the start. The season begins two days before the planned sale of Waystar Royco to Swedish tech mogul Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård). Shiv, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), and Roman (Kieran Culkin), having been banished by Logan after their failed coup, already have plans in the works for a new business that they’ll fund from their shares of the sale. Logan leaves his latest birthday party early, the occasion making him painfully aware of how little time he has left to rule this planet.

Logan knows the end is coming, and so does Succession. Without spoiling what happens in the episodes sent to critics, the way that events unfold, and the impact that they have on Logan and everyone else, never plays like a rehash of what’s come before. Significant choices are made, by both the characters and the creative team, that cannot be taken back. It is full steam ahead to the end. Much of what happens is shocking and/or shockingly poignant, especially since it is a show about the absolute worst human beings alive.

The one aspect that remains unsurprising is how incredibly funny the show is. Whether characters are caught up in dumb ideas — Connor (Alan Ruck) debates whether it’s worth spending $100 million just to avoid polling under 1% in the presidential race — or swapping insults, every moment and line is a gem. Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) and Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) dub themselves “The Disgusting Brothers,” and do everything they can to live down to the nickname. When Logan makes an unexpected visit to the ATN newsroom, terrifying everyone as he prowls from desk to desk, Greg suggests, “It’s like Jaws, if everyone worked for Jaws.” And when the abnormally tall Greg attempts to hug the diminutive Roman, Roman sneers, “We’re not playing Chutes and Ladders, OK?”

Armstrong and company also continue to demonstrate a marvelously deft balance between the yuks and the tragedy of it all. The second episode features a rare scene of Logan and his four children in a room together, relitigating old grievances, and it’s as amusing and as sad as anything the series has done to that point. And there remains an enormous amount of nuance in showing the varying scales of awfulness between all these people. We are reminded, for instance, that while Roman is the most outwardly cruel and gross of the siblings, he’s also the only one of the four capable of demonstrating empathy, even briefly, toward people outside his immediate family. And Snook and Macfadyen do some absolutely incredible work at showing how Shiv and Tom are dealing with each other after his betrayal of her in the Season Three finale.

Obviously, all of this could fall apart in the coming weeks, but Succession has, like The Wire and The Sopranos, historically finished seasons even stronger than they start. And these early episodes already put us at the loftiest of levels.

After wandering out of his birthday bash, Logan asks loyal bodyguard Colin (Scott Nicholson) if he believes in the afterlife. Colin isn’t sure, while Logan says, “I think this is it, right?” However we come to think of Succession after it’s gone, it’s doing absolutely everything it wants to in the here and now. Enjoy it while you still can.""

The fourth season of Succession premieres March 26 on HBO and HBO Max. Alan Sepinwall has seen the first four episodes"
Dark,I’m just happy we’re getting 10 episodes.
Dark,"Is it finally over? 

Time to watch it then"
Dark,"I'm sad to see the show go, but I'm glad they're not just stretching it out because of its popularity."
Dark,"I am just about to watch last episode of season 2.

On one hand, the show is good, the characters are horrible but well realized..but I can't help but be slightly disappointed by the show, after all that acclaim I expected something more engaging."
Dark,Every episode is the same.
Dark,The excessive camera shaking for the sake of dramatic effect was just too much for me so I stopped after 10 minutes of the first episode. Hear it’s a helluva show tho 🤷🏻
Dark,[deleted]
Dark,"On the 26th of March, I’ll be all in. Can’t wait to see how these entitled shark-babies eat each alive to get to the Golden Chalice, or the insults that erupt from their decidedly wicked ego-pun one liners, when they go down. Either way!, “Fuck Off!”"
Dark,It’s essentially a dark comedy
Dark,"Everything Alan Ruck does is funny.

It's incredible."
Dark,The dick pic might be one of the funniest things I have seen on television.
Dark,The writing is top tier.
Dark,I’m pretty sure every scene Greg is in I always find funny. Even if the scene isn’t supposed to be funny his presence alone still just makes me laugh.
Dark,It's technically a satire of the filthy rich.
Dark,Look at Armstrong’s previous work. Peep Show is one of the funniest British shows of all time. He’s certainly got a comedic head.
Dark,"The Sopranos came close at its peak but Succession almost feels as if it's written to be a comedy that ends up being a drama because the plot and presentation is so compelling.

It's one thing about the show I don't necessarily think was sold well when it first came out - a lot of TV ads played it up as this very typical family power struggle in a way that looked semi-interesting but predictable. The comedic elements take it from simply being that to this weird and wonderful satire."
Dark,"Similar to some of the all time great dramas (sopranos, mad men, the wire) that are so well written they’re also hilarious"
Dark,"Yeah, I love Succession, and Season 3 is still a great season of television. But that is when it set in that they can only do this tug of war power battle so much."
Dark,"season 3 threw away perfect plot season 2 finale setted up, when you mention that in r/SuccessionTV of course they attack you..."
Dark,https://64.media.tumblr.com/e3d1b47dbd3304694b1d9c1042d41ff0/8f1e0552b6751f77-65/s540x810/dca5b355719f000691ec651f3aaeb28d6a60f034.gif
Dark,There are 10s of us!
Dark,Usually they get the first few episodes or first half if it is a very short season.
Dark,Don't think so. IGN reviewed the first 4 only.
Dark,"Nope. The end of the review says that “this may all fall apart in coming weeks, but Succession tends to end its seasons stronger than it starts them”"
Dark,Tldr: it's good and it's out on that 26th
Dark,"If you’ve never tried it already, I would recommend starting the watch now so that you can hopefully be caught up with a few episodes left to air. It’s my preferred method of binging a show - eliminate 99% of the wait between releases, but catch up just in time to join the hype and water cooler discussions."
Dark,"Maybe you just don't like this sort of a drama

It was opposite for me. I expected to hate it because I don't like drama shows but this is one of the best shows I've seen

I have the opposite reaction. I feel this show is way more active or enhancing than many acclaimed shows like Breaking Bad for example"
Dark,"That sucks, I totally know the feeling. While I do think that it's one of the better shows on television right now, the internet's ability to overhype everything is definitely real. It happened to me with John Wick and some other things as well."
Dark,"I begrudgingly made it through season 2.

Maybe I'm a hater but I find this show so boring and predictable"
Dark,"Same. It’s high quality, but tbh it also feels like a worse version of The White Lotus to me. Different shows, but they both have a lot of thematic overlap and I certainly prefer one over the other. Succession has been a struggle so far, but for all the praise it has gotten as the ‘best show ever’, it pales hard compared to Deadwood (which I’m watching along side it).  
You definitely should not be getting downvoted for this opinion"
Dark,So what did you think of the episode?
Dark,Lol chill it’s not like you’re watching Cloverfield
Dark,"That was completely because Adam McKay directed the first episode. After the first couple of episodes they tone down the super shaky/zoomy McKay cam effect. 

I’d recommend giving it another try knowing the shaky cam will be reduced eventually."
Dark,"If you're the type of person who can stomach video essays then I think [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lU91279xZk) video does a good job of explaining the appeal of Succession's camerawork. 

Won't necessarily change your opinion, it still comes down to individual taste but maybe understanding the thought process behind it might make it a little more palatable."
Dark,"how dare he expect to be paid as a journalist, fucking moneybags over here"
Dark,"Yeah, I find it odd how its humour is rarely talked about, while it's very funny, and on purpose"
Dark,"Kendall  and Logan are in a drama,the other kids with TomGregg are in a comedy."
Dark,He's been playing a loser since Cameron Frye but damn is he good at it.
Dark,I have never felt so much second hand embarrassment in my life.
Dark,"Sopranos is definitely first and foremost a drama though (even if it was intially envisioned as a lighter drama that changed darker because of the lead actor). It’s comedy just punched above it’s weight class.

Idk if I see Succession as a comedy with stronger pathos or a drama with some comedy but Sepinwell (reviewer in the article) certainly thinks it’s the former.

I gotta say though, I do think the intervention scene and Ralph’s prank call to Paulie’s mom in Sopranos is funnier than anything I’ve seen in Succession. But Succession has more comedy beats per episode I think. So I’m inclined to agree that it feels more comedy with some drama."
Dark,"I think they ultimately all need to be to a certain degree. Great dramas are dark and make you think, but life is also very fucking funny sometimes and any work of fiction which aims to show life as it is needs to get that."
Dark,"It feels like a common problem for shows that reach success on a formula like this, this is why I love knowing when a show has an end date scheduled. Going into this season of Succession, we all know it'll be wrapped up and that's a great thing to know ahead of time.

I'm sure it's tough for a network to end something with so much runaway success, but it's doing the fans a disservice to beat it into the ground (I'm sure we can all name at least 2-3 examples where we've seen a favorite show get ruined by pressures to keep it going)"
Dark,"I stopped watching after season two becsuse I could see it deviating to that tug of war, of well... succession. Liked the show a fair smount, but felt i got the gist of the motives/characters after S2. Could see them pushing that content in a circle forever like they did in Euphoria."
Dark,"What did you want, Kendall being a badass and blowing up the company?"
Dark,"Yep, their copium around season 3 finale's was hillarious ""if you are watching this for the story you are an idiot"" was how some would react."
Dark,"it depends actually. with the Last Of Us critics got the whole season, for example."
Dark,I think I’m going to start doing this more often with shows I hear a lot of praise about but missed the bus on. I coincidentally started watching the show a couple months ago and finished the season 2 finale last night. I’m sure by the time I catch up my timing will be almost perfect.
Dark,"I agree that this is the best method.

Unless it's something like Game of Thrones lol. I caught my wife up just in time for the final season, only for it to completely fall flat. Although, she liked the ending... but I chock that up to her only spending a few weeks with the characters rather than the years that most viewers spent."
Dark,I was just a few weeks off of Westworld's last season. But this year I can do it for Succession.
Dark,"oh so it isn't over yet?

I don't care much about hype tbh (I actually find Succession fans online kind of annoying, which is what put me off from watching the show), so I'd rather wait for it to be all over, I'm one of those people that watch like 5 or 6 episodes in a row lol"
Dark,"I am the same, I don't often like drama and/or comedy shows. I prefer fantasy/sci-fi/action etc.

Somehow Succession is now my favorite show ever."
Dark,"I like lot of other HBO shows, Sopranos, Wire, Six feet under, Deadwood.."
Dark,"I think White Lotus is a worse version of Succession. While both shows have nuanced characters and interactions, White Lotus doesn’t have anything as dramatically strong as the third season finale of Succession."
Dark,"Thanks, I am surprised by the downvotes. I think the show is good, I just don't love it as much as I expected."
Dark,Ahh this is good to know!
Dark,Anything involving Greg. The whole Ortolan scene with Tom and Greg had me dying.
Dark,That rap was pretty funny though
Dark,Everything on Showtime
Dark,Everything on Showtime
Dark,"I think there were some occasional pacing problems in S3, especially when watching week-by-week, but felt like it all came together pretty perfectly by the finale again. Kendall was always going to fumble whatever advantage he had and the character beats for everyone felt pretty spot on."
Dark,The DOJ inflicting actually damage on the company
Dark,"Kendall should’ve died at the end of s3e8

They kinda pussied out on that one"
Dark,"of course i watch it for the story, sure characters are funny, acting is great, dozes of dark comedy etc, but what made it great for me is the plot, i was so hyped after the bomb drop in season 2 finale, and I somewhat like season 3 but for entirety i was telling myself ""we all saw this, move the plot on"".  
lets hope this article is to be believed"
Dark,That was probably a special case since the story was already out there and you couldn't really spoil anything.
Dark,"I first did it just in time to catch the second half of the final season of Breaking Bad and it totally changed how I view TV shows. If it grabs my attention I'll tune in for appointment viewing regardless of how much bus I've missed, but if it's a passing fancy I'll wait to hop on as the finale is nearing."
Dark,"I had the exact same experience with Game of Thrones! Caught up just in time to watch all of the final season as it was released, and didn't feel as huge a disappointment since I hadn't had years and years of build up. Worked out really well in my favour - I didn't feel like it had been a waste of time at all, so while I recognize the last season ended with a whimper I hardly feel bitter about it... it was reading all of the books that did it haha"
Dark,"> I actually find Succession fans online kind of annoying

Huh. In what way? I really haven't seen that many of them in the wild. Not being loud or boisterous about it, anyway."
Dark,"Weird. I feel like Succession has some overlap with The Sopranos, obviously without the violence. Both shows are hilarious black comedy/dramas. Both shows go for more understated plot conflicts (people complained about Logan v Kendall in season 3, the exact type of anti-climax commonly featured in Sopranos) and focuses more on family/work dynamics. Both shows are tend to spin wheels before justifying it with a strong payoff. Both are stylistically different of course, Sopranos has a more arthouse feel and aesthetic, Succession goes for mokumentary style (things like zooming into the face ala The Office) but a good chunk of their core characteristics are pretty similar."
Dark,I do not think there is a reason to think otherwise. 3-4 episodes in the writing would be on the wall.
Dark,That would have been true of HOTD too
Dark,"Almost all I found online talked endlessly how it's the best show ever made and if you say you prefer something else they call you stupid and say you're dumb for ""not getting"" succession. 

that's been my experience at least."
Dark,No. They've got first 6 with HOTD
Dark,"The difference is that the ending of HOTD season 1 wasn’t explicit based on the books, so there is some amount of mystery there."
Dark,"Hmmm, haven't seen that at all."
Dark,They're saying that the story was already out there for HotD.
Dark,I watched the shit out of this show. My 14yo ass thought Jessica Alba was the hottest woman ever to exist.
Dark,"I swear those FOX bastards were trying to sabotage every show I enjoyed by moving it to that cursed Friday death slot. There's even a [Wiki entry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot) for it.

Brisco County Jr, Firefly, Dollhouse, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, just to name a few others."
Dark,I loved the first season.  The second season got a little too weird for me.
Dark,"Young Jensen Ackles was really yummy on that show.  I remember hearing a lot of behind the scenes drama when he was cast to be Max's love interest, because Michael Weatherly was the co-lead (and also dating Jessica Alba) and worried about his future on the show and made a big stink about not pairing Alba and Ackles and tried to get him fired.  I think Ackles even mentioned that in one of his interviews on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast.

So it wasn't a shocker to me to find out Weatherly was also a huge douche to Eliza Dushku."
Dark,I am literally in progress on this show right now lol. I am on Jensen Ackles' first episode! I heard about it many years ago when I started Supernatural and it was always on my list to check out and I finally started it :P.
Dark,I loved the first season. Then they introduced the dog hybrid brother in season 2 and I fell off big time.
Dark,I watched it but I barely recall anything about it except that it's the first thing I saw Jensen Ackles in and that I thought Jessica Alba was absolutely gorgeous. I'm sure I watched both seasons so I must have enjoyed it.
Dark,"It had a lot of potential for worldbuilding and I liked it overall; 

I wouldn't mind a remake set in 30-40 yrs. 

Points of improvement though:

1. go beyond Seattle into other cities/states over seasons
2. make it about more than one nuke that set of an EMP- that won't be enough to set back the US the way the show makes it out to be
3. if they're gonna have 20-episode seasons (and I hope they do), then make some larger arcs through the seasons that scale up the stakes at a slower pace
   1. first season should be about finding some fellow x5's and battling crime/corruption at a base level across Seattle + western US
   2. second season should introduce the government trying to recapture Max and the x5's; perhaps succeeding at the end; small crime + corruption stories inbetween
   3. third season is 50% about her escape and flight through the US to throw off the scent, and 50% about settling back into life as usual; peaking with that wierd cult discovering the x5s
   4. fourth season should be taking on the wierd cult in private; more focus on x5's and other civilian-run genetically enhanced operating underground across the US
   5. 5th season should be about going public; there should be an underground movement to get the VERY genetically enhanced somewhere safe.  Maybe end here the original show did?
   6. 6th onwards could be questionable but I'd like to see the final stakes being genetically enhanced from other countries -like China playing a huge role in some kind of international incident- end with a joint US against some external baddy."
Dark,"I absolutely loved this show. Bought the box sets and even the crappy game they made for Xbox/PS2. I do think the quality really dropped in the second season, and that’s also when they injured the wrestler Lita on the set and derailed her career at its peak, so teenage me was very angry at the time lol."
Dark,"I remember some speculation that at least part of the reason for the show's decline in ratings may have been because of September 11th. In the aftermath of 9/11, the concept of ""America is attacked by a nuke and reduced to a third world country"" didn't sound as entertaining to people."
Dark,Loved this show. It was dark and edgy.
Dark,"One of the worst victims of Fox's deliberate sabotage, and meddling with a good concept."
Dark,I just remember some press event announcing it and thinking Jessica Alba is hot AF
Dark,Who does but all I remember is Alba.
Dark,They set up season 3 so well too..
Dark,"Oh yes, the start of my boyhood crush on Jessica Alba. It was also fairly good TV, at the time. My brother and I followed it for a bit. Guess I'd forgotten it was a James Cameron project."
Dark,At one point my favorite tv show.  Haven't watched it since it aired. Think I need to find some dvds.
Dark,Great pilot. The rest of the episodes were disappointing for me. Never finished it.
Dark,I loved Dark Angel. I had a crush on Jessica Alba and Jensen Ackles. I read book series after season2.
Dark,"Yup, loved that show.."
Man Down,"I rate Greg Davies. One of my current favourites, I first saw him in We Are Klang which is even higher in the quirky league."
Man Down,"A decent show to start off with, but becomes a must watch after the first few episodes. Great surreal comedy."
Man Down," Shakira's depiction of birth is one of the funniest things I have seen on TV in awhile.

Davies' show **Cuckoo** is also very good."
Man Down,I love this show so much. RIP Rik Mayall :-(
Man Down,"I didn’t like the first few episodes but I’m so glad I hung on. 

I look forward to Shakira in every episode. "
Man Down,Great show. Surprised so few people have seen it. The forth season was amazing. Had me in tears a couple times. Hope they follow up with another series.
Man Down,Is he referencing his fucking teaching career from his stand up shows in this series!?
Man Down,*complement
Man Down,"Yep, it's gotten better and better"
Man Down,"> Davies' show Cuckoo is also very good.

I watched an episode or two of it and I couldn't get into it, but I'm gonna try it again after enjoying Man Down"
Man Down,"I bet he is, he is a teacher for at least part of the series "
Man Down,"The first half is better than the second, IMHO."
Man Down,"Gaiman:

>”Sandman Season 2 has been commissioned by Netflix and is real. Whatever behind the scenes wrangling and negotiating needed to happen to make this a reality has already occurred.”"
Man Down,"> ""Sandman Season 2 has been commissioned by a Netflix and is real.


Plenty of shows were renewed, but few weeks/months later, they were unrenewed. This happened at Netflix, HBO, Paramount+, AMC+  etc

In the current era of belt-tightening, nothing is real until they drop the second season on the service."
Man Down,"Gonna be interesting what they do with it. No spoilers but other than the first maybe, 20% of the novel, the rest is all stories through out history. If they do go all out on what big story pieces there are in the 2nd then I hope they stick with Barbie's stuff. Martin Tenbones is ma boi."
Man Down,So happy they adapted this well. The battle with Lucifer and the death/Hob episode really stood out!
Man Down,Sandman 2: Man Your Own Sand
Man Down,"The Batgirl directors assured us it was safe too.

Sorry, just making trouble ;)"
Man Down,"I won't believe it until it shows up on my Netflix homepage. Warner Bros Discovery has been unpredictable and honestly it isn't that abnormal for any company to go back on a deal. 

I get why he has to sound optimistic for fans though."
Man Down,"i wouldnt treat it as a 100% confirmation tho, he probably is also in the blank in big corporation actions"
Man Down,"Dang, I feel every major show at Netflix is either mired in some dispute, is in the process of being cancelled, or is facing some other problem...Netflix is turning out to be very unreliable from a production standpoint."
Man Down,I hope season 2 is more like the first half of season 1 than that awful Dream Vortex arc. Honestly the Vortex plot felt like a CW show but with a higher budget (especially how bad the main actress was).
Man Down,Should I continue watching this show if the first two episodes just didn't do it for me at all? Main character is super unlikable so far. Never read the comics.
Man Down,Wooooo I had some of my best sleeps in ages while watching season 1. I can't wait.
Man Down,More Desire plz.
Man Down,"Did anyone feel like this fell off a cliff halfway through the season? I'm not hating and I'm glad it got a second season. However, I was much less interested in the second half of the season and I'm just curious if I'm alone in that thinking."
Man Down,"Was very disjointed.  Guessing that's because S1 covered an anthology?

I quit maybe 4-5 eps in?"
Man Down,"Didn't WB film all of Batgirl too, then cancel it when it was in the can?  I wouldn't call jack shit ""safe"" while WB is cleaning house."
Man Down,Fuck yeaaaa one of my favorite shows!
Man Down,Is this actually a good show? I remember seeing the trailer and thinking it looked goofy and boring.
Man Down,"I didn’t care for it. No offense to anyone who enjoyed , just wasn’t my cup of tea.

Besides , everyone knows Netflix will wait until after season 3 to fk up popular shows :/"
Man Down,Watched episode one of first season ....it was super un-captivating. Ugh.
Man Down,Yay
Man Down,"Glad to hear it...but I'll breathe easier once I see the words ""New Episodes"" On the show thumbnail."
Man Down,I was so bored by this show after an episode and a half. Gotta give it another shot at some point.
Man Down,"Never read the comics, had no idea about what sandman was, thought the first episode was utterly bizarre, only the vagueness intro to who he is, what he does, what powers he has, when he lives, how he influences the human world, who he works with... No background at all, he gets summoned and trapped for 100 years, goes back, his realm is destroyed. But I don't care about that at all because I'm not invested in it. It means nothing to me.

I didn't watch any further"
Man Down,That fucking clown is going to kill WB.  At least we'll get a season 2 of sandman first!
Man Down,Neil Gaiman is a gift.
Man Down,Westworld. I’m so sad.
Man Down,It fucking better be
Man Down,Should have been cancelled
Man Down,[deleted]
Man Down,Too bad the show sucks and doesn't come close to living up to the source material. The audiobook is leagues better. Imagine that.
Man Down,Woke.
Man Down,Was there ever any real doubt?
Man Down,"But will it be woke enough? That's the question.

Any more male characters we can turn into women?"
Man Down,The amount of gay people/gay Shit that happens in this show is not realistic to the world (literally every episode some weird gay shit happens)
Man Down,What was crazy to me is how much better Sandman looked than an HBO produced Mega hit like Game of Thrones new series
Man Down,Meanwhile Stand Straitman got canceled
Man Down,One less thing to worry about that I already wasn’t worried about.
Man Down,And they renamed it to Sandperson.
Man Down,👏
Man Down,Gay man
Man Down,Destruction the endless moment
Man Down,"He can't possibly be sure. They wouldn't tell him if they were secretly considering cancelling it, and they have already cancelled projects that were already commissioned or even in production. Hell, they have cancelled projects that were finished."
Man Down,"Netflix has a history of cancelling popular shows, I'll wait for this one and others to finish before I start them."
Man Down,This is such a nothingburger of a story. All the rumors said was that Zaslav didn't like the payment structure.
Man Down,It was already done and paid for.
Man Down,"Hope they put everything they can into it. If they flub this arc there's no reason to continue the series (It would be cancelled anyway, but still)."
Man Down,The sandman was so boring it’s def only gonna have 2 seasons
Man Down,"First half of season one was good second half fell apart, kinda hard to determine how season 2 will go hopefully it’s good as the series has potential."
Man Down,Is this going to be like Miracleman?
Man Down,"Don’t mess with ma Sandman, there’s piles of other useless drivel that can be tossed before this gem."
Man Down,"I stopped watching it as soon as i saw Lucifer. I mean cmon, My hopes of Lucifer was so high cos of Tom Ellis"
Man Down,I really wish they’d give American Gods another shot.
Man Down,I'm really waiting for next season. Good to know things are looking ok.
Man Down,Could not get into this show. The director or sound guy made the dialogue hard to hear. I like the actors but it’s not for me.
Man Down,No shit. Netflix is footing the bill for production. Sandman costed 15 mill per episode on season one.
Man Down,I really enjoyed season 1.
Man Down,This is definitely a Warner Bros and Netflix issue that will only involve new series sales. The issue will likely be long resolved before the new Sandman renewal is in consideration in a few years time.
Man Down,Reading between the lines: they already cut the check.
Man Down,[deleted]
Man Down,I used to think a renewal meant nothing until cameras started rolling. But we've all been burdened and that doesn't mean it's safe either.
Man Down,"I started the comic after watching season 1 and am just wrapping up the 2nd book.  I get why they hesitated on season 2, going to be a bit different."
Man Down,Raised by wolves fans would like a word
Man Down,"And even if.. I kinda see no way in hell that Sandman will ever get a full adaptation. Hell, I kinda doubt season 3 is in the cards unless season 2 will be some sort of surprise mega hit.

Which sucks."
Man Down,"Even if it's released, it's not guaranteed to stay. David Zaslav has removed HBO ORIGINALS from the platform as tax right offs. Netflix removed their Marvel shows as well."
Man Down,"
>the rest is all stories through out history.

The best parts of season 1 were the standalone episodes, so that's not necessarily a problem."
Man Down,"I did some back of napkin math based on the first season and it looks like they can easily knock out two trade paperbacks each season, maybe a bit more for some of the one off stories getting tweaked or cut for IP reasons."
Man Down,Martin Tenbones deserved better!!!!
Man Down,Lucifer seemed like the weakest casting to me. Everyone else was perfect. But I did enjoy that battle scene.
Man Down,"Adapted this well? What are you talking about?

They made Constantine a woman FFS. A lesbian woman. Because, you know, woke.

I am hoping they will make a Sandman tv series some day. It could really work well in that format."
Man Down,Sandman 3: Keep My Sand Out Yo F***ing Mouth
Man Down,"Sandman 2: looks pretty enough but the storyline, pacing, and acting are mid at best. I'm surprised it got renewed."
Man Down,Well the movie itself is safe- WB still has it and it was absolutely filmed in some capacity. It just won't be released ever
Man Down,"No this is accurate. Until season 2 airs, anything can happen. Honestly why would Gaiman even know?"
Man Down,"I think that's just at a different stage. If they make season 2 and test audiences are showing that it's a total dumpster fire, they'd probably consider cancelling it, but the fears gaiman is trying to settle are around whether they will cancel it for legal reasons."
Man Down,"That movie was dumpster fire and I don't know why people cling on to it. Like it was so fucking bad that Disco/WB looked at it and said ""yup we're writing this 200m disaster off as a loss""."
Man Down,">I get why he has to sound optimistic for fans though.

And to the cast so they don't shop other offers."
Man Down,They do this kind of shotgun thing of making a massive number of shows and hoping one sticks. Wednesday is the most recent example.
Man Down,"lets be real, this is not a major show"
Man Down,They squandered their position of market leader long ago.
Man Down,"Season 2 will pull primarily from Volumes 4 and 5, with one-off episodes or episode portions adapting most of the remaining one-off issues up to this point in the comic.

Volume 4, Season of Mists, is mythic level storytelling that introduces us to gods and angels and the faerie court and centers on the actions of Lucifer. Volume 5, A Game of You, is closer to being a sequel to The Doll’s House (second half of season two) with a couple characters recurring, but it is less formulaic than that volume and weirder in general, so you may like it more than the previous such section (I certainly do as far as the comics are concerned)."
Man Down,"Its straight out the comic and the show actress was just like the comic character. Personally i just dont think that comic arc is something most people will like. Its basically alice in wonderland but coming off the more sinister early arc and somberness of death it feels like a different show and doesnt slightly suprise me tgat people dislike it.

Even in the original comic its somewhat whiplashy to jump to that from the previous stuff."
Man Down,The second novel is near all short stories through history of how Dream influenced/watch/helped/deus ex machina'd shit. In a lot of ways it's more of a middle child of building up the endless and their influence on the world. I think best case is maybe 8 single serving stories similar to the few episodes they release at the end of last season. That said those stories are some of my absolute favourites from the whole thing.
Man Down,"Yeah, Rose Walker and her friends actresses were pretty terrible. It was literally Vanesu Samunyai's FIRST EVER acting gig (per imdb) and that made people speculate that she was brought in either because of her money or relations/connections."
Man Down,Wholeheartedly disagree on that one. I think the entire season was phenomenal and an awesome adaptation of the comics.
Man Down,"You know I wasn't a fan of the Vortex arc at first but have grown to love it on repeated viewings.

The actress was fine too she was suppose to be an almost dream like character."
Man Down,Was it the kind of arc that ruins potential for future storytelling (like GoT s8 episode 4) or more like a sidestory that was kinda lame or boring which can be easily moved past?
Man Down,"how the hell did anyone finish this show it was a snoozer all the way through. I didn't read the comics so I couldn't tell if the main character was supposed to be a little bitch or not until I got to near the end and I was like ""ok he's supposed to be a whiny little bitch. that's interesting."""
Atlanta,Great episode. I legit laughed the fuck out loud when that exec in the “documentary“ did his Goofy impression.
Atlanta,I ain’t putting that white boy in my movie
Atlanta,The entire final season is still on my mind. My girl and I talk about it often. Especially the Popeyes part bc her family used to own some.
Atlanta,🎤To stand outtt above the crowd even if i got to shout it out loud. Till mine is the only face you see I’m gonna stand out till you know it’s me🎤
Atlanta,"Incredible is right. I was expecting a bummer episode, but it became one of the best of the whole series. Teddy Perkins still rates as one of my top episodes."
Atlanta,"As someone who loved *A Goofy Movie* as a kid, and *Atlanta* as an adult; this episode hit on so many levels. An unexpected gem."
Atlanta,This episode was brilliant and I loved it.
Atlanta,“Draw this!!”
Atlanta,Best episode of Atlanta. A rare 11/10.
Atlanta,"Atlanta was such a great show, everything from the writing to the acting was top tier."
Atlanta,I feel gaslit by Atlanta because I find myself asking if that was real or not all the time.
Atlanta,Brilliant episode.
Atlanta,"I feel incredibly stupid… I thought this Atlanta episode was real and the story was true until
Now……. Wow lol I’m embarrassed"
Atlanta,By the time I got to “and that’s why a goofy movie is the blackest movie” I was fuccin sobbing lol such a good piece of television
Atlanta,There was an Atlanta episode about A Goofy Movie? Holy fuck I gotta watch lol
Atlanta,Can this episode be watched coherently if you’ve never watched Atlanta before?
Atlanta,"Atlanta will be talked about in the same regard as the wire in future.

A 10/10 show with one slightly weird (albeit still great) season that didn’t have the ratings while it was airing."
Atlanta,"I remember seeing this being aired on TV in Bahrain while it was still in the cinema in the UK.  Some countries really didn't care about piracy.

Also, what's the big deal with this Atlanta episode?  Should I watch it even if I've never seen the rest of the show?"
Atlanta,It’s a shame there isn’t a 3rd movie about some kind of reunion or Christmas.
Atlanta,"Even with the latest Documentary Now season, which is always good, that Atlanta episode was one of the greatest mockumentaries I have seen in a long time!"
Atlanta,Is this how I find out the new/ last season of Atlanta is running
Atlanta,It’s so fucking good. I was hooting and hollering and clapping so hard.
Atlanta,I wonder if this episode is what got Bob Chapek ousted.
Atlanta,/r/GoofyMovie
Atlanta,"As an avid, long-time A Goofy movie fan, this episode really broke me down. Totally believed it was real at first, then after finding out that it was fictional, still broke me down because I can see something like this absolutely happening. I drive by the lake in Castaic, mentioned at the end, on a daily basis for work. After watching the episode, until I knew the truth, I would feel so awful driving by it. Great episode!"
Atlanta,I watched it last night and I thought it was another faux thing for half the episode and then I was like omg this is amazing and sad as fuck holy shit.
Atlanta,I have always loved that movie. My favorite Disney movie hands down. I’m glad it’s getting more spotlight. Wish it got a better showing for its 25th anniversary than a blu ray and some tiny back packs.
Atlanta,That episode was stressful
Atlanta,"Favorite Disney movie honestly, the soundtrack slaps (even in dubbed form as I grew up watching it)."
Atlanta,Ok well Im glad I’m not the only losing my mind over this episode…I’m like why isn’t this talked about more… is no one paying attention haha…what a gem
Atlanta,My first crush was on Max
Atlanta,Was this movie the inspiration behind the dog they added to Itchy and Scratchy with the sunglasses that was voiced by Homer in the Simpsons?
Atlanta,I thot it was a real thing until my sister said it was fake like wtf why did they do it ?
Atlanta,"The billionaire party episode was too much for me, I just stopped."
Atlanta,I’m glad *Atlanta* is over. It never knew what it wanted to do with any of the characters and was mostly distracted by conceptual episodes that had nothing to do with anything.
Atlanta,No. He IS Goofy. A-hyuck.
Atlanta,My biggest laugh came from when the camera slowly panned out and he was squatting on top of the exec table.
Atlanta,He’s a mouse…
Atlanta,I still think about the tea room because its the tea room
Atlanta,"what's your take, was she thick or nah"
Atlanta,Eat the pufferfish
Atlanta,"I legit had a ""Minooooooooooots""-esque dream the other morning. I somehow knew I wasn't actually away and said to myself ""this is a dreammmmmmmmmm"" and the same thing happened haha"
Atlanta,*notice me
Atlanta,This song is on heavy rotation in the kitchen at work.
Atlanta,"Ah, the 90’s always had the lesson in the theme song."
Atlanta,Teddy Perkins was PHENOMENAL! I found a new kind of love for Darius and lakeith in that episode.
Atlanta,"It's been an entire month and I still think about this episode like it was yesterday.

Honestly, an Emmy worthy episode."
Atlanta,"I don’t watch the show, but I love Goody zombie. Worth watching as a stand-alone ep?

*goofy movie dammit"
Atlanta,"I gave up on Atlanta halfway through the Amsterdam season. Can I just pick this episode up and watch it, or do I need to watch the entire season first?"
Atlanta,"As someone who can tell you about all the deep fascinating political battles of the studio at the time between Katzenberg and Eisner and all that, the first 1/3 of the episode *still* had me questioning if some things were real! Lol."
Atlanta,"If you want a imo satisfying explanation why the goofy movie is a ""black"" movie I recommend this actual [short documentary video](https://youtu.be/bpDJeRnLS2U) about the goofy movie 

Tl;dw one of the main character artists for the goofy movie was a black woman who infused a style to some of the characters that resonated with a lot of black youth.

edit: carrole holliday"
Atlanta,"What... Even with the ending of the episode.. you thought it was real? 


Invest in bitcoin"
Atlanta,What? How?
Atlanta,Lad.
Atlanta,"Ha! Somehow I love that people think that story was real

But honestly there are real facts in there about peppered in so I can understand..."
Atlanta,I sat there during the episode fact checking because I was curious 🤣
Atlanta,Fuck. Same. :( bino is actually a cheeky mofucka
Atlanta,Hurry up!
Atlanta,"Yes.
Has nothing to do with the Atlanta character and story arc."
Atlanta,"Yes. Never seen anything else in the series and this one was a stand-alone that didn't require any extra information. Apparently there are some references to other episodes (B.A.N. is apparently a running gag of a fake network), but the episode itself doesn't require any other knowledge.

FWIW, my search algorithm has been all kinds of odd since watching it. I guess I'm not the typical Atlanta viewer, so now the algorithm doesn't know what to throw at me."
Atlanta,"Exactly. It will only get appreciated in the future when specific moments of specific episodes will give the series some traction and well-deserved exposure.

There's some truly absurd humor in some episodes but that's what makes it so great."
Atlanta,It’s awesome
Atlanta,"It's a stand-alone episode and requires zero knowledge of the show to follow.

If you liked A Goofy Movie, I highly recommend it."
Atlanta,Been over for weeks. Go binge it!
Atlanta,I like to think so
Atlanta,Also /r/GoofyMovieMemes
Atlanta,Wow I’m going to be thinking about this for the next month
Atlanta,There were some real facts peppered in
Atlanta,Poochie?  Not just any dog
Atlanta,"No, the suits at Fox recommended the Simpsons add a new character to join the family to spice things up so they wrote the Poochie episode instead."
Atlanta,WAIT THAT SHIT WAS FAKE/…I had convinced myself it was for 40 min and then was like no they definitely switched it up and wanted to tell a story and then was like I won’t even look it up il suspend my belief but omg
Atlanta,Season 4 is pretty good though!
Atlanta,Your loss
Atlanta,"Atlanta is not a show that intended to present a simple narrative. They intentionally messed with those expectations. Those were not distractions: that was the show. 

And yet they still did, in fact, develop their characters deeply. 

It’s one of the best shows in tv history. You didn’t watch it correctly."
Atlanta,Garsh!
Atlanta,i know mickey is white in the same way i know knuckles is black.
Atlanta,"Nah. Darius saw how happy his friends were. Finally living the life they’d been working so hard for, after all the shit they’ve been through, and I think that’s why he smiles at the end. He’s relieved and happy that he isn’t in the tank. It’s real and it’s good. (Plus you can faintly hear sirens in the background)."
Atlanta,Why did that episode make me cry???
Atlanta,"I think nah, but I always tend to lean to the pessimistic interpretations in these kind of situations"
Atlanta,Sometimes. Depends on the angle.
Atlanta,"It's all a dream that was a dream the whole series was, but he was in the same part of the dream that they had been in the whole series. So while he is going to jail he is also still in a dream. Judy was always thick."
Atlanta,Naww I’m good.
Atlanta,I was just about to correct it but I thought na he prob wouldn’t care lol good thing Spotify has lyrics right
Atlanta,I sometimes think that a good percentage of Atlanta’s success is just that Lakeith is a truly phenomenal actor. I’ve loved him in every role he’s had.
Atlanta,Who ordered the white rice?
Atlanta,What is Goody zombie?
Atlanta,"Absolutely, it has no connection to the show. Completely stand alone."
Atlanta,"You can definitely just watch this episode! It doesn't follow any of the show's main characters at all, and is a stand-alone story. Although I highly recommend watching the entire season at some point too."
Atlanta,"The last season is nothing at all like the Amsterdam season, it has a lot of great moments, highlights are the Goofy ep and the finale"
Atlanta,"i feel like if you didn't like season 3, you wouldn't like the Goofy episode as well. it's a standalone like half of season 3 episodes."
Atlanta,"Please at least just watch this episode, even if none of the others. It completely stands alone"
Atlanta,"When it said B.A.N. at the beginning, I was pretty sure it wasn't real, but I still googled to make sure."
Atlanta,Pretty sure by the end I was on my phone/listening instead of paying attention as I can’t even recall the ending. Is probably why I believe it lol. Also invest in ADA
Atlanta,"> there are real facts in there about peppered

i thought the funniest thing about this episode is that Sight & Sound article in which Goofy is called ""a good-natured coloured boy"" *actually exists*."
Atlanta,"I mean, I know for a fact that A Goofy Movie is the blackest movie of all time for sure! I’m curious as to what was true though. I think the director should chime in."
Atlanta,American Vandal on Netflix is also very real and very much worth watching 😉
Atlanta,"Not saying it ain't good, just too cringe for me. It gets surreal, it used to be very real. I dunno, just can't go through."
Atlanta,[removed]
Atlanta,And piccolo
Atlanta,Actually Knuckles is [Aboriginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna).

Hope it is good."

The Story of God with Morgan Freeman,"I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright.

The Story of God with Morgan Freeman," The Escape from Alcatraz bio was really interesting I thought! The other people mentioned in this thread I don't recognize. It's a pretty cool topic that isn't totally over-saturated yet, like idk ghost shows for example. But I mean I'd probably watch anything with Morgan Freeman and/or Morgan Freeman's voice."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"He was an amazing actor. I'm pretty sure he did all his TPB work sober, and was probably the best onscreen drunk ever (in my opinion). Rest In Peace, bud."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"The liquor is calling the shots now :(

RIP "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"The shit clock's ticking for all of us.

The big dirty shit hawks are coming. They're flying in low. They're swooping down, shitting on people, dragging them off to the big shit nest. "

RIP."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,This is a shiticane of news.  Tonight I'll be one with the liquor for you Jim.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"This man was a Canadian treasure. Thank you for bringing so much laughter and happiness, John. You will be missed. 

> Do you feel that Randy, the way the shit clings to the air? Shit Blizzard...  "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"I saw John (Lahey) and Patrick (Randy) do shakespeare while in character as Mr. Lahey and Randy, one of funniest live skits I have ever seen. Meeting or seeing john throughout the years, he always had time for his fans, gonna miss the character and really gonna miss the great man he was."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,He was a beautiful man.  [Watch this](https://youtu.be/3mcQfP8k51s)
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"He'll be supervising trailer parks in the sky with Bobandy and team Sexian. 

This fucking sucks :( "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Oh no. :( R.I.P. 

He was absolutely fantastic as Lahey."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"I'll never forget, I got to meet him and the boys after one of their live shows

Me and my wife walk into the room where the meet and greet is and my nervous wife blurts out: ""Oh this is exciting""

Without missing a beat John with his signature lahey slur says: ""Did you piss yourself?""

So sad RIP"
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Had the pleasure of meeting him a few times through work related events, and he was a kind and funny guy. Rest in peace, and condolences to the family "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Completely out of left field. He's been to my city with Randy twice over the last year with his stage show and I kept telling myself that I'd see him ""next time"".

Condolences to Sarah and the rest of the family. This is a huge blow to Canada and TV."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"My day just turned into an all you can eat shit buffet. RIP Jim Lahey, you were a legend. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"My small John Dunsworth story. A few years back me and a coworker were driving down route 90 in Winnipeg near the airport. We get to a red light and I look out the window to the right (was in the passenger seat) and I see what looks like Mr. Lahey driving beside us.

Did a bit of a double take, tapped my co worker and he looked over. Clearly John Dunsworth knew I was putting the pieces together and smiled, said “How’s it going boys?”

I blurted out “Good Mr. Lahey!” Just as the light turned green. He nodded as he drove off. We were both a bit stunned, saying “did that just happen?”

RIP, drinking all the liquor at the trailer park in the sky."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,Pouring out a nice drinkie poo for him.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"God dammit. Just saw him and Bo-bandy in Williston ND and did the meet and great as well. He was spry as fuck at the show too. They asked for a volunteer to go on stage, and instantly got bum rushed by a bunch of drunk Williston fucks. Well Lahey bypassed those fucks like a ninja, and randomly picked my friend Adam who was just sitting there at our table. Long story short they made him take his shirt off and Lahey tricked Adam into letting him take a body shot off of him.  Adam is shy too, totally made the fucking night epic. We called Lahey and Randy by their real names backstage at the meet and great to see if they would break character and talk to us, they absolutely would not! Totally dedicated to those characters. Even did a little act for just the 2 of us, and didn't rush us at all. 

Lost a legend today boys. Gonna pour me a couple drinky poos tonight "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"""We're headed for a shit typhoon, Randy. You better haul up the jib before it gets covered in shit!"""
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Andre the Giant may have been the greatest drunk ever, but Mr. Lahey  is the greatest drunk ever to grace the screen. Trailer Park Boys walks a very fine line between stupid and genius, but there's nobody that's more of a joy to watch than the antagonist/anti-hero than the supervisor of Sunnyvale. 

My father did radio dramas with him in Halifax and always spoke fondly of him. Mom mentioned that he was very soft spoken in real life and not a big drinker at all. It just goes to show how dedicated he was to his craft and succeeding in becoming the biggest asshole you rooted for. 

I still laugh when I think about him being completely dyed in blue ink in one of the recent season finales. The plans that never came to fruition, the scheming against the boys, the relationship with Randy and Barb and, of course, one of the best rivalries ever with Ricky. I felt that John Dunsworth had good chemistry with EVERY single actor on the show, and that's about the only person I'd make that claim for. 

RIP you drunk, beautiful bastard. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,This man is the Canadian Bob Ross you can't deny it.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Posted my experience with John Dunsworth in another topic. I like to share it so here it is.

I like telling this story about John Dunsworth.
He used to give out postcards to fans that would ask. My girlfriend asked and got one, he said he'd send me one but I didn't get it for months and was convinced it just wasn't coming. My gf saw how sad I was and asked him if he was still doing it, and he said no the requests were too many, but that he would call me. A week or so later I get a call from Nova Scotia. And it's John Dunsworth. He started out for a bit in character, but after a bit switched to his normal persona and asked me about how my life was, the weather in California and other small talk. And that was it. Fast forward a couple of months, and my girlfriend loses her long time family dog. I reach out to him and ask him if there's any way he can maybe just send her any kind of card with his signature, as she actually lost her card he gave her during a move,(his other ones were trailer park co supervisor certificates he'd make out to you or the cover of the Dicshitnary) but he said he didn't have any but he would call. Lo and behold he does, talks to her for a good while. I didn't tell her, so when SHE saw Nova Scotia on her caller ID she was double surprised. Pretty sure she cried but I tried to let her have her privacy. That's the kind of stuff he would do for a fan, take time out of his real life, all because we loved what an amazing and hilarious actor he was."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"What a blow to Halifax, everyone is getting on the liquor tonight. The guy gave his life to this city."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,Shit.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,You will always be the liquor my friend. Thanks for the laughs from a Nova Scotian'er who grew up watching you.

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"""You know, Ricky grew up as a little shit-spark from the old shit-flint. And then he turned into a shit-bonfire and then driven by the winds of his monumental ignorance, he turned into a raging shit-firestorm.

Will miss the guy :("
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"It's not often a celebrity death has any impact on me, but this one really left me feeling sad. He was brilliant in the show. RIP Jim. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,shit moths randy
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,Shit. I never watched tpb but I watched him on Haven. His ability to play such polar opposite roles and make it convincing showed his strength as an actor. A coworker got to play a part in tpb the most resent season on Netflix and told us how he was definitely one of the nicest of the bunch. He will be missed. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"Yeah, this one hurts. A little drinky poo is in order. RIP Mr. Lahey."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"I remember the first time I saw Lahey in the wild was about 10-11 years ago. I was walking in to Pro Skates and one of the shop guys is hauling ass out the door yelling ""out of the way!"". Me kind of confused stood by the door wondering what is going on and he yells down the sidewalk "" Hey Lahey! FUCK YOU!"". Lahey turns around with a huge smile and waves at him then keeps walking. Met him a couple years later and fuck what a nice guy he was."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,The way she goes boys
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,RIP John. By far and away the best actor to ever portray a drunk person and it's a damn shame we lost him.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,John seemed like a really nice guy and he was definitely a hell of an actor. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"The Trailer Park Boys were on a live tour recently and came through St. Louis. The night after their show they came into my restaurant to celebrate Bubble's (Mike Smith's) birthday. The whole group was there, and hands down Dunsworth was the absolute best. Just as quirky as his actual character. Incredibly nice to the staff and cracking jokes. At the end of the meal he just walked back into the kitchen and exclaimed how great the food was. 

Dude was truly a class act. And it's surreal how just a couple months ago he was fine, and chipper, and full of energy. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"So many laughs and fun memories. Lahey was an amazing character. Rest in Peace, John Dunsworth. ""You might be able to fool the FBI, but you can't fool the FB-me."" "

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"My fraternity loved this show so much, when I pledged I had never even heard of it. I was in a two man pledge class, my pledge name was ""The Mustard Tiger"" and my bros name was ""The Green Bastard"" I soon realized the beauty of the show and it became a huge part of my college life. Every night after hard drinking you'd hear the TPB theme song playing randomly throughout the night from all of us falling asleep watching it. It will never be the same without Jim. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"I don't usually care when celebrities pass on but fucking-a this one hurts. Thanks for all the laughs, John. "

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"...are you fucking serious? WTF. Fuck. My condolences to his family and friends. Fuuuck...

Edit: This fucking sucks. I *really* liked this man. 

[Here](https://youtu.be/3mcQfP8k51s) is a video that I liked from him. Has nothing to do w/ TPB, just a man doing what he likes. FML. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,He's flying with the shit angels now. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"“I am the liquor.”

Thanks for the laughs, Mr. Lahey. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA,"I always said if anything happened to John Dunsworth that TPB should just wrap it up. 

First they lost Lucy. Then they lost J-Roc. Lucy is meh, but J-Roc was hilarious. Still, the show could live on without those two. 

The show cannot live on without John Dunsworth. So unless they get some semi big named extremely talented actor to fill the void, I don't see TPB lasting another 2 seasons. 

RIP Lahey, you will be missed. 

PS: I suggest to anyone (who have or have no seen the show) to watch the end of season... 8? I believe. Where he has the 1% ownership in the park and Julian is being buddy buddy trying to get him to give the 1% to him so he can buy the park. 

John's scene at that part when he's asked to sign over the 1% is amazing. It's like an entire actors reel in one scene. He goes through the entire spectrum of emotions. Happy. Sad. Angry. Menacing. Horny/Filled with lust. Arrogant. All over the course of like 3 minutes. 

Truly one of the most talented actors in the world. He'd convince anyone he was drunk and the guy doesn't even drink at all. 

RIP Lahey you will be SORELY missed. "
Mars,Loved those shows.
Mars,Can't tell if he's saying it's in development hell or if it's actually being worked on?
Mars,"He doesn’t sound optimistic. Hope it comes together, love Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes."
Mars,"I had been wondering about this lately as I re-watched ashes to ashes a few months back and there had been no recent update on lazarus. Part of me is nervous about them making more as I liked how it ended, it felt satisfying, but I trust the writers they they wouldn't do it unless they had a great idea & thought it was worth it."
Mars,You really gonna believe The Master?
Mars,it could get a HD remaster before though
Mars,"what, do you think they give out top quality BBC dramas in them lucky bags?"
Mars,it was amazing show...especially season 1
Mars,Would it be named after a 90s Bowie song
Mars,I loved it when it was on but it never went anywhere. Just toyed with the ambiguity for too long.
Mars,Sounds like he's holding back from saying 'development hell' - which is what it really seems like at this stage if there's been no development since the initial announcements.
Mars,That's probably as he doesn't know anything and answers diplomatically...
Mars,"Basically that he doesn't know. All he knows is he and Glenister read a script and said yes.

Given that Ashley Pharoah is also showrunning *Around the World in 80 Days*, it could simply be *Lazarus* hasn't moved forward while he's gone off to work on Series 2 of that show first."
Mars,Life On Mars was top tier. Ashes to Ashes was a flanderised mess.
Mars,The spinoff idea has been sent to a fob watch
Mars,Was it shot on film? That's the only way you're going to get a proper HD remaster.
Mars,Ashes to Ashes ended pretty fucking unambiguously.
Mars,"Ashes was an absolute parody of everything that worked in Life on Mars. It felt like one of those special one-off self-aware scenes they do for comic relief, except it was a whole series"
Mars,You didn't like [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz8ppujjTXw)?
Mars,Agree.
Mars,Really? I don’t it closed off well quite well.
Mars,I thought the third season really upped their game and the finale was surprisingly satisfying as a wrap up to both shows.
Mars,"Life On Mars felt so 'lived in' and of its time, plus it was great to have a show set in Manchester - the setting was such a key part of that show, really set the tone.

Then Ashes to Ashes did away with all that. Set in London, nothing fresh about that. Retooling Gene as some sort of sex symbol. 

Main character, even though she was a cop, was wearing all these glamouros outfits in each scene (think Emily in Paris). Ridiculous over the top storylines - if memory serves correct, the main character's own daughter is taking hostage in the first scene, just so silly. 

Real letdown.

I was rewatching the series recently, showing it to my sister. We loved everything LoM. And then neither us could get through the first episode of A2As, it really has not aged well. Absolutely farcical in comparison to LoM."
Mars,"Ashes to Ashes S3 is better than any other series of LoM or AtA, so gonna have to disagree here."
Mars,This fan cut is a solid 4' though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqqrQ4bSQzI
Mars,"LoM was a hard act to follow, and I was really unsure about A2A the first couple of episodes where it was finding it's feet, but it became it's own thing.

Character changes - well where LoM wore the clothing of The Sweeney, A2A wore the clothes of Dempsey and Makepeace, or another 80's show.  It moved subtly with the times, which would actually fit with the meta-narrative - Alex found the world that would reflect her landscape.

I still prefer the lightning in a bottle that was LoM, for sure, but A2A still works in its own parameters and we'd probably be less comparing if LoM hadn't come before it!"
Mars,"It has that garbage tv quality to it as well, like they can’t show Gene Hunt Uzi a criminal like it’s Scarface or something, so they just gave him Uzi a bin or something instead and show the same thing from several angles because it’s “the money shot”."
Mars,Jesus this is sad.
Mars,"Wow, this is just heartbreaking. I just finished watching NYPD Blue. I was so impressed with him. Such a great actor even as a small child. He seemed so sweet, and apparently he was brilliant. RIP. So sad."
Mars,"He was an Eagle scout and graduated Sum Cum Lude from USC, and still became homeless and on heroin/Fentanyl.  I have four boys much younger than him.  From his resume, he was raised ""right"".  Jesus, these drugs are bad."
Mars,So sad.  He was a great little actor on NYPD Blue
Mars,This completely breaks my heart. Blue has always been my favorite show and he was a wonderful child actor. So sad.
Mars,Oh wow this is so sad- I remember him as Theo :(
Mars,Part of the club now :/
Mars,"I saw Theo’s birth last week, in my first watch. That was a surprisingly realistic birth scene. He’s tiny and has gunk all over."
Mars,"Aw, damn it. Andy's boy? Shit."
Mars,"Drugs man, gotta say no."
Mars,Died of suddenly?
Mars,"Sad shit, RIP"
Mars,"Yet Ricky Schroeder, another child actor and NYPD alum, lives to pay for Kyle Rittenhouse’s defense. The Universe is so fucking unfair."
Mars,This is sad heart's broken
Mars,[deleted]
Mars,Mars returns
Mars,Its time to legalize all drugs and provide safety resources for users and regulate them so people know they’re not getting fentanyl. Why do we keep trying the same dumb shit and being surprised that it doesn’t work?
Mars,"He looks so young and vibrant in this image. Didn’t know who he was before this post, but hope he passed quietly and relatively comfortably"
Mars,[removed]
Mars,r/13or30
Mars,[deleted]
Mars,I keep confusing him with the 6 Million Dollar Man.  His parents must have been fans. RIP.
Mars,"Should have gone with Treasure planet, because all I think is butt stuff from that show"
Mars,Died suddenly?
Mars,Oh no! Not little Theo! Why?!
Mars,"Very sad, so young."
Mars,"Most kids in 90s and 00s shows were annoying, but his scenes with Dennis Franz were so adorable."
Mars,"The article should include why he was homeless. 
Kinda an important element."
Mars,[deleted]
Mars,"NYPD Blue is my favorite series of all. And besides Dr Greene dying on ER, nothing makes me cry more than watching Andy with Theo after Sylvia...."
Mars,It's almost like it doesn't matter how you were raised and that's a distraction to spread blame where it doesn't belong.
Mars,"A vast majority of the opiod problem comes from lazy/for profit doctors over prescribing this type of medication and then once the person is better no more prescription someone says here try this and the cycle continues.

Edit: since I'm being downvoted

Mars,27 club... :(
Mars,[deleted]
Mars,💉
Mars,Ignorance
Mars,You are just pisssed that you don't get to decide.
Mars,"I mean, id wager most homeless people have direct relatives with homes. Sometimes they are separated by distance or have lost touch, sometimes drug or mental health issues make housing them in their homes with their families is too much of a burden, sometimes they have lived with relatives but its not indefinite. Some homeless people refuse help from relatives- not necessarily common but Ive seen it. Its a hard situation."
Mars,Other articles say he died of a suspected fentanyl overdose
Mars,Maybe he didn’t want to live with them? Just because family is willing to help doesn’t mean a person is willing to accept it. You/we have no idea what was going on with him so judging his family and saying it’s “fucked up” is so insensitive and ignorant. Get a clue.
Mars,Well considering he died at 27 and they didn’t list a likely cause of death I’m going to assume addiction.
Mars,It’s hard to let someone in your home knowing they are going to steal from you.
Mars,"You clearly haven’t experienced the reality of living with a drug addict or someone with serious mental illness, or worse both."
Mars,Sometimes they burn every bridge and are no longer welcome.
Mars,Mental illness could also have been a factor.
Mars,If he was a drug addict then blaming them is kinda fucked up
Mars,"Youll never know the hardships others dont speak of…
Maybe he had a toxic family 
Maybe he wasnt in a right place who knows"
Mars,"Tell me you’ve never dealt with someone with addiction without telling me. 

Not a fun time for anyone involved."
Mars,"Most homeless people are not homeless because they have no home to go to. Its almost always drugs and mental illness,  useally both. That is why throwing housing at the problem doesn't help. Most homeless need evaluations, then put in.places that can help them. We dont have that option."
Mars,What stupid comment.
Mars,"Because sometimes family members are fucked in the head 

My family lost our home of 30 years, 5 years ago. And our only relative didn’t offer us shit. Nothing. Nada. Even though he spent countless holidays in that house, and other such events 

Didn’t even come to see our new home 

Some people are assholes."
Mars,Because they abandoned him
Mars,Probably because he was doing drugs and either distanced himself through shame or alienated everybody in his life where they had to kick him out for the sake of their own lives. Happens all the time.
Mars,You can’t always safely house people in your own homes without putting your family in danger. It depends on the person.
Mars,"You're not wrong, but every case is different. It's probably a case of depression. He likely didn't want to be a burden on his family, and knew that his addiction would create problems.

It's not always easy to reach out when you need help. Especially if you aren't ready to help yourself."
Mars,"I don’t believe drugs have to be legal (or illegal) for there to be help available. If anything, it’s the production, transportation (of large amounts), and sale that should be cracked down on, not the consumption. Consumption should be seen more as a mental health issue than a crime."
Mars,"Considering what Fentanyl overdoses can do and it's side effects of which you either experience little of or all at once, I don't really think it would've been comfortably, to say the least. 

The mental anguish he would've been in being an addict and doing this to himself alone is arguably one of the more painful parts of this. Then the moment you become aware that you are shutting down and potentially overdosing, the fear that suddenly comes from that realisation is also terrifying. 

He died in a homeless facility, yet his family is there instantly with the media singing his praises but I'm left wondering where were they in supporting him through this time? Why was he left in a homeless shelter to continue taking drugs? Not saying I think they're partially responsible or anything but I also have to wonder what the situation was with these things when someone like that is left homeless and doesn't look like they're receiving any support or a shoulder to lean on to help them get out of the rut they're in. 

The entire situation is tragic and sad."
Mars,"What's wrong with you?

Stick to your usual brain busters

Mars,Wtf you want Josh to die? What'd he ever do to you?
Mars,Lord it would have cost you nothing to just not post this…
Mars,"Seriously? The guy was in a homeless facility, he has family.  Put two and two together and you get substance abuse, maybe mental health issues.  You don’t get “VacCINes killin all the kids yehaw”"
Mars,He died of a fentanyl overdose you fat moron
Mars,"Good chance he was bipolar (a pretty high % of successful actors are) and his family had clearly abandoned him, but now they feel great about issuing quotes to the media."
Mars,"Oh man, Mark Green’s death was heartbreaking. I can remember where I was when that episode aired!!"
Mars,Yeah I was devastated when mark died. Also er really went off the rails without him.
Mars,"NYPD Blue is also my favorite series ever. I was 13 when it premiered and I remember the controversy surrounding the nudity and swearing. I didn't end up watching it until I was 19 and I was hooked.

Andy is probably one of the best character arcs I've ever watched. Sylvia and Theo were such a huge part of his evolution."
Mars,It's almost like that's the point of their post.
Mars,"Damn, I thought it was more strict now."
Mars,"I find that hard to believe but it's a convenient excuse for people who don't want to admit how easy it is to import drugs from other countries specifically fentanyl fron China.

These days doctors are so paranoid that people who have legitimate pain can't get a prescription and if you do get it they only give you enough for a few days. I once had an exposed nerve near a tooth that was the worst pain imaginable like screaming in anguish in pain and after begging I finally got 3 pills to alleviate the pain and even with that the pharmacist acted like i was doing something nefarious (the first time ever getting a pain prescription filled) and I've heard similar stories from other people. 

I've never heard of a ""lazy for profit"" doctor prescribing fentanyl to patients for anything."
Mars,"No, Studio 54."
Mars,It’s long been a thing. Google it
Mars,Yup
Godless,I concur. Very good show!
Godless,Daniels is just incredible in this
Godless,It’s fantastic and made me wish more westerns were mini-series
Godless,"Yes, great show which I caught because it was the series that Scott Frank made just before he did The Queen's Gambit. The two shows share a few actors in small parts. It was amusing to see the unassuming twins in TQG playing psychopaths in the western. The headmistress in TQG is also in Godless but unrecognisable."
Godless,"I really enjoyed the acting (especially Jeff Daniels), design, cinematography and atmosphere, but I disagree on the ending; I felt the finale and especially the final shootout flopped. The bandits ride into town, people start shooting, and then Bill/Roy show up and win."
Godless,Great watch!
Godless,"I thought it was really good up until the last battle/shootout thing which just kind of fizzled. Plus Scoot McNairy's character has been having this whole story thread about dealing with going blind, and then he just comes back and is a perfect sharpshooter. Felt unearned and made the plotline seem wasted.

I enjoyed it overall though."
Godless,"It was very good and the casting was excellent. In this vein, you should check out CBC's Strange Empire."
Godless,Really good
Godless,Great show!
Godless,Just rewatched it recently. Even better the second time thru.
Godless,"I think what adds to its success is being written by Scott Frank (writer/creator of The Queen's Gambit, writer of Out of Sight with Clooney and JLo, and writer of Logan amongst other things). Plus Soderbergh produced it. He's a very high caliber writer"
Godless,"I found it extremely underwhelming despite an interesting premise, especially with the Buffalo Soldiers."
Godless,"Meh, just watch Unforgiven and save yourself some time

Edit - Sorry for making fun of a mediocre Netflix show that repeated the same line every episode"
Godless,"Been meaning to check this out, I'm a fan of Michelle Dockery & Jack O'Connell."
Godless,"It's great imo and Daniels is in one of his best roles.         
Also check out the English starring Emily Blunt. Not great but very good."
Godless,"Agreed - terrifying.
Overall, I felt the show was excellent (with the possible exception of the finale) and reminded me a lot of Unforgiven."
Godless,"This. I still love Lonesome Dove, and part of it's charm is that it was a mini-series. They obviously had great source material for LD but still, I like mini-series."
Godless,You'll probably like The English too then
Godless,Scott Frank is part of some great projects!
Godless,The I've seen my death line was also a fizzer
Godless,What is Strange Empire about?
Godless,"The ending was the weakest part by a mile but the journey is definitely very fun, IMO. I also love Sam waterston so he was a nice little bonus lol"
Godless,I’m unfamiliar with it. I’ll check it out
Godless,"See, I actually thought the way that resolved was great. No, he didn't have some genuine vision of the future, because that's fucking dumb and doesn't happen. He had a dream or whatever that he decided to believe was a vision and thought he was invincible because of it, but in the end it didn't amount to anything more than delusion."
Godless,"Frontier town on the Montana/Alberta border during the 1870s, called Janestown, which is primarily run by women after most of the men are murdered.  Unfortunately ran for only one season but it was pretty good. I liked Godless a lot but the one complaint about it I had was that, for a show about a town of women, there sure was a lot of focus on a handful of dudes, where I found Strange Empire actually gave the women in the story more of a focus."
Godless,Lonesome Dove is a little dated since it was a tv miniseries but it’s still one of the best westerns of all time. You’re in for a treat. Best Robert Duvall & Tommy Lee Jones performances ever imo and immensely quotable.”
Godless,That does sound amazing. I'll definitely look it up. I definitely would want a western that focuses more on the female residents. Thanks for suggesting it!
Godless,"Halt and Catch Fire overall has been underrated.

I’m watching him now in True Detective. The dude is consistently great."
Godless,"It's crazy this show didn't get accolades or wide acclaim at all. It's one of my favorite shows ever made, but barely anyone watched it."
Godless,"Fantastic show. People dump on AMC for mishandling The Walking Dead but it’s also the network that gave Halt and Catch Fire four seasons and a proper ending despite low viewership. So they get a lifetime pass from me.

It’s time for a rewatch."
Godless,He's had a really good career post-HaCF.  He's been in everything.  I really wish we can see Kerry Bishe in more stuff.  The only thing I recall seeing her in was the Showtime series Super Pumped.
Godless,Still gets me in the feels
Godless,He was good in Godless too.
Godless,"The entire cast deserved Emmys and I think that's why McNairy doesn't particularly shine. Yes, it's a top performance, right up against Pace, Bisch and Davis who are also giving top performances. 

A show like this is a great argument for a ""Best Cast"" or ""Best Ensemble"" Emmy."
Godless,"I just wrapped up watching the series a few days ago. I had heard about it awhile ago but didn’t get around to watching it until now. You are 100% right — McNairy is phenomenal in it, throughout, but just wait until you get closer to the finale. I was blown away by how the writers and the cast concluded his storyline. Absolutely stellar show."
Godless,"After Halt and Catch Fire anytime I see Scoot McNairy in any other show or movie I have to go ""Scoooooooooot"""
Godless,Great show overall after the first season IMO. It got so much better immediately in season 2 by upending everything.
Godless,"To me , it's the greatest tv show of all time"
Godless,I think Lee Pace should have for sure been nominated and it’s annoying he wasn’t either. Robbed!!!!!
Godless,"*Everyone* is so damned good on that show. Just an exemplary cast.

If you want to see a brief yet memorable role from Scoot McNairy, check out the Marvel short *All Hail the King*. He gets to play opposite a splendidly ridiculous Ben Kingsley for just a few minutes and he fully holds his own."
Godless,I just googled to see what else he’s been in and he is everywhere. That guy has steady work all the time. He may not be a superstar but he’s the right amount of famous. Well respected and still can go out for lunch.
Godless,Scoot McNairy is a ridiculously underrated actor. I remember seeing him for the first time in Killing Them Softly. Blew me the fuck away. I can't believe he doesn't get more high profile work.
Godless,All five of the main leads in Halt and Catch Fire were excellent. I love that show!
Godless,"When season 4 aired, I remember thinking that the younger daughter, Susanna Skaggs, was going to blow up. She was amazing on that show but since then she has only  done two episodes of Mr. Mercedes, one episode of The Gifted and been the lead in a shitty Netflix romcom.

Kathryn Newton, who played her sister, was fine on the show but nothing special and she has become super successful since."
Godless,"Sleepless, with Jamie Foxx, isn't a great movie, but McNairy is fantastic in it as the villain.

HACF was a hell of a show though. And what a cast, all four would have run away with any other show, but they're all a match here."
Godless,He was great in True Detective season 3 as well.
Godless,"Brilliant show. 

If you are in, or interested in tech, and lived in that era, it has hints of a documentary (no, not really, but you get the gist)."
Godless,"He's a fuckin' chameleon and outstanding in everything he does. Take a look at his early stuff too, like *Monsters* and *In Search of a Midnight Kiss*."
Godless,"Artie,  the strongest man in the world, did a pretty good job as well."
Godless,Really liked this show too. Gordo was my favorite
Godless,"The headline premise is false.  He got lots of accolades, at the time.  

And why him?  At least three other leads were just as strong."
Godless,"Such a goddamn amazing show. Top 10 all time, 100%. Only issue I had was with that really out of the blue, woke feminist ending with Gordon’s wife giving that “we are women, hear us roar” speech. It’s like…lady lol. You divorced your husband while he had a terminal illness and fucked around. I’d say you came out on the better end of that deal. 

Lee Pace gives one of the all time great performances in that show. Can’t say enough."
Godless,I hate this show so much. It got more and more ridiculous as it went on.
Godless,It was a show with a niche premise and a goofy title. No one should be surprised by its lack of accolades.
Godless,Think its the type of role that gets a lot of work over the next decade by impressed industry people.
Godless,"I feel strongly that it takes the actor also embracing added attention outside of just being a good actor.

Maybe the dude is good with his life and doesn’t want to do anything crazy.

Orrrrr he saw Guardians of the Galaxy, and now he doesn’t want to piss off Ronan….."
Godless,"I’ve seen him pop up in a bunch of stuff since, he doesn’t get a lot of credit from the public but the industry appreciates him"
Godless,It's a top ten show for me but might be the #1 intro. Great characters. Ending is good but oof.
Godless,I just have to say that Scoot McNairy is the most American name of all time.
Godless,Fuck I need to do a rewatch. That show is the goat.
Godless,"He did an amazing job on that show. The last season, he had me cutting onions."
Godless,"Maybe this isn’t the right place but I’m hoping it can maybe act as a repository for those of us who want to sing the praises of this series but watched it years after it was released? 


Anyway, aside from Scoot, can we give it up for Toby Huss as John “Bos” Bosworth? I freaking love what he did with this character and I equally loved his character arc throughout. Huss is one of the best character actors, imo, and has been in a zillion things. I most vividly remember him from s9e5 (during the on again / off again Elaine and Puddy romance) of **Seinfeld**, when he played *Jack, The Wiz.*"
Godless,"Halt and catch fire is the show I watch once a year at my work from home job.

I've been around computers since the early 90s and messed with most of the stuff on the show."
Godless,Narcos Mexico is good too
Godless,He was great in godless too.
Godless,It's nice to see halt gain popularity on reddit in the last couple of years. I miss that show
Godless,I’m watching True Detective season 3 right now and he’s incredible in it.
Godless,"Doesn't help that it seems to only be available on AMC+. The first season got a BD release and then dropped, and DVD is crap. It also came out at an odd time when a few big name shows pulled focus on AMC."
Godless,But those who have watched know what's up.
Godless,"Yup, definitely up there with its contemporary sister show Mad Men (also AMC). Both phenomenal period pieces."
Godless,"I can't even buy the fucking series on Blu ray, so pissed off at that fact."
Godless,Agreed! It’s criminally underrated! I always recommend it to people and most of them have never heard of it.
Godless,100% agree
Godless,"This show made me a huge fan of Lee Pace. If you think about it, his character is one of the most difficult acting challenges out there, and he knocked it out of the park.

His character is supposed to be this visionary bullshitter who can sway people with just a few words. Anyone can “act” like that, but to really pull it off, you actually have to sway the audience along with the characters. So in a sense, it’s beyond acting and ends up being something you *actually have to do*.

Now contrast his performance with the 2 Steve Jobs movies that came out - Michael Fassbender in one and Ashton Kutcher. They both “acted” the part and did “okay”.

But Lee Pace has such a magnetic charisma that no matter how much of a piece of shit his character is, you can really feel and understand why the other characters end up following him. It’s amazing."
Godless,Breaking Bad also underperformed for its first three seasons. I think it only really took off when Netflix aquisitioned it around when season 4 began airing it.
Godless,"She was in an episode or two of GLOW, but that was a few years ago"
Godless,"Fittingly, she's really good in a pretty interesting videogame called Telling Lies that's worth checking out."
Godless,"She had a main role in the reboot of Scrubs (only watch if you truly need to. It won’t make you feel good about her acting by no fault of her own, just not her wheelhouse)"
Godless,She was in that last season of scrubs a long time ago
Godless,The ~~penultimate~~ third to last episode of the series — “Goodwill” — is a perfect hour of television.
Godless,He is good in pretty much everything he does.
Godless,"I could not possibly tell you who gave the best performance in that show.

Lee Pace is masculinity incarnate and Davis could move mountains with her eyes."
Godless,"Not to mention Toby Huss, who is literally always great in everything, but plays the average man so well that people barely seem to notice."
Godless,He and his wife were best things on the show
Godless,I actually might say season 1 was my favourite part.
Godless,"Loved the entrepreneurship in season 1 and wished they had that same approach every season instead of flopping around like they did. That's not to say I didn't enjoy all seasons, they were amazing."
Godless,"I can't bloody believe it's been 5+ years since it's ended. It is officially eligible for GOAT discussion

and as someone who just rewatch-binged it last month.... it's my personal goat drama. watching a show from the first season, week by week, is an unmatchable experience. I'm glad that single day release seasons aren't the norm"
Godless,"Nah man, he got enough of a jump I’m sure he’s doing just fine with his bank account that he’s not worried about no awards from that small project a decade ago.

That being said, as nerds into computers, we absolutely loved this show. Took me back a little bit!!"
Godless,I just watched that recently! He's so good
Godless,He's an excellent actor but he's short and has a small head so he'll never be a leading guy. I know that is a ridiculous statement but it's true. Almost all leading men are either taller or have giant heads.
Godless,Susanna Skaggs is 5 years younger - hope she'll get more opportunities going forward and luckily time is on her side!
Godless,"You’re right, not sure about the downvotes. Donna was so awful by the end I stopped watching half way through S4 and just read spoilers. The whole main cast was perfect."
Godless,"I think the title is great. It refers to the subject matter and to how the characters tend to self sabotage.

My only complaint would be the first five minutes, with the cliché scene and the gratuitous sex scene.  It makes it seem like a totally different show. I turned it off myself after the pilot came out all those years ago. (But I'm glad I did, as now I get to binge it all 😄)"
Godless,"It started out hewing very close to the Mad Men formula but then it evolved into its own - and imho - far, far better thing."
Godless,"Yeah it's always annoyed me that season 1, while still good, was the weakest of the show and it got a BD and then dropped so we never got the rest/better seasons. I was just thinking recently that I'm surprised nobody has licensed the show out for a Blu-ray release with Mackenzie Davis getting so well known and Kathryn Newton getting more popular, or RLJ or Lionsgate or whoever distributes AMC produced shows releases it all themselves."
Godless,[deleted]
Godless,Rewatched Monsters and didn’t realize he was the lead.
Godless,"I thought season 1 was okay but too much of a ""what if Mad Men but in the '80s"" copy."
Godless,"I'm not saying I expected or even necessarily want him to become a ""leading man."" But he's good enough to be up there with some of the greatest and best known character actors of our time, like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi, and JK Simmons."
Shes Gotta Have It,My god this show is like Spike Lee jerking off on screen. Jesus I don't know who loves them self more QT or SL. It's so preachy. So convoluted. This feels like it's written by a super liberal first year film student. 75 % of what I'm hearing sounds so unnatural - especially when the lead talks about movies. 
Shes Gotta Have It,Loved the original movie and can't wait for this. 
Shes Gotta Have It,"This was a good trailer, but Spike Lee stuff usually goes one way or another. Hopefully this is more *Do the Right Thing*, less *She Hate Me.*"
Shes Gotta Have It,"This is giving me ""Insecure"" vibes. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"That The Roots song in the trailer, [Seed 2.0.](https://youtu.be/ojC0mg2hJCc)"
Shes Gotta Have It,Does spike lee age?
Shes Gotta Have It,"I love his movies and the original was a landmark in independent, black and feminist movies but was sort of undermined with the depiction of rape, something Spike has said he regretted putting into the movie. I wonder if this show is his way of making up for it"
Shes Gotta Have It,"Please, baby. Please, baby. Please, baby. Baby, baby, please!"
Shes Gotta Have It,bruh who the fuck downvoting this just *moments* after its been posted? 😓💁🏿
Shes Gotta Have It,"There's nothing charming or empowering about screwing lots of people at the same time, nor is it a sexual orientation. Am I supposed to be convinced that pure self indulgence is brave? Because I'm not."
Shes Gotta Have It,"No, NILES gotta have it!"
Shes Gotta Have It,"Arent there already like a million versions of ""strong independant female don't need no man"" shows? 

I guess it's an audience that is easily marketed to. "
Shes Gotta Have It,Independent woman balancing relationships and a career.  How original!  
Shes Gotta Have It,"This looks (doesn't mean it is, just the trailer ""looks"" ) a ""WTF is this shit?"" kind of show. I haven't seen the original movie so I'm out  of the loop here, but ... really ... WTF?"
Shes Gotta Have It,"The trailer looks interesting, but there was a clip posted a couple of months ago with Anthony Ramos' character that was painful to watch. I hope that it ends up being good."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Do you figure the movie is still worth watching, or will it look super dated?"
Shes Gotta Have It,I guess I'm one of the only Spike fans that like She Hate Me. Ridiculous concept but I thought it was executed well enough. Spikes fallen off but I felt this one snuck in before he fell all the way off.
Shes Gotta Have It,"If you're talking about his appearance at the beginning, that's a clip from the OG movie promotion and they dubbed in ""show"" instead of joint."

Shes Gotta Have It,"As soon as I heard someone describe themselves with like 25 different adjectives and pronouns around 20 seconds in, I was turned off.

You're bi and you like to fuck a lot of people, great. What's new?

I think people are downvoting because Netflix seems to have been jumping over themselves to corner the oppression olympics market lately. I see all these new releases for new shows about an austistic polyamorous disabled pansexual transgender nonbinary proud transracial womxn.

And, yeah, those groups who make up maybe 1 or 2 percent of the population probably need shows too, but it just seems to be the *focus* lately. Like ""Hey look, we're progressive as SHIT! Check out our new releases, tumblr fans!"""
Shes Gotta Have It,"Probably bots. Reddit seems to have some weird anti-Netflix thing going on recently and I've long been suspicious of it.

Once again, since I know people have a hissy otherwise, I'm not saying anyone who is anti-netflix is trolling as Netflix certainly doesn't always shit gold, but instead that there seems to be a coordinated effort to stir the pot."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Isn't it up to the decision maker wether they find it empowering? Not anything I'd partake in myself but at the end of the day if all parties are happy with the arrangement then why can't it be an empowering experience? At the end of the day if I'm watching a show that affirms all the beliefs I already held, it (imo) is rendered useless."
Shes Gotta Have It,In all these stories everyone is young. They never try to depict what happens to them when they get old. 
Shes Gotta Have It,"The top comments saying it looks great, too... 

I don’t get it. Like, I legitimately can’t relate to you as a human being if you think this show looks good from this trailer. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"I agree, i hope the actual show covers that and isn't just glamorizing it like the trailer kinda makes it seem. I never saw the original movie so i have no idea if that's valid or not "
Shes Gotta Have It,"Yeah, was just about to ask. Is there like a turn coming at some point in the series? It'd be weirdly... superfluous if they didn't examine the flip-side of this kind of lifestyle."
Shes Gotta Have It,Seems like an egotistical fantasy. I wonder how it would be perceived if the genders were reversed?
Shes Gotta Have It,[deleted]
Shes Gotta Have It,"Looks dated judging by the boster.

But Do The Right Thing is fresh as fuck to this very day, so who knows?"
Shes Gotta Have It,It looked cheap when it was released. So I can not imagine how bad it looks now. 
Shes Gotta Have It,"A large part of that is racism, but a small part of that is that Spike Lee doesn't have the greatest track record when it comes to writing. For every Do The Right Thing there's a whole lot of She Hate Me. I loved Malcolm X and Inside Man, but ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus"" was just painful to watch."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Sorry you can't deal with people who live a non-traditional lifestyle and their portrayals in media.

This doesn't look like it touches *anything* to do with oppression. If she's pansexual and poly, that's cool, she's not discussing anything to do with oppression. It's a show about her dealing with the complexities of her lifestyle - something that's sorely invisible in media, especially film and tv.

And Netflix isn't specializing in *anything* like that. So, they have an LGBTQI category? And you see it sometimes? Who the fuck cares! It's not the focus! Which of these Netflix Originals are catering to a non-traditional queer market?

- The Get Down

- Bill Nye

- Girlboss

- Tales by Light

- Dear White People (check! ... Except it wasn't about that at all!)

- Sense8 (had some queer characters, but it's made by the Watchowski's so, that was almost a given)

- Master of None

- Anne

- Kimmy Schmidt

- House of Cards

- Orange is the New Black (check! But in a prison for women that's going to happen/be more visible)

- GLOW

- Mindhunter

- Atypical (Do you count autism as being a group that makes up a small percentage of the population?)

- Castlevania (check! Ancient vampires and near-extinct Eastern European clans represent almost none of the current western population)

- Dark

- Disjointed

- Friends from College

- Gypsy

- Kiss Me First

- Lady Dynamite

- Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (check!)

- Real Rob (check! *Nobody* but Rob Schneider has lived a life like Rob Schneider)

- Stranger Things

- Watership Down

- Wet Hot American Summer

- She's Gotta Have It (Pansexual polyamorous, there's a check!)

So taking off my sarcastic checks, we have 3-5 out of 25, which roughly aligns with the 4% of the US population that aligns as LGBT or Queer. Of course, that number isn't exactly finite, and has gone up every year it's been surveyed, plus it ranges wildly by survey, country, city, and region.

If you think you're seeing too much LGBTQI media, just ignore it. You have a wealth of straight, traditional, non-challenging relationships to watch as it is."
Shes Gotta Have It,What a weird thing to be offended over 
Shes Gotta Have It,"ok this is one of the weirdest comments I've seen on here in a while so I can't help but reply and try to argue some of your point (since I ain't got nothing else to do).

> As soon as I heard someone describe themselves with like 25 different adjectives and pronouns around 20 seconds in, I was turned off.

why? 😕 from that statement it sounds like you have a general disliking for 'people who are different'.... but, why? what has they ever done to you? 

> You're bi and you like to fuck a lot of people, great. What's new?

well umm.... that's new, somewhat. I'm not sure how many TV shows you watch but most shows, and when I say most here I mean over 90% portray straight people. And I'm not saying that's a problem, I'm just saying a show with a gay or bi sexual main character every now and then hurts no one (well, except maybe you lol). As a TV enthusiast myself I kill for more gay couples. If over 90%...fuck it, if even over 60% of couples on TV were gay i'd be annoyed as fuck, but the majority of TV couples and characters are straight, so what's the fuzz about?

> I see all these new releases for new shows about an austistic polyamorous disabled pansexual transgender nonbinary proud transracial womxn.

And what's wrong with that? From my point-of-view we need more shows like Atypical, Looking, Transparent etc. I mean, they're definitely more refreshing than the 50+ detective shows we get every year. 

> And, yeah, those groups who make up maybe 1 or 2 percent of the population probably need shows too, but it just seems to be the focus lately.

actually, no, it doesn't seem to be the focus lately. How many shows have been released this year featuring those types you just mentioned? I can't think of more than maybe 3, so to convince me you'd have to list those shows for me.

> ""Hey look, we're progressive as SHIT! Check out our new releases, tumblr fans!""

Why you sending shots at Tumblr users? Like damn bruh... there's so much hate coming off you 😂😂 What did Tumblr do to you? Share your pain please because I'm really interested to hear. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"Because nobody wants to go from one of these ""empowering"" segments to a depressing story about a dirt poor single mother with three or four children from different fathers."
Shes Gotta Have It,Eh the movie kinda implies it but overall it comes off as empowering for the character 
Shes Gotta Have It,"Not a one to one comparison since she seems to be dating these three guys at once and they're aware she is, but there are plenty of male characters out there like Joey from Friends or Barney from HIMYM that constantly sleep around. Both are extremely popular characters."
Shes Gotta Have It,oh fuuuuuuuuuuuck off
Shes Gotta Have It,"I'm not angry about it, I just think it's a message that I wholeheartedly disagree with. I wouldn't boycott Netflix because of it or anything over-reactionary like that, but I am allowed to say I think it's wrong just as much as you're allowed to say there's nothing wrong with it."
Shes Gotta Have It,What?
Shes Gotta Have It,"She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing, Malcom X, Jungle Fever, Mo' Better Blues, Crooklyn, He Got Game, 4 Little Girls, The Original Kings of Comedy, Bamboozled, 25th Hour, Inside Man, and When the Levees Broke...

Spike Lee's cinematic contributions far outweigh some lackluster films he's made. There's been no other black filmmaker to advance the medium and make it more accessible to people of color than Spike. It's really just racism - you don't really see the kind of vitriol that you with Spike directed towards prolific filmmakers with a couple bad movies. "
Shes Gotta Have It,Chiraq. Ugh.
Shes Gotta Have It,Netflix is doing a Watership Down adaptation? Hell yes!
Shes Gotta Have It,"> Sorry you can't deal with people who live a non-traditional lifestyle and their portrayals in media.

I'm going to ignore this sentence, but thanks for the rest of your informative post."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Dig the post, but Master of None got that writing Emmy for Thanksgiving. Pretty...pretty...pretty gay. Thought that deserves a mention."
Shes Gotta Have It,I'm not offended at all. I just roll my eyes when a character is introduced with eightteen pronouns instead of being a real life person.
Shes Gotta Have It,"For once I'd like a show where a character is gay, except that's just like a minor part of their character. The problem is when we get gay characters in shows, they're not simply attracted to men, they're *GAYYYYYYYY* \*jazz hands\*.

That's my point. Ok, so she's bi and sexually active. Is that *all* she is? Because it seems like it given that trailer.

edit: And don't even get me started on tumblr. I've seen enough posts about people being headcased otherkin wolf spirits shipping two underage characters from a cartoon to last a lifetime."
Shes Gotta Have It,">a dirt poor single mother with three or four children from different fathers.

Shes Gotta Have It,Compelling argument.
Shes Gotta Have It,"I don't spit ""vitriol,"" I just think he's a wildly inconsistent writer. It seems like you can't be sure whether you're going to get Inside Man or She Hate Me whenever you sit down for one of his movies. "
Shes Gotta Have It,NBA 2k16. Ugh 🙄
Shes Gotta Have It,"It's in association with BBC, so it's obviously going to be fucking amazing."
Shes Gotta Have It,Yes. But this version follows a story about a gay vegan bunny rabbit that identifies as a dog and all the hardships he comes across along the way. 
Shes Gotta Have It,No problem.
Shes Gotta Have It,"Except, they are a real life person. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"Except the flamboyant gay man who is focused on his sexual/romantic life exists and has every right to exist. Trying to say only the ""straight"" gay men should be depicted in media is trying to erase people you don't like to see in real life in media."
Shes Gotta Have It,">For once

Theres plenty of shows like that"
Shes Gotta Have It,Where? Nowhere in my post did I claim that you said anything at all.
Shes Gotta Have It,"and a ""what if!?!"" statement is?

""What if unicorns existed and this show was about them"" makes just as much sense"
Shes Gotta Have It,"Sorry, I wasn't saying you spit vitriol - just a lot of redditors. 

And I hear you, he's inconsistent, just like a lot of prolific filmmakers. However, the good far outweigh the bad and his influence is hard to deny."
Shes Gotta Have It,Nvm Spike directed that one. Haven't played it...that bad?
Shes Gotta Have It,This is wonderful news.
Shes Gotta Have It,Watered down shit more like
Shes Gotta Have It,Thanks for replying to a comment I made a month ago with this bullshit.
Shes Gotta Have It,"I'm sure, and the trailer could have gone about introducing them in an infinite number of ways. Since I don't know who this person is, I'm looking to the trailer to tell me who this character is. And the trailer showed me that the person is primarily defined as a ""polyamorous pansexual whatever,"" that *that* is the sum of their identity, and nothing more."
Shes Gotta Have It,"No one's saying they shouldn't exist. It just seems like that's all that exists. The token gay characters on TV shows tend to always be the flamboyant capital G gay.

Something isn't really normalized until it doesn't become a ""thing."" As an obvious example, someone being in a monogamous straight relationship isn't a defining characteristic of most TV characters. Because it's normalized."
Shes Gotta Have It,So you don't have an argument and you're just here to pester or what?
Shes Gotta Have It,He's just asking a question. The fuck is your problem? Don't join the conversation if you don't want
Shes Gotta Have It,Maybe they do exist but you just assume they're straight?
Shes Gotta Have It,"Well, I don't have the stats on the degrees of gayness of gay characters. But in real life, most gay dudes tend to be more ""feminine"" than ""masculine."" There was a survey done on the occupations of gay men, and the majority of them did female-dominated jobs, like flight attendants and hairdressers. So it's an accurate depiction of reality."
Shes Gotta Have It,"The original statement wasn't an argument, either."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Nah, tv writers really just like to club you over the head with their gay characters so they can get brownie points. In all seriousness though some shows do it well where they have characters who are also gay and some shows do it poorly where they simply have gay characters who have no other aspects to them. It makes for flat characters and shit writing."
Shes Gotta Have It,"Again, what are you doing here?"
Shes Gotta Have It,"But seriously if their sexuality doesn't come up at all, how do you know? It's like that Dumbledore guy. "
Shes Gotta Have It,I'm not saying it can't or shouldn't come up just that it should be a normal thing rather having the audience's noses rubbed in it. You can write a complex multi dimensional character that is gay but if you write a character whose only purpose and defining characteristic is being gay then that's just shitty writing.
Shes Gotta Have It,"Binged it all in a day. It reminds me of Insecure but more serious. 
Pretty good series in general but can be a bit pretentious especially with the forced film/arts references at times."
Shes Gotta Have It,I really liked the style and I though it was enjoyable and an easy watch. I’m definitely gonna like this one. 
Shes Gotta Have It,"Am I the only one who thought this was horribly bad and cringey?

Nola has no realism to her. She appears to be nothing more than a caricature of the ""strong independent black woman"" trope and further, a mouthpiece for a writer perhaps. When she's talking to the camera, I don't believe one word she says. Her lines are like they were written by somebody who just finished a few classes in Gender Studies. It's just so canned and ...artificial. Lots of buzz words used in odd contexts with very little substance behind it. I don't get it. 

Her guys are not much better with the exception of Mars, who is the most genuine in my eyes. Jamie Overstreet is a coward of a man, not to mention a horrible father and husband and I'm supposed to believe that Greer Childs is a real person? He's laughably cheesy and of course, unbearably narcissistic. 

And what's with all of them making love to the camera? I get that they're supposed to be ""unapologetic"" about their sexual energies or whatever, but it was a little over the top with all that sultry, breathy talk during the 4th wall breaking.

The show also goes SO EASY on Nola. These guys are just so ready to put up with her shit and it's not believable at all. If my lover tricked me into an awkward thanksgiving dinner with his other lovers, I would immediately feel insulted and walk out. these guys  instead are STILL FIGHTING OVER HER?  The show punishes everyone but her for their actions. Not to mention, SHE DOESN'T EVEN GROW AS A CHARACTER. 

Nola starts as a strong black independent woman who is unapologetic about her sexuality, art, and sexual partners and she ends as a strong black independent woman who is unapologetic about her sexuality, art and sexual partners. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. What were we supposed to learn on this journey?

I really liked the gentrification subplot and some of the commentary about race relations but it all seems to not really connect with any of the main part of the plot. 

This is SO, so bad, yet it has great reviews and I'm pulling my hair trying to see how people don't see what I see. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"This has been getting great reviews! I've been loving the emergence of high quality black centric television. 

Atlanta, Insecure, Dear White People have all been great. Started Queen Sugar (been pretty good so far). Add in Master's of None because that's a special show as well"
Shes Gotta Have It,That musical act in ep 2 was so good.
Shes Gotta Have It,"Watching the first episode, it's kind of hilarious if you are in the right mood. That scene where they introduce Greer had me rofl-ing. I like the main character, she's a refreshing contrast to the typical twee awkward hipster-girl in the city trope. But I think the show will rub a lot of viewers the wrong way because they'll take it too seriously just because there's no laugh-track.
"
Shes Gotta Have It,"Watched the first episode of my commute this morning and enjoyed it quite a bit. Funny, smart, the composition of shots and cinematography were gorgeous for a comedy show, like almost Master Of None level gorgeous as far as comedies go. I think I'm going to enjoy this one quite a bit"
Shes Gotta Have It,This seemed like pretentious trash to me. The fact that in episode one this Spike Lee character launches into a monologue about how the film Malcolm X (Directed by Spike Lee) didn’t get the recognition it deserved is to say the least just weak. Each character mugs into the camera and is seemingly perfectly self aware while they couldn’t really have any less of a clue what is going on. Overall it just seems like a tone deaf reboot of story no one needed to hear.
Shes Gotta Have It,"Saw it, I thought it was okay. The cinematography and the music was fantastic. Nola needed to either be better written or better acted, because I hated her character. She was a selfish irresponsible asshole who toyed around with everyone's feelings and was arrogant about it. Super unlikable."
Shes Gotta Have It,"The style is really cool and fresh but the ""lessons"" that Nola force feeds you and her friends became pretty cringe worthy fast.  "
Shes Gotta Have It,Watching right now...I'm so amused! 
Shes Gotta Have It,You're not brave and manly for dealing with this type of woman. You're just crazy. She's insufferable. 
Shes Gotta Have It,I'm liking the vibe and cinematography. The album covers of the songs used does get annoying after the first couple of episodes 
Shes Gotta Have It,"I wonder if this show is supposed to empower me as a woman? After watching it I am rather questioning my feminism than feeling good about it. But maybe that's the whole point. Maybe it's supposed to challenge you. Then I ask if a male director is the right person to challenge feminism? 

Whatever, I kinda liked Nola in the beginning, my liking became less and less and when she was late to her first art class, I was literally yelling ""Are you serious"" at my tv. Being late is one thing, but being late with this ""Who cares? I'm Nola Darling, I'm a strong independent black woman."" attitude was the first time my sympathy hit rock bottom. 

Then her art. Ugh. Sure, the paintings are skilled in brushstroke and realism. But her art says nothing. It's just near-photo realistic. She doesn't tell me anything about what she or her pain or her drive is about. And when Greer asks her for her perspective, she gets offended and asks for the check right away. She refuses to be challenged when this is the very concept of art: Creating something to start a discourse. If you don't wanna deal with it, then you're just a painter and no artist. Sorry. 

And her taking responsibility. Somebody wrote earlier, that she takes so much from her fellow human beings, yet gives so little. In this regard she reminded me of Carrie Bradshaw in later seasons when SATC went downhill. She confuses being unapologetic with being a selfish brat. Your own freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Being unapologetic and self sufficient doesn't mean to trample on your friends and partners. And she always explains it by being a feminist. Yes, I understand that feminism is about making male norms acceptable for women, too (and vice versa). But a lot of the shit she did is not acceptable for any person. Not everything any men does is generally accepted. The story missed the mark here and did a disservice to feminism. 

I really liked the gentrification subplot and got interested in Shamekka near the end. I would have loved to hear more about her story and about the accident aftermath. Also it was briefly hinted twice that Clorinda has her own Sugar Daddy. I would like to know more about that. 

Overall I watched it til the end even though I see so many flaws. "
Shes Gotta Have It,Did anyone catch him talking about his own movie lol. The Malcom X segment was sort of meta if you think about it 
Shes Gotta Have It,"I just finished the first ep. I like how she is unapologetically sexual. Some people still seem to think that in this day and age, sex is a 'man's thing' or that the woman's pleasure doesn't matter. 

I like Mars. He's funny. The other two guys are annoying. The biracial guy is so up himself to the point where he makes me want to vomit. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"I watched a couple of episodes and I think it's pretty alright, but the show feels like it's straight out of 1995.  "
Shes Gotta Have It,"10/10 like her. Her character is as relatable as it can be for a woman these days. It's detailed and structured. Subtle but direct, and yet genius! 

I think she's not a caricature. She surpasses that idea of the strong independent black woman, with her passion, impulsiveness, and optimism of the future. A lot of that, composing, an in-depth lively character that also goes beyond race. "
Shes Gotta Have It,"Just finished episode 4 (Opal), which really highlights what annoys me about Nola. She's all about being a strong independent woman who doesn't need anyone and finds her worth from herself. This is great in theory, but like people...need...other people. That's kind of how humans work. And Nola disregards other people all the time because she's so caught up in herself. "
Shes Gotta Have It,Uuuuugggghhh this show stresses me out. I don't deal with ppl like Nola very well. Also there are like weird shots every now and then that are random and make you feel uneasy? Like at the art show the random lady that comes up to Nola to praise her art and hugs her. I haven't finished it yet so I don't know if it holds any significance later. My husband is interested in Shemekka's story. I can empathize with her waaaay more than I do with Nola. Welp. Here's to the last few eps left. Oh boy.
Shes Gotta Have It,I know Spike Leee gon kill me but lemme finish 🎶
Shes Gotta Have It,Brilliant reboot
Shes Gotta Have It,I was thinking the same. I think this is because she mentions the films full title and directors name in casual conversations which normal cinephiles don't do. It would come off a little less pretentious if she simply said the title
Shot in the Dark,"I binged it all, thought it was pretty interesting. I feel bad for the RMG guys (Marc/Howard/Austin). Scott seems like quite a dick and I'm not sure what to think about Zak. 

Hopefully additional seasons happen, probably doesn't take long to make a season or cost much to produce."
Shot in the Dark,Zak from On scene scares me. He seems a tad socio/psychopathic. 
Shot in the Dark,"Curious as the what the get for each ""hit"". Guessing around 500 but could a lot more or a lot less."
Shot in the Dark,nightcrawler was crazy 
Shot in the Dark,"Part Cops/Nightwatch, part competition, part real-life news, and very bingeable.
Came out on Friday, 8 episodes.
Plot: ""Three rival freelance stringers scour the streets at night to film crime scenes, fires, accidents -- and anything else they can sell to news outlets.""
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDG93YC8-HQ"
Shot in the Dark,"Watching it now!  Definitely a far cry from Nightcrawler, but it is the first show of its kind that has really pulled me in. It has solid story telling, great suspense, and it's surprisingly well shot for the pace the characters are moving.  I did not expect to be this emotionally invested in a few stringers.  Solid 8/10"
Shot in the Dark,This seems to totally miss the point that Nightcrawler was making regarding the media...
Shot in the Dark,What cars do they drive? They are pretty tricked out
Shot in the Dark,When do they get to fuck Rene Russo ?
Shot in the Dark,Agreed. 
Shot in the Dark,He's like the protagonist from Nightcrawler IRL
Shot in the Dark,"I love this scene where they make his eyes look un-human. Like a bug's eyes
https://imgur.com/a/5kK8C"
Shot in the Dark,"(Spoiler alert)
Does anyone else have serious issues with the first episode where the dude was filming a car that stalled on the highway? While he was filming from  safe distance the car's lights went dark. I work in video production (nothing like that though) and my first though was why isn't he shining the brightest lights he has on the car? "
Shot in the Dark,"But this isn't Nightcrawler the TV show, it's a more authentic look into the real profession. These guys actually have professionalism and integrity and it does show there isn't some big moral conflict they deal with. It's a video job like any other except it involves crimes and accidents."
Shot in the Dark,Doesn't seem to me that they're trying to make that point. It's well filmed and exciting but I think they've the left audience to decide if the profession is right or wrong.
Shot in the Dark,Zak drives a Crown Vic and Scott drives a Dodge Charger. Forgot which one Howard drives. Austin drives a Ford Explorer. 
Shot in the Dark,[deleted]
Shot in the Dark,"I doubt he has lights other than the wide angle soft light on the camera. At that distance it wouldn’t light up the car, but if he had a flashlight that would have helped. "
Shot in the Dark,"I know, which is the problem with this headline. Nightcrawler was a critique of a blood thirsty media; this is a glorification of it."
Shot in the Dark,Yes just watched that! I wish they had addressed this in episode one!
Shot in the Dark,"I disagree. It focuses on the people doing the job and the excitement that naturally comes with it. It does somewhat romanticise the profession but I still think it doesn't make a statement on the rights or wrongs of it.

That's for another documentary I would imagine. 40 local news stations vying for morbid footage to attract viewers to the morning news.


"
Shot in the Dark,Good Show basically real life Nightcrawler
Shot in the Dark,Show's been out for like a month.
Shot in the Dark,"I watched the whole season, it is really good. It follows three different ""Stringer"" companies around LA. Stringers are free lance cameramen who film news stories. There are a number of stringers shown but the show focuses on three in particular.  Those three are pretty charismatic and it is wild life they live. They sit in their cars listening to 911 calls and then race each other to film the events. There are a few ""conflicts"" between the three of them that are clearly staged but over all it is a really good piece of reality TV.

I wonder how successful stringers are outside of L.A? LA is perfect for this sort of work because of its urban sprawl, geography, arid climate and huge number of interconnected cities. There are 150 cities that make up LA. "
Shot in the Dark,"I enjoyed the shit out of this show, but anyone thinking of watching it should know that it's more cable reality show than it is Netflix docuseries. It's a little exploitative and maddening in certain aspects (like it makes prolific use of cliffhangers and it's clearly edited to serve the narrative) but as far as reality shows go, it's one of the better ones and I definitely want to see more."
Shot in the Dark,Extremely well shot and put together. Loved it.
Shot in the Dark,Watched the series and it makes me wonder why none of these guys have used drones yet.  
Shot in the Dark,"> watching it should know that it's more cable reality show than it is Netflix docuseries.

Absolutely!"
Shot in the Dark,"> The problems were myriad from the start. **After Mark Patch (a veteran visual-effects technician with a long list of credits including Tenet, 2016’s Ghostbusters, and Starz’s American Gods) was offered a short-term position working on VFX for a Marvel series on Disney+, he says the studio balked at paying him his going rate — demanding to first see a pay stub from his work on Tenet proving his market value, then undershooting Patch’s quote by several hundred dollars a week**. Then came the nondisclosure instructions he says were issued by Marvel’s VFX and postproduction president Victoria Alonso and staff VFX producer Jen Underdahl in a telephone meeting, requiring that Patch keep his employment at the company a secret and avoid any social-media posts that might indicate he was affiliated with a Marvel Cinematic Universe project. “I was like, ‘Okay, I can’t even tell my family where I am?’” he recalls. “What is this — the Manhattan Project?!”

> Then there was the job itself. **While an average feature-length superhero or sci-fi movie might have 1,600 visual effects, he says this ten-hour show** (which he cannot specifically name per a nondisclosure agreement he signed) **would require around 3,000 VFX shots to be completed on a much shorter timeline. Nonetheless, feature-quality work was expected**, which could include anything from replacing actors’ faces to rendering entire CG sequences from scratch. **Confronted with the prospect of what he was told would be 18-hour days, seven days a week, for three months straight, Patch walked away from the contract. “They said, ‘Okay, well, do you want a job on our next show?’ And I said, ‘No.’”** (Marvel Studios declined to comment on Patch’s story and declined to make Alonso and Underdahl available to speak.)

> **Talk to any VFX artist or tech working in modern Hollywood and certain complaints come up over and over: the punishing deadlines, grueling work hours, too few workers charged with too much work, underpayment and systematic “pixel-fucking” — an industry phrase used to describe the behavior of nitpicking clients who lack the VFX knowledge to communicate their needs.** Ben Speight, an organizer at the Animation Guild and the VFX-IATSE, a rapidly growing wing of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (of which Patch is a member) that first formed in 2012, says the industry has grown “exponentially” since the late ’90s and early 2000s, when it consisted of several hundred visual-effects workers. According to the effects and gaming directory site Studio Hog, there are now 582 visual-effects houses worldwide and somewhere between 31,000 and 117,000 workers plying their trade at any given time. **VFX industry watchdogs estimate that across TV and film, there is currently about three times the amount of work as there are visual-effects professionals to execute it.**"
Shot in the Dark,VFX artists absolutely need to be unionized. The rest of the film industry has strong unions and they need to be included 100%
Shot in the Dark,"Good. These artists deserve a union who will, frankly, hold incessant release schedule to ransom to get them acceptable working conditions. Feige et al are obsessed with the progression and growth and don’t give a shit how they get there as long as something else gets set up on the way."
Shot in the Dark,"""Animation is expensive, time consuming and needs specialized skills"", said the Animator. 

""Aaaaaaarrrrgh"", screamed the Hollywood exec, ""how dare you confront me with reality, I've spent years developing a drug habit to avoid that!"""
Shot in the Dark,"Disney shows are looking like shit these days, because they are asking too much of VFX artists in a short amount of time. 

The quality is seriously all over the place. Sometimes it looks great, other times it looks like Black Widow (oh man that movie's VFX were awful, maybe the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie). If I were a VFX artist, I'd walk away too. Disney needs to treat these people better, pay them better, and give them more time. When Disney gets into crank-a-bunch-of-projects-out mode the final product usually looks awful."
Shot in the Dark,"With the current boom-era going with Television and the focus in both movie and film on VFX, how is it that VFX houses are not able to receive a premium for their work simply based on negotiation? I don’t see how a Marvel or Disney production could be effectively made right now without VFX so why aren’t VFX folks more in command of their pay? Generally this is the effect of a market so something else has to be missing."
Shot in the Dark,"Since Fiege is the head of Marvel, this is his fault. They should be able to afford to pay these people what they are due.

*my bad Fiege This appears to be Victoria Alonso's fault, but you are also somewhat responsible."
Shot in the Dark,"Well that sucks. I formerly worked in that industry (I do similar work in games,  now). They’ve been trying to form that union for a while now (it was being discussed in 2009/10 at the latest). 

“Back in my day,” there were similar issues, but that level of abuse was only associated with specific studios.  You learned to avoid them (some of them were run by absolute scum). But none were as big as Marvel, and there were other options. 

Gotta say, I was in the Animation Guild for a bit, and they had absolutely no teeth. Hope the VFX version does a little better!"
Shot in the Dark,"I want to add that I hope, along with artists, that VFX Production Coordinators and Managers get allowed into a union as well just like some on set production positions are.

I’ve worked as a VFX coord close to six years now for a lot of shows, and we pull just as much hours if not more as artists, as we usually have to stay even later to deliver for clients if we work vendor side OR we’re pulling stupid hours awaiting those deliveries at night or waking up at the crack of Dawn to set up reviews the next days for dailies in the AM. This is especially brutal during pilots. And we don’t get paid nearly as much as artists do.

We’re suffering from this nonsense too. Please don’t forget about us."
Shot in the Dark,Maybe they will let the Catering Dept unionize next. As it stands only one of usually 5 team members are allowed to be teamsters. They force the other 4 to work 14-18 hour shifts with under 8 hours of turn around.
Shot in the Dark,"It seems to me that one repeating issue with these stories is the nature of the contract between the movie company and the VFX company - fixed price with a seemly unlimited scope for changes.

The idea of being able to do this with any other form of work seems unreal.  Imagine you're watching a house being built and the client goes to the building company with a list of alterations.  The builder isn't going to do that stuff for free.  Without incentives and disincentives to planning their work properly, the movie studios will keep abusing VFX houses."
Shot in the Dark,"I used to dismiss vfx work as simple stuff till I stumbled upon the corridor crew channel. Gave me real insight of how much work goes in. 

Big companies don't respect workers and its why unions are important"
Shot in the Dark,"It's past time for VFX artists to unionize, studios have treated them like slaves for years now (remember what happened with *Life of Pi*?), demanding top notch work to for peanuts and faster than possible. Modern blockbusters would straight up die without VFX yet their job is terribly undervalued."
Shot in the Dark,"I wonder if they could negotiate to join SAG-AFTRA.  This seems like a pretty easy marriage, you have creatives being put over the barrel by studios the same way actors have previously been abused.  SAG-AFTRA has dealt with this from production crew up to writers, they negotiate with the same people.  Etc"
Shot in the Dark,"Curious: why are these companies allowed to treat the artists so poorly?  Is there a glut of them and so if they don't like the working conditions they can be easily replaced?  I didn't think that was the case.

Is it just that too many artists have allowed themselves to be walked over for too long, making exploitation the norm similar to how you sometimes see in the IT industry with people expected to be on call 24/7/365?"
Shot in the Dark,"It's about time someone in the VFX biz told Marvel Studios to fuck off. Whatever you think about their movies, the demands they place on vendors are unreasonable."
Shot in the Dark,Sounds like Armor Wars.
Shot in the Dark,"As a Marvel fan for 35 years, I absolutely endorse better pay and conditions for the people that bring me the content I enjoy.

I'd much rather there be no more MCU than there be these shitty conditions Disney keeps imposing on their employees/contractors."
Shot in the Dark,Im sorry but blame ring of power all you want but the vfx were flawless. And that's because anazon hired enough studio to get it done. Disney is scaling the size of projects but not the amount of studio working on it.
Shot in the Dark,Good. The VFX people have too much on their plate. I may enjoy marvel movies but I don't want people behind the scenes getting overworked for this.
Shot in the Dark,"Marvel Studios is that hot girl in high school that everyone wants to fuck but in reality she's very shallow, will cost you a ton of time and money and there are probably more rewarding things to do than be with her."
Shot in the Dark,I work in film. There's gonna be Patch patches worn on sets soon. We're rather droll so it'll probably just be a black patch that says Mark Patch in white block letters. Maybe even just Patch. The producers will pretend they can't see them.
Shot in the Dark,"This is the problem in both tv/movies and game development; the time frames have shrunk insanely, along with the budgets, because ""time is money""  and they have to keep pumping out new material to sell every year."
Shot in the Dark,"So, that Marvel show has to have been She-Hulk right? For half the runtime it had (at least) one full CG character and you could tell that the VFX artists didn't have the time to make it look good in a lot of the shots."
Shot in the Dark,How haven't the VFX artists not go on strike by now? These working conditions are ludicrous.
Shot in the Dark,">“With the right strategy led by VFX workers themselves,” says Speight, “in the next year, there could be an opportunity for a group to move forward, be successful, and establish their first union.”

Shot in the Dark,"We want more, but will pay you less…."
Shot in the Dark,"I’ll believe it when it happens. Over covid Artists and TD’s had ALL the power. And despite a ton of talk nothing happened. Hell in some places they straight up CAN’T unionise because certain companies playing politics rather than paying fairly. (Search up the hobbit laws for a wide ride)

Fuck you Warner cunts."
Shot in the Dark,"that is what greed does to you. 

i recently saw a documentary kingdom of dreams. and they use creative people to booster their own money, no care for their health as long as they deliver on the deadlines, while these company owners made billions of dollars. it is a disgusting world. same for VFX guys. they love their work so much, they shorten their lives because of it and the people in power know it. so they profit from them."
Shot in the Dark,They will just outsource even more than they already do.
Shot in the Dark,this is not new and it is happening on all  visual tech industry for decades
Shot in the Dark,"Curious to see the struggles of VFX artists and how similar they are to IT developers, and IT personnel in general. It seems that there is a generalised lack of respect for people who work with computers, from both management and customers."
Shot in the Dark,They need it done in 2 weeks so they can shelve it for 3 years. Hurry up!
Shot in the Dark,"Yea... disney ruining Stan Lee's company reputation..

Shot in the Dark,Fuck Marvel. White trash company.
Shot in the Dark,It’s almost like Disney is a terrible company. Who would have thought that.
Shot in the Dark,"Oh man what are they doing.

It honestly seems like they are cashing Marvel out at this point which I didn't think was going to happen under Fiege"

Shot in the Dark,"Unions are great, yes to unions, but in this case didn't the free market do its job? The potential employer was shitty, the potential employee refused the work. Happens all the time in every industry."
Shot in the Dark,"Dude offered job, it’s too much for him, dude says no. Big deal?"
Shot in the Dark,"What is this ludicrous parody illustration accompanying the article that describes nothing about visual effects. Also I’m suspicious of people saying de-aging on a marvel film has more clout than in a Scorsese film. Everyone knows marvel is cheesy AF. If this is real, then it just emphasizes that the industry needs to rid itself of the fanboy mentality.

Edit: too many fanboys in the thread downvoting who evidently have no industry experience. I say this to the workers on current marvel films: How the fuck did you get to the point where you think there is prestige doing Victoria Alonzo’s bidding. Grow the fuck up and tell them to go fuck themselves."
Shot in the Dark,Greenmans savin u right now bro
Shot in the Dark,"Not that I don’t want VFX artists to be treated fairly, but the moment they unionize all of their jobs will be outsourced overseas for much less money than they are currently makingZ

Edit:  why are people downvoting this? I’m not saying I want that to happen. I’m saying it *will* happen. VFX jobs are already being outsourced. It’ll just get worse with unionization."
Shot in the Dark,this sound similar to the peewee herman netflix movie.
Shot in the Dark,"Much like animation, there will always be humans willing to do it for less"
Shot in the Dark,Good luck. This is exactly what Information Tech when through when overheating in the early 2000’s. Studio response?…replace them with smart mexicans from india. Same thing will happen here.
Shot in the Dark,"I'm tired of seeing VFX people being burned out of the industry, or firms collapsing despite getting paid because they're not getting paid enough to deal with the OT.

Marvel and Disney in general fucking suck for this from what I've been hearing. they'll film some actors in a greenscreen, then demand to do and redo and redo things until they figure out what angle they wanted, or in some cases, have alternate scenes like they are completely ass-unable to storyboard BEFORE filming their movies so it's a Choose Your Own Adventure basically until enough coked up executives agree it'll get max return on investment"
Shot in the Dark,As someone who works in VFX this all sounds super accurate. And it’s actually frame fucking… usually it doesn’t get down to the pixel.
Shot in the Dark,"18 hours a day, 7 days a week, it’s amazing he didn’t want to take that enticing deal."
Shot in the Dark,"> requiring that Patch keep his employment at the company a secret and avoid any social-media posts that might indicate he was affiliated with a Marvel Cinematic Universe project. “I was like, ‘Okay, I can’t even tell my family where I am?’” he recalls. “What is this — the Manhattan Project?!”

Signing away your rights to talk to your family just to work on some dumbass Marvel superhero show called The Paper Cutter and it's about a guy who can use paper to cut people as a superpower."
Shot in the Dark,"The studios are just going to keep doing it until all the effects houses are unionized, or at least a significant majority of them. And they can't go overseas with this stuff, the studios want immediate back-and-forth, and video chat doesn't cut it for that."
Shot in the Dark,"If a prospective client ever asked to see pay stubs from a previous client to prove my rate to them, that would be an immediate dismissal of ever working with that client again. Absurdity."
Shot in the Dark,"VFX is definitely slammed, so not surprising. Post administration is also trying to unionize nationally. 

Capitalists just take everything they can, and then some. Only way to combat the entrenched wealthy is to organize."
Shot in the Dark,"If there is 3x the work as there are people to *do* the work, you'd think these people were rolling in money, not getting fucked harder than ever."
Shot in the Dark,"I work in graphic design, not VFX, but I’m going to be using “pixel fucking.”"
Shot in the Dark,">feature-length superhero or sci-fi movie might have 1,600 visual effects, he says this ten-hour show (which he cannot specifically name per a nondisclosure agreement he signed) would require around 3,000 VFX shots to be completed on a much shorter timeline. Nonetheless, feature-quality work was expected,

If 1600 is normal for a 2-3 hour movie.

Then what's wrong with 3000 for basically a 10 hour movie?"

I’d like to see him get credit for coming up with the phrase."

Shot in the Dark,[I just watched a great YouTube video about this yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALwDyS7rB0)
Shot in the Dark,I saw an article yesterday that said Marvel pays 20% below the industry standard for VFX
Shot in the Dark,Aren't these guys highly skilled and sought after specialists? Why are they accepting shit jobs?
Shot in the Dark,"We’ve heard of VFX artists being exploited for a long time now. I’m surprised they haven’t managed to set and enforce their most important demands for working conditions and pay. 

I imagine if a significant portion of artists refuse to work for what a studio is offering, then what is the studio gonna do? Getting worse artists isn’t a great idea because the audience doesn’t react kindly to bad/cheap visuals. Paying some non-unionized artists would probably be very expensive because they could choose other projects to work on. 

I realize that when working in that field, by yourself you’re just one guy and don’t have any power. But collectively they would have a lot of leverage"
Shot in the Dark,"I’m 90 percent anti union having managed one at one point and even I’m pro union in this situation. 7 days, 16-18 hrs? , impossible deadline, unfair pay - that’s idiotic for an employer to demand and they should be punished as such. The vfx workers largest obstacle is that there is 3x more work than workers which means Disney can be like “whatever, we’ll find a mofo that will do it”  which there always is. But the customer gets an ass product in the end."
Shot in the Dark,"> Disney shows are looking like shit these days

the biggest problem is that it all looks and feels the same, there is no difference if I watch Dr. Strange MoM or Hawkeye"
Shot in the Dark,"Honestly: there was nothing wrong with Black Widow's VFX. There are shots which could be better, but they're all perfectly serviceable. VFX doesn't necessarily make or break most films *provided the audience is invested in the film*.

Black Widow's problem is the story the VFX tells makes no fucking sense at all. It's like someone got a brief for ""animate these Marvel superhero movie scenes"" and then was later told ""drop in this Scarlett Johansson 3D scan and send me the renders"".

The best VFX in the world won't make *Black Widow*'s effects look *good*, because narratively it all reads as nonsense based on what we know about the character and her capabilities."
Shot in the Dark,"I loved the writing and acting on She Hulk, but the CGI was so distracting. I was kinda wishing the whole time that they had just painted Tatiana Maslany green and put her on a stool. :P"
Shot in the Dark,"> other times it looks like Black Widow (oh man that movie's VFX were awful, maybe the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie). 

You haven’t seen Ghost Rider, have you?"
Shot in the Dark,The same has been happening to Disney animators for decades. The Mouse is a cruel taskmaster.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"There's also one for Puss in Boots and one for Buddy Thunderstruck, so that one isn't the first, but yeah, it's pretty neat. And they're supposedly planning to do some kind of choose-your-own-adventure thing that's specifically aimed at adults at some point in the future."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,My son started watching this today actually. Was pretty interesting
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"It's pretty fun, and unlike the previous ones, this one has multiple endings. The one thing I didn't like is that it takes place after season one, so you have to watch the first season before playing it. "
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"I was wondering about that, since it referred to stuff happening before"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"conan loves this guy, whenever hes on his show, u can tell he enjoys hearing him with a genuine laugh "
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"I love when comedians smell blood in the water and push it. His voice gets louder ""but no! She stood on..""

I need to get back into the bill burr podcast"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Apparently this is the clip that made lance reach out to Bill and become friends 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Bill burr's ""he rapes but he saves"""
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"What is ""midgets who wanted to bang their mailman's boyfriend"" referencing? "
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I feel like there are few comedians that can make Conan genuinely laugh this hard. I love re-watching this clip. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,[removed]
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,His rants are golden. I watch every special of his sober on Netflix and laugh out loud throughout all of them. He's too 5 in the game right now IMO. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Haha old billy redbush 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Some of Bill's best bits came while he was sitting in that chair.

Like talking about [Paula Deen](https://youtu.be/WbXDpKbhg2s)

Or [teaching Elijah Wood how to arm himself](https://youtu.be/1xEchEbGUI8)"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Seems like yesterday I'd listen to Bill when he  would stop by old Opie And Anthony and do that for 3 hrs.  One of the very best story tellers  alive. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,[deleted]
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,The guy is a fucking comedic genius.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I'm really looking forward to the next season of F is for Family. Bill Burr is my spirit animal. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Whats this midget-Oprah situation Bill is talking about? I don't live in the USA so Ive never seen the Oprah W show
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,There has to be a Karl Pilkington Bill Burr special before they die. They are too brutally honest and hilarious to not link up for something special. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Burr I'd amazing. I'm not really into podcasts, but on occasion his YouTube account will upload a new piece and I have to listen. Some are good, some are dry, but they're all at least entertaining. "

Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"I love Bill. We've got the exact same sense of humor, and he's taught me a lot about my temper these last few months. Honestly I look forward to those podcasts more than anything at the moment. So glad my friend shared the red rocket with me!"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"this is what separates jimmy fallon and other hosts, fake and real laughs"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Thank you I needed that!!
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Funny line after funny line. Hilarious. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Bill (I think along with Louis & a few others, iirc) is a comedian that stills practices the discipline of the Old Way: touring the country/world with more time spent on the road doing stand up than being home in a year, & more importantly, throwing out all material at the end of said year to build a new set fresh from scratch.

That's insane, especially when you look at comics like Russel Peters or Jeff Dunham or dare I say Amy Schumer who have rode their own coat tails on the same tired schtick for years now.

Having good jokes is only part of it when you're performing for a different city on a different day of the week every night - it takes an immense amount of natural born humor & audience awareness to be dynamic enough to make the shit you've had written land the same in Dallas as it would Austin, for instance.

It goes without saying you're gonna have off-nights through this approach, but you can rest assured you will never be crowned king if you refuse to stretch & grow & challenge yourself in this way. Jokes become old in the re-telling, but gold is finding new ways to say the same truths."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill dropping wisdom 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"This is one of those ""upvote every time it's posted"" gems!"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"It's a combination of factors. One, once these guys get rich and famous and get TV show deals, they no longer have to grind out show after show on the road and they end testing a lot less material.  
Two, once you are rich and famous....the change in lifestyle changes their perspective and thus their comedy.  Sometimes this works for their audience, sometimes it doesn't."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"His helicopter story in one of his Netflix specials is one of the best stand up moments I've seen, I swear this dude is exactly how my mind thinks everyday."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"This introduced me to him, spent last hour watching some of his moments on youtube such good and reasonable opinions with a nice splash of humor in the mix, Bill Burr has earned a life long fan"

Shaaaaaame.....SHAAAAAAAAME!!!!!"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"good to see this clip back at the top of television. see ya next year, this clip! "

Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,It took me far too long to realise Bill Burr was on Breaking Bad
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,i haven't laughed this hard since I was a little girl 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,still can't compare with some of those legendary interviews with norm macdonald.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,That was pretty damn funny!
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I'm not even laughing at the joke anymore. Consuming laughing so hard is making me laugh!
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I wish I could view YouTube :( 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I missed his show at the Wells Fargo center a year or two ago and I'm STILL kicking myself in the ass for it.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,This man is a treasure
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,This small bit was better than the entirety of his last special. That is as a Bill Burr fan.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Damn he's relentless. His punchlines are steel toe kicks to the heart 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill Burr is too much fun. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Man, Bill Burr needs to publish more stand up."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,the monday morning podcast is sooo good with bill
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,My roided up guy beat your roided up guy!! 😂😂
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill Burr is hilarious mad man lol.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Love BB!
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,He is the funniest hard core conspiracy theorist
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Burr is a fucking pro.  Goddammit he knows how to hammer a joke home.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"I love Bill Burr, and to see him get Conan like that is priceless. Me undies, me undies, making Conan laugh..."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,He was hilarious on the bill Simmons podcast two weeks ago
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,These 2 give me faith that gingers do have souls
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,. Bill .
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"He makes some solid points. Made me think, the bastard."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Bill is always awesome on Conan.....my favorite is ""Bill Burr teaches Elijah Wood how to kill"""
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,What was the story about Oprah?
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,If you really want to see Conan laugh check out Richard Lewis telling him about Shaq's penis. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Not to be rude but Bill Burr looks a little bit older than I remember.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I've watched this 100 times but now watching Conan's reaction to him makes it even funnier now.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Holy crap I want to have dinner and drinks with Bill Burr. He's fucking hilarious. I feel like I'd have sore muscles the next day just from laughing at the conversation with him.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Conan wasn't really laughing that hard.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Favorite comedian 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Can someone give a bit of context here? This seems funny but I don't understand what he's talking about
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,I feel like this is a good time to ask what other comedians can I binge watch that are as funny as bill burr or Tom segura or Kyle kinane
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"I am not a fan of Lance, and I knew I could count on Bill Burr to bring up the brigt side of that mess.  ""Imagine if that guy ran a corporation."" ""Keep him on the bike."" So witty and so good."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,He's the best thing that ever happened to comedy. 
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"even though he's getting a good laugh, he is still bringing up some good points about lance and the bikers."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill Burr and Tim Olyphant. Two guests I will always watch on Conan
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"
Mm"
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Grin worthy
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Watching Conan laugh this much in Bill's interviews is how I got into Bill's comedy and he has been my favorite ever since.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill Burr is my favorite comedian. He just tells it as he thinks it is and either you laugh or you don't. I love the guy.
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,"Love Bill Burr, probably my favorite comedian alive. I laugh so hard I cry at every one of his specials."
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,The best is when Joe Rogan calls Lance Armstrong crazy on his [podcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEfSdPz1WtA&t=23m49s).
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,Bill Burr is my favorite comedian by far
Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters, Fucking love BB
Marvels The Punisher,I swear if the Hand turns out to be behind everything I'm gonna flip my shit. 
Marvels The Punisher,"Damn Jon Bernthal really nails the look (& sound) of pure rage; something not as heavily emphasized in the other portrayals of his character. Also, I kinda expect him to shout RICK from Walking Dead."
Marvels The Punisher,"that leg shot/head shot was beautiful, it felt very john wick, which the punisher should feel... maybe equal parts john wick and jason voorhees w/ guns"
Marvels The Punisher,Great use of Metallica's One.
Marvels The Punisher,"Netflix! 


Imprisoning me! 


All that I see! 



Everything Marvel! 



"
Marvels The Punisher,"Goddamnit, stop teasing me with that release date! "
Marvels The Punisher,"Looks dope. Hope it's going to be better than the show about the immortal Iron Fist, protector of Kun-Lun, sworn enemy of the Hand. "
Marvels The Punisher,"Omfg this looks amazing. Bernthal is such a badass. 

Btw. Micro looks a bit like the Immortal Iron Fist, protector of Kun Lun, sworn enemy of the Hand. 

Hope it actually has a metal soundtrack the way Iron Fist and Luke Cage had rap. "
Marvels The Punisher,"That shot of him just mowing down a pillar while screaming...

Gods they cast this so fucking perfectly."
Marvels The Punisher,coordinated gunshots to Lars Ulrich's drumming. brilliant
Marvels The Punisher,Give the person who made this trailer a raise.﻿
Marvels The Punisher,"One batch. Two batch. Penny and dime

I can't wait"
Marvels The Punisher,[deleted]
Marvels The Punisher,That was a great trailer. I hope the show is more Dare Devil/Jessica Jones than Luke Cage-y or the Immortal Iron Fist of Kuhn Lung.
Marvels The Punisher,Please let this be as metal as the fucking trailer. 
Marvels The Punisher,The hallway fight scene. BUT WITH GUNS.
Marvels The Punisher,*excellent* song choice - Metallica's One is perfect for Punisher
Marvels The Punisher,"I'm really hoping this curves the Netflix MCU out of its downward spiral. I have a good feeling seeing as how the Netflix shows do better when shit is less ""mystical"""
Marvels The Punisher,[deleted]
Marvels The Punisher,"I knew Netflix had money, but not Metallica licensing money. "
Marvels The Punisher,"Bernthal is great in the role and kicked ass in Daredevil, pretty much stole the show. I've been waiting for this to finally release.
People were scoffing at the idea of Bernthal playing Castle but he owns it."
Marvels The Punisher,"Metallica, guys walking slowly away from explosions, badass one-liners.  I'm so fucking in on this."
Marvels The Punisher,"This actually looks fantastic, solidifies my belief that this will be the best series in the MNU till date, topping even JJ S1 (Or DD S1, for those who like that better). 

A few thoughts on the trailer - 

• I like that they went with the proper full logo on his vest instead of some outline or something like that, he clearly seems to be embracing The Punisher persona so it makes sense he would do a massive ass, in the face logo (or whatever it should be called). 

• The shot of the city at the beginning of the trailer looked gorgeous. 

• No dark, bullshit, non-shots action shots, if you wanna show action then show it properly (And yes, I am referring to the bullshit we saw in Defenders). If your stunt choreography sucks then don't hide it by making people essentially watch black screens, just do it better. 

• CGI work still seems really mediocre, idk what's it with Netflix and not being able to afford good CGI. At least the way it's implemented in that little shot in the trailer doesn't highlight how bad the CGI is, and that makes it ok. 

• The little dialogues we got from Micro already seem to suggest that he was well cast and the series is well directed. 

• A lot of bright/daylight shots in general which is good cause u don't necessarily need to have a dark looking show to make a *dark* show. 

• Overall the trailer seemed really well put together. "
Marvels The Punisher,Ben Barnes! 
Marvels The Punisher,Yeah Metallica is probably okay with this.
Marvels The Punisher,So Shane came back as a zombie vigilante? 
Marvels The Punisher,"I'm a little surprised by this trailer.

I thought it would be gloomy."
Marvels The Punisher,Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle will always be the best casting choice of all time
Marvels The Punisher,[deleted]
Marvels The Punisher,"1. That shot of the guy walking in and killing the wife really got me for some reason. It affected me more than most jumpscares in movies lol.

2. I'm super pumped for this. I really liked Punisher in DD season 2 but the first trailer kinda bored me so I wasn't expecting much. Not anymore. I'm all in."
Marvels The Punisher,Jon Bernthals scream is terrifying. I would shit myself if I heard that coming towards me with a a rifle. 
Marvels The Punisher,"After watching ""tomb raider"" trailer , I was in need of some holy water for cleansing my eyes. Thank you Netflix , wonderful trailer."
Marvels The Punisher,"Actor fits.  Music works.  Action looks fantastic.  Another ""evil government"" thing though?  Frank, when I read the Punisher comics, was busy taking down the Mafia and Mafia bosses in particular, not government agencies.  Actually as I recall he had sort of a love/hate relationship with government in general."
Marvels The Punisher,We made this happen. How cool is that?
Marvels The Punisher,"I was a little worried that they might tone down the violence since it's a Netflix / Marvel series.  

I'm not worried anymore."
Marvels The Punisher,Loved the editing to the Metallica song! 
Marvels The Punisher,I thought in Daredevil that the punishers  wife died in the park? 
Marvels The Punisher,I really want to watch this when it premieres but I have no interest in Jessica Jones/Daredevil/Luke Cage/Iron Fist. Any chance it is more of a standalone or am I stuck watching the others?
Marvels The Punisher,This is how you trailer.
Marvels The Punisher,This trailer is already better than Iron Fist. Lol
Marvels The Punisher,From the creator of the Hannibal TV show. Love how you can see his visual style all over this trailer. Really excited.
Marvels The Punisher,"Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne!"
Marvels The Punisher,"That was pretty cool with Metallica. Love the old punisher, got my hopes on this guy. "
Marvels The Punisher,That trailer got me fucking PUMPED UP!  Adding Metallica as the soundtrack killed it.  When is the release date????
Marvels The Punisher,"Metallica, fuck yeah!"
Marvels The Punisher,They had me at One.
Marvels The Punisher,Metal.
Marvels The Punisher,Please don't be garbage. I swear Netflix. I'll lose all faith in you if you fuck this up
Marvels The Punisher,"If the episode where he loses his family isn't titled ""One Bad Day"" I'm going to be a little disappointed. "
Marvels The Punisher,"Goosebumps, man

I love how he can turn on a dime from this soft-spoken (but still scary) dude to a guttural, howling madman. The scene in DD2 where he's at the diner is one of the best examples of how he can turn it on and off like the flick of a switch, which really drives home how all of that rage is lurking just beneath the surface."
Marvels The Punisher,"hearing the Guitar starting to play ""One"" by metallica at the start was like "" OK SHIT ABOUT GET GOOD"" this trailer has hyped this up even more! i cant waiT"
Marvels The Punisher,John Bernthal was born for this role. Holy crap he’s so perfectly cast here.
Marvels The Punisher,I think I wet myself
Marvels The Punisher,Controversial opinion but not really: He was the best part of Daredevil Season 2 so fingers crossed.
Marvels The Punisher,I've gotta be honest. I'm really sick of seeing this dudes family get brutally murdered. Every new adaptation I'm like Christ I hope they don't light his baby on fire or something.
Marvels The Punisher,"This is single-handedly the best use of a Metallica song ever. Also, I love Netflix's way of not giving us a solid release date. "
Marvels The Punisher,Him blasting away at the pillar protecting that one dude was badass
Marvels The Punisher,"After all these years of being a Punisher fan, from the very beginning, will this finally be what my soul has always wanted?!"
Marvels The Punisher,Was that Karen Page?
Marvels The Punisher,brilliant use of one
Marvels The Punisher,this looks sick! love hearing some metallica in trailers! 
Marvels The Punisher,One batch. Two batch. Penny and dime.﻿
Marvels The Punisher,Why won't they say when it premieres?
Marvels The Punisher,Please don't Iron Fist this Netflix (phrasing?) Please do better. 
Marvels The Punisher,Van van van van van van van van van?
Marvels The Punisher,This series needs to be 1 step beyond excessive but 1 step below gratuitously violent.
Marvels The Punisher,"It sucks we're not going to get to see Cap and Punisher interact.

Their interactions were always so interesting whenever it happened in comics... albeit pretty rare."
Marvels The Punisher,"I love Micro's line after Frank says he's gonna kill all his enemies: ""Yeah I can live with that.""

No nonsense, no trying to change his stripes, which is a common enough trope nowadays.

I feel like thats Marvel essentially stating you're The Punisher and you're gonna kill em all cos thats what you **do.**"
Marvels The Punisher,"I love how his super power is: guns.

Not complaining. "
Marvels The Punisher,Metallica and puisher. I've not seen a better combination since bread and butter.
Marvels The Punisher,"After seeing Fisk in SO1 of DareDevil, i wanted a Rise of the Kingpin series. Fisk just a interesting character."
Marvels The Punisher,"Metallica and head scratches.

Sign me up."
Marvels The Punisher,"OMG that was amazing.  I tried submitting this:  
  
https://www.instagram.com/p/BZM1xcEH1qS/  
  
Punisher is coming for you.  Nice little short."
Marvels The Punisher,"Hell Yeah!! Opportunity for Netflix to make up for Fist and in my opinion even the Defenders. For the last two, never felt the need to rush to the next episode, never felt was on the edge of the seat, no emotional investment in the characters (despite having  loved them in the recent past),  cringeworthy damp dialogues. This may reset the score. Game on!"
Marvels The Punisher,"Hell fucking yeah.  Looks like they are doing the character justice.  Hate when they PG the violence for the screen, makes it feel nothing like the comics I loved as a kid.  I get that they are trying to appeal to a wider audience, but I hope the studios start doing more MA/R rated stuff for the characters like the Punisher.

Deadpool and Wolverine finally got it right.  Hopefully we get an R rated Batman some day.

"
Marvels The Punisher,"Finally, a Netflix Marvel show without a hip hip soundtrack. "
Marvels The Punisher,I...I think this might be my favorite trailer ever.
Marvels The Punisher,Oh God..  YES
Marvels The Punisher,Fuuuuuuck me that was awesome. Blank 2017 can't come fast enough!
Marvels The Punisher,M'ask ya sump'n Rick
Marvels The Punisher,"This gives me so much hope for a Netflix series of Dredd. I'd be tempted to get a netflix sub just on this, but if they add Dredd I'm sold.

I was always a fan of the non-super super""heroes"". But even more so than Batman-Ironman super suits. The Punisher is just a guy, an extremely well trained and driven guy, but just a guy. No super powers, no super technology (besides what he steals from others)."
Marvels The Punisher,Really liked how well Thomas Jane did the role in The Punisher (2004) but I believe  Jon Bernthal might perform even better since he nails the ice cold look.
Marvels The Punisher,Well that was brutal (which is just what I expect from the Punisher) so I'll definitely be watching!
Marvels The Punisher,What a perfect music choice for this trailer. 
Marvels The Punisher,"He was the best part of Season 2 of Daredevil, consider me on the hype train"
Marvels The Punisher,"The Music: Metallica – One﻿
"
Marvels The Punisher,I am so pumped for this!
Marvels The Punisher,Did I see that douche Logan from West World in there?
Marvels The Punisher,For some reason the music and the sound effects timing remind me of [Batmetal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qatmJtIJAPw).
Marvels The Punisher,"I've always said the story of the person one, by meticallica is based of is one of the most fucked up things to happen to a person. Ww1, guy loses both of his arms, both legs, his eyesight and his hearing. Basically just a torso and a head. Every day he has no idea if he's awake, sleeping or just dead . No way to communicate with anyone. Stuck in his own head. That is what I imagine hell to be like. "
Marvels The Punisher,I'm confused when did they change his origin story?  Wasn't Frank's family gunned down in the crossfire of a mob shootout in the park?
Marvels The Punisher,I love that Jon studied Thomas Janes punisher... This is gonna be a bad ass show... I just wanna see him force feed someone their kneecaps
Marvels The Punisher,Anyone catch the date they worked very hard to obscure?
Marvels The Punisher,"I'm hyped I watched the original ""Punisher"" religiously as a kid"
Marvels The Punisher,September 20 --- it's John Bernthal's [birthday today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal)!
Marvels The Punisher,They had me at One
Marvels The Punisher,I'm not sure if this erection is from the trailer being that dope or from the Metallica incorporated gun play 
Marvels The Punisher,Nevermind a Luke Cage 👎🏽 this is what I been anticipating!!! ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Marvels The Punisher,I just jizzed my fucking pants
Marvels The Punisher,I lost my shit with one's intro
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I have a hyphen in my name and it is surprising the amount of companies that can't even handle that. I could be in the system with a hyphen, them separating my name at that point with a blank,  adding the two parts together, making the first part of the hyphenated name my first name and the second the last name, and a bunch of other ridiculous things"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I’ve always felt very represented by Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. 

It’s nice to see kids feeling represented by new puppets."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,I guess I always thought the point of muppets being weirdly shaped and colored was so that nobody would feel excluded because they're not any ethnicity.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Love Sesame Street 🥰
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"My wife got a huge kick out of this when she first heard it. As a Korean artist named Jiyoung, it hit really close to home."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,What’s the significance of the hyphen?

In fact, the captions wrote it wrong in a different way every single time. I don't think it's automatic captions because they were accurate for every other word!

Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Kids have to learn racism in the first place. People are just people to them before that.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Bring back the AIDS puppet you cowards.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I was one of the first generation to grow up on Sesame Street. Growing up in rural Canada (or white Canada) Sesame Street was the first time I actually saw people of colour, and hispanics. Having a variety of characters, of a variety of ethnic backgrounds helps all kids learn about the world around us."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,This made me smile. I didn’t notice until now that there wasn’t Asian representation in the muppets. Happy to see this change. I hope all who read this have a good day.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"This is cool, but I thought all the puppets where just monsters.  When did they start making puppets of ethnicities?  Usually kids on the show where actual children."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I always remembered Minh from Barney, she was from the Philippines! In my predominantly white neighborhood I had never met an Asian person at the time, as a small child, and Minh was my first exposure to non white or black people."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"that’s great but can we have more south asian representation? Everyone’s up about “asian representation” when they’re really talking about East asians. White people really think Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis, etc are part of their own continent."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Ji-Young is so adorable! Sesame Street being awesome as it always has.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"This is great, but do people believe the that representation for Sesame Street was too white? I've never identified with a giant yellow bird, a green trashcan monster, a blue googley-eyed cookie addict, a purple vampire, etc. The puppets have always been pretty ambiguous."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"As a Korean American with a hyphenated name, this is the stupidest shit I’ve ever read."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,">It makes us as the Asian American diaspora feel finally seen and validated.""

Because this lady speaks for all asian Americans . . /s"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Why is it the ethnic puppets are all very ethnic, but there ae no “white” puppets? The other people puppets are all purple and green and orange and blue. The most “white person” puppet is Prairie Dawn and I don’t think they use her these days. The whole point was ro have “anybody” puppets. 

I got nothing against Koreans or Korean puppets, but it does seem to go one way. 

Also, ever notice that autistic characters in kids programs have dead eyes?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,[deleted]
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Wow People are upset with this in comments and I find it funny…cause they didn’t have a problem with Bert and Earnie being gay with white personas. Go figure they just hating on race

Sesame Street wasn’t made for racist it’s actually a liberal program. Conservatives can blow off watch or create your own hillbilly hate programming for kids"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"As a Korean, the Cookie Monster was my dude. Guess thats why I like Death Metal now."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,More female puppets! More diversity! Yay!
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,The show lost its impact when every puppet had to represent a minority group for some woke cause imo
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"This is what the Asian community needed to feel validated?  A fucking Sesame St puppet with a hyphen in its name?  

I really really wish people could be black for just a day.  Sure would change some perspectives."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Don't teach your children to rely on external validation.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Sesame Street does so much good in the world.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"What are you talking about… We Asians have always been seen and validated, what cave have you been hiding in?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"since when do muppets have ethnicities.

they're different colours. not race colours lol"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Smarter, stronger, kinder"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"ok, I gotta say...it never occurred to me before today that Muppets were supposed to have race.  

which are the white ones?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Aren’t children on Sesame Street normally played by real kids and the puppets are monster characters?
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Just cast the best puppet for the role. /s
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,I’m confused I thought the puppets on Sesame Street were without race
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Seen and validated? That’s rich. My (real) name has been butchered my whole life, it’s not a matter of being “seen and validated”, it’s more about people being careless and sloppy."

It’s been just a quirk in my life, never really thought about bigger implications like this. Good on ya Sesame Street!"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"oh for cryin outloud lol. this is becoming so silly… indians are outraged at Apu, Korean’s are overjoyed by this puppet… what are writers supposed to do, write *more* or *less* diverse characters? And more importantly, why are arbitrary characteristics like race and skin color so important to the character? Who cares, and why?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,It's about time.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"You feel validated by a puppet. Congrats on your very low bar, round of high fives for everyone"

Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I think it's great that Sesame Street is doing this, and I believe representation matters for kids that watch it. At the same time, I'll never understand the victimhood boner some Asian Americans have. [Is the fact that they're completely trouncing every other ethnic group including whites not enough to feel seen and validated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#cite_note-3)?

Really?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"42? Damn, good genes girl"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Oh, this is so sweet! That's the first time I heard about a Korean kid on Sesame Street. What a fantastic character Ji-Young is. And she so reminds me of my Korean wife; it's incredible. We both were grinning with positivity and joy after watching Ji-Young on Youtube. I even have slightly watery eyes. :-) Sesame Street has such an essential role in educating kids (and their parents) about diversity and how wonderfully different yet similar monsters we all are. :-D

For instance, one form I worked with wouldn't accept apostrophes so many Irish and Arabic names wouldn't be allowed EDIT: in my case the backend was already super restrictive and thus until I could get them to loosen their checks we would be forced to make the front end at least as restrictive, which sucked"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I live in Korea with a Canadian name and it messes up all kinds of stuff. My name almost never fits in the name field on any online form. I'm registered in several different places with different name orders. Some places leave my names in Canadian order. Other places insist I put my family name first. Some places don't support capital letters in my name at all. It's gotten a lot better in the past few years, but it's still the occasional hassle."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,At least you don't have an apostrophe in your name like O'Toole. Programming nightmare.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I was surprised to see an ad featuring Lee Min-ho, and they had his first name first. It looked so wrong, I commented that the ad was wrong. It’s actually like insensitive or something to Koreans, but I’m not sure if they noticed. It was already done, so I’m sure they never changed it, but still"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Not my real name, but say my name is Brandon Johnson. Then I get an e-mail starting ""Hello John,"". Like HOW? How the hell did you fuck that up?

And this has happened multiple times with people from different companies we do business with.

  


And on a few occasions I've gotten an e-mail starting "" Hi Brenda,"". Like, they're not even trying."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,In one of the states I work with directly for entering death certificates you can’t use punctuation. Name O’Malley? Cool you get a space. The names are all in caps as well so you have to decide if you ad a space to indicate the capital or just ignore that there is a capital same would go for a hyphen. It is just lazy coding in my opinion. Punctuation is clearly important for different reasons or everyone’s name would be on capital letter followed be a serious of lower case letters.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Company? IRS forms still don’t take hyphens. You just have to leave a blank.

That said, it’s not a big deal LOL. I think there’s a huge difference between immigrants who came into the country and kids born from immigrant parents who insist on hyphenating their kids’ names and who have to “endure” a bunch of “wow your English is really good!” growing up."

Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I thought it was weird to have a human-like muppet too. All for inclusivity, but it does not look like a monster like Grover, Ernie or Dr. Teeth does.

edit: called him Mr."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Yeah, but then you have african american puppets and latina puppets, so…"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Can you tell me how to get there?
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Representation is definitely important, especially for programs watched by little kids. It helps them learn that they are not an outsider or unwelcome because of their race and nationality, but instead someone who is also a part of their community. They are in their most formative years and learn who they are based on how they and people like them are treated even on television."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I don't think there is a big consensus on using a hyphen, because some people go about concatenating the two characters (Jiyoung), using PascalCase (JiYoung), using a space (Ji Young) or in this case, a hyphen (Ji-Young).

I personally like the hyphen because it helps distinguish the two characters that form the name. Each character in a name has an associated Chinese character (we call this hanja) and each hanja has its own meaning.

For a name like Da-Mi, it's showing that it's 다미 and not 담이 even though technically they're pronounced the same.

Additionally, Korean generations are often (declining over time, though) distinguished with one of the hanja in a given name being used as a generational indicator. More simply put, siblings will generally share a common syllable.

Soo-Min, Soo-Young, Soo-Jin could very well be 3 siblings belonging to the same family, where Soo is the generational hanja, and Min/Young/Jin is the more personal hanja.

So all this to say, the emphasis on making each character distinct is probably the biggest advantage to using the hyphen. However, even with that, I find it more convenient just to omit the hyphen and the hyphen seems to be employed more frequently in formal / official situations."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,i have one in my first name. you wouldn't believe the number of sites that see that as an illegal character when filling forms. its annoying.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I don't know anything about Korean names, but maybe it is like removing accents from names? (for Spanish)

It's kind of weird to remove part of your name to fit in, I understand there can be some limitations due to how technical systems operate, but ""hiding"" your heritage eventually makes it weirder or more difficult for others to actually display it."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"I think it's just that a lot of Asian names have them, and it's something that historically white people have looked at and said, ""That's too complicated, I can't pronounce that."""
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"As a white American hyphenated names aren't the norm and anything that isn't the norm, well, people are cruel"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,I might be wrong but it could be similar to hyphenated English names. For instance I know a Terri-Jo.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"It just makes it easier to pronounce in English. In Korean, each letter pairing is one syllable, but that doesn’t make sense in English. So, hyphenating a name makes it easier to say. But a lot of foreign people will go by an English name. So instead of Ji-Yung, they might go by Jenny."
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Yeah and Koreans don't represent all Asians either. They're just the most popular one right now.

Edit: Why are you booing me? I'm right!"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,I only accept representation in puppet form.
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,"Yep. Why are people (the puppeteer included) acting like this new Asian muppet is nothing short of a revolution, when there has been diverse casting on Sesame Street from Day One?"
Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey,Oh no that’s doesn’t fit the narrative 😂

P. King Duckling,">The set design and costume design also do well to mesh with the cinematography

Not sure if this is serious. When you get a grand wide shot of Numenor, you think this is going to be great. However, what you actually get of Numenor is the docks, one street, and one back alley. They keep shooting the same spots over and over again. For such a grand civilization, what you actually get is disappointing."
P. King Duckling,"lemme draw for [my review of Rings of Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/y5qlf7/a_review_of_the_lord_of_the_rings_the_rings_of/) because I basically have the same opiniona and perspective you do on it. My rating is a 7.3

> the show is visually spell-binding. Hardly a show comes close to this one in terms of visual splendor. Aided by expensive vfx & gorgeous scenery of NZ I assume, the show does justice I feel to capturing the imagery of the books as well as how PJ depicted Middle Earth. 

Yupp. This is the best aspect of the series... even though to me in general the series came off a bit, beautifully bland. 

> I feel the acting was servicable. Few of the actors stand out tbh.

That lady that had the musical bit... that was with the dwarf people (*I don't remember what they're called*) gave the best performance throughout the entire thing imo."
P. King Duckling,She looks so different. I cannot figure out what is different on her face though. But something is different.
P. King Duckling,"While I may not agree across the board, I did enjoy S1.  Personally, I thought it started a bit slow and slowly improved over the episodes.  If it was not for E8, which I thought was really strong, I am not sure I would be as interested in S2.  I hope it continues its growth and gives us a good story."
P. King Duckling,the aesthetics and visuals of this tour are out of the world
P. King Duckling,"I liked it. I know its a terrible adaptation and I totally understand anyone who hates it for that, but luckily for me I’ve never read the Silmarillion so I don’t have the source material to compare it to and get angry about.   There is some stupid prequel shit, who in their right mind was like “I need a Mythril origin story!”?  But mostly it’s good. Plus when a studio spends three quarters of a billion dollars on a sweeping fantasy epic, I have to support that. Even if I had hated the end result I would still watch all the episodes just to tell Amazon that, yes, I approve of that investment, and you if you’re interested I got like a dozen series in my kindle just aching for someone to spend millions and millions of dollars adapting.  How do feel about brutal napoleonic era empires tossing around light based magic like it’s not slowly murdering everyone who uses it?"
P. King Duckling,I shallow. The elves are not hot. Getting rid of the long hair is a travesty.
P. King Duckling,"Here for the Teen Titans reference. I think a lot of cartoon adaptations are like that. The original X-men cartoon was probably closest to source comics from the 80s, but more recent shows like X-men: Evolution and Wolverine and the X-men have been much more AU interpretations of classic characters."
P. King Duckling,"Lucifer. Good show, Tom Ellis is highly entertaining but it has nothing in common with Neil Gaiman’s Lucifer."
P. King Duckling,"The Boys is the best current answer to this question.

The Boys is a legitimately good show, sometimes veering into great

The Boys is an absolutely trash-ass comic with almost zero worth as fiction.

The *reason* The Boys is a legitimately good show is *because* it's a terrible adaptation of that shitty comic."
P. King Duckling,The new Let the Right One In show is a great look at vampire fiction in a real world. It is nothing like any of the adaptations or the original book/movie.
P. King Duckling,"The Incredible Hulk which was a successful but extremely diluted & downscaled offshoot of the original Marvel Comics source material, justified considering a more faithful adaptation would have been both unfilmable and repellent to mainstream audiences of the late 1970s."
P. King Duckling,"The Office is an interesting one in that the pilot tries to be a faithful adaptation of the UK version only to completely fall flat on it's face. 

It really came into it's own when it decided to scrap the dry British awkward humour and be unapologetically American with a bunch of wacky characters getting up to hijinks."
P. King Duckling,"Preacher. The biggest complaint you’ll hear about it, assuming you’re into insane stories with incredible amounts of sacrilege and you’re cool with ridiculous suspension of disbelief, is that it isn’t faithful to the source."
P. King Duckling,"Kindred - I just finished and it seems different from the intent of the novel.

Even changing the relationship between the main character and her love interest changes the tone and it becomes more of a mystery box show rather than one about the effects of slavery and racism.

As a scifi mystery, it’s not that bad if a show though."
P. King Duckling,"The Jack Ryan show could apply - it’s a good show on its own but beyond 2 character names there’s nothing ‘Jack Ryan’ about it. The guy spent most of the books behind a desk analyzing stuff, not running a special ops teams on a cargo ship."
P. King Duckling,"Station Eleven. As much as I enjoyed the book, the TV series far surpassed it for me. The decision, in particular, to have Kirsten and Jeevan's story together continue after the theater incident was a big change that worked beautifully."
P. King Duckling,Arcane and Castlevania made their own types of stories without worrying too much about what the source material was doing. They just used the general idea of the world and characters.
P. King Duckling,"Can’t believe I haven’t seen this posted yet.

But the Halo Series is the very definition of this.

A pretty good Sci-fi show. A fucking awful adaptation of a beloved universe.


I’m pretty sure the script was already written before the IP of Halo was ever put near it."
P. King Duckling,"Just want to say that even though Stephen King adaptations are never really satisfying and are usually examples used for bad adaptations, The Green Mile was the best movie adaptation I have ever seen."
P. King Duckling,[deleted]
P. King Duckling,"Anne with an E. Wonderful show. It was almost nothing like the Anne of Green Gables series that it was based on. I liked it though, I considered it kind of like AOGG fanfiction. 

The Kevin Sullivan 1980s (first) one was extremely close to the source material and so beautifully done. The second one (Anne of Avonlea/Anne 2) was a mashup of 3 different books and they put in a bunch of original characters to move the story along. Then he retconned his own timeline for the 3rd one and put them in WWI. His original timeline had them get engaged circa 1889. If he wanted to make a war movie, he could have made Rilla of Ingleside into a movie, that would have been great! So as it stands, I don't think I will ever see an adaptation of Anne's House of Dreams."
P. King Duckling,"For some, HBO's Watchmen may fit the bill. I enjoyed it the first go around, perhaps if I watch again it won't hold up as well. My friend was a Watchmen fan from our high school days and while he liked the movie, he didn't like the TV show."
P. King Duckling,"The ITV series *Agatha Christie's Marple* would frequently play fast and loose with the adaptations, sometimes for better or worse. Sometimes, they would take stories not featuring Miss Marple and add her in as somewhat of a mentor to other detectives; other times, she'd replace them outright.

And then there are the times when they'd change the killers' motivations to make them more acceptable, or the series playing into the settings change of being around the 1950's, focusing a lot on post-war tensions and drama.

For example, the plot of *At Bertram's Hotel* is significantly changed. Not only is the subplot involving the character of Canon Pennyfather completely rewritten - going from being missing for a few days with memory issues to >!having never been in the hotel in the first place, as the story focuses exclusively on his impersonator - now a Nazi war criminal being hunted by other guests at the hotel!<, but unlike in the original novel, the killer does *not* get away with it.

Murder is Easy is also made better for changing the killer's motive - originally a plain-ass psychopath who is killing people close to a former romantic partner to frame them for the killer, it is changed to >!a woman trying desperately hard to hide the fact that she gave birth to a child after being raped by her own brother... who she also killed because she knew he'd be institutionalized if she told anyone about it.!<

Also, some of the episodes were adapted out of order. Sleeping Murder was part of Series 2, when it was the last story Agatha Christie wrote about the character, period. Nemesis ended the third series, which made things awkward since it was a sequel story to A Carribean Mystery, because the Watson in that story hired Miss Marple to investigate a murder he had uncovered but died before he could've gotten a chance to solve it himself.

And since you mentioned that games were allowed, there's a fantastic point-and-click adventure game based on *Murder On The Orient Express* that changes a lot of details related to the source material.

Bouc isn't travelling on the train; instead, his secretary is returning to Paris and is travelling with Poirot at her employers' orders; Poirot is too injured to investigate Ratchett's murder because he was sleeping on the top bunk when they hit the snow drift; more emphasis is put on the crew as valuable witnesses; there's a Morse code radio that the heroine can use to learn information about the suspects...

Then things get interesting. Dr Konstantine is revealed to be lying about his medical qualifications and is actually a vet, but still gives an accurate autopsy report, you have to fend off a pack of wolves, >!Daisy Armstrong isn't dead and is on the train...!<"
P. King Duckling,Dirk Gently.  I don't sense any Douglas Adams wit in the tv show.
P. King Duckling,"""The Magicians""

A lot of people love the show, so I'll call it good, but holy fuck they don't match the tone of the books. I read the books before the show came out and I couldn't watch past the 1st season. It's a completely different thing that just shares the name, genre & some proper nouns."
P. King Duckling,"Game of Throne. It's a good show(the early seasons) but I think it missed a lot of what's in the books, not only in the way of plot or this or that detail, but imo it fails to adapt the themes and spirit of the books"
P. King Duckling,"iCarly 2021 completely missed the humor of the OG series and was better for it by being a genetic adult sitcom. As it adapted more of the crazy humor in season 2, it just doesn’t work with the little kid glasses taken off of me. 

Not a tv series but I like the Snyder films of DC, even if my opinion is unpopular. You don’t have to adhere to comics to make a good movie, and his Justice League made the previous two films mean more (though I still dislike Eisenberg as Lex Luther, it’s already gonna be rebooted as a new universe so there’s no real point in getting mad about it anymore)."
P. King Duckling,Game of thrones
P. King Duckling,"Cowboy Bebop, the live action one."
P. King Duckling,"The Boys

Watchmen (2019)

Interview with a Vampire (2022)

The Shining

Jurassic Park"
P. King Duckling,"The Walking Dead, show > comic (source)."
P. King Duckling,I didn't mind the Wheel of Time all that much. (I have no idea what the source material is like tho)
P. King Duckling,"Wait hold on. Jurassic Park and Roger Rabbit are bad adaptations? I think they’re both examples of really good adaptations. Yes, they change a lot, but it’s all in service of a better movie. Knowing what to change is what makes an adaptation savvy.

You want a bunch of Zack Snyders out here doing frame for frame adaptations that absolutely don’t work as well as a result? Know the strengths of your medium!"
P. King Duckling,"Not a TV show, but Ready Player One was a huge disappointment having read the book first."
P. King Duckling,Wheel of time
P. King Duckling,"I feel like Locke n Key had so much potential at adapting Joe Hill’s story. The first like 2-3 episodes were extremely fascinating and set up a sorta Lovecraftian vibe that’s absolutely necessary for the show. 

However it quickly devolved into Riverdale High School drama bs. Which is a shame. I was hoping the 2nd season would perhaps double down on the keys but instead it just doubles down on the high school drama bs 😓"
P. King Duckling,"Dude hasn’t seen Teen Titans Go, then"
P. King Duckling,"When Hulu announced they were making Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I was stoked.  Ive read the books a few times, listen to the radio series a few time, in addition to the 1980 BBC mini-series.  

Well its been over 3 years, no news at all with this project.  No director, no cast, no script, no pre-production, no teaser trailer.  If this show ever starts production, I can only assume it will be based off the 2005 movie, which Disney owns, in addition to Hulu and that we wont see anything from the books, radio drama or even the text based video game. 

So I will say, this show, even tho it hasn't been made, will be a bad adaptation and will probably suck.  Unless the BBC makes this, its gonna suck Arcturan MegaDonkey balls."
P. King Duckling,[deleted]
P. King Duckling,"The BBC’s Sharpe series deviated from the original books in some aspects but did it so well, Cornwell adopted them (specifically Sharpe’s background before he joined the British army)."
P. King Duckling,The Teen Titans shows was actually a pretty close rendition of the New Teen Titans comics. It just didn't go as edgy because the characters were like 13-14 ish instead of basically college kids.
P. King Duckling,Westworld would probably fit.
P. King Duckling,"The Magicians. Great show, but veers way off from the books."
P. King Duckling,"Foundation, apparently."
P. King Duckling,"The Magicians on Syfy was a show that felt that way to me.  I only read the first book and part of the second, but by the end of the first season much of it was unrecognizable and several characters were changed, renamed, or added.  However I actually enjoyed the show and gave up on the books.  Also going to give a nod to Syfy's Dresden Files series.  The only way to reconcile that with the books is knowing that a mirror universe is going to be introduced and pretending this was a different multiverse from the books.  However it was a good enough show to get me to track down and read the books.  Finally I'm going to also say Dexter.  The first book follows much of season 1's arc, but Dexter himself is vastly different and over the course of the books they went into more of a supernatural arc.  
Not a show, but movie, however Constantine also fits the bill for me.  Doesn't even pronounce the character's name correctly, but was a movie I really enjoyed."
P. King Duckling,"Haunting of Hill House.  I adore Shirley Jackson, and am usually one of those people who hates shows based on books - I want them to be incredibly faithful to the source material.  But Haunting of Hill House did a really amazing job of telling a very different story but still keeping a lot of the themes and character references/traits to the original novel. It was exceptionally well done."
P. King Duckling,HALO.  It was good science fiction but it also a terrible adaptation of the source material.
P. King Duckling,"I like the show Doom Patrol so I got the Grant Morrison Doom Patrol collection which the show is heavily influenced by. I really liked in the comic how the team gets along and has each other's back. Jane accepts Cliff as a mentor (helps that he isnt trying to be her father figure when Im pretty sure they are about the same age or she is older) and they are very close. Cliff also is extremely loyal to Larry to the point when Larry transforms into Rebis Cliff never used the new name. The show also removed Joshua Clay from a major role and I liked him. 

Another big change is that in the comic Doom Patrol is fine with being heros. They straight up say they are specially equipped to deal with strange problems the Justice League cant handle. 

I think the show would havebenefitted with moving to a place where they become closet with each other and embrace being heroes."
P. King Duckling,"I like halo, it seems hated by all people who played the game. they went ballistic when big homie took his helmet off, like deal breaker. I gave zero shits, woulda been dumb if he kept it on I thought"
P. King Duckling,The Bruce Timm animations of Batman and Superman are my primary example for this.  They are SUPERB stories inspired by the comics but they have made their own changes to the characters and universes.  I think Timm kept the original spirit of the stories and universe even as he adapted them for animation.
P. King Duckling,"""Why do they blame me for all their little failings? They use my name as if I spent my entire days sitting on their shoulders, forcing them to commit acts they would otherwise find repulsive. 'The devil made me do it.' I have never made one of them do anything. Never. They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them.""


I would love to see a show about the Lucifer that Gaiman wrote"
P. King Duckling,"To be a little pedantic: Neil Gaiman created the character, for lack of a better word, but the show is a bad adaptation of the Mike Carey comic based on the Neil Gaiman character.

I agree on the main point, though. Excellent show, bad adaptation."
P. King Duckling,"The first few seasons were great. Then when Netflix acquired it, it leaned way too far in to the supernatural and became a parody of itself.

It was funniest when Lucifer was a fish out of water and everyone else was fairly straight."
P. King Duckling,"Seriously asking, what do people like about this show? I’ve tuned in for, admittedly, very small portions, but it feels like a standard police procedural with the gimmick of the lead being this super hornball devil?"
P. King Duckling,"See, this is where I have trouble with the use of the word “terrible” when the proper term is “faithful” because you can choose to alter from the source and it can be a good adaptive choice. That’s part of the process of adaption. Adaptation is not straight-up copying 1:1"
P. King Duckling,Good call. Very different from the movie adaptations for sure but still a great show in its own right!
P. King Duckling,Don't forget they even changed the main character's name to David Banner because Bruce was considered too gay
P. King Duckling,">unapologetically American

That would also explain the superfluous final 3 seasons"
P. King Duckling,"Nah, biggest complaints are that Season 2 is an aimless plodding mess, Jessies thoroughly dislikable, and Cassidy's whiny as fuck over a friendship that only actually really happened in the comics."
P. King Duckling,"I gave the first season a watch and liked a lot of what was there, figured the show needed some room to do its own thing.  Then I got a few episodes into the second season and realized this was just another bourne-esque action drama with some Clancy branding.

I don't even like Clancy that much, but it's been ages since a good adaptation, I think!"
P. King Duckling,They turned Ryan into John Clark but failed to include all the challenging moral ambiguity that goes with his character
P. King Duckling,"The Kirsten and Jeevan connection is so natural and beautiful that it’s amazing to think it wasn’t always part of the story. 

I do think I prefer the post apocalypse in the book but seeing how they changed the prophet was also great"
P. King Duckling,"I think thats why they worked, only the games that don’t really have established narratives end up  making for good adaptations , because if the game already has a through narrative, whats the point in adapting it into a less immersive medium?"
P. King Duckling,My friend joked that they wanted to make a Mass Effect show but couldn’t get the rights so they just slapped Halo on the title and assumed no one would notice
P. King Duckling,"Agreed. Honestly all of the recent fantasy adaptions could fit this description. Witcher, Rings of Power, and Wheel of Time are all decent-good shows but have very little in common with the source material."
P. King Duckling,"You’re so right. I hate when movie and show runners just use an IP to bring in the massive audience and fan base, then abandon the IP’s storyline for whatever they wanted to do in the first place. It incenses the fan base and disrespects the original medium.

Foundation was great because, as you said, adapting the original fully would make for a boring show. But if that was always the case, they could have made a completely new IP with their Trantor plot line and even The Empire!

In this age of reusing material and taking advantage of nostalgia, I’ve become sick of seeing my favorite stories get twisted and bent into these shows and movies that they never asked to be in the first place 😔.

I’m not saying that I don’t want to see my favorite books and games be adapted to the big screen. It’s just that every time it happens, I get so excited about the possibilities just to be massively disappointed when I see they just wanted to use the IP for its popularity. And then they try all their new ideas and wonder why all the fans are mad.

Guaranteed people would be less mad if you just made your own IP with those ideas. Give people a chance to like it before pissing them off."
P. King Duckling,"Completely agree - I enjoy the show and I hope it proves successful, but even the most flexible of Foundation fans has to admit that these are not the characters and stories from the books.

Having said that, I actually think they're doing a great job remixing the early history of the foundation into something with dramatic stakes, and as you said, the new material from the perspective of Cleon is captivating stuff.

It puts them in a weird position though - the show owes a lot to the novels, yet isn't reproducing what they contain in the eyes of most viewers.  Can a show be such a loose adaptation alongside more true-to-source sci fi like The Expanse?"
P. King Duckling,"HBO's Watchmen isn't really an adaptation of the source material, its' a direct sequel to it.

I honestly believe it's a sequel that not only retcons the original effectively, but is one of the rare retcons that improves on the original media.

But it's not an adaptation of source material at all. It behaves as if the source material in question actually happened in the show's past, and proceeds forward from there."
P. King Duckling,"I've said it before in another thread, but Watchmen is the TV equivalent of 2006's Crash. Utterly vapid. Talks about race in America while offering absolutely no meaningful commentary on it. For all it's talk about Tulsa, the KKK, institutional corruption and police transparency, the show amounts to nothing more than a basic Saturday morning cartoon about foiling a baddie and their doomsday machine."
P. King Duckling,"Ya more quirk than wit in the TV show (some wit though), still enjoy both though"
P. King Duckling,"A buddy of mine hated the books with a fiery passion, and was an enormous fan of the show."
P. King Duckling,"Cutting Lady Stoneheart was probably the first big mistake, but I think the biggest failing was how they decided to mostly ignore the fourth and fifth book. 

Like, the whole point is that the food guys lost. A lot of people are dead, the survivors are defeated, the board is cleared, and new players are joining the game. Instead, the show tried very hard to just continue the first half of the story.

It’s a shame, I would’ve loved to have seen Dorne and the Iron Islands treated with the same love and respect the rest of the series got early on. With that said, considering even the earlier seasons didn’t seem to “get” the Ironborn, guess we should’ve seen it coming."
P. King Duckling,"I don't think this answers the OP's question. When I saw it I immediately thought of ""The Shining"". It's a virtually different story to the Stephen King novel it's based on but an excellent movie in it's own right.

GoT is still the same as asoiaf (for the first four seasons). Yes, they cut out most of the magic and prophecy stuff. Yes, the themes are very different (GoT is way more nihilistic). Yes, the story and its characters are noticeably less complex.

But it's still the same story on the surface. Not remotely comparable to ""The Shining"" example."
P. King Duckling,">imo it fails to adapt the themes and spirit of the books

I 100% disagree."
P. King Duckling,">but imo it fails to adapt the themes and spirit of the books

Half of the seasons did."
P. King Duckling,"Similarly the original Battlestar Galactica was a campy, mediocre, Star Wars clone. The remake was a dark character drama and was much better."
P. King Duckling,"Even as someone who thinks the anime is the best piece of media Iv ever seen, I couldn’t hate this show, it commits so much to being a live action cartoon with how over the top it is, I loved it in a campy, kitsch, guilty pleasure way.

Sometimes I do want something deep and existentialist but other times I just want a fun raunchy comedy with some sci fi flavor

This and Blood Origin are my most shameful guilty pleasures"
P. King Duckling,"AGREED 
It was phenomenally well cast, had a great vibe of its own and actually good independent of the source material"
P. King Duckling,"Interview with the Vampire seems to be really proposed as a reimagination from the start, with late Anne Rice’s blessing for that. 

And there’s even an “explanation” of sorts part of the divergences: Louis is shown to be an unreliable narrator."
P. King Duckling,The books are not great tbh. 14 giant tomes of nothing and bad characters
P. King Duckling,"Much, much better than the show."
P. King Duckling,"The show is much closer to the source material than the Bookcloaks claim. There are pronounced differences, but it's nothing like some of the highly upvoted examples in this thread.

I was into it for the first 6 episodes, and pretty let down by episodes 7 and 8. I'll watch season 2 with an open mind and I hope they can find their footing and it'll be at the same level of quality as the first half of season 1."
P. King Duckling,"by ""bad adaptions"" I mean not acuate adaptations not badly written, I wanted to make a point that accuracy isn't required to make a good show"
P. King Duckling,"\>Jurassic Park and Roger Rabbit are bad adaptations?

&#x200B;

He is a moron."
P. King Duckling,Going to strongly disagree on this one.
P. King Duckling,"Not only unfaithful adaptations, but just a bad show on its own. It doesn't even maintain *it's own* world building from episode to episode, let alone the books. Just a travesty of a show."
P. King Duckling,Literally anything could have been an improvement over those books.
P. King Duckling,Isnt it a thing in thr series that every medium has a similar but different take on it?
P. King Duckling,I didn't read the Good Omens book. Why is the show a bad adaptation?
P. King Duckling,"Absolutely! Same with JL/JLU. Great shows with comics-inspired episodes, but they created their own League. The recent Young Justice was even more away from the comics, just picking names out of a hat for their team I think."
P. King Duckling,Their stuff was so good it made it back to the comics and other media. Harley Quinn was an invention of Batman: The Animated Series.
P. King Duckling,so then I wouldn't consider them bad adaptations. its not like they were adapting any specific story
The Sinner,Season 4 is so far better than season 3. So It will go out with a better season than at least.
The Sinner,"Did creators knew about that, and they created a proper ending?"
The Sinner,">This marks another milestone in USA Network’s original programming evolution as UCP-produced The Sinner is the last remaining homegrown scripted series on the network.

It's a shame, but not surprising.  Cable is pretty clearly a dying model."
The Sinner,"any chance another network (even Netflix) could pick it up? If not, please have Bill play an another detective.... 

also what a shame barely anyone here watched/watches it. Season 4 is good (i liked it more than True Detective's second and third season...)"
The Sinner,Season 4 is pretty good!
The Sinner,"I am really liking Season 4,best season after S1 imo."
The Sinner,Took me a second to figure out that the title was incomplete lol. But I guess it's better to end it on a high rather than milk it to death like a few other shows.
The Sinner,That's a real weird place to cut the title
The Sinner,"So, now that this season is over, I have to ask back to the first episode in season 4: who were the 3 women having some ceremony out in the woods late at night in the nude? They never really touched on that again. I thought when one of the women turned around it was Meg Muldoon...but again, they never touched on that again in the season, unless I missed it.

They later had the character of the other girl that tried to help Percy out, but she was doing that alone and it seemed different. 

So what was going on there?"
The Sinner,[deleted]
The Sinner,How was the second season? I’ve only seen the first but I loved it and now I’m a Big Black Delta fan ha
The Sinner,"According to the article: ""The remaining three episodes will air Nov. 17 and Nov. 24, leading to an extended Season 4 — and series — finale on Dec. 1, which will wrap Det. Harry Ambrose’s (Bill Pullman) journey."" So I think so."
The Sinner,"It's really not.  And even if it was, how the fuck does that have anything to do with this? Is only cable creating scripted series?  Obviously not, that's fucking stupid.  So wtf are you even saying other than looking like a markov reply bot?"
The Sinner,"Honestly it is. I was preparing to quit it if it was more of season 3's quality, but I think it's as good as the first season. So far, anyway."
The Sinner,Oh they do that on S4? Now I don't wanna watch it...
The Sinner,[deleted]
The Sinner,"Last episode of the series, is always called series finale. This doesn't mean anything.  
I have bad feelings about that."
The Sinner,"To be correct, he doesn't really talks to dead people. He is talking in is own head with it."
The Sinner,you should. These take barely any time and he does not get any information out of it
The Sinner,"you put those the wrong way round dude, the crocodile eats the bigger number (or better season) remember"
The Sinner,I think he's talking about wrapping up the journey more than it being called a series finale
The Sinner,Seriously man? “The crocodile”? It’s a fucking alligator.
The Sinner,"The only actual ending for that character is offing himself, wouldn't be hard to add if they didn't go there.

edit: downvotes! So... maybe we have very different reads on him? I see him prolonging his physical and mental suffering in search of understanding, broader and broader sorts of understanding at this point. He's lost all social ties and his health, while not confirmed exactly, is really poor. I think it makes the most sense for him to finally find  peace in understanding whatever drove the current mystery and to choose to end his own life."
The Sinner,"I really enjoyed S1, but felt like the show declined steadily from there."
The Sinner,With Bill Pullman you can’t go wrong.
The Sinner,"Is this no longer going to be in Netflix? 

Enjoyed first two seasons. But 3rd was a bit bland. Seemed like we had all the answers quickly, unlike the others slowly unravelling."
The Sinner,Will he be walking around pained and mopey all season? Because that's fun
The Sinner,"S1 was great, S2 was meh, S3 was hot garbage."
The Sinner,This fucking guy gets emotionally involved with the most random murderers.
The Sinner,Where’s my season 3 fans at?!?!
The Sinner,"Yea, we have known for quite some time."
The Sinner,S3's topics gave me huge anxiety. It was well acted and all but a torture for me to get through.
The Sinner,"1 was great, 2 was ok, 3 didn’t finish"
The Sinner,"I personally enjoyed season 2 as much as season 1, but I could not get down with season 3."
The Sinner,I didn't even finish the third season it was terrible.
The Sinner,"I agree, season 1 definitely the best, 2nd wasn't bad at all but 3rd just seemed 'too different', I watched it, decent enough but feels like we're far away from what made season 1 so good at this point"
The Sinner,Season 2 and 3 of The Sinner would like to talk to you
The Sinner,I am upset that there have been 3 seasons of a Bill Pullman show i did not know about.
The Sinner,"At least S2 had a solid Carrie Coon performance (plus that kid was really good, too). S3 was just confusing. It lowered my bar for detectives. Now, I'm like, *'did the murderer successfully convince you to bury yourself alive? No? Well, good, Batman. That's good. You're the world's greatest detective'*."
The Sinner,I thought it absolutely slapped and it was easily my favourite season of the show!
The Sinner,I'll give you an upvote though I was not a fan of season 3. I mean the acting was good but it didn't seem to have room to go anywhere.
The Sinner,I loved Bill and Matt together!
The Sinner,I dug matt bomer.. and the relationship they were building with pullman's character but it didnt work..
The Sinner,i enjoyed it personally
The Sinner,"I feel like the season can be read two ways, and neither of them are very good. In one reading, Matt Bomer's character is the unapologetic villain, which is quite bigoted against people who have the sort of psychological breakdowns that he has in the show. In the other, Detective Ambrose is the villain for doing all the wrong things and pushing Matt Bomer's character to a point of breakdown where he's lost all sense of right and wrong, then murdering him. If this is the case, then why do we care about Detective Ambrose anymore, and why should we ever root for him to investigate another murder?

I feel like the only logical out the show has left is to turn Detective Ambrose into a corrupted antihero we're not supposed to like, because if he's still portrayed as a decent guy after everything he did in S3, fuck that shit."
The Sinner,It's never too late. The first three seasons are on Netflix.
The Sinner,"Agreed 100%. I've been a fan of Matt Bomer since his White Collar days (an underrated series, imo), and I've seen him in several roles since then, but I thought he was fantastic in The Sinner. I feel like the season got a lot of hate, but I really enjoyed it. 

He's also incredible in The Normal Heart. It's another very emotional role."
The Sinner,"I've always hated how underrated Bill Pullman is, so I'm tempted to try the show just for him."
The Sinner,"Matt Bomer puts-in fucking work, man. I never thought that a show like *Doom Patrol* would get me misty-eyed, but goddamnit did his performance get me there on multiple occasions."
The Sinner,"I honestly wish I had waited to binge-watch this season, as opposed to watching it weekly as it aired. The way his character devolved was so brilliant, and his acting was so amazing, but I didn't really realize or appreciate it until after I finished the season and looked back on it later. I think if I had watched the episodes back-to-back, it would have been much more impactful. Highly recommend this show. The first season is also excellent as well."
The Sinner,"Just watched season 3 and thought it was one of the best seasons of any show I've ever seen. I wasn't really expecting it to be good. Season 1 was pretty good, but I never even finished season 2. Admittedly, I've never really paid much attention to Matt Bomer as an actor, but I'm now a fan. Messina is usually on his game. The audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes are horrible, but I saw this one review that explains why I think that is. 

""The third season of 'The Sinner' has so much to say about it's niche subject material that it may not speak to every viewer; but will scream at the select few who are already familiar with that feeling you are standing on the edge, staring into the abyss.""

I'm one of those it screams at - I guess we're not alone, but I can see how it would be hard to watch for people who don't relate."
The Sinner,"Loved this season. Loved Bomer in it. Pullman is amazing, and Messina is a great actor."
The Sinner,great acting by everyone but boy this season was rough. I just finished it and it was not that great. I didn't expect a cat and mouse game after 3 episodes. It just didn't feel like a detective show at all. I thought season 1 was mediocre and haven't watched season 2 and probably won't bother now
The Sinner,Agreed 100 percent. So incredibly beautiful and tragic at the same time.
The Sinner,"I searched Reddit specifically for this sentiment. I’d never seen Bomer take main stage in anything previously, and he was phenomenal. The rationalizing, the pain, the loneliness….wow"
The Sinner,"I just finished. I have a lot here relationship with the Sinner because it almost feels a bit unrealistic at times. But Matt Bomer’s character I resonated with particular well. There were moments where I couldn’t stand him, but the development of his character was astounding. And I’ve never seen Matt Bomer in a role like this and he did a phenomenal job. Definitely want to see him in more stuff."
The Sinner,It was so good and so bingeable.
The Sinner,"Bomer is sooooooo good in DOOM PATROL and he’s in good company. 

That show is easily the best superhero show I’ve ever seen on tv and yes, I’ve seen and love The Boys."
The Sinner,"Loved season 1, didnt like season 2,
& loved season 3 again

Only bad thing is season 4 won't have matt bomer in it again 😩"
The Sinner,"I personally felt the opposite. I thought Bomer’s acting was terrible. I think they just cast him as eye candy. All he really did was show his wide eyes and act out the part of a psycho or victim. His character did not show depth and everyone was just in love with him and wanted to understand him. I don’t normally bring race into things, but if he was an African American man, the season would have been 10 minutes long. There were countless times and reasons they could have arrested him for his behavior: dna at crime scene, lying to detectives, smashing chairs (and yelling and scaring people) at public events, the highway speed chase… instead they didn't have enough to hold the beautiful tortured white man, so he continues to kill. And even after more deaths, detective is like ""hey man, please don't do it again.""

But again, besides the race factor, I thought the writing and acting had no depth. Seemed like a philosophy 102 class made into a movie by high schoolers who needed to fill 5.5 hours. Sad I wasted this much of my life on this season. I did like the psychology of characters in other seasons, especially season 2."
The Sinner,hehe Bomer.
The Sinner,"S1 was awesome. S2 put me to sleep and S3 can cure insomnia and I probably won't finish but I agree, Bomer has done a great job."
The Sinner,Season 1 best and Only good Season. Period WTF
The Sinner,"I didn’t give 3 a shot but, Jamie or Matt Bomer not the right choice IMO"
The Sinner,2 was alright
The Sinner,First scene -Stabbing at a beach- psycho- can’t touch that - up your scenes Writers
The Sinner,"It was great watching him grow as an actor over the course of White Collar. He wasn't bad to begin with, but he went from someone who relied mostly on his natural charm to giving wonderfully nuanced and emotional performances. I really miss White Collar and would love a revival of it.

I'd also strongly recommend people check out Doom Patrol as well. It's a great show and Bomer (as well as the entire cast) is terrific in it."
The Sinner,He’s phenomenal in The Sinner. It’s strange that he went from “guy every woman had a crush on in the ‘90s” (source: my mom) to a guy who is giving career-best performances in this new show and is still under most people’s radar.
The Sinner,Both the first seasons are absolutely amazing who dun its.  The third I have on my list to watch but just haven't had the time.
The Sinner,"Oh I forgot, I did try the first season, and I didn't like it at all. Are the fallowing seasons  better?"
The Sinner,I thought S3 was amazing
The Sinner,"Yes and more interesting, to me anyway, as the older I get and observe how people rationalize their every day lives and be hypocrites about many things they advocate, I can't help but wonder why more people don't see it themselves. Self awareness is lonely lol"
The Sinner,"Is season 2 worth watching at all? I’m a couple episodes in because I enjoyed season 1 so much and wanted to see season 3, but it’s really not grabbing me."
The Sinner,How can you possibly say that if you didn't watch it? They don't really tie together wholly
The Sinner,Get ready. It is difficult to watch and brilliant.
The Sinner,"No - Season 3 is an abomination. Terrible writing. This cop is being celebrated when in the real world he would be fired. And because of the bad writing, Pullman overacts. The first four episodes were good. I was hooked. Then it went WAY south. Just awful. Regret watching it."
The Sinner,Watch 3. Watch three with Bomer. I'm watching S1 after accidentally starting at 3 and I'm glad I watched 3 first
The Sinner,Watch 3
The Sinner,The first season was an adaptation of the German book. I guess writers just couldn't think anything good on their own.
The Sinner,"I don't agree.  S1 was obviously the best, but I enjoyed S2 and while S3 is pretty insane, I'm still enjoying it.  I suppose me enjoying doesn't actually mean they're good, but hey I had fun with them."
The Sinner,I thought season 2 was pretty good
The Sinner,"I love every season of this show, each are different and have their own flavor."
The Sinner,"I really hope the current season of ""The Outsider"" stays as a one and done.

I have a feeling they tried to add a little ??? with some post credit scene which has me worried they will do an unnecessary season that has no book to follow so they make their own story up."
The Sinner,"Honestly, the Sinner could have been a great 2 part episode of Law and Order SVU. The series just dragged on and on"
The Sinner,"""Yeah just me bury me bro wcgw"""
The Sinner,"I’ve been a fan of the show and the quasi-anthology format. Clearly they tried something a little bit different with the third season, since it is not predicated so much on a “why did this person do this unexplainable crime?“ mystery. Or it is, but the answer itself seems besides the point relative to the exploration. Maybe it wasn’t as successful as the first two seasons, but I appreciate them trying to tweak the formula"
The Sinner,"The perfect example of this to me is Californication.  Season 1 was an awesome portrait or a brilliant but broken man coming to terms with how much he had fucked his life up. And growing to the point where he could move forward  David Duchovny won a golden globe.  Then over a series of seasons that got progressively worse he repeatedly undid the character growth in order to drag the show out.  Everytime he went back to Karen despite them being ridiculously toxic to each other, I got increasingly bored."
The Sinner,Wow I didn't even know there was a Season 3 and I've seen the first two already
The Sinner,This post made me realize I never finished watching the second season. I guess I just kind of forgot about it one episode and literally haven't thought about it since. I do remember enjoying the first series.
The Sinner,"I’ve only seen the first season,which I thought was quite good. It was about the right length and pacing. Jessica Biel and Bill Pullman both did excellent jobs."
The Sinner,"I watched the first season as it aired, and enjoyed it. I’m also a Bill Pullman fan. That said, I wouldn’t say it was great TV. Above average though.

Tried to do the same with season two, but I couldn’t get into it. It was so boring and wholly uninteresting. As the OP said, even the great Carrie Coon couldn’t save it.

I wondered if I’d erred, and decided to give the third season a shot. I’ve recorded all episodes, but maybe I won’t bother now. I have too much else to watch"
The Sinner,"Another good example (though nowhere near the quality of *The Sinner*) is *13 Reasons Why*. The first season at least had a book to work off, and fit well enough into a 13-episode season. After that, they just had no clue where to go from there and started cramming **TRANSITIONS** into everything for some reason.

Hey showrunners, not every scene has to transition like a one-take. It feels like showing off and loses effect."
The Sinner,"Eh, I kinda like all of them on their own. I like the overall mood of the show and it isn't great TV or anything but I enjoy every season as a standalone."
The Sinner,Don’t like it? Don’t watch it. It’s a fine show
The Sinner,"I love Pullman & the character Harry. After S1 they should have just gone procedural with it, if they wanted it so much. Make it like other countries do their mysteries: every 2 episodes is a mystery to be solved. And the season is 6-8 episodes. S3 sucked. Liked the characters, just could have been 2 maybe 3 episodes. Or have more of a mystery to it."
The Sinner,"I haven't seen it, but I know exactly what you mean."
The Sinner,or 20+ episodes in a season.
The Sinner,Twin Peaks soured me on the whole genre.
The Sinner,"I enjoyed season 3, very entertaining and Bill pullman is great as usual. Sue me."
The Sinner,Miniseries don't make money in this era of tv.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Have you tried Ghosts?
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Blockbuster is fucking horrible. I don't know how people like that show so much. What a depressing setting, a minimum wage job that the workers are stuck in and the owner is losing money and cant pay them, christ."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Good news! Taika's upcoming show, Time Bandits, should be right up your alley."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"If you missed it, you may like Man seeking woman.  Really creative and funny, got to finish the story arch too 

Santa Clarita diet is another one, but was abruptly cancelled.  Still worth a watch imo 

Our flag means death is really funny.

Lastly, resident alien and people of earth are really solid."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Miracle Workers

Reservation Dogs"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,If I never see another “workplace sitcom by way of fake documentary” formatted show it’ll be too soon. I know What We Do In The Shadows does the documentary angle too but at least it’s about the supernatural.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"So these shows aren't a new style, they are actually among the oldest style of sitcoms and comedy

Its called ""bickering roommates"".

There are MANY comedies that are this show style, and not all of them are sitcoms. For example, Archer is this style, in fact its a fantastic version of it, but not necessarily a sitcom. The Odd Couple to Schitt's Creek are also this style."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Forever on Amazon Prime was great, like Good Place, lasted only one season."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Sorry but I don't think The Good Place is categorize as a Sitcom at all. What We Do in The Shadow yes. I think a Sitcom can be called that when you can watch any episode and not be lost in the story beside part episodes
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Like Mork and Mindy?
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Have you seen the Mike Tyson mysteries on yourube?
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Wrecked:   

Survivors of a plane crash deal with crazy shit. It's funny, it doesn't rely on returning to status quo and it's not a family or workplace sitcom."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Just started this recently - love the idea. It's a lot of fun. Sounds like OP could use more Taika content tbh. The pirate show on HBO about the fancy pirate was really enjoyable, Reservation Dogs was great, etc.

Life and Times of Tim is animated but brilliant, too. Just gotta look a little deeper

edit: grammar"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"The UK one, not the US adaptation."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Do people like it? I’ve only heard negative reviews
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Who likes it? All I have seen are people hating it.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Superstore has a similar premise and is 100x better in every way.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Blockbuster would’ve been so much better if it was just set in the 90s and they went full in on the nostalgia. Having said that it’s still gotten nothing but terrible reviews whether it’s popular among viewers or not.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Really looking forward to Time Bandits.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Worker is literally in the title of Miracle Workers.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Are there going to be more Miracle Worker seasons?
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Wellington Paranormal was awesome too.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"The Good Place is also part of a newer trend of ""meta-sitcoms"" where part of the joke is that they are making fun of the structure itself. See also:30 Rock, Only Murders in the Building, Reboot, She-Hulk, Rick and Morty"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I thought it was pretty interesting. Didn't love it but I would have kept watching it to see where it went.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,[deleted]
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I love The Good Place, I'd disagree but to each their own. Every episode has numerous jokes, it's a serialized sitcom but it's absolutely a sitcom imo."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,No the US one is just as good
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I mean the climax of the season involves a solar flare wiping out all electrical appliances on the planet, necessitating Blockbuster again. One would get the impression what they were going for was a *Questionable Content*-type scenario — focusing on the exploits of the employees of one store, while world-changing events happen in the background."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I'm not sure that being angels in heaven or medieval shit shovelers counts as a workplace sitcom.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Season 4 is coming in January and is called End Times and is a take on Mad Max post apocalyptic style stories.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Don't forget Community, which intentionally ripped through a whole sitcoms worth of ""will they or won't they"" in a single season, among other deconstructions and regular genre parodies. Even the relatively normal pilot is kind of an episode about sitcom pilots."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Most of the Tina Fey-Carlock/verse is meta
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I don't really need A list stars to watch a show.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,They should’ve have just made it a period piece and set it in the 90s
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Was mostly a joke
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"wow thanks! I didn’t even know there was a season 3, there are only two seasons on HBO Go. cheers :)"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,We just watched Season 3 on HBO max so it is in the states at least.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Heh. Velma got cheated out of being with Shaggy yet again. At least she has Hot Dog Water.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I am one of the legion who perv on Velma (Nerd Girl Hot is just so strong), but we should give some love to Daphne, too.  Quick witted, good instincts, a solid member of the team.  One could argue that she is the glue that keeps them together and focused."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,This movie actually looks awesome
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,This was a great read.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Delta state was the shit!
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,It was on both actually
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Aho young warrior!
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I started calling people shit-ass because of this show. 

Aho young warrior."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Skoden!
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,[deleted]
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Stath Lets Flats for more Nadja lol

But yeah, I really liked the show. I didn't have Hulu for a long time but this was always on my list of stuff to watch when I got it... then they had the Black Friday sale for 12 months for $2 a month... so I just recently started watching."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I love it! Season 2 was my favourite season of TV from last year. Pretty much every episode had me on the verge of crying, and also laughing hard. Mabel and Offerings are two 10/10 episodes of tv. The show is constantly surprising and incredibly unique, such a great cast, and the characters are treated with an incredible amount of care. Can’t wait for season three!"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,It’s fantastic
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I'll have to give this show a look......I'm close to finishing up WWDITS right now and just watched Flight of the Conchords last month.  I seem to enjoy just about anything Taika Waititi is involved with.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,It’s such a great show! Season 2 blew me away every single episode. The episode where Willie Jack went to see Hokti especially tore my heart up in the best way!
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Season one, hunting episode - it has a flashback of the character who took his own life chatting to his uncle. There isn't a line that makes it explicit how unwell he is, but his sadness just radiates from the scene. I think think about it to this day. Special show."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,">I've been on a Taika binge (and anything including actors from WWDITS

But have you seen [**Stath Lets Flats**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GMVFbNKBM)? ;) It stars Natasia Demetriou (Nadja) alongside her brother (who is the main character, Stath), plus Al Roberts, who guest stars in an episode of WWDITS as Guillermo's boyfriend who is cloned and eventually falls in love with himself. Similar energy as Flight of the Conchords but with more unlikeable characters. Sort of like FOTC meets The Office."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Jojo Rabbit might be my favorite piece of media from Taika, immediately followed by Reservation Dogs."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Yes it's a great show can't wait for the next season.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,This is the most snubbed show I have ever seen in terms of awards. It has yet to win a single award for its second season
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,About time you shit ass
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I really tried to like this show, especially being such a big fan of Waititi's work. I'm not sure what I'm missing, since so much of it it ""should"" work. All the pieces are there for it to mean something, but I dunno. What is it you all get that makes it such a good show? Welcome any and all perspectives!"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"It's a great one. 

I found it incredibly accessible and emotional. Rooting for all of those kids. Such great characters. 

Personally, I didn't like the title. Thought it was a restaurant competition reality show when I first heard the name. But hey, what's a title?"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,At first I thought you spelled “Reservoir Dogs” wrong…
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"I enjoyed it, but I found it mid"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Why can’t you believe it?
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Thought this was the Tarantino movie Reservoir dogs, it made the text really confusing until understood id ""corrected"" the spelling to a whole other thing."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Anyone have similar shows to suggest?   Betty on HBO was somewhat similar (not as stellar though)
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"The episode where bear gets the construction job with the cranberry juice tik Tok guy made me bawl my eyes out.

Such a good show. Hilarious, heartfelt, unique, excellent music, Bobby Lee. It's got it all."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Happy to hear your review. I have very similar taste to you and have been keeping this one on hold for a rainy day.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"The guy that plays the spirit guide also has some skits on a YT channel.

https://youtu.be/xJ89HBfaLs4

Edit: Another one- https://youtu.be/wRc0aTK0YoY"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Shit ass.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,This guy had me in a laughing fit every time he was on screen. His comedic timing is something else.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Low key my fav character
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Studis!
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,I'd watch paint dry if Willie Jack did the commentary.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"Seriously. That episode with all the ""Aunties"" going to that convention. That's a show with like 5 seasons right there."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,Desperately need a Spirit Guide show that's him just bothering a new person every week for 30 minutes before they accidentally learn a lesson.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,">verge of crying

Cheese in the group home."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"> Can’t wait for season three!

I hope season 3 is just as good as the first two. The season 2 finale really felt like a great place to leave the show, entirely. I always worry when shows push past a great season finale."
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,It was bittersweet watching both the Reservation Dogs and TLOU finale back to back last night. Always a great feeling experiencing such great shows/movies but then you're left with waiting on more/knowing you can't watch it for the first time again.
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"When you finish res dogs, check out Our Flag Means Death!"
Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby,"On the other hand, we probably should also acknowledge that the co-creator and showrunner of *Reservation Dogs* is **Sterlin Harjo**, and that [he deserves the lions' share of the praise](https://variety.com/2023/tv/markets-festivals/reservation-dogs-sterlin-harjo-showrunner-award-scad-tvfest-1235500955/) here. While Waititi's name is undoubtedly what got FX to open up their checkbooks, and he co-created and works on the show, Harjo's the one guiding the ship: just look at [the writing and directing credits for the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_Dogs#Season_1_(2021))."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The David Chang food show, I think it's called Ugly Food is my favorite Netflix food show. I do agree, I think Netflix should try to take over the Food Network and HGTV market."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,All I want is more Cutthroat Kitchen.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,No need for that
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"i'd be interested as long as it's not an amateur cooking/""man on the street"" show starring an out of breath and cranky gordon ramsay.

GORDON RAMSAY: (*approaching shoppers outside a mall while in full chef outfit, with tongs and spatulas in hand*) ""I don't suppose any of you can COOK, can you?!"""
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Wouldn't you say PBS already did that with CREATE TV?
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Ugly Delicious. And yeah, it's a really good series."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,It's on Hulu.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"My family loves Cutthroat Klicken so much, it's absurd."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,\*clicks tongs three times\*
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I have no idea what that is
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,It’s been canceled :(
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"It's an off shoot of PBS it's a nationwide (as far as I know) channel for do it yourself home improvement,travel and cooking shows and over all IMO it's incredible."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,This doesn’t talk about Galadriel’s family at all.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,It's about time I reread the books again.  I had totally forgotten that Galadriel was Elrond's mother-in-law.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,That scene with Adar was the highlight of the episode.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,NAMPAT
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I'm enjoying this show, but out of all the characters I find Galadriel to be one of the least interesting. Let me say beforehand that I'm not well-versed in Tolkien lore, so I'm not sure if the character is accurate to Tolkien's books.

I don't dislike her, I just find Galadriel to be extremely one-note so far. Other characters like Elrond, Durin, Arondir, and even Adar have much more depth to them, but Galadriel takes up a majority of the screen time. It is unfortunate, because I do think Morfydd Clark is a great actress. She's brilliant in the film Saint Maud."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I thought it was going to talk about Galadriel's actual family - you know: her husband Celeborn who she married in the first age, and her daughter Celebrian who was born early in the second age.

Both her marriage to Celeborn and Celebrian's birth should have happened already in the canon, but apparently the show's pretending they never existed so she can have some sweet tension with totally-not-Sauron."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I almost feel bad for Amazon the way even fans talk about this show. Then I realize how much writing and directing and acting talent is out there and am wondering who they are letting make these decisions. If you only play with rich people, and are willing to pay top dollar, at least let someone like Megan Ellison into the game and produce a few good projects."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Don’t get the hate for the show. Been a fan of the books and movies for 30+ years.   It looks wonderful, the way the dialogue is spoken and the ethereal-looking shots are right out of the books/movies, the music is well edited but not too overbearing and nearly all the plots/characters are interesting.  Sure it’s not perfect but it’s a far cry from Wheel of Time’s issues.  I’m thoroughly enjoying it."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Feel like the criticism of her has been pretty unfair, I think she's done a really good job so far. 

What hasn't helped the show is some of the decision making with the writing and the execution. Like that shot of Galadriel riding the horse a few episodes back. All that's going to do is invite ridicule onto the actress, who people have already decided they don't like."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"This article title means nothing to those of us, who don't follow celebrities."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I stopped watching. This is dreadful television.  A real dishonour to the books.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,That twitch her character does whenever she’s mad is so annoying to watch
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,My gf hates this show and she knows nothing about LOTR. She said all the characters are dumb and make dumb decisions and say dumb things. She also said it is so slow and boring. Lol I agree with her and also think the show is TROPEY AS FUCK…
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,She supposed to be way taller AND have insane magic already.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I really wish the actress could show more than three emotions. The performance is definitely a step down from Cate Blanchett’s
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,These puff pieces are more entertaining than the actual show….which is sad.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,One of the dumbest episodes of television I’ve seen. Tolkien would be ashamed at how stupid that show is.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,RoP is a disgrace to Tolkien's lore. Fuck Amazon.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"This actor actively makes me hate Galadriel, she just doesn't embody the character at all. The piss-poor writing isn't exactly helping either."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,The move she pulled on the horse while in battle in episode 6 has to be some of the corniest shit ever seen in these types of shows. Like audibly groaned at how bad. Just horrendous. Shes the worst part of the show imo
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"My only problem with this show so far is that weird Galadriel/Horse on the beach scene. 

Very cringe."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I've been enjoying this show a lot! The first two episodes felt like a slog, but it really picked up steam after that.

It might not be on the same level as HOTD writing-wise, but it's cozy and familiar and 100% worth the watch if you're a fan of fantasy stuff."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Guydriel
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Very satisfying episode. I am invested in the trajectory being mapped out for Galadriel’s character. Many are failing to recognize the merits of it but its so clear to me. I find paranoia, austerity and darkness in a heroine so refreshing while also appreciating the layers of vulnerability under the front that she puts up. The confrontation with Adar allowed the enemy to exploit her weakness and left her reeling. She will be on a path to start healing but not before hitting rock bottom."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"her performance is definitely the highlight of the show, the character is a bit...one note so far...but her performance none the less is quiet enjoyable as a parable about a woman driven to blindness by her desire for revenge.

The hateboner around this property is deeply insufferable. It's fuckin everything now. Nothing can be enjoyed, it has to be a blasphemous desecration of all things that are good in this world.

Did it ever fuckin once dawn on Lord of the Rings fans that this show ONLY got made because they changed it and would NOT have been made if it were word for word from the text?

Wanna know why the only good Lord of the Rings adapted content since 1954 has been 1 trilogy 1 time?"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Reddit has stomached so many forgettable milquetoast by the books obsessed with vengeance male leads over the years but when it’s a woman people lose their damn minds lol



there’s problems with the show but none of it has to do with her acting or black elves or whatever you wanna cry about"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Her and Bronwyn are both so outrageously attractive
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,🤢🤢🤢
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Every time I see Adar on screen, I'm for some reason reminded of Matt Mercer from Critical Role."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,The CGI alone makes this worth watching..I’m enjoying it!
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"""It was really exciting for me...there are lots of like little nuggets of lore in that as well, kind of to her family and like the damage that they did""

I think they mean her kin."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"It's talking about the Noldor, which where quite a powerful and prideful clan among the elves. Think of it like the Uchiha or Senju in Naruto."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Apparently so did the show
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,He admit it!!! This car is everything!!!
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Joseph Mawle is fantastic. His performance in ‘Birdsong’ gutted me, and I was so glad to see him cast as Adar."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"When he says..

""Perhaps, your search for Morgoths successor should end in your own mirror"" was top notch.

Adar is the character that made this season."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,He’s the best LOTR character added since the original trilogy
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Highlight of the whole series thus far.  That plus that amazing and ending I never saw coming.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Adar actor is one of few good actors in the show
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,[deleted]
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"They missed a great opportunity… they should have had that “old guy” try and mimic them chanting nervously, “N-nam - - -p-pat” and then looking around and then eventually gaining confidence as he chants in unison"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I might be more forgiving but I feel that she's being set up to change a lot over the show. Right now I see her as, ""my work is my life, everything is black and white"" type of personality. And this showdown with Adar is the beginning of some bitter lessons. At least, that's what I hope is the plan for her character."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I think at this point Galadriel is at her darkest and most vengeful and Sauron is at his lightest and most repentant after Morgoth's defeat. I think they will reverse courses over this season and next as her arrogance and naivety give way as Sauron takes hold and her word means little about it due to her over zealous past.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Her motivations are quite lore accurate, but her portrayal has none of the wisdom she should have. She acts like a petulant teenager, and the other elves treat her like one, which feels very off because she is literally an elder relation to king Gil-galad.

But the way she is sure about Sauron still being out there is true to lore, she was the first to feel his presence in the east, and she moved there and founded Eregion and started diplomacy with the dwarves specifically to combat the threat of his return. Weird that she looks down on Elrond for being a politician, when that was her role at the time. 

Galadriel was prideful, refusing the pardon of the Valar because she felt she did nothing wrong. She remained in Middle Earth because she had the desire to rule over her own lands and teach people her knowledge. Much of her family was killed by Morgoth and Sauron, knowing that he is out there absolutely motivates her with revenge and the desire to prevent Sauron rising again. People think of the elves as being nothing but kind, wise, measured beings without flaw. But the Noldor were egotistical bastards who felt they could do the impossible, even against the advice of the Valar.

She was one of the only elves to be suspicious of and reject Sauron when he arrived in disguise to forge the rings. Presumably the show will give us that and it'll be a 'boy who cried wolf' situation because everyone is so sick of hearing Galadriel going on about Sauron the past thousand years. I also guess that Sauron will claim the rings are what will keep the decaying disease at bay and save the elves."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,This show is very far from true to Tolkien.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"All the other Elves have had long interactions with mortals (or, in Adar's case, unimaginably tortured) that cause pretty big shifts in perspective for them. 

Galadriel has spent her time pretty exclusively with other Elves so far."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Elves are, by and large, intended to be one-note characters."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The only character I find ""interesting"" is adar, I enjoy the dynamic between durin and elrond, but everybody is kinda bland"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"It‘s obvious that she is not married. She referred to Elrond as her best friend - not son-in-law - and did not bid farewell to anyone before departing to Valinor. As it stands, neither Celeborn nor Celebrian add value to the current story with their presence. Even in LotR, Celeborn stood around with a poker face doing nothing. Screen time is precious and shouldn’t be wasted on characters with no presence or impact.

You are choosing to undermine the impact of Galadriel’s family on the war and give more weight to marriage and motherhood? Lol"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I guess the writers read your comment lol
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,a billion dollars and they couldn't hire competent writers?
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"And picking such SHORT actresses/actors for the Elves? I don't even...

They could at least do some camera trickery like Peter Jackson did."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,most fans I know (myself included) are loving the show.  Just some shit pieces like this getting upvoted by haters online.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I am absolutely on board with Arondir's character.   Cordova's contemplative gazes and slow stately manner of speech are everything I pictured of elves from the lore.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Same. I fucking love it. It started off very slow hit last few episodes were fucking amazing. I love the Mount Doom origin story that they have done. I hope that is it:
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I agree with everything you've said, I've read/watched the series for almost 25 years and I like RoP much better than the Hobbit movies. 

The writing, especially the dialogue has been one of the biggest weaknesses. However, it doesn't kill the show for me and overall I enjoy it a lot."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The way the dialogue is spoken sure, but the dialogue itself is so blah. I found myself bored multiple times watching it. They just need better writers. The overall plot seems good, but the details are frequently uninteresting (in my opinion). 

Your wheel of time comment is interesting. I found that more enjoyable overall (except for perhaps the last episode, that wasn’t good)."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"What exactly do you find interesting about the plots/characters?

I would agree about almost everything being a step up from Wheel of Time EXCEPT plot/characters. 

(Spoiler)Too often I find myself mentally rolling my eyes while watching this show. I am 1 episode behind I believe but when Bronwyn moved up to that high location and gave that heroic speech to those ragtag bunch of villagers I had acute Wheel of Time flashbacks.

So now she’s a leader and she’s going up to that high spot with Arondir behind her like he’s her vice president. And she’s making an incoherent speech addressing a bunch of farmers, many being women and children, urging them to stand and fight.She says this while they don’t know the enemy at all, not how many of them there are, not where they are, not what their goals are. Nothing. 

Also why would they fight? Didn’t they leave their farms to escape the orcs in the first place? What changed when they reached the tower? More of the same ragtag bunch of farmers joined in so now is the time to take a stand? 

It’s just so painfully amateurish and cliche."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I think it’s the arrogance of the showrunners that set hardcore fans off. A lot of the early interviews painted this “we know better than Tolkien/this is what he would have written had he lived in modern times,” which is straight BS. Combine that with the supremely weird way Amazon has been trying to market the series for over a year ie thosw god awful “super fans” videos featuring people who knew just absolute dick about Tolkien and so far haven’t even bothered to talk about the show on their own channels etc, and you get an enraged fanbase. 

People have a lot of passion for Tolkien’s work, so I can understand why they’ve taken a lot of what’s been done as offensive. That’s on Amazon, frankly.  They knew what they were doing and ran with it. I know people want to scream “racism” etc but the same early complaints were made about House of the Dragon, but were quickly silenced when that series turned out to be GOOD. Suffice it to say that hasn’t been the same reaction for Rings of Power, which has lead me to conclude that lack of quality/respect for the material is the issue and not the other nonsense thrown about. YMMV."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I started watching it yesterday and I loved it! I really don’t get the hate for the show. I was hooked from the beginning. I tried watching wheel of time afterwards and I found myself spending more time playing on my phone.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,It looks good but it’s boring. While some of them actors and actresses are good too many have no charisma especially the one playing Galadriel. Everything we have seen could have been condensed down into less episodes.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"It looks incredible, yes the actors speak with nice accents, the problem is the writing is garbage. The y don’t take the time to make you care about anything or anyone in the show. They have done such a bad job that I care more about the orcs who have gotten character development and clear goals in the show."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Some people look for reasons to be mad.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I'm trying to like the show, but it just doesn't feel like middle earth to me.  Someone said Amazon was originally trying to make a Dragon Age adaptation and taped LotR onto it when they got the rights.  It definitely feels more like Dragon Age than LotR."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"my only issue is with the casting of Numenors queen regent. her acting i just can't get on, plus her eyes instead of add to the character just don't work for me kinda like the opposite of how Samuel L Jackson eyes kinda adds to his acting for villainous characters."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The writing is cringe all the way through, visually very bland, just a low effort paint by numbers show in general"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I dont think even the most ardent of fans would have wanted this as this story in an ideal world.

Having said that there is some stuff to like, but I feel there is also a good number of things to dislike, but chiefly for me it is the fact it feel so small scale. We are supossed to believe that the world is full of such wonder, but everuthing is close up shots in a room. Numenor was a handful of sets they keep reusing, Khazad Dum mainly been one or two rooms, Lindon has been one set, Eregion has been one room, the ""southlands"" was one village. It doesnt feel real like the PJ movies. It feels like its one big house and each small room is a different location and they can just skip to and fro. It doesnt feel big budget at all in that sense.

Unfortunately it is made by amateurs and you can tell. It doesnt feel special, it feels like a generic fantasy show with the LOTR IP and some easter eggs for fans.

I dont even hate it or dislike it, im just disappointed that was this was the sum of all that money and my excitement since the day it was announced.

It could have been so much better! It could have been more interesting and more exciting. Its Lord of the Rings it deserves the best and this is not. It's 6/10 tick box blandness with no soul."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The dialogue is terrible, it’s written by people who are trying so hard to sound intelligent and poetic it’s embarrassing.  And how can ethereal shots be straight out of the books..?"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Hard disagree. The dialogue is utter drivel and the characters only exist to move the nonsensical plot along.  Sure it looks pretty but only the vista shots. The sets and costumes are embarrassingly bad for a show of this budget. And given how amazing Bear McCreary is, the soundtrack is very disappointing."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"The show is excellent, especially for those of us who read the silmarillion. It's been a pretty common thing that the people bitching the most either didn't read the books or just don't remember them. Like the people above bitching about the armor not being plate armor, even tho Tolkien never mentions plate and only mentions mail and scale armor. Like I'm fine with the show having some plate here and there but to act like it's such a big deal because not everyone is wearing plate so therefore it's ignoring the books is so absurd."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,They were told to not like it and so they do not.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"> Don’t get the hate for the show. 

Bigotry. Every excuse these people make up to justify their hate is a lie. They hate black people. They hate women. That's the answer."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Good lord... It's one thing to enjoy it regardless of it's issues. But to not understand the hate, holy.  That's something special...

Let me guess, you totally think the shows explanation of displacement was amazing, right???"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Unfortunately people don't see the writers, they see her doing what the writers and directors are telling her to do, so most criticism will be directed towards her"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"She is a good actress, as seen in St Maud. The writers just made shitty dialogues and situation. Having House of Dragon in the same time doesnt help either."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"that scene was like two seconds long, can't believe people are still talking about it like it ruined the entire series."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,People didn’t like the horse shot? I thought it was stunning! Was I high when I watched it? Absolutely. But it was incredibly well shot and showed her character genuinely happy for the first time ever
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I mean they have her playing an angsty teen which she's doing great at. She should be a revered badass though.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Yeah it sucks that Galadriel was happy.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,[deleted]
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I thought so too at first but then realized elves are supposed to be the most stoic creature alive, so what we’re seeing in a twitch is her uncontrolled rage being held in check, barely breaking through .  It was like when Legolas got “drunk” and felt a little tingle in his finger."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Thanks for your input
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"I totally get the criticisms, but people forget that Tolkien in general is tropey as fuck."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Elves have more than 3 emotions in other LotR films? They haven’t been depicted as particularly expressive thus far. I think her performance is on par with any others playing elves in this.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Sorry, hard disagree. I think Morfydd Clark is killing it."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,I just watched the trilogy again. Al she does is smile knowingly while asmr’ing the characters. All this “character assassination” of big G claims are just hilarious.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Ok am I taking crazy pills here? People keep talking about Cate Blanchett, but I remember her make exactly 2 faces the entire trilogy.

1) The near permanent slightly bemused face which could be mistaken for a mask

2) Her freakout moment when she imagines a world where she takes the One Ring.

I really didn't see a whole lot there from Cate Blanchett, and honestly it was kind of wooden."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"To be fair, I am not sure if we have any actresses that could match Blanchett's performance these days."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Really recommend her Mekong River mini series.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Why did the original hosts leave the show ?
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"The hosts said that they quit, because they felt that the producers were starting to create a more intrusive and crueler show toward the contestants."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"If The Sun say it, it's probably closer to the opposite."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Fucking hell mate, you don't half post a lot of anti-women shit to some weird looking subreddits don't you?"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,#RAG
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Yeah, when I did a news search only the Sun and the Daily Mail had headlines like this. There were also stories about Piers Morgan's response to it. Who the fuck cares what Piers Morgan thinks?!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,*anti-sexism shit
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"People my age need to know how chill TAGS is. It's one of the coziest shows you could watch, but enough stakes to keep you engaged."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,It's funny how Barney can carry a tune when the script allows it.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,And that jailbird guitar picker grew up to be Rosco P. Coltrane.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Man, James Best was sexy!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"It is only now that I realize one or more generations may not have grown up on those reruns!

I think I need to sit down."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Yes, and I love how happy and relaxed Andy was in the black & white seasons."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,It’s a shame they did not have Andy do a guest on Dukes of Hazard and do a new version with the Sheriff.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Geeooot geeooot geeoooot
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,The seasons after Barney leaves just aren’t the same at all
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,[deleted]
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I understand what they were going for in the finale but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. >!Emily didn't have a single scene with Sue or anyone with her family outside of Lavinia. And they never showed what happened to the military dude. It just didn't feel like anything was resolved to a satisfying conclusion. If anything, episode 9 worked better as a series finale imo.!< Regardless, it was still a great show and Hailee Steinfeld absolutely killed it, along with the rest of the cast."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Didnt feel like a shows finale at all, its kinda weird like that."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Was there a third season of this?  I thought I finished the second but that was months ago
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"That’s how I feel too. It was an ok ending, just wasn’t a satisfying one for me."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Yes, the third season is the final season. The last episode of the third season came out today. Give it a watch if you enjoyed the first two seasons."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Yeah for sure. I think it would have worked better if >!Emily had come down to talk to her family at least once and then have Sue with her at the beach.!< I know they wanted to show Emily realizing she could be hopeful again or whatever cuz Hailee said as much in interviews but I think they could have executed it a little better.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Weird I had appletv for the past few months and it seemed to have no advertisement for it .
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"It didnt feel like a show finale at all, more like some mid season episode."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,That’s Apple TV for you. They barely promote their hits.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,The mouse got to Hahn… She Agatha now
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I figured after the success of Hacks which is kind of a fictional version of this, this project became less interesting."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Sarah Silverman sends her jewgards
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I liked Joan in her stand-up days and I have a bit of a crush on Kathryn Hahn, so I'd have watched.  Oh well."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I read this wrong. Was trying to figure how Joan Rivers was making a TV show with Kathryn Hahn despite the rigor mortis.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Dang I was hoping for a Joan rivers cinematic universe where it could cross over with marvelous mrs maisel
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I hate this modern trend of announcing shows before even a pilot is shot. Just tell us when  a show is greenlit and when it is going to air. Then you can do a deep dive into the storyline and who is going to play whom. Otherwise, it's always a deep disappointment to hear potential shows with potential actors that inevitably fall through the cracks. 

I am still waiting for CW's take on The Lost Boys. And it has been what? Two or three years since they've announced it. They keep on dangling that show."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Is jewface a thing? 

please dont tell me you can veto a casting decision based on religion now..."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"""Because of issues around the life rights of Joan Rivers, a limited series in which Kathryn Hahn would have played the legendary comedian isn’t moving forward."""
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,She was Agatha all along.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Out of curiosity, did Joan Rivers have a go-to writer like Jean’s character in Hacks? I understand it’s not a direct correlation, but I don’t know much about the history of Rivers."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I think Mrs. Maisel is closer to a fictional version of Joan Rivers. Also it's really good.

Edit: realized that it might sound like I'm saying Hacks wasn't good. It was fantastic."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Seriously.. her comment smacks of privilege.. ""its ok for us to play caucasian people who are not jewish but the opposite is a racism."""
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Did she send it while in blackface?
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,You win the thread.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Oh thank Hahn, I thought it was just me"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"It's not a modern trend, this stuff was always announced in industry trades and Variety is one of those. There's tons of people who work on this stuff and it would get leaked anyway. It's not even really ""announced"", the trades usually find out from someone involved that it's happening and that's how it winds up being reported. Often it's even done to influence the deals being made."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,The have dropped The Lost Boys. Project is dead at the CW. They did announce it is going back into development at Warner Bros as a reboot movie.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"In other words ""The estate already told us no when we asked for the life rights, but we went ahead anyways and assumed they'd cave after we sold it to a network."""
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,You'd think making sure you actually had the rights to the thing you were making would be like the first step you would take on something like this.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,So why are there life rights to a public person whose life is already public knowledge?
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I'd heard that Joan Rivers had filing cabinets full of 3x5 cards with jokes written on each, sorted by subject, and that she wrote the jokes."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Fully agree, a couple years ago I heard snippets of early Joan Rivers stand-up from the 60s on some public radio station, the resemblance to Mrs Maisel was uncanny.  Well beyond the two just being Jewish New York women from that era whose acts were pretty blue for the time."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"That wasn't it at all. Being white is not a culture, being Jewish is. And Sarah was commenting on specific cases in which a character or real life figure's Judaism is crucial to their identity in the role, and how often those roles are given to actors without a Jewish background."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Click the link and look at that picture of her on the left and tell me she isn't Hot Stuff.  Damn, girl!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"What I mean, there's a modern trend for informing people *outside* the industry to know these things. People like you and me who have no connection with the Hollywood machine except for we're the audience. 

I really wish they would keep these things more hush hush. But then again, I have no one to blame but myself for coming to subreddits like /r/television and /r/movies. No one is forcing me here. But, dang it, I hate to hear such and such show/movie may happen with such and such showrunner/director and there are such and such rumors that this actor may be in it. I always get excited only to hear a moment later that the project fell through."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Well, darn. 

I wish we could have at least seen the pilot. I wonder how bad it was."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,You don’t know Hollywood.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"You can see the filing cabinets in the documentary she did. She even pulls a couple of joke cards from the cabinet and reads them to demonstrate.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568150/"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Kathryn Hahn and Rebecca Ferguson
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Yeah, this sounds like a you problem."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Alright, but you gotta get over it."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I think they actually had two pilots made and both were not well received by the network. If not two pilots then they definitely had two completely different scrips made up. They did toy with trying to make a third go with the show before just kicking it back to Warner Bros. Sounds like this was straight up development hell!
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Such an insightful documentary. I need to give it another watch.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"If they had two pilots, now I really wanted to see it. Was it too scary? Too cheesy? Just plain old awful?"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I’ve no idea! Pity we did not get the sort of leaks from The Lost Boys that we got from that failed Powerpuff Girls pilot where the whole script got leaked! All we know is the network did not like what they seen and kicked the project back to development both times.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Karen Gillan and Emily Kapnek worked together previously on Selfie (My Fair Lady/Pygmalion adaptation): /r/SelfieTV

Emily Kapnek is also known for creating As Told by Ginger and Suburgatory.

Karen sang a [fantastic rendition of Chandelier](https://youtu.be/AN2ntx4kPO4) and people have wanted to hear more of her singing since then. Also, teaming up with Danny Elfman is great since he has done many amazing scores for movies/TV like Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman, The Simpsons, Men in Black, etc."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"In a van, I presume"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"I am excited for anything Danny Elfman.

But on a side note, is every show being announced now through Disney? I must just have selective reading"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Does she live in a van??
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I love Emily Kapnek - excited for this
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,So why has Selfie been deleted from the internet. I remember watching the show as it aired. Remembered it last year and you cannot buy it anywhere.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"You just have selective reading, in this sub right now there's announcements for Netflix and Paramount+ shows. Disney just seems to announce like all of its new content at once."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Warner Brothers holds the rights, but not sure why they are still sitting on it and not on HBO Max. I'm thinking it's because of the music licensing fees. They might have to change it if they do release it (Dunno how Hulu was able to do it before). 

You can [view this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfieTV/comments/pqvlio/comment/hdt89z3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in the Selfie subreddit on where to watch."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Hopefully with this show releasing and Netflix's cowboy bebop adaptation they revive Selfie to a streaming service
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Part of a leaked script from first episode: 

>Frost: What made you want to be a policeman?

>Pegg: Officer-

>Frost: What made you want to be a policeman-officer?"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,So Hot Fuzz meets Harry Potter? I'm in.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"WOOT!!!! OMG, I've been waiting for announcements on the *Rivers of London* TV adaptation of Ben Aaronovitch's series of books for YEARS!! (It's been in development hell for a while). And that it's Pegg & Frost is just perfect. Yes!!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Edgar Wright needed.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Really fun books. Not as flashy as some other series and the procedural angle (with a relatively short season) would work well. I'm into it, but a lot of it is going to come down to casting the leads (obviously) and not toning down (or playing up) the diversity"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Oh this is really exciting news. This is my favourite series of books. I just hope they cast 'The Rivers' well. And I'd love to see Bill Nighy as Nightingale.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"This book series is excellent; One part police procedural, one part contemporary fantasy, all pulling inspiration from the history of London. I highly recommend checking out the books on Audible as the reader, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith nails the characters, tone and flavour flawlessly."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Please let’s have Kobna-Holdbrook Smith as a cameo.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,They kinda need edgar Wright though...
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Urban FANTASY, mystery thriller *AND* FANTASY??? Holy shit!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Aaand I'm sold.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I'm so excited for this! I hope the project gets moving & I can't wait to see who they might cast.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Fucking sweet! I love those books, I can't wait to see the show!"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,HO SHIT
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Love these books!
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I'm super fucking into this. It's about time they had a new project.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,And here I am just wanting more Spaced.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Yeah ok I'm sold, get Edgar in and this is perfect."
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Any chance of Edgar Wright being involved?
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"Oh shit, that's awesome. I just started reading this series and I really like it. Curious about how they plan to handle some of the... effects, though. Also, obviously neither one of them can play Peter, so I wonder who they've got in mind for what role?"
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I'll watch anything starring these two. I hope they can get Edgar Wright to guest direct an episode.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Well isn't that just a slice of fried gold!
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I will watch anything they make.
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Shut up and take my money.jpg
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,"No need to say anymore, I was hooked at ""Simon Pegg & Nick Frost"""
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,I'm about thirty pages from the end of the first book and I am very into this news. Neat!
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,AW YISS!
The Mekong River with Sue Perkins,Sounds crazy enough.
Alias Grace,i translated subtitles for this series to my language back then. it was a good experience. enjoyed it much but finale not that good. such weird ending for a beautiful series.
Alias Grace,Might want to mention the showrunner was [Sarah Polley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0295264/).
Alias Grace,"Not watching a damn thing by that terfstain.

EDIT: The scorn of Potter fans and TERFs nourishes me. It wasn't even a good series, guys. Rowling's a hack. Grow up, read Pratchett, conversation closed."
Alias Grace,"Last episode sank the series for me, loved the start though."
Alias Grace,May I ask what you're talkin' about exactly? Who's a terfstain?
Alias Grace,"Margaret Atwood posted a link to an op-ed that *some* believe to be transphobic. (The initial op-ed was arguing against the growing trend in healthcare to replace words like ""women"" with phrases like ""people who are pregnant."")

She hasn't said anything actively transphobic, has spent a long career supporting LGBTQ rights, and has bluntly stated that she believes gender is a spectrum and that people can identify as whatever gender they choose. 

But somehow, you can't mention her name now without a rabid minority comparing her to JK Rowling?

I've read all the original social media from the controversy and several articles on the topic, and I still don't get it..."
Alias Grace,"Those people are insane, it's a waste of time trying to find reason in their actuons."
Alias Grace,"Having an opinion now gets you canceled. Sounds like she was never dehumanizing anyone, rather she was standing up for an experience only a biologically born woman can have & to have to validate men wanting to be women over women themselves is dehumanizing to her own sex. So I stand with her opinion too."
Alias Grace,"End of the F\*\*\*ing World is a UK channel 4 show, so maybe that's why. It came out in on Channel 4 and Channel 4's streaming service months earlier than Netflix. I think Netflix co-produced it though, so it's on Netflix in USA too cos you guys don't have the channel. But Netflix do brand things as Netflix originals even when they're not original.

Like here things like Better Call Saul and all their anime are Netflix originals."
Alias Grace,"There's a part of me that would argue *Alias Grace* was better than *Handmaid's Tale*. Especially looking at season 2. It was kind of niche show for a niche audience and I think Netflix knows that. *Ozark* wants to be the next *Breaking Bad* and Westerns are hot so it's not surprising *Godless* is being touted. 

PS - If you haven't watched *Alias Grace* go do so. It's so fucking good."
Alias Grace,Mindhunter was the best show of the ones I've seen. I couldn't even sit through Ozark. 
Alias Grace,"Pretty poor headline, why not mention Dear White People or American Vandal, both mentioned as the main examples in the article, and both actual Netflix originals that were really well received? Neither Alias Grace nor End of the Fucking World were fully Netflix-created shows, but co-produced with other networks and regionally distributed."
Alias Grace,"Oh dear, I think dear white people is one of their best shows and has a few chances at some awards.

That being said, I'd it doesn't have buzz, they can't really create it can they. All they can do is remind us of the hype. It's why shows like game of thrones keep winning and so many shows get snubbed."
Alias Grace,"Interesting dynamic:

>Many believe the Emmys are an opportunity for networks to shine a light on critically hailed series with low ratings; it elevates series above the back by associating its title with the prestige of an awards show. So why prioritize a perceived hit over series with better reviews?  
>  
>“Because you want to be in the ongoing conversation,” Taylor said. “It’s great to push the underdog here, but it’s really hard to get in, so my guess is that their calculation is, ‘Let’s go with our strength.'”

Also the next bit:

>Yet there’s a nagging similarity between the well-reviewed comedies given less FYC support: Their two top-reviewed series — “Dear White People” and “One Day at a Time” — feature minorities in lead roles and throughout the cast. Plus, “She’s Gotta Have It” earned far better reviews than “Ozark” and “13 Reasons Why” and did not receive comparable FYC support.  
>  
>To that end, “Dear White People” snagged two ads, an FYC event, and a panel at the Paley Center during voting. “One Day at a Time” got four ads and one FYC event. That’s not bad, but there are caveats: one of the two “Dear White People” ads ran with only five days left in voting, neither ran in Variety (only THR), and half of the “One Day at a Time” ads were only pushing Rita Moreno for Supporting Actress. (“Dear White People” [did get a billboard](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkYmKy_BKEu/?hl=en&taken-by=loganlaurice), though — and it was up for at least three days during voting.)  
>  
>“I think it’s tougher for a Hispanic show to break through,” Taylor said, adding that the #OscarsSoWhite campaign didn’t really translate to Emmy voters, who already feel like they nominate a [more diverse lineup](https://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/emmys-diverse-nominees-2017-1201854614/) than their film brethren."
Alias Grace,"I really don't like this wierd trend of counting scores and aggregates as a way to determine enjoyment or meaning from creative work. I know it makes it easy for those who frequent reddit to hop on bandwagons or those less educated in TV production who can't really articulate how they perceive quality but it is and always will be more complicated than just counting scores. Also, the emmys are meaningless. "
Alias Grace,The Emmys are even more meaningless than the Oscars.
Alias Grace,Ozark was pretty amazing though so glad they're backing it.
Alias Grace,Ozark is overrated. Problem was they were overrated themselves.
Alias Grace,"Thanks, Netflix. Now, I’ll never see End of the F***ing World get their well-deserved Emmy. "
Alias Grace,Alias Grace felt like a movie stretched out for TV. 
Alias Grace,"Well that explains it. I did wonder why a snoozefest like Godless was getting pushed so hard. And Ozark - I legitimately cannot think of it as anything other than a half-assed attempt to re-engineer Breaking Bad, right down to ""comedy guy goes super dark""."
Alias Grace,"Those other shows may have high ratings from viewers, but they're not necessarily good, whereas Ozark, Godless and Glow are each great shows.
Popular acclaim vs. critical acclaim"
Alias Grace,Netflix doesn’t have any good shows at this point. It’s basically premium Lifetime.
Alias Grace,"What is the significance of that?

Are ""show reviews"" part of the criteria to get nominated for an Emmy? Possibly selected reviewers?"
Alias Grace,Good colonisers should not get no award. 
Alias Grace,Alias Grace is also a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) show that Netflix picked up internationally. I don’t think Netflix is going to push shows they didn’t make for Emmys.
Alias Grace,The scene with Grace and the black veil in the finale (trying to be vague to avoid spoilers) was amazing. Sarah Gadon's acting was phenomenal in that scene.
Alias Grace,I didn’t want it to end
Alias Grace,I would argue that any day of the week. *Alias Grace* was 100x better. It was one of the very few best series of 2017 IMO. It's fantastic.
Alias Grace,Haven't watched it because I didn't know it was adapted but also read the book by Margaret Atwood!
Alias Grace,"Alias Grace is the best thing I saw on Netflix last year. Better than Mindhunters, Bojack, etc. and those had great seasons. "
Alias Grace,Godless is pretty awesome.
Alias Grace,"I didn't think it was better, but it definitely scratched the itch. Agreed on recommendation. Go watch it people!"
Alias Grace,Apparently it was made by CBC. 
Alias Grace,"It was certainly a haunting show, but I thought its conclusion didn't quite land (at least what I thought it was trying to say). The plot reminded me of the movie Primal Fear."
Alias Grace,Season 2 of Handmaid’s Tale is so annoying. They just keep repeating the same things over and over and over 
Alias Grace,"ozark surprisedd me with how great it was.

i like mindhunter more for the subject matter, as it interests me more. but ozark i think could possibly be better. unsure."
Alias Grace,Sort of the opposite for me. The first episode of Mindhunter was a snooze fest for me but Ozark had me hooked from start to finish
Alias Grace,"Love Jason Bateman, thought Ozark was so boring"
Alias Grace,Ozark is poor man’s Breaking Bad. Once you make peace with that its a good enough binge. 
Alias Grace,All of Ozark was just shot and edited like an antidepressant commercial. It’s Missouri in the summer. Why does everything look bluer and grayer than the town in Twilight?
Alias Grace,"My issue with Mindhunter is that it has a great premise, but spins the wheels Bloodline-style, especially in the middle chunk.

Like, the parts where they're talking to real-life serial killers were fascinating. But it gets bogged down in the practical application of catching fictional killers using those techniques. Even if it makes sense, those episodes feel disconnected from the real drive of the story and are much less interesting.

And SO MUCH time is dedicated to the Ford/Debbie subplot, possibly the most boring and annoying romantic storyline I've seen since James Hurley and Evelyn Marsh.

Not to mention that it takes literally 10 episodes for Ford to achieve any development, and it only comes in the last 2 minutes.

""Holden you've gone too far this time""  
""Lol""  
""Okay but if you fuck up once more you're off the case""

\> proceeds to fumble almost every case for the rest of the series"
Alias Grace,That's too bad. Ozark was the bees knees.
Alias Grace,"I was surprised when they made a television series to begin with, the movie wasn't exactly some huge hit and I don't think the Netflix show is all that popular, hell they barely push it in their app from what I've seen."
Alias Grace,To be honest I think it’s better than counting views
Alias Grace,"Maybe to fans but it's important to industry people, otherwise they wouldn't show up to the award show."
Alias Grace,you don't understand how the industry works.
Alias Grace,Yet we *love* to talk about them. Every time a new star-studded miniseries is announced half the discussion here is about how man Emmys it'll get.
Alias Grace,"So still pretty meaningful then? Even if you don't think it's representative of the ""best"" show (hint: quality is subjective and you'll rarely agree with all the winners, it's simply the results of a poll from a number of critics/artists, not an objective ranking), it's incredibly important for the future prospects, direction and success of the shows, networks and cast & crew involved. "
Alias Grace,There was a time when The Big Bang Theory used to be a regular at the Emmy's
Alias Grace,"Michael McKean was snubbed last year after an insanely good performance in Better Call Saul, fuck the Emmys forever."
Alias Grace,"Apparently it's criminally underrated, then."
Alias Grace,"Ozark is good, but it's just uninteresting because it's such a basic concept. "
Alias Grace,don't see how it's overrated when nobody talks about it.
Alias Grace,it's not a netflix show. it's a show that jut airs on netflix in usa.
Alias Grace,"You did get to see the show, though."
Alias Grace,"It was nominated for a BAFTA in the Drama category, if that scratches your awards show itch. (Lost to Peaky Blinders.)"
Alias Grace,Isn’t this the opposite sentiment of what the article says? It’s saying the show’s not being promoted have more critical acclaim than the “great” shows you mentioned.
Alias Grace,The article is saying Netflix isn't pushing its best shows which night have a better chance to win
Alias Grace,"ok yeah sounds like this is the case.

i wish netflix would re-brand these things as netflix exclusives rather than originals.

if i made a show that they took and they called it an original, i wouldn't be happy."
Alias Grace,"Netflix *did* make them; they co-produced those shows, which is not uncommon. Now, they didn't wholly make them, which could be the reason as the article (and OP) point out. But that's worthy of criticism IMO."
Alias Grace,"I thought the opposite, that last episode made the show feel really mediocre to me. I understand it's based on a book though so I guess they just adapted it right from that."
Alias Grace,I agree. Ozark is definitely derivative but it has great actors and an interesting tone that really works for me. 
Alias Grace,"That's how I was. I really really wanted to like Mindhunter, but I quit halfway through the second or third episode. I was hooked on Ozark from the start. But I'm also a really huge Jason Bateman fan, so that probably helped. "
Alias Grace,"I like that 'Ozark' takes itself way less seriously than 'Breaking Bad.' Every episode has at least one laugh out loud bit, imo. "
Alias Grace,"The thing about comparing young shows to Breaking Bad is that the best stretch of Breaking Bad is the last three seasons. 

The first season of Breaking Bad is good, and the second season plods along at times and certainly doesn’t make the show seem any better than your average 5+ season drama. It’s only once Gus Fring starts to take a central role that the show takes off and becomes one of the best of all time. 

It’s just a good thing to keep in mind with these shows - Ozark has a great premise, great actors, and was reasonably exciting. It might turn out to be another dime a dozen show, or it could do what Breaking Bad did and find its characters partway through. Remember that Saul Goodman didn’t even appear until midway through Season 2 and we don’t even see Gus Fring until the last two episodes of Season 2. "
Alias Grace,"I don't imagine it costs much to make either, tho. "
Alias Grace,"Um, people always turn up for a party and all the attention. "
Alias Grace,"If you think these awards are given on merit, I think you don't understand how the industry works. "
Alias Grace,"Not *incredibly*. A win bumps up their quote a bit, maybe a bonus. But mostly it's a marketing exercise."
Alias Grace,You must not have been on this subreddit when this show came out to lie like this
Alias Grace,NETFLIX CO-PRODUCED IT YOU DUM-DUMS. STOP PERPETUATING THIS LIE
Alias Grace,Just like every other show on Netflix?
Alias Grace,"Yes, but for Emmy consideration, it's a Netflix show since the Emmys are for American productions and Netflix is the American producer in this case.

Edit: thanks for DV despite me being 100% correct. "
Alias Grace,"It all sounds highly subjective, and not worth a debate in.

I find most awards for shows and movies very self-indulgent for the industry."
Alias Grace,"Can UK shows win Emmy's?

It was nominated for a BAFTA (A UK award) so maybe it's ineligible for an Emmy."
Alias Grace,"Breaking Bad definitely had its comedic moments though; hell, the first season felt more like a dark comedy. The pizza on the roof moment had me in tears."
Alias Grace,I enjoyed *Ozark* but I couldn't tell if I was laughing at it or with it. I think I lean towards the former.
Alias Grace,"I thought literally the exact opposite, it felt so self serious and constantly grim. Breaking Bad has a hell of a lot of comedy and comic relief characters, especially in the first season (Jesse, Badger, Saul are all mostly comedic characters, at least early on). Ozark is kinda oppressively dark and depressing, I only ever laughed at it, it never felt intentional."
Alias Grace,Ozark takes itself waaaay more seriously than Breaking Bad. There was almost no levity or humor. 
Alias Grace,Breaking Bad got better progressively through every season. I don't think anyone who watched the first season would have expected ot to become one of the all time greats.
Alias Grace,"where did i say anything about awards being 'given on merit'?

the awards are basically like a point system for actors, producers, and distributors. more awards and more nominations mean more money, bargaining power, and more opportunities in the long term."
Alias Grace,I was here and it there were posts about it being bad and posts about it being good. The comments in each of those posts were pretty split about the show’s quality. It was very interesting to see.
Alias Grace,"the subreddit dedicated to tv or ozark is the only place it's talked about then. otherwise, nobody talks about it."
Alias Grace,it's not a lie. it still aired months in uk on channel 4's tv and streaming months before it arrived on netflix. they co-produced it for international streaming rights.
Alias Grace,"no. it's a uk show made by channel 4 that aired months earlier on channel 4 in uk. and streamed online in uk months before netflix in usa.

that would be like me saying better call saul is a netflix show cos it's the only way to watch it in the uk. "
Alias Grace,[deleted]
Alias Grace,Many UK shows have won Emmys. 
Alias Grace,"It aired in the states, it's eligible."
Alias Grace,"fuck you bogdan. FUCK YOU and your EYEBROWS!

WIPE DOWN THIS!"
Alias Grace,Are you kidding? Ozark is constantly and purposefully funny. 
Alias Grace,"Oh, good. So you agree with me they're meaningless. "
Alias Grace,"Newsflash: tv shows air on different networks in different countries.

There's a big difference from only acquiring international rights after the fact and producing the thing from the get-go, which Netflix did here. Same with Alias Grace. These projects wouldn't have gotten made without Netflix (or someone else) funding them."
Alias Grace,"No, it was a co-production with Netflix actually. They didn't just acquire it from Channel 4, they joined early on to help get it made. Same as with Troy: Fall of a City.

Better Call Saul isn't funded at all by Netflix, they just acquired exclusive rights for the UK. So it's not quite the same."
Alias Grace,Not true. See: Downton Abbey. 
Alias Grace,HE CANT KEEP GETING AWAY WITH IT!!!
Alias Grace,no?
Alias Grace,"Ostensibly, they're presented as merit-based and everyone acts as if that were the case. Everyone says, ""Oh no! Carrie Coon was robbed! She gave the performance of the year and wasn't even nominated!"" Nobody says, ""Oh no! Carrie Coon was robbed! She deserved more money, bargaining power, and further opportunities via this insider, award-based point system!""

But since they're not based on what everyone believes them to be, they're meaningless and all the griping on awards night from fans is wasted breath since we know they're not merit-based. "
Alias Grace,"people can still watch it for fun as it generally is based on who did the best stuff, so people can like what they want.

all the behind the scenes benefits of awards is only relevant if you care about that stuff. otherwise it's a fun award show. no different than watching a sports game."
Alias Grace,Just finished watching all six episodes and thought it was great. This really is Atwood’s year.
