TV Show,Comment
Stargate SG-1,I keep seeing Stargate popping up in one way or another recently and I gotta say it's making me hit that Hopium a bit harder than usual
Stargate SG-1,They perfectly walked the line between continuity-based seasons and episodic storytelling.  I miss them.
Stargate SG-1,Pretty sure they guys in universe crossed the emptiness part of space by now and can continue with another season. Would be nice.
Stargate SG-1,"Amazon has a beautiful universe to explore right now.  I imagine a movie with a good budget to restart the saga and a series soon after.  With good marketing, they can have a high-end and popular scifi universe.  Sometimes I feel like Amazon wastes a lot of energy on things that don't go ahead, rather than focusing on long-range, long-term successes.  The Boys, Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time, Fallout, The Peripheral and Stargate would already ensure the involvement of fantasy and scifi audiences throughout the year.  Organization is lacking.  They also go well with male action shows.  Jack Ryan, Reacher and The Terminal List did well in ratings, despite any personal criticism.  Again, lack of organization and vision."
Stargate SG-1,Indeed
Stargate SG-1,"Still my favorite sci-fi series ever. Just finished another SG-1 rewatch a couple days ago and about to dive in on Atlantis. 

I'm still not sure if I want a revival or not. It's a franchise that thrives on silly monster-of-the-week episodes that slowly reveal a bigger threat. I don't know if there's room for that in the current era of TV and we'd probably just get a Picard-type disaster. 

The original producers are pretty active over on /r/stargate (/u/JosephMallozzi posts a ton of behind-the-scenes concept and production artwork) and have been teasing a [revival pilot](https://old.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/triwkf/the_brad_wright_pilot_for_the_new_series/) though."
Stargate SG-1,When is it coming back to Prime Video if they own it now?
Stargate SG-1,Hope we get another tv-series that is not a restart! SG-1 is already a masterpiece. You wouldn’t repaint Mona Lisa and expect it to surpass the original. I. Need. More. Stargate.
Stargate SG-1,You ended that sentence with a preposition. Bastard.
Stargate SG-1,"Stargate could easily become Amazons 'Star Trek' franchise. Stargate is a concept that allows them to go just about anywhere, create as many aliens and villains as they want, and do endless plots. SG1, Atlantis, Universe all proved they could recreate the magic in new formats with fresh entertaining stories. 

Now imagine in todays format of 10-12 episodes with different teams, plots, live action as well as cartoon formats. With multiple shows they could grab the old fans as well as new ones. Hate one show fret not as something familiar but different comes along in 3 months to keep you entertained.

Every media company dreams of the big franchise that keeps going by reinventing itself over the years and Stargate has already proven itself capable of that."
Stargate SG-1,"Coincidentally watching it again right now. On season four at the moment and it's much better than I remember.

*""Window of Opportunity""* is one of my favorites so far[!](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vhp99)"
Stargate SG-1,"Listen, I like the show and all, but how are you gonna suggest the sequel to a movie “kicked off” anything?  The movie kicked it off. This is all spin-off."
Stargate SG-1,[deleted]
Stargate SG-1,"I loved everything stargate except for SGU which killed the franchise.  The concept could have worked, but instead of stargate where we visited strange planets, meet aliens and basically did stargate stuff.  They wanted to make 90210 in space with a cast of unlikeable characters and boring social drama.  That is not why people watched stargate."
Stargate SG-1,"> SG-1 sprung into being due to a deal between Showtime and MGM Studios, with the latter owning the rights to the Stargate film. With Stargate proving to be a massive success at the box office, director/co-writer Roland Emmerich and his creative partner Dean Devlin pitched two more Stargate films. Each of the proposed sequels would have delved into the origin of various myths in Earth culture, and revealed that the chyrons on the Stargate were in fact coordinates to other alien worlds. ""Whether it was Bigfoot, or the Yeti — we were going to tie everything together into a larger mythology. And it was going to be so much fun. It was going to be so wild,"" Devlin said during an interview for the Dial the Gate podcast.

> Those films never came to be as MGM saw more value in a television series. The network hired Wright and Glassner, who'd previously worked on the Showtime revival of The Outer Limits. Together, they crafted a story that took place roughly one year after the events of the Stargate films and saw the return of protagonists Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). O'Neill and Jackson become part of a specialized ""SG"" team that also includes tech genius Samantha ""Sam"" Carter (Amanda Tapping) and the mysterious alien warrior Teal'c (Christopher Judge). Throughout SG-1's entire run, the team would utilize the Stargate to travel to other worlds and confront interstellar threats such as the shapeshifting Goa'uld."
Stargate SG-1,I know majority prefers SG1 and the lighthearted tone but I really would like more of Universe with the more serious tone like in season 2 as it became better and they could continue from there. But just some more adventures in that whole Stargate universe would be good enough
Stargate SG-1,"Easily one of my favourites ever. And with there being so many seasons, plus Atlantis, I often have a Stargate of some sort on the go. I’d love to see a new series, preferably with any of the SG-1 or Atlantis people who wanted to be involved, even if it was only in a limited capacity."
Stargate SG-1,sg1 is awesome
Stargate SG-1,I do love me some Stargate!
Stargate SG-1,My absolute favorite show of all time. No question
Stargate SG-1,"Is it worth rewatching?

I watched it when it came out so it's been a long time. And I remember even then some of the sets felt cheap and dated. But I liked the show."
Stargate SG-1,"July 97 I was 11 and this show changed my life. Almoat never missed and epp of it and Atlantis. SGU was a disappointment for stargate fans but was a decent scifi show. If they do stargate again,  it needs to be based on a team. A team that always has eachothers backs, no more of this everyone has an agenda and you can't trust anyone. We want the SG1 formula back, a team, support staff and a semi episodic format with A/B plot set up."
Stargate SG-1,It the 25th anniversary of the original Stargate show.
Stargate SG-1,"Things will not calm down, TurkeyPhat. They will, in fact, calm up."
Stargate SG-1,"Media is talking about it because of the anniversary. Although, I guess they do it because it makes views too so that's a good sign.

Amazon recently acquired the franchise with MGM but we have no idea on their plans. There were plans for a new show by Brad Wright (like the previous ones) by MGM before the purchase.

We only have to wait and see. For now they still have distribution contracts with other companies so it's not even all on Prime yet.

Amazon should clearly relaunch the franchise though, that's their Star Wars,  Star Trek type universe, even if less popular (though actually Stargate always seemed more popular than Star Trek internationally or at least in Europe)."
Stargate SG-1,It's coming friend.
Stargate SG-1,"No idea why, SG1 never had any appeal for me but I love Atlantis"
Stargate SG-1,"One of my favorite parts is I think Season 9, where they have the whole Camelot theme with the Ori.  That has always been one of my favorite themes in general and SG1 incorporates it well into the series.  That is also when I developed a crush on Morena Baccarin."
Stargate SG-1,serialized vs episodic.
Stargate SG-1,I'd settle for a 'Stargate Universe' TV movie a la SG-1 movies 'The Ark of Truth' and 'Continuum'.
Stargate SG-1,"I don't think I could accept the same cast return, so much age difference."
Stargate SG-1,"Could still work. 

Wallace couldn't fix the pod in time and did what he promised but not before uploading himself using the chair (he lost significant weight after the show so ""malnourished"" Eli could work as a hologram and help explain his age difference through it)

The ship didn't make the cap so the ship floated for thousands of years until it reached the new galaxy, the pods slow aging but with thousands of years they are all now older, few pods failed (actors who have other responsibilities or too expensive to bring back) and first half of the season could be them being in complete darkness as the stones still connect but only for few seconds and all they see are ruins of futuristic buildings and wasteland

During the thousands of years Holo-Wallace kept mostly to minimum power but did use some occasionally to work in a plan to travel the ship back in time, to bring back to the start of the series Rush will be the one to provide the final details on how to make the plan work. 

The plan finally works and they travel back but the unstability of the stars means they return to a time 15 years after start of the galaxy crossing and cause significant damage to the ship (get to kill off few more folks). they get to contact earth again but the earth continued living and none of the relationships and power structures are the same anymore. Second half of the season could focus on finding resources to fix the ship and relationships. 

Of course a faction or 2 will appear who will want to try to travel back closer to the original departure but attempts will be stopped to avoid further damages."
Stargate SG-1,That story line was finished in the comic book
Stargate SG-1,">  They also go well with male action shows. Jack Ryan, Reacher and The Terminal List did well in ratings


'Bosch' as well. The original show ran for 7 seasons, with a spin-off series, also starring Titus Welliver, that was renewed for a second season."
Stargate SG-1,I'm still very upset they didn't let them finish The Expanse novels. The final 3 books are so fucking good and I wanted to see them on screen!
Stargate SG-1,"Yeah, they have really butchered WoT though. Pretty disappointing as it has so much promise."
Stargate SG-1,"Yeah they're looking for a head of films now. Btw, I heard they're doing a Mass Effect show"
Stargate SG-1,"They apparently also have a Mass Effect show in the works. Nothing official though.

In fact they had plenty of projects that seems to have disappeared so I assume development hell and abandoned. Culture series, Ringworld, Snow Crash and Lazarus notably.

Really Stargate alone could make them 3-4 shows, the history of the franchise support it and now that everything is a cinematic/TV universe"
Stargate SG-1,I wish they would not finish The Expanse either.
Stargate SG-1,"> a movie with a good budget to restart the saga

I think that would be the wrong move.  Streaming services love TV series now, and Brad Wright has been working on [a fourth Stargate show for a few years](https://www.gateworld.net/news/2022/03/heres-proof-brad-wright-new-stargate-script-exists-teaser).  

The gate is open for Amazon.  They just need to step in."
Stargate SG-1,You say that alot
Stargate SG-1,Indeed
Stargate SG-1,Star Trek Strange New Worlds and The Mandalorian did kind of do story of the week type thing (with or without an overarching narrative) and they work very well. They could really adopt the structure of the old shows and make it work even now.
Stargate SG-1,"You currently have to get the MGM package here in Canada, it's relatively cheap. Keep in mind for some insane reason they skip the last two seasons of SG1."
Stargate SG-1,Never
Stargate SG-1,"The creators mentioned they had a new series planned.  The main plot is the Stargate is now public knowledge and all the issues that arise from that.  

I suppose it might be “what if the Tau’ri are no longer solely represented by the USAF?”"
Stargate SG-1,"They need to do something like Atlantis where they are not on earth, but not in deep end of nowhere either.  Maybe a stargate outpost on a far away planet where they stay in contact with earth, but mostly stay by themselves and are exploring an unexplored section of the stargate network."
Stargate SG-1,"I don't disagree but can see where the author is coming from. The Stargate movie was a modest box office success with lukewarm reviews that almost certainly wouldn't have gotten a sequel. 

SG-1 took the general concept of the movie, did a soft reboot\*, and kicked off a 17 season franchise (19 if you count Origins and Infinity, which...no). 

\*Off the top of my head:
Abydos was no longer in another galaxy but the closest planet to Earth with a Stargate, the gate could dial thousands of planets instead of just Abydos, Ra was a host of a parasitic organism (the Goa'uld were not in the movie at all) not just some alien species, Anubis and Horus become rivals of Ra instead of servants, tons of minor name/location changes."
Stargate SG-1,If you look into it you will understand. The movie was unique and the series almost never happened.
Stargate SG-1,Travelers is one of the best 'camp but serious' shows I have ever seen. It takes a really high concept idea and makes it quite deep and charming. Some of the rules it invented were really creative and smart.
Stargate SG-1,Time for another SG:1 rewatch i guess lol.
Stargate SG-1,And Amazon just recently bought MGM
Stargate SG-1,"Like the rest of the ship, suspended animation wasn't fully functional. Aged 10 years while asleep for 500. Can't get a cast member back? Pod failed."
Stargate SG-1,"*Wallace couldn't fix the pod in time*

He should've asked Gromit, or at least had some Wensleydale."
Stargate SG-1,This sounds vaguely familiar
Stargate SG-1,if I'm not mistaken none of the show writers were involved in the comics so they remain non-canon.
Stargate SG-1,"*Bosch* is damn good. If you like that style of format as well (one season-long mystery/investigation), check out the first season of *Murder In The First* (just the first season, second season is rubbish). It's quite good."
Stargate SG-1,For some reason I really liked it.
Stargate SG-1,This Netflix syndrome of trying to do too much and doing almost nothing well! Amazon already has the IPs. They just need to work right.
Stargate SG-1,"We got six seasons, which is a fair haul given that Syfy cancelled it."
Stargate SG-1,My fear is that it will be less stargate exploration/discovery/action and will be just social drama like SGU first season.
Stargate SG-1,That sounds like Stargate's version of Deep Space Nine.
Stargate SG-1,"And it's O'Neill, with two L's. There's another Colonel O'Neil with only one L, and he has no sense of humor at all."
Stargate SG-1,IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING?
Stargate SG-1,"funny, you can watch SG1 but Atlantis and universe are blocked behind a paywall (you have to subscribe to the MGM channel)"
Stargate SG-1,/u/josephmallozi get in here. Please give us more SG: U!
Stargate SG-1,"Better yet. Don't even suspend aging. The purpose was just to conserve resources while they crossed the galactic void, where they couldn't refuel. The fact that ancient pods retarded aging was a bonus. These are older pods, just say they don't have that capability. 

Otherwise you'll also have to content with Earth 500 years into the future."
Stargate SG-1,"I've always said that.
All you need is Eli really and he can say he spent the time people were in stasis getting buff seeing as that's what the actor has done lately.
Don't even need the pod to fail completely. Just pull the actors in for 10 minutes to stand in the pod for one scene and then if their schedule ever opens up the pods are magically fixed.
Easy peasy."
Stargate SG-1,I guess the only issue would be the actor that played Eli looks like he lost 150 pounds. Looked him up on IMDB and he looks completely different. He was the last to go in as it ended with him gazing into space so I guess you could say he ran laps before suspending himself.
Stargate SG-1,"> check out the first season of Murder In The First 

Thanks, will check it out."
Stargate SG-1,I mean they got us less episodes than Syfy overall while profiting much more from it. Not sure they should be that praised. I guess there is still the theory of the time jump being done in real life but I'm not really believing it
Stargate SG-1,Indeed.
Stargate SG-1,[deleted]
Stargate SG-1,"No, you can finish the hole, its quite inefficient to start a rewatch of a show that has 214 40minute episodes in the middle of a round of golf."
Stargate SG-1,I got the Altantis blu ray set for like $50 or something a few years ago. I couldn't *not* buy it.
Stargate SG-1,Spelled it wrong. /u/josephmallozzi
Stargate SG-1,I guess the only issue would be the actor that played Eli looks like he lost 150 pounds. Looked him up on IMDB and he looks completely different. He was the last to go in as it ended with him gazing into space so I guess you could say he ran laps before suspending himself.
Stargate SG-1,They could have no contact with Earth. But also that could be a cool plot device in so many ways.
Stargate SG-1,"I mean the main issue is mostly bringing back a show after so many years especially one who failed pretty hard back then and isn't even liked by many of the franchise fans.

If they bring it back, it's clearly must be a new show in the vein of SG-1 or Atlantis"
Stargate SG-1,"When he was left with the last broken stasis chamber they also discusses how the shuttle had a small power supply. I was pretty sure the plan was always going to be Eli spent the two years alone, and drew power from the shuttle to support himself well enough. So weight loss would still fit."
Stargate SG-1,Undomesticated equines could not remove me.
Stargate SG-1,"The stasis pod was broken. He only had two weeks to fix it. 

Maybe he did a partial fix where the pod was not able to stay active for the entire duration and he kept getting kicked out. Food supplies were scarce so he didn't eat much in between cycles. Got skinny."
Stargate SG-1,They would have to get rid of the stupid communication stones.
Stargate SG-1,I'm more than okay with that
Stargate SG-1,"Then it's fine - ish. 

In 500 years Earth didn't manage to figure out a solution and open a portal to Destiny. Why ? Could be either a massive plot hole or a great plot device."
Stargate SG-1,"Come on Amazon, give us a new one."
Stargate SG-1,Watching Stargate for me is like sinking into a comfy couch with a mug of hot chocolate and a warm blanket.  Soothing as hell.
Stargate SG-1,I loved that the ancients were just the science believers fleeing the planet full of religious nuts…
Stargate SG-1,Indeed
Stargate SG-1,"If they reboot, I really hope they don't embarrass the franchise."
Stargate SG-1,Indeed
Stargate SG-1,IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING???
Stargate SG-1,I liked SG-1 more than I did the movie.
Stargate SG-1,125th anniversary? What year is this?
Stargate SG-1,Indeed.
Stargate SG-1,"On my fourth watch through and I'm still cracking up over something I just saw in so7e1 that I missed on every other watch and is testimony to both the humour and clout of Richard Dean Anderson.

SG1 arrives on a desert planet inhabited by nomads, one of whom gestures towards Teal'c and asks: ""He is Jaffar?"" to which, straight-faced, Colonel O'Neil replies: ""No, he isn't one. He just plays one on TV!""

No clue how this survived the edit, but happy it did"
Stargate SG-1,"I have tried to watch sg few times in the past but just couldn't just because the sheer number of 20 episode seasons, so I hope some SG fan can help me on this.


Which series would be a better start for a newcomer to the series? SG-1 or Atlantis or Universe? 


Which series feels more modern in terms of storytelling and effects?"
Stargate SG-1,Is sg-1 on any streaming service right now?
Stargate SG-1,"Look I'll be the first to admit it's got alot of filler and the show would have benefited from 10 episodes less per season, but its mostly built like star trek in that most episodes are self contained. It also makes for great background TV; fold some laundry, do some weights, cook some dinner and have it running in the background.

I'd recommend just trying one of the real banger episodes and see if it's your kettle of fish: SG1: S2E16 matter of time.

It's got it all; a great plot, well established and believable technobabble, action, drama, you name it. If this episode doesnt sell you on the show it's probably just not gonna be your thing."
Stargate SG-1,I know people who have only watched this and not the movie. And they have the hide to tell me that they will never see the original film. Like living in bizarro world...

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Why not just nix kid's programming altogether? It doesn't make sense for Disney to have two services with kid's stuff.

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Might be a stretch, but Batman: The Animated Series was directly inspired by and made due to the success of the Tim Burton Batman films. Including B:TAS, there are eight unique shows from that."

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"> Why not just nix kid's programming altogether?

The Dreamworks deal was made before Disney assumed full control of Hulu.

>It doesn't make sense for Disney to have two services with kid's stuff.

Sure it does. First-party content that Disney fully owns goes on Disney+. Third-party content that may rotate out ends up on Hulu. Hulu allows a platform for Disney to collaborate to create content with other companies without requiring them to have full ownership."

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,[deleted]
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,This franchise is getting ridiculous 
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Huh, that sounds strange "
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Sounds like a perfect fit since DreamWorks Animation is known for making family shows.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Dora: ""Dominic. Can you tell me what we are?""

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Oh man I am very intrigued by this. 
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"I hope it is an Mir production, because they have been doing great with Korra and Voltron."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Every time I think Tony Toretto, it reminds me of Tony the Tiger, and then I imagine that show instead."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,I wanna know who this is aimed at. I assume kids but I wanna watch it if its a little more made for adults
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,This is the fastest I've ever nut after reading a headline
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Dunno how I feel about this...I enjoy the Fast and Furious movies but it's generally because of their crazy action sequences (which often utilize practical effects) and also because I enjoy a lot of the actors.

Edit: And it doesn't even feature Dom or his gang! It's his cousin. Lame."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Well if it works for ghost busters, it's gotta work for fast and the furious right?"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,this is the sort of thing that happened fairly often in the 90's
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"i remember when fast and the furious was about street racing, stealing vcr's, young girls in skimpy clothing and really small cars that could drive under an 18 wheeler with 2 feet of ground clearance  "
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Aren't the original movies basically animated already

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,No

If there is one thing I've wanted from the fast and furious franchise its been more unbelievable car stunts."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Have you seen the movies a car fought a submarine in the last one. What could they honestly do in animation that would top that.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"> some flexibility in terms of chases, crazy stunts, etc.

I think we've pretty much crossed that line already lol, the movies are more or less live action cartoons"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"> This honestly sounds like a cheap cash grab

So just like the movies.
"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Yeah but.. they could easily rename The Fast and The Furious franchise to “Cash Grab” and no one would notice.

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Getting ridiculous?!? When was it ever not ridiculous? 
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Pray that I don't alter it any further
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,But its all about that family.

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"It says Tim Hedrick is the showrunner, so that makes me think it will be."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Why not?
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,A car fighting a submarine.... In space! Jk but my point was that with animation they aren't constrained by a special effects budget. They literally do whatever they want.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,[deleted]
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Part 1. 
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Tokyo Drift wasn't ridiculous. The only ridiculous thing in that movie was that Lucas Black was a high school student.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Lol I knew that line sounded familiar to me.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Comcast isn't going to refuse because Netflix pays for the production while Comcast gets to air them on their own kids channel now. 

Essentially Netflix licenses the properties, pays Comcast, and Comcast gets to reap the free revenue, advertisement and ability to sell merch based on IPs being shown.

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Ah, converting CGI to flash. Shorter, cheaper, and more jokes to put it."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Well, I mean, if they can replicate the bizarre humor of the original show, I'll totally be down.  But since the movie was just a generic DreamWorks ""kind of funny but also remarkably bland"" movie, I'm not holding high hopes.  I want a show that has no issues spending an entire 8 minutes episode just setting up one incredibly terrible pun.  That strange Rocky and Bullwinkle humor that I can't define, but definitely know when I see it."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Hopefully it'll be better than the movie.

DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Wow. This brought up amazing memories. I had this taped and used to watch it every Christmas. Damn.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"My sister and I try to watch this together every year. We're in our 30's now and she's introduced it to her kids; it's a great family tradition! I also love the part where Garfield is sitting on Grandma's lap; its such a great moment and really deep, as she looks back on all her years and her husband and how much she loved him and how she misses him. Now that I'm married, stuff like that always strikes me a lot harder than it ever did before. 

Bonus: my sister and I try to still watch Garfield's Halloween Special every year too. ""Candy, candy, candy!"""
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"This is in my family's Christmas-watching lineup along with a Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty, Rudolph, and the Grinch."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"People rag on the Garfield newspaper strip and the movies and some other vehicles, but ""Garfield and Friends"" was really great, a legitimate big hitter among that golden era of Saturday-morning-style cartoons."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,I wish they still played this on TV.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Another example where cartoon food looks incredible.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Wow thanks. I'm 45 and unbelievably I've never seen this, even though Garfield Halloween is a favorite of mine. Just finished watching it!"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,The 80's and 90's Garfield animated material is shockingly good in general.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Hated that one, very boring although I love Garfield and Friends"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Saw this once as a kid on ABC Family and watched it again last year. I loved how it feels just like real family gatherings for the holidays...
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"I had a bizarre obsession with Garfield in the way that most kids had with sports teams or superheroes. My bedroom walls were orange at some point. I would email Jim Davis on his birthday. Part of me dies every time I remember this, but then I remember how good the Garfield Christmas special is and it makes it feel justified."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,Same. Garfield just isn't the same anymore though.
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Yeah, I remember CBS played this for years along with Rudolph and Frosty.  I wonder why they don't anymore?"
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,">Written by Bryant, in Dream, when her son graduates from college, former teen mom Dream Morgan (Riley) turns her life upside down to pursue her dream of becoming a singer.

Way to make me feel fucking old!

But I'm glad she's getting work. She's always been a talented singer but her acting's improved immensely over the years."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,I want to know what happened to that project is it still in the works?
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,STOP. KARMA. FARMING. IN. R/TELEVISION
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"When he wore that silly bandana around his thigh and when he tried to invent his own catchphrase...  ""Wa wa wa"""
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"I was aged 7 or 8 when it first aired in the U.K. in 1974 and I was always deeply confused by *Happy Days*. I didn't understand that it was a current series, it was so un-funny that I assumed it had to be a re-run of a show from the 50s. I didn't understand why the audience acknowledged Fonz when he walked into a scene. I didn't understand how all these actors, who were clearly adults, could still be in high school. I just didn't get any of it. Clearly, it was an issue of culture shock, because the series is much-beloved in the U.S."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"It did seem to be getting a little too much to the point it was just becoming the ""Joannie Loves Chachi"" show, which they eventually actually did."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"I quit watching it when it stopped being a SITCOM about the 50s and turned into The Fonzie Show, so I don't think I ever saw any episodes with Chachi."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,"Looked at their profile. Seems like a person just interested in shows/movies. And assuming they're karma farming with Happy Days, of all things? It was a very popular show, but 40 yrs ago."
DreamWorks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,I was about 8 or 9 when Happy Days was at its peak. Fonzie was my hero...  tied with The Six Million Dollar Man.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,He just likes Norm from Cheers.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Thank you sir for the amazing childhood holiday memories — Godspeed
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,RIP to a true legend. Rankin/Bass movies were a staple of this Gen X’s childhood.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"I loved his work for Mad magazine. Never knew he was also in the Rankin Bass stuff but now looking back that makes sense. 

And another chapter of my childhood is over."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I still love those holiday movies.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Classic holiday viewing growing up in the 70’s and 80’s . Not all great but fun and cheesy super craftsmanship ( for the time ) . I watch Peter Cottontail   every year now on YouTube. I never saw it as a kid until a couple years ago,but it is a new tradition in our house . RIP CokerJr I will view you in the credits.❤️"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Does anyone have a collection of his iconic images handy? I recognised the characters in the cover photo but was disappointed by the lack of content in the article. Would like to appreciate the man behind the work
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,So much nostalgia.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is always required to watch every Post-Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I’m in permanent limbo between gen z/millennial and he was apart of mine too thankfully. My nutty gen x parents got that right at least! I remember the evolution of “mom what is this movie” to going **burgermeistermiesterburger** everywhere at four years old lmao
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I’ve watched every year since it debuted. 💕
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"God, it's bizarre. So effective. The only thing weirder was HR Pufnstuf."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"“Dentist” was code for homosexual, right?"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"You want weird? Check out the Rankin/Bass Christmas Special where leprechauns celebrate Christmas and involving a witch who won't stop crying.

Edit: She's actually a banshee"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,“Independent”
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,***Banshee***
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"""The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold"".  I cannot say I have seen it. 

I wonder if you could watch that and see if it lines up meaningfully with ""Hotel California"". 

IMO, it was all proof that drugs were real."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Christmas ornaments fall down a tree.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Also wasn't there something involving gold that sealed away the banshee and made it stop crying briefly?
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold still airs on AMC alongside other Rankin-Bass Christmas Specials. Highly suggest that channel for the company's lesser-known specials besides the big three.

DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,🙂💕
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,It’s great but it’s depressing.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,The West Wing: Noel.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Christmas 1989 gave us 2 epic holiday shows back to back!

Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, and It’s a Bundyful Life!

That episode of The Simpsons was the beginning of Simpsons Mania for years!

The Married With Children episode was one of their very best!

I’ll always hold a special place in my heart for these episodes!"
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Psych Christmas episodes were always great.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Hey Arnold - Arnold’s Christmas

Arnold attempting to reunite Mr. Hyunh and his daughter, who he had to give up 20 years prior during the Vietnam War to American soldiers so she’d be safe, is a plot line you wouldn’t expect from a children’s animated TV show. It’s a truly emotional and beautiful episode, with good plotlines and resolutions for Arnold and Helga."

DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Happy Days.  That early episode is what made Fonzie a lovable character.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"""Seasonal Beatings""  S7E5 of Peep Show. 

One of the main charectors, Mark, has his incredibly dysfunctional family over for dinner. He lies about his GF being his GF, his Father is an awful racist and his Mum reveals she's writing a play about a groupd of sexually repressed people who are lead on an illuminating journey by an old Jamaican woman. 

It's a 10/10 episode of a 10/10 show."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,Raising Hope; It's a hopeful life.
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Dragnet: ""Christmas Story"" or the ""Big Little Jesus,"" remade about four times on radio or TV.

Jack Benny Program: any of the radio or TV episodes in which Jack goes Christmas shopping."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"""Home For the Holidays"" and ""No Place Like Home for the Holidays"" both from Roseanne. The first one is great, almost nothing dramatic happens in it, the cast are separated on Christmas Eve by a blizzard. It's basically just jokes and one dramatic insight into David's home life (and the syndicated version cuts out Darlene telling his sisters that if they stay up late, Santa's elves will cut off their toes with their pointy shoes, but the syndicated version leaves in a part later on where Roseanne tells Darlene to go to bed on time when she's stuck at David's house because ""Remember what I told you about Santa's elves and their pointy shoes"". Them cutting out Darlene telling that story makes that line make no sense but they leave it in anyway!)

The second one is during season 9, the lottery season, and again it's basically just joke after joke with just one dramatic thing happening. I always get a little choked up seeing this family that has struggled for so long finally get stuff they really wanted for Christmas, and who doesn't get teary eyed when Roseanne gives Dan the mortgage paperwork and a lighter since they finally paid off the house with their winnings? 

Of course ""Arnold's Christmas"" from Hey Arnold is fantastic. Watching as a kid I didn't understand that Mr. Hyunh was Vietnamese and so didn't really understand the full scope of his story, but they did a good job portraying the basics. The episode is really representative of the meaning of Christmas - doing acts of kindness for no thanks or recognition. Mr. Hyunh doesn't know who reunited him with his daughter, Arnold doesn't know how how it happened either, Helga gives up the ONE thing she wanted for Christmas that her usually absent-minded alcoholic mother actually made an effort to get her and Arnold doesn't know what a sacrifice she made. It's really touching. Also the score of that episode is really fantastic. 

Also ""High Holidays"" from Frasier. It's not super Christmasy but when you get to the joke that the entire episode has been building up to... really just fantastic. I think it's best to go into that episode knowing as little as possible."
DreamWorks Holiday Classics,"Ted Lasso- Carol of the Bells

Nine years after the suicide of one of their own, a family gathers at their family estate over the holidays which is interrupted when a bloody note is found in one of their Christmas crackers promising to murder two of them. While dismissed as a joke, it's not long before an attempt is made on the life of the elderly resident of the house, forcing Barnaby to act.

Probably one of my favourites, both because of how brilliant the killer's plan is, but for having one of the most brutal kills in the entire series, almost out of something out of a horror film - >!the killer slipped a 20-bore shotgun shell into Jennifer's coat before she went out pheasant shooting; when she thought it was a dud, she loaded up one of her regular 12-bore shell which fired into the shell that was now disloged into her gun... causing it - and the gun - to explode in her face.!<"

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I really really wanted a fourth one, but this'll do for me. Hopefully, they explore the characters more. It probably won't have the OG actors returning, but I'd like to see this one being more Furious Five and Shifu focused than the third movie, which sidelined most of them, barring Tigress..."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The first Kung Fu Panda is one of the greatest American martial arts movies of all time.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I read Jack Bauer at first instead of Jack Black and was very confused for a few seconds
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Why is this going to Netflix instead of Peacock?
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I think I'm the only person who only likes the first movie and doesn't remotely get why the second caught on so well, but when I say I like the first movie it's an understatement because I'm just as obsessed as I was at 12 and I would love to love something else from the franchise as much. Going to give this my best shot."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I just hope they eventually make a spin-off series/movie of the Furious Five without Po. If it worked for Puss In Boots without Shrek, then it can work for them."

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"idk much about kung fu panda, but the article says ""Legends of Awesomeness"" ran from 2011 to 2016, and then ""Legends of Awesomeness"" ran from 2018 to 2019. is this a mistake?"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Kung Fu Panda teaches the wrong lesson when you think about it.

Tigress worked her ass off to get to where she is (so did the other members of the furious 5) whereas Po got to be the Dragon Warrior and superior warrior, why? Because he was born special. He never worked for it like them. So the lesson ended up being you can work as hard as you want but some people are just born special and can pass you in an instance. Po doesn't have anywhere near the disciple nor experience as them yet he surpassed them and even Tai-Lung (who dedicated his life to martial arts) in a short amount of time.

Tai-Lung worked hard but didn't react well at all to the rejection but Tigress handled it as well as most people could have in that situation."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Cool, but I wish he’d do something for adults again

Edit: guys. Come on now. Downvoting the literal mildest of opinions lol."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Please make it stop
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Disappointing- so many amazing comedic Asian actors that would be just fine.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,As long as the animation is better than “Legends of Awesomeness” I’m game
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,This is going to be like the 3rd spinoff show they've done.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The villain of the fourth movie should be a dragon
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I feel like there’s a possibility that Lucy Lui and James Hong could return to voice Viper and Mr. Ping, as they were the only movie actors to continue voicing their characters in the other Kung Fu Panda tv show(s)."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I'm the opposite. I think Po's story is done. They should continue the story on a new generation of kung fu fighters. Jack Black can still voice new characters. Make Po and the Furious Five take the role of Sifu and Oogway.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I prefer the second one because it knew when to be serious. It never turned the big bad into a joke.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Tai lung escaping from the prison is one of my all time favourite animated scenes

Gorgeous art direction, Gary Oldman as the villain, excellent score. Not much of a mystery."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I thought the first one was basically perfect. Didn’t see the second one in theaters and didn’t think it looked that great, finally saw and thought it was not too bad. And then I saw the third one and thought it was amazing, like seriously the 3rd movie is actually really good and captures the magic of the the first in a great way. If you haven’t seen the third I’d def check it out cause it was really enjoyable!"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"The first kung foo panda is my favorite movie of all time. The second and third are just bonuses, I enjoy watching my characters come back to life in another medium."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Tai-Lung is such a great character he made the first film for me. Although everything else in the film was great.

How do you feel about the 3rd film?"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The 3rd one didn’t float your boat? I saw it first and tried to watch it passively while cooking for my kids and ended up GLUED to the TV. I was awestruck!

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"> Because he was born special 

Welcome to possibly the oldest literary story structure of all time. See also: the Bible, Superman, The Matrix…

The Savior, The Messiah, The One… is about as classic story as it gets. 

Not that you’re wrong, but if you feel KFP has a bad message then you also have a problem with thousands of other works of fiction. 

Also, the isn’t really the message/theme of KFP, that’s just the story telling/character device used to set up the actual themes of identity, perseverance, justice, family, dedication…. And things like that. The “lesson” isn’t really  “be born better/special” but it’s totally easy to see how that interpretation can come about."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"But isn't the message of the whole film that he believes in himself and that's what makes him special? That the villain may have worked hard but deep down he needed that scroll to believe he was good enough, while Po just believed in himself already?"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The lesson of Kung Fu Panda is about accepting and loving your family. Both in Panda accepting his adoptive father and Tigress accepting Panda. But it does show there is a limit with Tai Lung’s behavior being unacceptable (being like a son to Oogway).
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"But he wasn’t. He had to work equally hard. He wasn’t built as a perfect weapon like Tigress, he had to learn from 0, get his ass constantly beaten, then he was thrown in the middle of all and figured out that he had to embrace who he was to succeed, it is acknowledged constantly how inferior his technical skills are compared to the rest, but it was his heart and love for his friends and the way that he cared about everyone that made him who he is. 

That’s the lesson I choose to see in this movie."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I mean isn't that life as well?

You can work your butt off but if someone has an talent for something they still can pass you. 

It does suck though"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Although it's not discussed overtly in the film, I think the lesson re Tigress is that dedication and hard work must be their own reward, or they will become obsession and madness, a la Tai Lung. Just my 2 cents."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Hmmm first kong fu movie?
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"How is that the wrong message tho? That’s literally life lmao, you could play basketball everyday and still not be 6”10"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"it's the millennia old ""genius-special one"" archetype. Take the Nero Wolfe books, where his assistant Archie does all the legwork, interrogates suspects, gets shot at by criminals, drives back and forth doing basically anything in the books, then hauls everything home and Nero solves the case in a couple hours standing on his chair. Archie is very, very intelligent, probably the most capable man in all NY, but he is still a commoner, not a genius able to see the invisibile dots, that's Nero. That's Po"

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,You're in the minority.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,First one with Jack Black returning as Po though so it’ll probably be equivalent to a fourth movie.

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,He was fucking terrifying honestly. Actually unstable murderous bastard.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Yup. 2 is legit a great movie on multiple levels. It's 100% why I want to see the planned arc continue
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,That gravity run is awesome.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The sheer beauty of the scene when Po finds his inner peace.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,It's my favourite animated movie for sure. I can't believe it's 10 years old!
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"My fav was Oogways dig at Kai ""Took long enough""  lol"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I liked the second one, primarily because I’d seen the spin off shows, so seeing Master Rhino get straight up merk’d was a “oh so this movies going dark huh?”"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I've kind of suspected I'd like it more than I had 2 but I've been so nervous it would be yet another letdown. This is encouraging though! Thanks.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I love Tai Lung to death. I don't remember anything about Shen(?) other than his cool design. Still have to watch 3 of course, kind of kicking myself I haven't given it a chance yet.

Zigzagging to your comment about KFP teaching the wrong lesson, I can see where you're coming from but I think Oogway realized Tigress wanted it for the wrong reasons. She *wanted* to be the Dragon Warrior. Po was passionate and humble and I think that's what he saw and wanted to choose. There is an unfortunate chosen oneness to it as well that I don't quite like, but I *don't* think that's the single solitary reason he was chosen ultimately. Po still had to work hard and he did and for all the right reasons. Still....it's true I wouldn't have minded Tigress as the Dragon Warrior. In terms of sheer effort and dedication she's ""won"" already."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Kung Fu Panda has the greatest screenplay I’ve ever seen in an animated movie. If the characters were human it would definitely be nominated for some awards
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">but if you feel KFP has a bad message then you also have a problem with thousands of other works of fiction. 

I do.

>And things like that. The “lesson” isn’t really “be born better/special” but it’s totally easy to see how that interpretation can come about.

I get the lesson is meant to be don't base a book by its cover."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,But for the majority of the film Po didn't believe in himself. This was focused on quite a bit with him doubting himself. Tigress believed in herself from the start and was confident in her abilities. So no I don't think that was the message of the film.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">The lesson of Kung Fu Panda is about accepting and loving your family. Both in Panda accepting his adoptive father and Tigress accepting Panda.

That's more like the message of the third film."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"He really was. He learnt all that in a few weeks and surpassed people who had trained for years.

>That’s the lesson I choose to see in this movie.

That's the lesson they want to present but that isn't really the case. He was just naturally gifted because he was born as the dragon warrior."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I guess that's true but the movie kind of paints as a good thing.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Lol fine then I want him to do another movie that’s not for everyone to enjoy, just adults. You had to know that’s what I meant, right?"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Okay this does intrigue me now.

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"did I just got downvoted for asking a legit question??  


I didnt know there were 2 spin off of kung fu panda, I was thinking of spin off of other movies"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,No a Chinese dragon
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Exactly. Tai Lung was great until the final battle where Po is sitting on him and beating his ass Barnyard style. That's what killed Tai Lung for me as a child and even more as an adult.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,I fucking cry every time
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">Po was passionate and humble and I think that's what he saw and wanted to choose.

Yeh those are good traits although Tigress wasn't the most humble she was certainly passionate. She dedicate so much time to it and respected immensely.

>Po still had to work hard and he did and for all the right reasons

He worked hard for a couple of weeks before fighting Tai-Lung, she worked hard since she was a child. Passion and humbleness are great traits but so is dedication, respect and maturity things she displayed far more than Po ever did."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Also, and I’m being mega pedantic here because work in development, but we don’t really do “lessons” in writing/developing films. Generally it’s all about theme, and most good films naturally have multiple strong themes, maybe one or two that the filmmakers were focused on as what lies beneath all of the story/character and then others that form organically from there. Being an animated kids movie, theme can often be much more
overt or literal, so it’s easy to feel like the film is trying to teach you a lesson, but it’s not really. It’s, like most films, an exploration of theme and character, it just happens to be wrapped in fun action comedy package in this instance. “Lessons” are more of a very little kids tv thing as opposed to big budget international theatrical films. 

“The One” isn’t really a theme writers explore. It’s basic structural device or character archetype. And you see it a lot because it really does work well. But like all devices/tools in the writing toolbox it’s all about execution. When devices are done well (or at least adequately) we think of them as tropes or archetypes. When down lazily or poorly we think of them as cliches or cheats."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"> But for the majority of the film Po didn't believe in himself. This was focused on quite a bit with him doubting himself. 

It's like he had a character arc or something."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Oh yeah I confused some of the conflict from Michael Cranston Dad and Duck Dad from the third movie and put it into the first, my bad."

DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"yeah we all knew lol. and im with you, remember tropic thunder? fucking loved that movie.

&#x200B;

i think he has too much of a good guy thing going on seeing him in an R rated movie would be jarring."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Idk why you got downvoted. Sometimes people misinterpret the intent behind your comment, and sometimes they’re just in a weird mood.

Big Hero 6 is a Disney property (while the others you mentioned are Dreamworks) so maybe that was a factor, too."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,[deleted]
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"All true. I guess it's more that I think just because it was handed to Po and there was another worthy candidate he's not undeserving. It should also be remarked that there's a mystery to how Oogway operates so I'm sure he had additional reasons we can't possibly fathom. 

I wonder now too if Oogway thought Po making an informed decision to train whereas Tigress was practically bred to be a warrior factored in at all."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Po was not the chosen one because he was the bestest or greatest with qualities others can't measure up to, but because he had the right stuff at the right amount.

His ability to resist the pressure point attack is one factor, his personality another. However, you could consider him a prodigy who mastered the Wuxi Finger Hold in a couple of weeks and thanks to his ability to resist Tai-Lung's pressure point attack he was able to comfortably 1 on 1 him.

Love the movie btw. I pretty much consider it a ""perfect"" movie from start to finish."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,The point they made was Po became the Dragon Warrior because he believed in himself. I was pointing out that isn't the case because he was chosen to be the Dragon Warrior before he believed in himself. Maybe read properly.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">He didn’t really surpass anyone. Tigress was still a significantly better fighter than him and so was Tai Lung. He won over Tai Lung by basically accident and because Tai Lung underestimated him. Nothing about the fight was because of technique. It was because he was a fat panda. The only exception is the wooshi finger hold, which is definitely a cop out. But rewatch that fight. There is no “chosen one” aspect to it.

So, as luck would have it, I randomly did decide to watch Kung Fu Panda this evening, and just finished a few minutes ago. The first half of the fight, you're right. Tai Lung wasn't fighting him at all, they were just both chasing after the scroll. But after Tai Lung gets the scroll and finds out that there's nothing there, he does go all out on Po. And loses horribly. Po grabs Tai Lung's tail and uses that as a rope against him, making him bite his own tail at one point, while effortlessly dodging the rest of Tai Lung's punches and kicks. Even the final hit shows Po squaring himself up against Tai Lung's final charge so that he can use his ""fat panda""-ness to redirect the attack and bounce Tai Lung 500 ft into the air."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"He figured out the wooshi hold something Tai-Lung didn't manage to learn in all those years.

If you saw the sequel films Po clearly became a master fighter."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I agree, I didn’t know it was such a controversial opinion though"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"No, a Chinese dragon. There are literally ones that have already appeared in the Kung Fu Panda series"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">too if Oogway thought Po making an informed decision to train

But wasn't it kind of just pushed on Po?"
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">with qualities others can't measure up to, but because he had the right stuff at the right amount.

>His ability to resist the pressure point attack is one factor, his personality another

Those two qualities? One every Panda has. Besides that again is just something he is naturally born with not earnt. Which is my point.

>However, you could consider him a prodigy who mastered the Wuxi Finger Hold in a couple of weeks and thanks to his ability to resist Tai-Lung's pressure point attack he was able to comfortably 1 on 1 him.

Could consider? He definitely is there's no denying it.

>Love the movie btw. I pretty much consider it a ""perfect"" movie from start to finish.

The movie is great I am not saying it's bad just that the message isn't the best."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,It shouldnt have been. Reddit gonna reddit.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,Not really? He could leave if he wanted and was being actively pushed. If Oogway couldn't see into the future he knew how Shifu and the others were going to react and he wasn't going to stop that. Tigress never had a choice.
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"The movies message isn't a single thing. The movie teaches us that obsessing over something or achieving a singular goal can corrupt your intentions.

It teaches us that there might be dormant potential inside of you, you just need to find the right method of learning to awaken it.

It also teaches us that you don't need something else or become something special, being the best version of yourself is plenty special.

It's never to late to get into something you are really passionate about, that's another lesson one could draw.

Saying the movies ""message isn't the best"" because it uses the ""chosen one"" trope is a bit of an undersell in my honest opinion, especially considering how strange a story would feel if the main character isn't ""special"" in some way. It makes you question why the story is even centered around that character.

One could argue that what makes Po the chosen one is not simply his physique (although that does play a role in the movie), but because he loves martial arts ITSELF. 

Even tigress, for all her virtues; is still hunting Shifu's approval. Po is motivated no matter how shitty he is, no matter how much it hurts. The only moment he wavers is when nobody believes in him, but he's still supposed to face certain death.

And when it turns out that the dragon scroll is actually nothing, he turns around, alone, to face Tai-Lung 1 on 1 without even thinking he has a chance of actually winning the fight.

If you cut out the end fight, by having Tai-Lung be convinced by Po that fighting is pointless, the majority of the movie could still stand as is. His physical victory over the antagonist was a way to quickly and cleanly wrap up the plot.(and reference back to the finger hold) Po had already won the true struggle at that point, showcasing why he was worthy and Tai-Lung was not."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"If you're told you're the Dragon Warrior by someone like Oogway you would have a sense of obligation to try and become the person that's fit for the role.

>Tigress never had a choice.

We don't know that. All we saw was her training as a child maybe she chose to take up martial arts? She could have left when she got older too but she chose to stay."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"I feel like the position Po was in versus Tigress definitely leaves more enthusiastic consent wiggle room, plus Tai Lung's escape wasn't something anyone could have foreseen and so it's not like they thrust Po into that pool without any floaties from the get-go.

I just feel like Tigress could've been set on a path she might not have chosen if as children we can understand the sacrifices we have to make to become an expert in anything. Maybe Oogway felt remorse about this, just a suggestion."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,">I just feel like Tigress could've been set on a path she might not have chosen if as children we can understand the sacrifices we have to make to become an expert in anything. Maybe Oogway felt remorse about this, just a suggestion.

The issue is that's all pure speculation."
DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda Awesome Secrets,"Obviously, like I said his methods are still a mystery.

But I think the movie supports it. Tigress wanted Shifu's love and didn't necessarily get it. That's a direct consequence."
