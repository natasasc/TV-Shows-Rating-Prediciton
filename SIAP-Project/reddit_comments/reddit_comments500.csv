TV Show,Comment
The Woods,A mammal is how I would desribe Corden.
The Woods,Has James Corden ever been in anything good?
The Woods,"This review is of two separate shows and it feels very lazy. They don't give reasons why they feel the way they do, or what exactly does not work but it just says one is self conscious and the other is mostly about James Cordons other works. I really expected better articulated thoughts, but It might as well be if your friend told you he didn't like the vibes and never eleborated"
The Woods,"I'm halfway through *The English* and am pleasantly surprised--the plot is pretty reductive of 1883 and lots of other recent westerns but the **writer's** spot-on Alfie Solomons impersonation is weird and amusing, the actors, especially the nicely twisted villians,  seem to be having fun (Tom what's his name from *Victoria* always plays the same character anyway) and its well shot. I'll definitely finish it."
The Woods,The way the title is formatted made me think we were due for an *Into the Woods* reunion - I wouldn’t have minded that at all.
The Woods,What was the point of Mammals other than to make you feel bad?
The Woods,"James corden is a refreshing (but diasppointing in his case) reminder that reddit’s opinions are tiny and insignificant.

Absolutely unanimously hated on here, and yet he continues to get job after job and continue with his shitty show."
The Woods,"Corden has created and acted well in lots of good stuff. Gavin and Stacey, the history boys, The Wrong Mans to name a few. He was actually a fun personality on british TV in his early days.

Theres a reason he became a big star. He had xfactor that he kinda pissed away by being a dick and in some shit. It's a remarkable downfall in terms of respect whilst somehow also still getting roles

I'm 2 episode into this and it's alright. Intriguing, well shot, well acted and has some gravity. Its not necessarily wholly original. But there are infinitely worse shows in the world. And yet this is on 3.2 on IMDB because people hate James Corden so much. Its fascinating."
The Woods,I don't understand why *The English* seems to be DOA. It's the best thing that I have seen in years.
The Woods,James corden can’t lead his own shit out if his own ass.
The Woods,Can we have just have review threads rather than just one single publication being listed. You still have to end up checking if the review is in agreement with others or is an outlier.
The Woods,Boozy pandas are a kind of mammal so that makes sense
The Woods,And you’d be 100% correct…
The Woods,Only just.
The Woods,"It's amazing how hated he is, and yet he gets more work."
The Woods,"Well I can’t stand Corden and Adam Levin but still liked Begin Again (2013) , so there’s that."
The Woods,I liked his 2 Doctor Who episodes.
The Woods,History Boys
The Woods,This is Gavin and Stacey erasure and I won't stand for it
The Woods,"He's in two great episodes of Doctor Who, and is good in them. It's literally the only thing I've ever seen him in, so a lot of the hate everyone has for him seems a little weird to me at times"
The Woods,Gavin and Stacy that’s it
The Woods,"One Man Two Guvnors, but that was before he settled into his shtick"
The Woods,I thought he did a great job playing a fat pussy…. cat
The Woods,begin again. One of my favorite movies but hes not a main character
The Woods,"The first Peter Rabbit movie, oddly enough, but that's because of everyone else that was in it."
The Woods,"teachers (the uk show, first 3 seasons, s4 sucked) and gavin & stacey."
The Woods,I thought Into the Woods was decent. My daughter loved it and we don’t get much theater where we live. That said … woulda been better with someone else in his role.
The Woods,History Boys and Telstar
The Woods,The only thing I haven’t mind from him is his small role in Oceans 8.
The Woods,"he's supposed to be really good at musicals and stuff.

he was in some british comedy show, ~~Gwen~~Gavin and Stacy?, something like that, never seen it."
The Woods,No
The Woods,He gave quite a performance in the Mike Leigh film “All or Nothing”. It was honestly very surprising.
The Woods,"Big Fat Quiz, but that was good because Sean Lock was there."
The Woods,Prison would be good?
The Woods,You’re only 1/2 way through… just wait.  Oh.  Just wait.
The Woods,"I'm transfixed by this show, I think it's brilliant."
The Woods,it's not only reddit that james corden gets shit on though
The Woods,I've never met anyone who does like James Corden tbh. Twitter is equally as harsh on him. Just not an entertaining or charismatic person.
The Woods,He's a good actor but a bit of a fuck in real life
The Woods,His wife is just plain horrible and it makes the plot and show unnecessary.
The Woods,🤣🤣🤣
The Woods,I think it's blackmail. And/or in reality I think it's in his contract with ABC to be guaranteed x amount of roles.
The Woods,He’s got pictures of someone big.
The Woods,Does his character die horribly?
The Woods,"The only thing I have ever seen him in is that Channel 4 show Teachers with Andrew Lincoln, like 20 years ago."
The Woods,"Meh, he’s thoroughly replaceable.

At one point we’re supposed to believe his character plays football (soccer) in his free time.  That was a level of disbelief I couldn’t suspend."
The Woods,Ugh. That performance was awful. Lots of high speed rambling off nonsense with “gee aren’t I clever to have memorized that?” mugging to go with it.
The Woods,The only justifiable reason for myxomatosis?
The Woods,"yeah, but the movie is ass so his point still stands"
The Woods,"Yeah, I don't think it's blackmail, hes just a mascot for ABC, hes some executives pet.

He also works really hard, I'll give him that. He seems to do dozens of projects a year, including his show. They're all crap, but still, he ain't lazy."
The Woods,He has a baby in 1 so maybe.
The Woods,I wish he was.
The Woods,He’s at cbs.
The Woods,"More Krysten Ritter is a good thing. But I'm still very sad this means less of a chance of more Jessica Jones, and *even* less of a chance of more 'Don't Trust The Bitch in Apartment 23' - otherwise known as the best show in the world ever."
The Woods,JESSSSSSICCCCAAAAAAHH
The Woods,Hey that’s the B from apt 23
The Woods,"good for her, sounds like an interesting show."
The Woods,"Hey Krysten, I can take you to a place where it doesn't smell like this.."
The Woods,I cant get over that Netflix cancelled JJ...
The Woods,"Interesting, I wonder if this will mean more adapations from Crypt TV if its successful."
The Woods,Crypt tv has some really good stuff. The thing in the apartment is one of the scariest horror shorts I’ve seen
The Woods,"She can do comedy and drama, she’s insanely hot, she’s whip-smart, and has the poise and presence of mind to survive The Eric Andre Show, AND she can direct? Krysten Ritter may be the next Martin Scorsese."
The Woods,**I** **Th**ought s**He** overdo**Se**d on **He**roin?
The Woods,question is will it be free2see?
The Woods,This might actually make me kick in for premium Peacock
The Woods,I love crypt tv
The Woods,I love crypt Tv!
The Woods,She is striking
The Woods,"Reading: sounds cool! \*gets to part where it's on Peacock\* ah, a shame I wont be watching this"
The Woods,I thought that this was tales from the crypt at first and got super excited
The Woods,This is superb news. I adore Krysten!
The Woods,Hooray for more saturation of already famous people in Hollywood rather than letting the people who made the Crypt TV shorts direct and find success.... that's exactly what we need /s
The Woods,"2 words, Smoke Show."
The Woods,Went from: that sounds super cool! To: totally uninterested the moment I saw that it’s a Peacock exclusive…
The Woods,She looks like a vampire.
The Woods,I always see Michael Jackson’s nose when I see her profile in Jessica Jones.
The Woods,Peacock is fucking trash
The Woods,I just don't understand the craze for Krysten. My favorite performance from her is when she died on Breaking Bad
The Woods,Hopefully she can direct better than she acts. Jessica Jones was hot garbage. No personality and boring af to watch on screen. I heard her other show about the bitch in the apartment was good but I’ll pass.
The Woods,i'm so excited to see krysten ritter make a monster hunter show!!
The Woods,"> For Peacock

So no one will see it, ok"
The Woods,"I love Crypt TV. If you haven’t yet, check out their YouTube channel."
The Woods,">'Don't Trust The Bitch in Apartment 23' 

This was such a good show, I wonder how much the silly title affected it's ratings."
The Woods,Jessica Jones is probably done for good. They had the best villain and Jessica's archenemy killed off in season 1 and it went downhill real fast.
The Woods,OMG don't get me started on don't trust the bitch in apartment 26 which was the original title I believe.
The Woods,"I wish DTTBIA23 would come back. I don’t think people realized just how wacky it was. 

Side note, I  wonder if Eric Andre would ever agree to be in a potential reboot/continuation."
The Woods,"Amen to DTTBIA23 being the best show. I rewatch it every couple months, never gets old or makes me laugh any less"
The Woods,Hmm i was just reading the other day that her and cox were in talks to come back and reprise their roles
The Woods,I never thought I’d adore James Van Der Beek... then I watched Don’t Trust the B...
The Woods,"Jessica Jones is easily the best thing Marvel has ever done. Killgrave is the best villain too, and it’s hilariously not even close."
The Woods,"She is directing, not starring."
The Woods,THANK YOU.
The Woods,That was a fun show.
The Woods,She's directing - this isn't per se more Kristen Ritter
The Woods,Jessica Jones S3 was trash tho
The Woods,Dont trust her
The Woods,It was inevitable after Disney+ but last episode was like a final. Of course they could make more.
The Woods,It was a so-so show with a lot of filler. Par for the course for being cancelled.
The Woods,">Crypt tv

how do you watch this stuff?  youtube?"
The Woods,"She's also an author, aka she writes too."
The Search,Oh fuck he's fired. I haven't been paying attention to the story. Must be pretty bad.
The Search,"Aw jeez, when are auditions?"
The Search,I'm not celebrating the career of a domestic abuser. I don't give a fuck about his last scene because he is a disgusting person
The Search,"seriously?  Doesn't he own the rights to the show and characters?  He's the lead voice actor as well as the producer/writer, isn't he?"
The Search,"Aw, geez"
The Search,Good riddance
The Search,"Are you guys trying to celebrate him or something? He didn't die, he's a sex pest."
The Search,good thing i stopped after the half way point of season 4
The Search,"Good luck to them. Hope it's not too noticeable that they're different voices. Other than that, big woop"
The Search,I hope it's just allegations and not true
The Search,I've heard they're shopping R&M to other studios. Might not recast the MCs  if the new studio will work with Roiland
The Search,Charged with felony domestic violence.
The Search,"The charges were one thing, but grooming children on Twitter was probably the final straw."
The Search,Would the network be able to see any evidence ahead of the trial? Or talk to his lawyer to see how they think things will go down? Wondering if they saw it as an open and shut case and are getting ahead of it.
The Search,"He kind of already did them. A few months ago there was a long video segment on Variety.com where Justin ran through like a dozen different Rick and Morty impressionists he found from YouTube and Twitch. Some of them were really close on one or both of the voices, even Justin said one guy was so close it was spooky. 

I suspect Adult Swim will approach one or more of these folks, and do proper auditions with them if they are interested in taking over the roles. Most of them didn’t seem to be professional voice actors, so that may be a bit of a consideration if you’re supposed to do two of the starring characters in the show, but then the guy they hired as the new Cleveland Brown on Family Guy wasn’t an established voice actor and he’s done just fine."
The Search,Creators almost never own the rights to the characters/shows they've made. Rick and Morty is Cartoon Network IP.
The Search,"They can buy him out of any lingering rights he has to appear as producer. He'll accept it because it's likely the last money he's going to get in the entertainment industry for the next 5 years because he's going to be persona-non-grata until people forget like they sorta did with Mel Gibson (Mel's sins were far less sinister than what Justin did, so who knows?)"
The Search,Once it goes to a network they almost never do
The Search,"I mean, it's a bit of a leap to assume everyone talking about this scene is crying because they're so sad he's gone. This is still news to a lot of people, myself included, and his last scene is interesting contextually, as whatever follows it will have to explain the new voices."
The Search,not a sex pest. Someone who brutalized his girlfriend. There's a difference between Louis CK asking women if he can show them his dick and what Justin did.
The Search,Doesn’t Adult Swim have exclusive rights to the show unless they willingly give it up?
The Search,Yeah that’s what I heard.
The Search,"I just[ had it up](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roiland-complaint.pdf), so might as well...

> The Orange County District Attorney charges that in Orange
> County, California, the law was violated as follows:

> unlawfully violate the personal liberty of JANE DOE by
> violence, menace, fraud, and deceit."
The Search,"Was this proven? I've heard obviously stories, but never heard if they actually found anything."
The Search,"It's not even just the trial.  There's also the credible teenage grooming allegations over DM and voice chats, the past podcast remarks sexualizing teenagers, whatever's in his HR record, and whatever the employees at the various shows say.  The trial, the criminal liability, is one hell of a cherry on top.

Ultimately, it's everything.  I don't know if the State of California will be able to prove a charge of felony domestic violence to the satisfaction of 12 random people, but the network is well within their rights to say they've seen enough whether they can or not."
The Search,"not sure why a legit question got downvoted, but I guess it's just Reddit.  

Anyhow, that's interesting considering he's basically involved in every part of the show.  It'd be like doing Family Guy without Seth MacFarlane."
The Search,"I think it's jointly held, right? He'll continue to make bank as long as it runs."
The Search,"> Mel's sins were far less sinister than what Justin did, so who knows?

Less sinister from a legal standpoint, maybe."
The Search,Yeah most IPs are owned by either the network (most of Adult Swim's stuff) or the biggest studio involved (like how Sony owns The Boondocks). Almost never the creator.
The Search,Unless those Twitter GMs turn out to be actual grooming and not extremely gross and inappropriate.
The Search,"I'm glad she's unlisted. There are R&M fans that would almost certainly be harassing the fuck out of this poor woman because she got their 'hero' fired. And I'm certain when it goes to trial, unless he gets a deal, they will dox her and there will be harassment.

The same type who were screaming at people at McDonalds over Szechuan sauce.... i.e. unhinged assholes who the show appeals to because they think they're Rick-like.

Justin is no hero and i looked up to him at one point. He disgusts me."
The Search,"Well, yes. They’ve been doing (the writing of) *Family Guy* (and *American Dad!*) without Seth MacFarlane for years now (since 2005). The same with Roiland — it has been six years since he wrote for *Rick and Morty*.

It would just be the voices being replaced — the writing quality should remain the same."
The Search,Dan Harmon was just as important if not more so to the direction of the show and he’s still around.
The Search,yeah sorry i just heard about the twitter stuff in this thread after i wrote that. This is more about the beating up the girlfriend thing but that's incredibly gross and unacceptable too.
The Search,"> The same type who were screaming at people at McDonalds over Szechuan sauce

The legend of this incident keeps growing year after year. Wasn't it like one guy who did it for internet points, or even viral marketing for the show? 

Now it has become a story where mobs of crazed fans were rioting in restaurants across the globe."
The Search,There is no evidence it’s all hearsay you dumb fuck
The Search,When the show turns to shit because the impressionist Is gonna be shit. No one is gonna wanna hear how the next 2 seasons after are awful.
The Search,"I guess that could go either way.  I kind of left Family Guy and American Dad by the wayside a few seasons back.  Granted, I think the season 3-5 of Rick and Morty were the strongest, so I suppose we'll see."
The Search,"Dan Harmon is absolutely essential to the show writing-wise. If he weren’t involved any longer, I wouldn’t really want to see the show continue. 

You can see what Rick and Morty would look like without Dan Harmon‘s influence if you watch Solar Opposites. It’s good, but not in quite the same way Rick and Morty usually is."
The Search,I read the guy did that because he was *specifically trying* to make RM fans look unhinged
The Search,oh no did i hurt your childlike innocence?
The Search,"That would have been when Roiland stopped writing for the series, yes (but for one part of “Morty’s Mind Blowers”). So it all hinges on the new actor(s) really, as to whether or not the performances will be on par with what has been done so far."
The Search,"that's the actual truth, but it's not nearly as salacious as mobs of thousands of crazed fans rioting in the streets, which gets a lot more clicks"
The Search,Zero evidence boss all hearsay
The Search,"No! More cringeworthy! More confused!

Give me a dating show that only uses identical twins! A dating show about people who have donated organs to each other! A dating show where each pairing is a person and their pet!

I want insanity!! Pure, unfiltered insanity!"
The Search,"I still think Netflix can be the one streaming company that finally gives us that whole ""11 straight guys, one gay guy"" meme show.

EDIT: [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/13idgk/a_reality_show_idea_with_gay_men/)"
The Search,"As tastelessness goes, Brazilian TV did even worse. 1 guy, 11 Trans women and one cis woman"
The Search,Loved the earlier seasons.  The last one fell flat for me.
The Search,Who requires an explanation? It was a fun ride across several genres.
The Search,"I mean, I personally am curious as to why they chose to include zombies."
The Search,Is this show actually worth a watch?
The Search,Yup
The Search,There's already a documentary exactly about this. It's called [The Thread \(2015\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4211516/).
The Search,"That doc is so misleading. Those internet detectives in the end really didn't do jack shit. It was a combination of the police and internet cafe guy who saw him on the news that lead to this guys downfall. The title of the doc should be ""Don't kill people"" because this guy killed cats multiple times with no real consequences. It was when he started killing people that really lead to this guys downfall."
The Search,I've only seen one episode of this so far but it did rub me the wrong way how the internet sleuths are painted as heroes here and there's only one off-hand mention about how they basically accused (and I guess potentially doxxed?) a bunch of innocent people before finding the right person. I understand that's not the point of the story but when your subjects are two of the people who found him you should probably make more of an effort to discourage people watching from doing that sort of thing.
The Search,[deleted]
The Search,"""tad bit inflated"" is an understatement.  The 2 people they interviewed had a seriously inflated opinion of their investigative abilities.  One of them went on a 5-minute ""mind-blowing"" explanation on how he used Google Maps as though it was some sort of hidden secret.  He treated it like he was breaking the case open even though it had 0 impact on finding the person, and any person whose ever used Google Maps before could have done the same.  

In fact, their only contribution to the case was because some random stranger messaged them and told them who the person was!  They would never have figured it out otherwise."
The Search,"I enjoyed the doc until the very end when the woman who dedicated most of her life to internet sleuthing turned to the camera and blamed the audience. No, idiot - you're the one obsessive pretend detective on a power trip. You're the one that egged him on to commit more and more crimes. Then you have the gall to blame us. Self reflection, lady!"
The Search,"I absolutely cannot stand how Reddit is both stupid and egotistical when it comes to real-world issues.

Our subreddits and upvote system inherently promotes bias and we thrive though mob-mentality. 

Most of us skim through news posts without clicking on the article, get angry at emojis and repost for karma. We’re not capable of becoming these super-sleuths we keep on insisting we are..."
The Search,">as a lot of the progress in case was hand fed to the group

Correct me if I'm wrong, I checked out half way through the 2nd episode, but wasn't all of the *useful* information hand fed to them? The name of the guy, for example, was literally given to them. Their Internet sleuthing turned up pretty much nothing useful without this."
The Search,"I'm honestly just enraged by the RIDICULOUS amount of padding in that fucking thing. It should have been half as long as it is, if not less."
The Search,"This documentary sucked.

The story is interesting, for sure. But to have it narrated and not even correct their copious linguistic fuck-ups was terrible. (Foilage, verbage, etc.)
Also, to point at your audience at the end and try to infer that we're complicit somehow, that's fucking tasteless. The makers of the movie and the dunces that tried to track him down from their homes KNEW this guy wanted his life to play out like a movie, so they went and made a movie about his life, are you fucking kidding me? Then you have the audacity to blame me as the viewer? Get the fuck outta here."
The Search,"The CLAW

I remember following a fantastic act of internet vigilantism as it unfolded on a car enthusiast forum where a poster had their SkyLine stolen. Over the next 48 hours, the car was spotted driving around the area by other members, the driver was identified (notably due to his lack of fingers that earned his name The Claw) and memes were made leading to their arrest. Well not the meme part.  

Original thread was an awesome read: https://forums.beyond.ca/threads/212943-1991-skyline-gt-r-stolen!-calgary-ab-cash-reward*pics-of-criminals-inside*

The Search,"I think the boston bomber has more to do with the rage boner that so many redditors get. OMG look at this guy who parked at an angle, lets fuck him up!!!!!!!!!

Its still here, probably even worse than back then and any effort to point it out just gets your comment negged out of existence."
The Search,"I refuse to stroke the killers ego by contributing to that shows popularity. He literally killed those people to become famous. Now all I hear is ""wow he was so insane"". Everyone is speaking his name. No one new it before stupid Netflix came in and now hes dieing a happy man."
The Search,"This stunk honestly. They ended up being incredibly inconsequential, and I was pretty put off by a lot of it. I mean, the title being about the cats that were murdered, while sad and awful, is quite disrespectful to the fact that an innocent human being was brutally murdered. They barely spent any time on him, the PERSON with a family that was killed senselessly. 

Also the main lady for some reason had to use profanity every sentence. Im not really a stiff in this regard at all as I curse quite a bit, but its odd seeing it in a documentary with this level of production value- it almost felt forced, like they were using it to endear you to her or something. 

Finally, scolding the audience for bringing attention to this murdering shitstack? I mean, you made a documentary about it and advertised it to death on the front page of netflix. All this guy ever wanted was attention, and you gave him more than he couldve ever dreamed of with this mediocre at best miniseries that pales in comparison to making a murderer, the staircase, etc. Trash"
The Search,"Followed by how Reddit solved Epstein's """"murder"""" 

Such great investigators we have here"
The Search,[deleted]
The Search,"Not a bad idea. Could be an anthology series as I'm sure there are more such stories. 

Hell, we could even do this with other social media platforms!"
The Search,">Although I’d argue that the role of the internet group from “Don’t Fuck With Cats” was inflated in the documentary, as a lot of the progress in case was hand fed to the group, it did paint internet vigilantism in a somewhat positive light. Within the first episode however, there is a brief detour when the group flags a suspect incorrectly, even though that individual wasn’t connected whatsoever and had committed suicide prior to his identification.


Yeah, if you really read between the lines, the only things they accomplished were 1) getting the wrong guy to kill himself and 2) probably egging on the killer to move on to murdering a human in cold blood.  The rest was basically them getting hints (probably from the killer) about what was going on.  But when the actual murder happened, the police basically found the guy without any help from them at all."
The Search,"Speaking of that documentary, what a waste of time. The final episode is the most audacious bullcrap I’ve ever been insulted watching. They interview the victim’s best friend, who mourns the fact that no one ever makes a big deal over the victim himself, just his killer. That gets two minutes before they go back to talking about the killer. The filmmakers are the very problem they’re documenting. And then at the end they pull the stupidest most insulting move possible, blaming the audience for bringing more attention to a killer who was all about attention. Like excuse me, but I didn’t know that would be the outcome when starting the show! But the filmmakers absolutely knew before they started making this documentary. They ask the audience to watch their murder documentary, which they made knowing the subject wanted to be some sick, twisted movie star, and then scold the audience for daring to give attention to such a thing. It made me so freaking mad."
The Search,"[Actually, I saw a documentary about it screened during the Boston Asian-American Film Festival years back.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2hkDeUwDwU) . Not sure where it's viewable now.

You can rent it on Amazon Prime video or if you have the Kanopy app (free with many public library memberships) you can watch it for free."
The Search,"It was insane and I had to watch from start to finish, but unlike the show let's not gloss over the fact that because of constant harassment by the internet mob that a very clearly innocent man was cyberbullied into suicide."
The Search,"Nothing portrays the capacity for good and evil of the internet more than good old /Pol and 4chan in general.

Post a vid of you drowning puppies? They find out your name, address, location, time of shooting, location of river, tell animal rescue, tell local police...

Smack someone in the head with a bikelock during a protest? Analyse days of footage, identify individual, find name, place of work...

But it's also 4chan so..."
The Search,"The problem isn’t just the amateur investigating here, it’s that news sites and programs then take that as a “source”. The other day I was looking into why a character had been recast in a show I like, the first thing to come up was a reddit thread, sometimes there’s useful stuff like official comments from production crew on reddit, so I read the thread. It’s nothing but speculation.
I go back to my searches and scroll down looking for a legitimate new site and find one that looks like it covers media as its thing. I start reading it and it was literally quoting the reddit thread."
The Search,"let the pros be the pros, and spend your energy elsewhere"
The Search,"I checked the reviews and plot of the show online when one of my friend recommended it saying it was amazing and clever! I wasn't too impressed with the plot or the reviews but decided to give it a go just on the recommendation. 

My take after watching it was that although it was an interesting watch, the interesting part was not about any cleverness, but the sheer stupidity of both Luka and those ""home detectives"" trying to catch him. At one point it got funny how stupid everyone were. 

Luka himself is one of the dumbest criminal. And I am not even talking about him giving out evidence; I know he wanted the attention and wanted to be chased. But even serial killers who gave out clues and who wanted to be chased were clever in not actually being caught. He was totally unaware of security cameras, used his credit card while he was on the run, went to a public cafe to check himself on Interpol - all that was just amateur behavior; not someone who is a ""genius"" as they tried to portray. Even the lawyer at the end who said ""he planned his defence one and half year before the crime"". No you dumb shit, he did not! He was, at that time, trying to put a defence for his crimes at the time (the cat killings), and a very idiotic one at that. Creating a fake person as a defence is not genius...way many more people have tried this before Luka.

Then, those internet detectives!! Man! If this documentary was about just Luka and his murder, and with just a backstory about his cat killings, it would have made more sense. Making it all about the cats and those detectives was a gimmicky and poor decision by the makers. They literally had zero skills. Obsessing over something by creating folders of information and using google maps to find places does not make you a detective, it just means you have way too much time on your hands. And while I understand the anger they felt, they just became pawns in his game. One of the most laughable fact was that early on they talk about the power outlets, and one of their first conclusion is ""Definitely not North American"". Then, they have the ciggarettes, again the conclusion was ""Not North American"", and then they find a yellow vaccum cleaner, and found it being sold in North America, so concluded that it was North American guy. Really?? Cigarettes could have been bought at an airport, the power outlet can be forgotten, but someone having a north american vaccum cleaner is definite proof???? I myself have bought vaccum cleaners in North America for people who went back to other countries. How was that ANY proof??

This whole documentary could be summed up by one of the things John Green said at the end ""We asked ourselves, Do we really want to give more attention to this person?"" Well...apparently you answered yes, and still trying to be righteous about it."
The Search,"*""Netflix, you're greenlit!""*"
The Search,"While watching that, I really expected Reddit to be involved.  I was kind of relieved that we weren't though."
The Search,Will it touch on the fact that the police and FBI went on national tv and asked for people to search through photos and shit to help find the bombers?
The Search,That documentary was mostly a cringe compilation of whiny idiots
The Search,"Tried this show since everybody's talking about it online.  It seems like there might be a compelling story, but choosing to have the ""internet sleuth"" narrate it in her own words was clearly a mistake.  I watched about 15 minutes before the format just rubbed me the wrong way.  They should've gone for more of a polished documentary feel than reality show confession cam."
The Search,I think Netflix wanted to release this doc before that musical film hit theaters...
The Search,"I remember reading [this article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/who-set-jessica-chambers-on-fire-the-internet-is-trying-to-f) which covers the awful part internet detectives played 

>These people — who range from C-list conservative bloggers to gluten-free bakers from Montreal, boat enthusiasts from Florida, and grocery-coupon collectors from North Carolina — claim to want #JusticeForJessica above all. Instead, they’ve terrorized her formerly sleepy hometown with their relentless demands for answers to their specious theories. In the process, they’ve spread rumors that have filtered into real life, igniting racial tensions, digging up old skeletons, and reawakening feuds. For these amateur detectives, Jessica’s death isn’t a mother's tragedy. It’s a pastime.

>Media critics use the phrase “missing white woman syndrome” to refer to the national obsession with victims who are young, blonde, and white, and Jessica checked all those boxes: The flaxen-haired former cheerleader weighed “90 pounds on a good day,” according to her mother. But the people who are fixated on Jessica’s death are exceptionally invested thanks to her tiny hometown. It’s easy for outsiders to track down social media accounts and even phone numbers for Jessica’s family members, friends, ex-boyfriends, and reputed enemies, all of whom said they’ve been contacted by strangers intent on cross-examining them about whether they killed a teenage girl.

>""Could you send us a phone log confirming you were where you say you were the night Jessica died? Why does your white truck look like the white truck that a commenter said might belong to the murderer? Care to explain that 2003 drug possession charge?""

>If locals engage with their interrogators, they end up arguing all day with people they’ve never met. They can’t avoid suspicion by staying offline, either, because when they do so, they appear even guiltier."
The Search,This is absolutely nothing. Meanwhile take a look at 4Chan taking down Shia LaBoeuf's flag
The Search,That would be a very anticlimactic doc...
The Search,I wish I could unread all of this. I was looking at memes and then this killed the vibe.
The Search,When I read the title of this documentary I thought 'is this about NEDM?' I was really disappointed when I found out it wasn't. I think that would have made for a better story.
The Search,"Tbh reddit should just leave the searching for important things to 4chan, their weaponized autism is next level. 

Specially with capture the flag..and that dude from transformers that I cant remember or spell if I tried."
The Search,"Honest and controversial opinion on Don’t Fuck With Cats... 

Those kittens where picked up for free off of Craigslist and where to be suffocated and frozen for python food regardless. 

If you have ever owned a python you will find that this practice is unfortunately common place. Pythons are expensive animals and a lot of owners will seek out free pets online to use as food. The suffocation with a vacuum bag is one of the more humane ways to do this. 

Did he have to record it? No.
Did he get the reaction he wanted? Undoubtedly.

But it was only due to that reaction that other kittens and then his victim where harmed to an extreme extent.

My heart goes out to the victim and the other animals abused for attention, but he should never have had that much attention to begin with.

...

Side note: I just want to point out that yes I have owned a python, but no I have never taken part in this practice. I would buy frozen rats, mice and gerbils from the local pet shop. 

NEVER give away pets for free online."
The Search,WHERE THE FUXK IS BAUDI ?!
The Search,"the only internet group that has achieved anything of note is 4chan, id really like a non bullshit documentary about them. but it has to be from their perspective or itd be garbage"
The Search,"A thorough documentary on the Boston bombers would be great. It should look into these things:

1) The older Tsarnaev brother was caught by police and stripped naked on the street, there's even videos and pictures of this, but later the official story changed to ""he was run over by his younger brother""

2) There are images of the younger brother surrendering to cops but there's no way to get his side of the story because he was shot in the throat.

3) A friend of the Tsarnaev brothers, Ibragim Todashev, was killed in his apartment by FBI agents. Why?

4) Two FBI agents involved in the case later ""fell out of a helicopter"" and died."
The Search,"Or remember the case, where a guy murdered his gf and was found through 4chan?"
The Search,"Lol of course they fucked it up. What would Redditors have done even if they found the real Boston bomber? Left passive aggressive, self righteous comments on their social media posts? Downvoted them to death?!"
The Search,I just found it funny how much people cared about this (which they should) but dont give a shit about what is done to animals in the meat industry. they are treated just as poorly before being eaten.
The Search,The op should have a job commissioning tv shows; wait around for a rival network to broadcast a successful show then commission a number of similar shows to compete.
The Search,"Frankly, those folks were TOO self congratulatory imo."
The Search,Speaking of Don't F\*\*\* With Cats did anyone else think the Facebook group didn't do anything in the end?
The Search,Start writing the script. Getting picked up by Netflix these days seems like an attainable goal.
Whispers,"Just keep SNW and Lower Decks going and I'll be happy.  

I'm glad they're allowing them to do some additional filming to wrap up the series and S5 clearly wasn't the planned ending."
Whispers,SNW is gonna be the tent pole Trek show it seems. LETS GO!!!
Whispers,"From three live action Trek show to just the one. Taylor Sheridan is the new cash cow IP that Paramount is betting their future on. 

Be interesting to see if they get a new live action Trek show ready to go for 2025 or if they just cannot afford it and plan to milk just one series and the Trek library and think that will be enough."
Whispers,"The protagonist in this show always confused me.

They got a really strong actress to play her, but so much of the writing for the character seemed like it was coming from some really awful fan fiction."
Whispers,"Discovery is my least favorite of the franchise.  I'm a trekie, was really excited for the show, and really wanted to like it.  But I just could get into any of the characters or the plots."
Whispers,"It’s a mercy killing.

Thank goodness we won’t have to watch Michael Burnham crying again."
Whispers,"The show's had its ups and downs. S1 and S2 had a lot of great moments and I liked that they tried some different things, even if they didn't always land. S3 & S4 are less offensive (for lack of a better term) to Trek sensibilities but I found the show's gotten really boring. I hope we can have an exciting fifth season.

I wonder where the franchise goes after Picard and this are over. There's hundreds of years they can fill in now, tons of characters they can spinoff or use elsewhere. Hopefully they make good of it and take the right lessons from the less successful shows from this era of Trek."
Whispers,TIL there are 5 seasons of Star Trek discovery.
Whispers,"For me, season four is tied with Picard season two for the worst Trek season ever."
Whispers,Therapy cancelled.
Whispers,"Only one more season of ""mysterious threat"" while Michael cries about it to go!"
Whispers,"I can't believe this got 5 seasons.  The first season was bad, but Jason Isaacs carried it a bit.  The second season was dreadful - I couldn't finish it - so either it had a dramatic swing in quality or people just watch anything with star trek on it"
Whispers,I remember when it was supposed to be an anthology series.
Whispers,Haven't watched since S2. Glad they're not spending money on it anymore. I'll sign up to watch SNW and Lower Decks.  If they do a 7-of-9 leading Titan show I'd watch that for a bit...  Unsure the current show runners can be trusted with any new shows though.
Whispers,I’m so angry this lasted longer than enterprise
Whispers,Good riddance
Whispers,"It's the worst one, out of all the newer Star Trek shows. Smart move, canceling."
Whispers,"I wonder what dumb, inane, melodramatic thing will be the center point of season 5?

Will Michaels tears heal a plague or something?"
Whispers,Thank fuck.
Whispers,The Pike character was the best thing to come out of this series.. once he was gone it felt like some CW melodrama.
Whispers,"Im... surprised they got that many seasons. Wow. I like Star Trek so I watched the first season and a bit of the second before deciding it was just too fucking cringe to possibly watch anymore.


Kudos to the trekkies that made it this far I guess."
Whispers,Maybe giving the space ship emotions meant they ran out of plot ideas
Whispers,This is good news. Discovery has become terrible and SNW is great. I feared that SNW would be sacrificed for Burnham.
Whispers,I can't believe that travesty got past season 2.
Whispers,"Good. Discovery failed because every season it was about something else.  So even though it had lots of good ideas, no one idea could could ever gain it’s footing and flourish. 

And then of course there was all the whining about people’s feelings."
Whispers,Of all the ST series that I have watched over the last 50 years … STD was by far the biggest disappointment. It will not be missed by me.
Whispers,"Thank god. Both atrocities (Picard and Discovery) ending. Keep Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks. 

Its too bad theyre committed to this terrible reboot universe or whatever the F it is since theyre still going forward with a Section 31 show i assume. The one thing that should be kept a mystery."
Whispers,"Keep Prodigy and Lower Decks. Give me Captain Harry Kim. Please, I beg of you."
Whispers,"The cast and crew are great. 

The acting is great. 

The SFX are great. 

But the writing is anything but. 

Their explanation for what causes The Burn in Season 3 was dreadful. Like I get the angle that Discovery is trying to take but *that* was the best they could come up with?"
Whispers,are they fucking crying in the thumbnail too?!
Whispers,"I watched a whole season of this shit without learning what any of the characters' names are, or why I should care about them. ""Because they're on Star Trek"" isn't a good enough reason.

Michael is the main lady, every episode is written around her saving the galaxy by herself again. There's captain Orca, there's Michelle Yeoh, there's the skinny guy. There's the gay guy, and his boyfriend the other gay guy. The redhead is the ""like OMG I'm just so awkward"" character, and there's another whole lady who has robot things on her face. Michael had a boyfriend who was a Klingon in disguise. At some point they added possibly the most boring comedian out there to add... humor? to the show.

I knew more about the crew of the Enterprise after the first episode of Next Generation than I did after a whole season of Discovery."
Whispers,Am I the only one who thought this show was subpar bordering on hard to watch compared to literally every other Star Trek show ever? Or is something wrong w/me?
Whispers,Good. This one was never very good.
Whispers,How many seasons can they save the entire galaxy every single time? Could have been better.
Whispers,That trash show should have stopped after season 2.
Whispers,Can anyone who still watches tell me if Michael still cries in every episode
Whispers,I cant believe this shitshow managed to stay afloat for 5 seasons.
Whispers,Whew! The Amoxicillin finally kicked in. Took long enough. Don't how much more of that burnham sensation I could stand to take.
Whispers,"Although I love Trek shows, I'm glad. I'm tired of Burnham crying in every episode over stupid stakes. As long as Strange New Worlds sticks around, I'm happy."
Whispers,"I just want 10years after Voyager... see what happened in the galaxy post the dominion wars.

It be nice to have an old school 20 season show as well... every single episode doesn't have to have the fate of the universe... 

since Voyager we've had. Enterprise (prequel) Kirk reboot films (prequel) DIsco (prequel) SNW (prequel) and then Picard which was what 30 years into the future, but solely focus's on picard... not so much about the state of things"
Whispers,"I honestly can't believe this got past S1. The worst trek by far.

Hopefully prodigy survives."
Whispers,"Thank god, fuck this show."
Whispers,Paramount bet big on the creator of multiple dead on arrival franchises.
Whispers,Good riddance!
Whispers,A truly awful show
Whispers,Oh thank god it’s finally over
Whispers,How to fuck did it get too five seasons.
Whispers,Season 4 **WAS SO BAD**
Whispers,Good riddance
Whispers,"I really think that Star Trek needs a minor reset.  They need to make Discovery's future an alternate timeline and advance with the Picard universe.  I am not saying that Picard seasons 1 and 2 were awesome, but you can build off that universe and have some older TNG, DS9, and Voy characters as stars and connect with old Trek fandom, but not worry about the Discovery dilithium disaster."
Whispers,"give strange new worlds at least as many seasons as this trash was given. lierally the best part of discovery was pike on season 2 as a supporting character, he was so good they built an entire series around him. nothing on discovery works."
Whispers,"try to watch it, but it was just too bad. RIP"
Whispers,Frankly this show is probably twice as expensive as SNW but gets less viewers so I'm not surprised. I'm not sure there will be 3 live action shows a year again but they're gonna have more than just SNW. Maybe Seven gets a command (Titan maybe)
Whispers,Fantastic news.
Whispers,It should have ended with season 1
Whispers,"Too much crying for gods sake. Even the thumbnail!


 I still enjoyed S1 a lot though. 
The dillitium plot line was bonkers. .."
Whispers,Thank god.
Whispers,"I haven’t hated Discovery, but I’m not disappointed with this.

Keep Lower Decks, Prodigy, and Strange New Worlds and I’m happy."
Whispers,"Discovery just never found its footing.  It's sad that I've watched 4 seasons, and theres 3 people on the bridge that I cannot remember their names."
Whispers,"Good, it was not good...."
Whispers,"I don't hate Discovery, but several of the seasons have been really coasting on auto pilot....not terrible, but not particularly interesting.

Michael Burnham is an insufferably Mary Sue character.  She NEVER does what she's told, always makes decisions WAY above her pay grade, and she always turns out to be right.  

to say it gets old is an understatement"
Whispers,"I’m a trekker from when I can remember, this is the WORST series ever of Star Trek. It’s just not Star Trek in a Star Trek studios."
Whispers,"Yup. Called it. They were stupid to give this POS a second season after the first bombed spectacularly, let alone four more. You can forget about those Section 31 and Starfleet Academy spin-offs too because Paramount has finally figured out no one GAF about Kurtzman Trek."
Whispers,They need to develop a series about Rachel Garrett and the adventures of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701C.
Whispers,The best Star Trek show is currently The Orville. Hate to say it.
Whispers,Should have been cancelled 5 seasons earlier
Whispers,I really wanted to like this show but they tried so hard to imitate the JJ Abrams Trek movies and failed miserably. it was so glaringly obvious.
Whispers,"I have enjoyed Discovery for the most part, even if most of the internet hates it. It's definitely got it's flaws, I do find Michael a pretty frustrating main character, but it was nice to see them try something different with the Star Trek formula. There were some decent ideas in there, and I do personally prefer the more serialised format, but they didn't really seem to know where they were going with it once they got to >!the future.!<

I did enjoy Strange New Worlds more, but personally I don't like the ""planet-of-the week"" style from old Star Treks as much as an ongoing story arc. I know a lot of people would prefer that all Star Trek sticks to that formula, and SNW vs Discovery does imply that it works. But I think that it's more down to the characters and the writing where one succeeds and the other fails, rather than it entirely being down to the format.

It's a shame to see Star Trek seemingly winding down a bit again, going from 3 shows and a bunch in the pipeline to just 1. It did feel like they might end up oversaturating things a bit with more shows, so it's probably for the best. We'll see if the Section 31 show or anything else pops up to take it's place, but if we just get more Strange New Worlds on a regular basis for a few more seasons, that's fine too. 

Hopefully they can learn from what worked and didn't work in this era of Star Trek shows, and come out with something new. I'd love to see something that continues on the timeline from where Picard finishes off, rather than more prequels, distant futures, and alternate timelines. Perhaps Picard's ending will lead into that, or Discovery will find it's way back to the ""present"" day."
Whispers,[deleted]
Whispers,Im suprised that shitshow managed to last that long.
Whispers,Not much else they can do for Michael other than making her God. Don't know where else she can fail up to at this point.
Whispers,This shit isn't Star Trek
Whispers,Burn it and forget it ever happened. Maybe bring Saru into another series but the rest of the story + cast...try to make it all a dream or something.
Whispers,Yep and I'll never watch it because I refuse to subscribe to yet another streaming service.
Whispers,Lost its mojo after season 1. Terrible writing.
Whispers,"I figure that they’re looking at doing some type of continuation of Picard in some form or another and realized there’s not enough in the budget to do that and continue Discovery, a show that has had tepid audience acclaim at best. 

Picard Season 3, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy and Lower Decks have had mass acclaim, so they probably figure money is better spent on those projects."
Whispers,Thank you
Whispers,There is a god after all.
Whispers,Thank god! Will finally be able to take this off the list of shows I have to watch but hate! Hot mess of a show!
Whispers,"about  2 -1/2 seasons in , you could tell they were out of good writing / ideas.... it went downhill from there.

SNW is far superior , for now."
Whispers,"Id love to know what the money men reasons for keeping this show alive for 5 seasons was.      

This was the most expensive tv show ever made per episode at release."
Whispers,"I should have *loved* this show. Instead, I never once connected with it."
Whispers,5 seasons too many
Whispers,"I'm a ST fan, but I couldn't become a fan of The Michael Burnham Show. That is not Star Trek."
Whispers,Thank god. Fuck that show man. I watched the first two seasons and that was 1 1/2 too many.
Whispers,"I stuck through it till the end of season 3. While it did have a lot of good things, I felt the bad things far outweighed them. It was nice to look at, I enjoyed almost all of the characters, Burnham going through the different time periods in that suit was cool, I liked the idea of the spore drive and theres probably alot more I could think of if I really tried. However, the bad stuff like, changing the Klingons - why change something that wasn't broken, Burnham's constant crying and breaking the rules and not making any fucking sense half the time and so many more things. The straw that broke the camels back for me was after Burnham prevented Stamets from attempting to save his husband, she had the audacity and ignorance to not understand why he was deeply hurt from what she did. Sure, it all worked out but how fucking dense could they make a character. It would have made way more sense if she said ""sorry, I did what I had to"" or something along those lines but to be surprised and upset by Stamets reaction was just too much for me. Fuck what a dumb character."
Whispers,Thank god
Whispers,Good riddance.
Whispers,I appreciate that it directly lead to the current wave of shows.
Whispers,"I am NOT against diversity and all that at all. But in Discovery it was so badly and over the top implemented i could not continue to watch it.

A five minute unnecessary monolog about removing a ’pimple’ (penis?) of that transgender character was too much and unnecessary. All main cast was power  women while men were weak and clumsy sidekicks.

At the other hand i guess that showcased what TV has looked like from womens perspective in the past. A dated approach nevertheless."
Whispers,That show was awful. Should have just named in Star Trek : Michael Burnham Saves Everyone Yet Again.
Whispers,Good riddance. Dire acting and writing!
Whispers,"Oh no, now do we have to talk about our feelings every freaking decision a bridge officer makes?"
Whispers,Thank god for that. Even knowing it exists at all makes my life a tiny bit worse.
Whispers,"4 seasons too late. Should’ve been canceled after the first season. Im hoping all of these nutrek shows just die so they can give the keys to someone who actually cares about trek, like Seth McFarlane. The Orville is the only good trek show on and I’d know he’d respect it if he got to make trek"
Whispers,"Thank you, it was time for Discovery to die. The only good thing we got from it was SNW."
Whispers,Honestly surprised it got a season 2
Whispers,I haven’t watched it and it sounds like I’ve saved time. Is it true they don’t respect the chain of command in this series?
Whispers,"lol thank the gods. How did it even get to season five. They wasted a lot of supporting talent like good cg, sound, costume, makeup etc on a show with bad cast, bad acting, generally poor prospects. Captain michael was never gonna happen, show runners. You morons still tried to force it happen. And it sucked biiiiig time. 

I loved many things in discovery. Specially good high quality cg and sound and set + modernized look for many alien races. LOts of thought and effort went into these things and I appreciate it a lot thanks."
Whispers,"Discovery not being renewed? Can I get a hallelujah?!! let’s get the Kleenex ready for Michael! Honestly it was so painful to watch. It’s the only Star Trek I’ve not finished, it’s just too painful to watch all the tears, allllllll the time! And some of the characters, deaf god!"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"""Adulting"""
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,as a nonactor me too.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,This whole sub has just become ads lol
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,You forgot *Hey Dude*
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Definitely ready for that word to die.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I’m glad someone said it.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Coconut Head?
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Who?
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,posting this and not saying the name?
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The Internet is ads
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Always was
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,The short lived Aliens in America too.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads  
Why’d you think the Net was had?  
Ads, ads, ads"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Am..I an ad???
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,ok work avenue q
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Bro you're not a pedophile for watching a TV show about high schoolers
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,This is a pretty suspicious self report right here
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,">Truth be told…I kind of feel like a pedo for watching this. 

in case this clears things up for you, Rose Bianco was over 18 before the series started filming"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"The only way you’d feel like a pedo for watching a kids show is if you’re attracted to the kids, if that’s the case then guess what….you’re a pedo"
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"I don't really know what you are getting at, but watch what you want, and don't overthink it too much.  

*Cobra Kai* is not a teen sex romp.  It's a nostalgic extension of a popular movie from the 1980's.  They chose *The Karate Kid*, not *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*.

The high school kids stuff to which you refer, can extend well into adulthood.  That's a theme of *Cobra Kai*."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,It's nostalgia
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,"If you’ve seen the show you might understand what I’m talking about.

Again, the writing is well done: as in there’s stuff happening all the time…never a dull moment.  Like a guy will manipulate Daniel into a fight in public and his wife is pissed that this has gone on for 3 seasons now!!!! So she’s leaving.  Ok, pretty adult stuff for a show.

But then the content of that writing… like: “This is Cobra Kai’s water park!!! No it’s Muigi Do’s Karate’s water park!!! I got it…let’s settle this with an inner tube water slide race.  Yeaaahhhh!!!”  Hi fives all around!!!!

Like I can get into it because of nostalgia but then shit like this happens.  These kids are suppose to be in high school and sometimes they’re doing shit I did with my friends when we were in 5th  or 7th grade or something.  

It’s so jolting.  The whole aesthetic to the show seems very “innocent”.  Which is why I was asking about the audience."
Wasteful Days of High School Girls,Perhaps there's something deeper going on lol
The World Between Us,"So this proves (again and again) that HBO has the recipe for good television drama.

Why can't any of the other networks figure this out?"
The World Between Us,Nothing to add besides: I’m just really glad this show ended up in the right hands. Could have turned out very differently somewhere like Netflix or Paramount
The World Between Us,I knew it was going to be big but jesus it could potetentially become HBO's biggest show if it keeps this up.
The World Between Us,"I hope the success behind TLOU will give us better adaptations. Seriously, there’s no excuse in bad shows with high budget."
The World Between Us,[removed]
The World Between Us,"I don’t love everything HBO makes, but most of the tv I really love is made by HBO"
The World Between Us,"I started watching it alone, now I watch the episodes with a group of 6. Definitely spreading through word of mouth because I tell everyone I know to watch it"
The World Between Us,"Details

>The penultimate episode of “The Last of Us” Season 1 reached an impressive 8.1 million viewers on Sunday night.

>According to Warner Bros. Discovery, that makes Episode 8 the series’ most-viewed thus far. Previously, that title belonged to Episode 3 with 6.4 million viewers, though the company did not make data available regarding the audience size of Episodes 4-7.

>The 8.1 million viewers who tuned into Episode 8, titled “When We Are In Need,” contributed to a 74% increase from the viewership of the series premiere, which drew an audience of 4.7 million people and was HBO’s second-most watched debut in over a decade."
The World Between Us,Can we just note fungus in the end saved him. Penicillin?
The World Between Us,"HBO treating The Last of Us as prestige television. Great writers and creatives on board to adapt the game properly

EDIT: Praise Druckmann!"
The World Between Us,[removed]
The World Between Us,"I've never played the game but I'm enjoying the show and it's been moving, but ""I got you baby girl"" is what finally made me burst into tears."
The World Between Us,"I am watching this show with MY GRANDMOTHER. It’s so crazy to me that in this day and age we can bond over something of a shared interest! Me, knowing exactly what happens and seeing her watching in suspense is always a great feeling for me. She adored Sam and Henry and was like “I hope they make it through” when they approached the sniper on the street. I was just sitting there silently and she’s like, “you know what happens don’t you?” She was devastated but the >!bloater ripping the head off!< had her so intrigued, also realizing >!David and his group were a bunch of cannibals!< had her so hooked it’s amazing. Thank you HBO for creating something we could bond with in a way that I never thought!"
The World Between Us,Bella Ramsey crushed it this episode. What a powerhouse.
The World Between Us,That episode was INCREDIBLE!!!
The World Between Us,I’m so glad Amazon or Netflix didn’t get ahold of this show. So refreshing seeing people actually give a fuck about the original material.
The World Between Us,"Ever since I played the game for the first time way back in 2013 I knew it was one of the best stories I’ve ever been told and it just makes me so happy that so many people are experiencing this amazing story for the first time, I certainly didn’t expect that it’d come close to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon which is arguably the biggest TV show of all time."
The World Between Us,"Damn amazing number, shame it has to compete with the Oscars for the final episode."
The World Between Us,"It was nearly a 1:1 of this section of the game, and masterfully acted. A+"
The World Between Us,[removed]
The World Between Us,"It's pretty good, I'll admit I had my doubts but the 74% is for sure word of mouth. Everyone around me told me it was 🔥 and now I'm suggesting it to others. It makes sense."
The World Between Us,"I haven’t watched a single episode, I haven’t seen a single spoiler, and on March 12th I’m binging every fucking episode and I can’t wait!!!!"
The World Between Us,Wonder how long it’s gonna be until other networks/streamers announce their own zombie/zombie-adjacent shows to ride the hype.
The World Between Us,"This was a great episode.  I ended up rewatching the [video game playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AaaGoWfOhY&ab_channel=CouchSoup) with commentary from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.  They did a great job capturing the story.  

Fun fact!  Troy Baker makes a cameo as James in the tv show!"
The World Between Us,ELI5: are people not watching the rest of the season and just watching episode 8?
The World Between Us,Happy for Sony and Naughty Dog.
The World Between Us,Been such a great show so far. The best video game/movie adaptation.
The World Between Us,I remember the time when 8.1 million views meant cancellation of the show
The World Between Us,"As someone who was wildly impressed back in 2013 with the game and the story. I’m just as excited to see the show doing so well, people that worked on the show seem to have enjoyed their time together, and it has kept the heart of the story. Well deserved praise for The Last of Us."
The World Between Us,Video game dialogues are top but I like how ‘sort of close’ they are to it compared to the game.
The World Between Us,Netflix totally gonna pivot some shows to one episode a week. Their shows hit and the conversation is gone in a week.
The World Between Us,"Amazing production for both fans and those new to the series. Not only did they stay true to the story’s themes but the deviations they’ve introduced seem to augment them instead of reduce them.

I can’t help but imagine if Henry Cavrill and Sapkowski were able to work with HBO instead of Netflix…"
The World Between Us,And this isn’t even counting all the people pirating it!
The World Between Us,"I was in the real town they filmed that in a few weeks ago, was cool to see it."
The World Between Us,It’s sooooo good! Like sautéed portobello good!
The World Between Us,It’s a good show
The World Between Us,"That was an intense episode.

Having Joel up and running and killing 3 men seems a bit of a stretch when he was bed ridden minutes before."
The World Between Us,[removed]
The World Between Us,Good stuff
The World Between Us,Best episode yet
The World Between Us,"Forgetting the game exists, after watching the walking dead for however many seasons I got through I absolutely got worried they were going to stretch this ""villain"" out and then remembered it's the last of us lol. It was nice not having a drawn out enemy that just gets worn out too fast."
The World Between Us,"I just want to throw out there that between episodes of TLOU, I started watching Station Eleven, another post-apocalyptic drama and I’ve never seen anyone mention it but if you haven’t seen it, it’s excellent. Very different from TLOU; slower, less action but engrossing. The base story is about an acting troupe that makes a living circling lake Superior going from one small community to the next performing Shakespeare. 

Maybe I just missed it when it first came out and I’m late to the viewing party or maybe it just got overlooked. Either way, if you are looking for something to watch when the credits roll on Joel and Ellie, it’s out there."
The World Between Us,"Any recommendations for single player PS games that focuses on story and isn't open world?

I don't really have time anymore to sink it big open worlds, I love TLOU part 1 & 2 because the story is so good and so tight. Would love to play something similar."
The World Between Us,"My only complaint with the show is I think they're going too fast. Instead of 9 episodes, it should have been at least 15. A lot of the moments in the game that in my opinion are crucial to character development and the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie have been skimmed over, or cut entirely, and honestly I don't think the point their relationship is at in the show makes sense within the context of what's actually happened in the show. I think it would have benefited from a slightly slower pace that told more of the story. But that's just like my opinion man."
The World Between Us,Ellie was a BOSS in this episode!
The World Between Us,"Bella Ramsey did an awesome job this episode. Lots of high emotion and fight choreo scenes.   
  
And then I watched Pascal take care of a different, greener adopted child right after. Dude’s having a dad year."
The World Between Us,The finale few minutes were pretty amazing in that episode 👌🏻
The World Between Us,Some people are going to be real upset when it doesn’t drag out for 11 seasons like TWD.
The World Between Us,This episode was the most intense 50 minutes of tv. Absolutely marvellous.
The World Between Us,"As much as I wanna see the new ep so bad, I really thing weekly premiers are the way to go"
The World Between Us,[removed]
The World Between Us,RIP to all the haters that said Last of Us was B-tier story at best if it was filmed.
The World Between Us,I am trying so hard to like this. apparently I'm the only one who thinks it's average.
The World Between Us,"Every week, a friend texts me that The Last Of Us must have been one interesting game… almost as if he’s insinuating that what’s in each episode wasn’t part of a pretty rich series of games. And every week, I reply “yup, it’s a fantastic story that they’re adapting brilliantly!”"
The World Between Us,"So lucky to have had such a wonderful adaptation of such a treasured game and story to so many people. I have my own nitpicks and I agree that they are having to speed through some sections but I genuinely don’t think people realize how good we have had it. Brilliant acting all around, showrunner who loves the source material, original creator heavily involved, original composer doing the score, beautifully shot — a dream come true compared to most adaptations (let alone game adaptations)"
The World Between Us,Yeah I mean it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise.
The World Between Us,"I love it. Theres a lot of content out there, a lot of good content even, but this show is great."
The World Between Us,I love this show!
The World Between Us,I'm ready to be hurt again...
The World Between Us,what delicious numbers
The World Between Us,10million by the end! Let’s do it!!
The World Between Us,"I can't get the original game out of my head, but when they use a similar scene, it's incredible."
The World Between Us,She went into beast mode and I loved it!
The World Between Us,It was a great Episode!
The World Between Us,Crazy good episode
The World Between Us,This is by far one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. I love what they’ve done with it and how they make things a little different from the game to keep you guessing. Everything about this show is amazing. I’m so glad they knocked it out of the park.
The World Between Us,"Bellas performance in episode 8 was incredible. 

“Tell them Ellie is the name of the child that broke your fucking finger!”"
The World Between Us,Last night episode was so fucking good
The World Between Us,Its really not that good..but i guess enjoy?
The World Between Us,Episode 9 is gonna have more than 10M and gonna surpass House of the Dragon season finale numbers.
The World Between Us,Why tho? That dialogue is ass
The World Between Us,"Anyone else think it was way way over rated? I quit pretty quick. Episode one was good and sad. After that I thought it was lame and felt really cheap for HBO. 

Just my take"
The World Between Us,Shit is so good
The World Between Us,"my biggest issues with it are the 

1) goofy ahhh kathleen episode and the ending action scene

2) the time skip being in the new spot was altogether worse for the pacing and character development

3) the impalement scene was weaker in the TV show"
The World Between Us,"They had to make up for episode 7.  What a, predictable, snooze fest that was. Ep. 8 kicked ass tho"
The World Between Us,The worst part of this show is the astroturfing.
The World Between Us,This Pedro Pascal guy is having a great start in acting. Maybe HBO or even Disney might give him more roles in the future.
The World Between Us,"Sorry this show is overrated. It’s fine, but people acting like it’s the next Sopranos or something."
The World Between Us,"It's a good show.

Let's see how they handle... Well... You know.

Honestly if they deviate for a bit it probably wouldn't make people hate them... But they gotta do it right... 

Either way, they gotta do it right.

Edit: Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you people. We're discussing a tv show why are you people so damn vitriolic. I didn't even state how I felt about the show doing one thing or another, just that I hope whatever they do that they do it well."
The World Between Us,"I gotta say, I never enjoyed the gameplay of the original game, but I am loving being able to enjoy the story without dealing with the gameplay!"
The World Between Us,"Lazy question.

But as someone that hasn't played the games.

Wil the show follow the entire game series and then just stop, or is it loosely based and will it divert from the games to create a season 5-6-7-8 etc?

If it's even known"
The World Between Us,I can’t believe my eyes how insanely accurate the sets are. It’s incredible
The World Between Us,Netflix so jelly right now.
The World Between Us,What a fantastic fucking episode.
The World Between Us,"Whatever the HBO recipe is, never change it. My all-time great dramas is like mostly HBO at this point."
The World Between Us,"See, this is what happens when a production company makes an actually good show"
The World Between Us,Love the show!!
The World Between Us,"I see a lot of comments saying “see this is what happens when…” and crediting some cocktail of budget, faithfulness to the source material, etc, but really i think it’s just well-written and well-acted. The writers wrote a compelling show, HBO probably used many of the same technicians and film crew as they have in other successful shows, so that was done well also."
The World Between Us,This was the best episode of the show 🥺❤️
The World Between Us,"Such a GREAT episode 👏 


Well done , and I NEED more .
This is coming from a person that’s NEVER played the game before."
The World Between Us,That end scene had me ugly cry
The World Between Us,Well ! It’s a really good show for one thing ! And it’s really well made ! And the characters are amazing !
The World Between Us,I just watched all of the episodes this week. The numbers are obviously because of me.
The World Between Us,I’ve loved this series I do wish there were more zombies though
The World Between Us,I've absolutely loved the show but feel they're making a mistake by moving things along so quickly in order to follow the events of the game.
The World Between Us,"Don't get me wrong, I am loving the series, but am I the only one wishing there was more conflict with the cordyceps? It is like they skipped the whole first few years of the outbreak and went full bore into the Walking Dead equation where the main conflicts are coming from humans trying to survive against other humans with differing views on how to advance society as it fights to regain its hold over the World."
The World Between Us,"Is this episode better than 7, my God that shit was boring. Just had to skip it."
The World Between Us,"If they lost the flashback scenes with bill and Ellie.(make them bonus episodes inbetween seasons, it’s been done) and replaced them with scenes from the game they obviously skipped over, this would be 20/10 game adaptation.

Ready for the rate downs, fight me."
The World Between Us,"One episode a week is the correct recipe. Giving each episode the respect it deserves. Just like back in the days shows…
Releasing a show like this all at once is a crime. We all watch one, talk about it and the word of mouth just makes it even more special. #hatebinge"
The World Between Us,Well I hope everyone’s enjoying it at least.  I didn’t get anything out of this one.  Just seemed like more of the same zombie stuff to me.
Fafner in the Azure,"Another way to write this headline 
“HBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year”"
Fafner in the Azure,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they’re the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
Fafner in the Azure,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
Fafner in the Azure,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
Fafner in the Azure,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
Fafner in the Azure,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
Fafner in the Azure,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
Fafner in the Azure,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
Fafner in the Azure,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
Fafner in the Azure,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
Fafner in the Azure,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
Fafner in the Azure,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
Fafner in the Azure,The writing has been superb.
Fafner in the Azure,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
Fafner in the Azure,It’s a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
Fafner in the Azure,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
Fafner in the Azure,"It’s a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn’t play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
Fafner in the Azure,This is the way.
Fafner in the Azure,It’s because House of the Dragon didn’t cast Pedro Pascal
Fafner in the Azure,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
Fafner in the Azure,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
Fafner in the Azure,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
Fafner in the Azure,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
Fafner in the Azure,"While the show has been strong I feel like they’re making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven’t hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
Fafner in the Azure,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
Fafner in the Azure,HoTD > TLoU
Fafner in the Azure,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
Fafner in the Azure,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
Fafner in the Azure,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
Fafner in the Azure,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  🤔

This is why making well written content matters."
Fafner in the Azure,Bring back WestWorld!
Fafner in the Azure,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
Fafner in the Azure,God I Hope so
Fafner in the Azure,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
Fafner in the Azure,How the hell?
Fafner in the Azure,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
Fafner in the Azure,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
Fafner in the Azure,Pascal Power.
Fafner in the Azure,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
Fafner in the Azure,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
Fafner in the Azure,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
Fafner in the Azure,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
Fafner in the Azure,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
Fafner in the Azure,if only they did halo correctly.
Fafner in the Azure,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
Fafner in the Azure,[deleted]
Fafner in the Azure,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
Fafner in the Azure,Its a much better show so thats great
Fafner in the Azure,Good
Fafner in the Azure,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
Fafner in the Azure,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
Fafner in the Azure,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
Fafner in the Azure,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
Fafner in the Azure,Good. It was better.
Fafner in the Azure,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
Fafner in the Azure,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
Fafner in the Azure,Deserved. It's a better show.
Fafner in the Azure,"That’s crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
Fafner in the Azure,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
Fafner in the Azure,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
Fafner in the Azure,Was it really THAT good???
Fafner in the Azure,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
Fafner in the Azure,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
Fafner in the Azure,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
Fafner in the Azure,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
Fafner in the Azure,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
Fafner in the Azure,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
Fafner in the Azure,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
Fafner in the Azure,It's a vastly better show
Fafner in the Azure,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
Fafner in the Azure,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
Fafner in the Azure,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
Fafner in the Azure,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
Fafner in the Azure,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
Fafner in the Azure,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
Fafner in the Azure,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
Fafner in the Azure,It was better.
Fafner in the Azure,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
Fafner in the Azure,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
Fafner in the Azure,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
Fafner in the Azure,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
Fafner in the Azure,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
Fafner in the Azure,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
Fafner in the Azure,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
Fafner in the Azure,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it’s going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
Fafner in the Azure,What’s the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
Fafner in the Azure,…. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
Fafner in the Azure,Can’t wait for season 2
Fafner in the Azure,Fucking Obviously
Fafner in the Azure,"I’m still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it’s backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a while."
Fafner in the Azure,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
Fafner in the Azure,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn’t even compare to the game.
Fafner in the Azure,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
Fafner in the Azure,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
Fafner in the Azure,…because it’s a much better show
Fafner in the Azure,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I’m surprised white lotus didn’t beat house of dragons"
Fafner in the Azure,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
Fafner in the Azure,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
Fafner in the Azure,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
Fafner in the Azure,"Fungos \&gt; dragões, simples."
Angel Heart,Ice-T bought a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
Angel Heart,"""Six 'n the mornin', police at my dawh, fresh adidas squeak across my Hollywood stah...."""
Angel Heart,[He also did a track with Slayer](https://youtu.be/kbKcL7q8RJU)
Angel Heart,are you Ice-Ts PR team? lmao what is this
Angel Heart,We’ll deserved. Wish he would of kept doing movies instead of tv shows. New Jack City and Trespass was legit..
Angel Heart,[The scene that earned it](https://youtu.be/Zd8vzIRQLLM)
Angel Heart,"Can anyone get a star? 

Can we honour Mr. Belding? 

Or Penn Badgley?"
Angel Heart,"OG, that's why"
Angel Heart,"It's a long way from his heyday, but that Rhyme Pays > Power > O.G. trio of records is fantastic."
Angel Heart,the past episode of SVU has IceT's character being honored with a plaque by hargitay's character.
Angel Heart,My parents lost their minds when they heard me listening to Cop Killer when I was a kid. Love the Ice man.
Angel Heart,Any problem he got he just puts his 👊in.
Angel Heart,And by honored they mean he paid to have it installed.
Angel Heart,Why?
Angel Heart,"thaths real sthmoove

shoutouths playa"
Angel Heart,Like when someone bets too much on the ponies?
Angel Heart,"I read it's up to $50k to be ""honored""."
Angel Heart,Kinda sad that the process has been figured out
Angel Heart,"Came into the comments to say this - hell, I'm pretty sure I\anyone could buy a star if you offered enough!"
Angel Heart,[deleted]
Angel Heart,The whole Judgment Night soundtrack is worth checking out.
Angel Heart,Also that one where a bunch of rich white folks hunt him in the woods but he ends up owning them all.
Angel Heart,I prefer [this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE2aXOs4Oww)
Angel Heart,It’s Ed Begley Jr Jr’s turn.
Angel Heart,so he can evolve into Water T
Angel Heart,"Yeah, it's by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Guessing NBC picked up the tab."
Angel Heart,This exact comment is LITERALLY the top comment of every Hollywood Star post on this subreddit. Also the cost is primarily towards actually installing it into the Walk of Fame.
Angel Heart,"You still have to be nominated and have some credibility but, yeah pretty much anyone in Hollywood can get one."
Angel Heart,"And yet he did that when police brutality was all over...

Oh wait it still is"
Angel Heart,Surviving the Game with Bussey is a great film.
Angel Heart,"[This](https://youtu.be/-Qi9OHb6f-I) is his actual best scene, and quite possibly the best line in all of modern cinema."
Angel Heart,">the cost is primarily towards actually installing it into the Walk of Fame

50k to place one tile? How does one get that job?"
Angel Heart,Donald Trump literally had one lol
Angel Heart,Busey's insane monologue about his dog is worth the price of admission alone.
Angel Heart,Perfect people are boring. You need conflict. In every scene.
Angel Heart,"Because you're specifically referring to the ""anti-hero"" genre. That's the definition of the role"
Angel Heart,"Some characters are aspirational, some mirror our worst qualities. Depends what mood you're in if you want to be inspired or if you want commiseration."
Angel Heart,"because writers are brought up being told that writing a Mary Sue is bad form

But even with that, I think that there are plenty of non-jerk protags: Ted Lasso, Leslie Knope, Jon Snow/Daenerys/Tyrion, Aang/Katara/Sokaa

Also I'd say in the 90s, the protag formula was to have their heart in the right place but make a mistake each episode and learn their lesson"
Angel Heart,"Tragic hero, a classic storytelling trope since the beginning of time."
Angel Heart,"there are waves of shows where characters are paragons of good, morally superior etc, it's just that these don't make headlines because they are not *prestige television*"
Angel Heart,"The movie, “The Jerk” really set the mold."
Angel Heart,"This is a two-part answer. 

1.	The first part is that many shows have Mary Sue protagonists. Hell, the majority of television shows do. Prestige shows don’t. But if that’s what you’re looking for, you sort of just need to change the type of show you watch. 
2.	which brings us to the real reason - market. Most people write to market, and since Breaking Bad, anti-heroes are the market for prestige shows. So that’s what writers write."
Angel Heart,"My guess is that people like to live vicariously through these characters. Most people can't get away with being jerks in real life, so they enjoy seeing someone on TV saying/doing the things they wish they could say and do themselves."
Angel Heart,And they are especially boring over the course of several seasons in which you generally want a protagonist to grow and develop.
Angel Heart,">Daenerys

huh? She murdered scores of people and was a right full cunt to a lot of people even before that."
Angel Heart,"Yes, as I said, I’m aware that they exist but I want more Leslie Knope’s and Ted Lasso’s. Like a lot more."
Angel Heart,Tyrion is also a textbook anti hero lol
Angel Heart,[deleted]
Angel Heart,"Leslie was very much deeply flawed and a huge, selfish jerk (even if her heart was in the right place) a ton of times."
Angel Heart,"Nah, everyone would’ve still loved her character. Her turn would’ve made sense if it wasn’t rushed, but she was not a hateable character by any means. She was pretty much unshakably morally correct for the majority of the show"
Angel Heart,"Green Lantern The Animated Series is on there now too. I highly recommend that, it’s up there with Spectacular Spiderman and Batman The Animated Series as an all time great animated super hero show."
Angel Heart,">Frisky Dinge

Yes Frisky Dingo*! I'm due for my 7th rewatch"
Angel Heart,Time to go on a Steve brule binge
Angel Heart,"> Xavier Renegade Angel

Finally the answer to the ultimate question. What doth *life?*"
Angel Heart,Just need Batman: The Brave and the Bold.
Angel Heart,Alas Delocated!
Angel Heart,Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is so good. One of the best DCAU films.
Angel Heart,Wish they would add the rest of Primal.
Angel Heart,"I really hoped they’d bring back Super Milk Chan. It wasn’t on adult swim very long but it was my favorite by far. It’s like no one remembers it now. 

https://imgur.com/a/pBSEggx"
Angel Heart,"OK, just need Brave and the Bold, plz"
Angel Heart,"Mask of the Phantasm is low key one of my favorite Batman things, ever."
Angel Heart,"I read the Red Son comic, how’s the movie?"
Angel Heart,Still waiting on Superfriends
Angel Heart,What about Young Justice?
Angel Heart,"To those of you, like me, who love to watch absolutely terrifying and mind fucking things while high I highly recommend The Shivering Truth. 

Every single episode is horrifying, surreal, trippy, absurd, and just a pleasure to watch when in an altered state."
Angel Heart,delocated!!!!!!
Angel Heart,"I've been waiting to watch The Shivering Truth for so long after someone on here said it was one of the best shows they'd ever seen. I might disagree, but I'm curious"
Angel Heart,Finally I can rewatch Xavier!!
Angel Heart,Ok but when are they making 15 more seasons of Joe Pera?
Angel Heart,I stumbled upon Too Many Cooks while browsing HBOMax. Hadn't seen that in years. Still hilarious/nightmare inducing!
Angel Heart,I’m still waiting for Batman: Under the Red Hood
Angel Heart,How dare they not include On Cinema At The Cinema.
Angel Heart,I just want Big O from Adult Swim
Angel Heart,"This isn't a complete list then I guess?

It seems like every single DC animated movie is now on HBO Max. That's awesome if so as I haven't seen a lot of the recent ones."
Angel Heart,"If you haven’t watched Primal on Adult Swim yet, I would highly recommend it."
Angel Heart,Superman: Red Son is incredible
Angel Heart,"Great, now only if there was an app for it on my TV 😭"
Angel Heart,"I hate you so much right now HBO Canada. Didn't get Ww84, no DC stuff and now adding Adult Swim content that if I want on Canada I have to pay 10 bucks a month for. Booooo"
Angel Heart,"So, uh what DCAU movies would you guys recommend? Idk which ones are considered “good”."
Angel Heart,Man I forgot all about Tom Goes to the Mayor. I loved that show.
Angel Heart,last time i had to pay for a girl for a frisky dinge...she did not offer a free trial/
Angel Heart,Still no Flash or Swamp Thing?
Angel Heart,Lucy Daughter of the Devil? Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time
Angel Heart,"The heart, she hollar! Something about redneck Kristen Schaal freaking does it for me. Season 2 tho idk."
Angel Heart,I thought the new Batman Death in the Family interactive movie was going to be added?
Angel Heart,"Oh awesome, somewhere to rewatch Delocated finally"
Angel Heart,Is there any reason why they arent putting on Batman The Animated Series? It's pretty much the best DC cartoon
Angel Heart,Are they trying to apologize for WW84...?
Angel Heart,"Oh god, Xavier: Renegade Angel. I watched half of two different episodes and I have never seen such an annoying, awfully-drawn, yet boring show. I don't get the appeal. I never got into Tim & Eric's show but at least I see and know the appeal of that, but this?? No clue."
Angel Heart,Ugh. All crappy Adult Swim shows too. Where's my Sealab? My Home Movies?
Angel Heart,[removed]
Angel Heart,"I got Aqua Team Hunger Force, which is all I need to sleep.

TONIGHT!"
Angel Heart,Those old Batman movies are so good
Angel Heart,This show deserved more than one season
Angel Heart,"From the setting and the CGI designs, you expect them to completely have fubar'd it, but watching it, it turns out pretty great"
Angel Heart,"don’t remind me about spectacular spider-man, it hurts too much"
Angel Heart,"Speaking of Batman TAS, also on HBO Max. Not sure if it's a new addition, but I just found it this morning."
Angel Heart,That’s high praise. I’ll check it out
Angel Heart,"Whoa. It’s definitely a good show, but it’s definitely not in BTAS or Spectacular Spider-Man territory. If it had more than one season, maybe it could build to that, but it’s not in classic territory like those two are."
Angel Heart,"Anybody who hasn't seen this, definitely go give it a watch. It was Adam Reed's show before he made Archer, and it's incredible."
Reality Z,Brazilian Dead Set
Reality Z,why they make so bad series
Reality Z,"I'm Brazilian and jeez, Brazilian acting is so bad. They speak so unnaturally it's like we can feel the camera there with them. The color correction is also always really bad."
Reality Z,"It shared so many similarities that I went digging and sure enough it is literally an official Brazilian version of Dead Set.

Right down to them having Charlie Brooker come out at a Brazilian creative conference in 2019 and talk about what he thinks of the adaptations pre-production.

>  “It’s incredible to see the ways in which Torres has reimagined this series, setting it in a city as iconic as Rio and tapping into Brazilian pop culture in such a sharp way”,

https://deadline.com/2019/04/reality-z-netflix-brazil-zombie-dead-set-1202601629/"
Reality Z,"1) While all signs point to this series being bad, we can’t really say for sure cause it hasn’t dropped yet. 

2) Netflix mostly doesn’t produce their content in house; this is surely something they purchased. 

3) Netflix releases more content on a weekly basis than all the other streaming services combined. There’s gonna be winners & losers; they’re trying to reach every demographic out there. 

This show probably isn’t for me but I bet my dad who loves pulpy sci-fi / horror will get a kick out of it."
Reality Z,It's actually really good. Im on the last episode now and i greatly enjoyed it. The second half is better than the first half though. You should check it out
Reality Z,"That's because it's exaggerated, but it's much better than the trailer makes it seem"
Reality Z,"Thanks, I was about to say ""Charlie Brooker better call his lawyer"""
Reality Z,"And:

4) Netflix's audience isn't exclusively the United States. This is a Brazilian show and was probably produced using data Netflix has gathered in Brazil about what shows and movies the people watch. It's likely they're expecting this to be a bigger hit in South America, and since they fully own it (being their own production), nothing to lose putting it in every Netflix market also."
Reality Z,"> Netflix mostly doesn’t produce their content in house; this is surely something they purchased. 


It's a [Netflix production](https://deadline.com/2019/04/reality-z-netflix-brazil-zombie-dead-set-1202601629/): 

> Brains will be served Brazilian-style soon, as Netflix has announced its first Brazilian zombie show, Reality Z. Based on the British production Dead Set, created by Charlie Brooker, the series was adapted by Brazilian director, screenwriter and executive producer Cláudio Torres with Conspiração’s production.

> This is Netflix’s  first collaboration with Conspiração, one of the biggest independent feature-film production companies in Brazil."
Reality Z,"Well I stand correct lol in the majority of cassis, their programs are purchased. Which people actually use as an attack against them more often than not."
Reality Z,Cool.  Dead Set was awesome.
Reality Z,Interesting. I remember liking Dead Set and given how obsesses people down here are  with reality show it might work... Though Sabrina Sato... yikes.
Reality Z,"God yes; ""Dead Set"" was great. I'd love to see the concept of ""reality tv stars deal with zombie apocalypse"" as multiple mini-series, with like Canadian Big Brother contestants, USA, Survivor and Amazing Race."
Reality Z,Dead Set was great so I’m excited to see how Brazil can make that concept their own
Reality Z,I wonder if Dead set still holds up or if it was more of a thing of its time.
Reality Z,"I enjoyed Dead Set, and I really liked the concept. However, I found the ending to be a little abrupt, and underwhelming. It just kind of ends, and I was left wanting more. I’m curious if this remake will expand upon the original, or be a more faithful adaption."
Reality Z,I always get Sabrina Sato confused with Danielle Suzuki because I'm racist. Which one is from Rio and which one is the hick?
Reality Z,"I swear I live in a computer simulation. 

Every time I start thinking about something obscure from the past it comes back. 

Was just thinking about Dead Set and if it held up... here it is back in the news."
Reality Z,"I have to laugh at it being described as its ""First Brazilian Zombie show.""

Go back 10 years and show someone that article."
Reality Z,"I saw it a few months ago on netflix, still pretty good"
Reality Z,Tbh me too. Sabrina is the hick. At least that's the part she played in Pânico and BBB.
Reality Z,"I'll have to check if it's on Netflix where I live.

Might be worth it to give it another look."
Reality Z,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Reality Z,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.
Reality Z,I’m surprised Ozark is that high

Reality Z,Interesting to see containment show up.
Reality Z,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Reality Z,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Reality Z,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Reality Z,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Reality Z,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Reality Z,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Reality Z,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Reality Z,How about movies??
Reality Z,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Reality Z,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Reality Z,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Reality Z,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Reality Z,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Reality Z,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Reality Z,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Reality Z,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Reality Z,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Reality Z,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Reality Z,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Reality Z,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Reality Z,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."

Reality Z,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Reality Z,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Reality Z,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Reality Z,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Reality Z,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."

Reality Z,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Reality Z,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"

Reality Z,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Reality Z,[deleted]
Reality Z,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Reality Z,Big Little Lies is fantastic and my favorite show this year. There is just nothing bad I can say about it. Great show from start to finish.
Reality Z,"I find _Sneaky Pete_ above Good/Enjoyable.

List is also missing one series that I really liked, _GLOW_. It's not astonishingly good, but it can make the cut into Good/Enjoyable."
Reality Z,I can't figure out of Patriot is actually good or just part of a stealth marketing campaign. It never seems to be on any lists outside of reddit.
Reality Z,"I liked that show ""Downward dog"", it's already been canceled tho. "
Reality Z,"I adore Patriot. The writing is extremely tight, with subtle but impactful character development, intertwining storylines, and excellent set up and pay off. The unusual combination of drama and off-kilter humor felt surprisingly compelling and genuine, thanks in large part to the cast's great performances across the board. In addition to the purposeful and visually interesting camerawork and style, there's also some pretty spectacular scene choreography, such as in the long, single-take rock-paper-scissors game and pipe sequence.

I could see the show having a similar viewership trajectory to Breaking Bad, in which it slowly builds up steam for the first few seasons through acclaim from its small fanbase before reaching critical mass and becoming a hit."
Reality Z,"I am in the middle of episode 8 of Gypsy, and I cannot wait for this piece of shit series to end. I wouldn't rank it as the absolute worst series I've seen this year, but it's near the bottom."
Reality Z,I thought The Good Fight was really good. CBS obviously did to make it their first series on their new streaming site. 
Reality Z,"While I can understand leaving it off the list, ""Brockmire"" has an undeniable charm, although I find its uneven tone to be a bit hard to handle. I am glad it was renewed as I think it has legs."
Reality Z,"i love the mick. anyone expecting kaitlin olson to create a ""just like IASIP"" show is gonna be disappointed. but the mick is hilarious on its own, and the actors who play the kids are amazing. i've rewatched the episode about [sully the clown/ben's birthday party](https://giphy.com/gifs/26xBxo80vzmY4xigw/html5) multiple times.

Reality Z,"**TL;DR** - in case it's too lengthy (well, it obviously is lol) or you didn't understand the layout. Here's a ranking of the 25 new shows (that I've seen) of 2017 so far.

2. Big Little Lies
3. The Handmaid's Tale

22. Marvel's Iron Fist - (Underwhelming)
23. Girlboss
24. I Love Dick
25. Anne
26. Gypsy - (not listed; Underwhelming)
27. Guerrilla "
Reality Z,"I completely disagree on Taboo. It was by far my favorite show of the year. The script, acting, plot, production value and directing is amazing. I don't think it moved slow at all but I guess I understand why others do.








I would switch Taboo and Legion. Legion was great film making and the visuals/tones were really cool and innovative but the plot was lacking and the last episode especially was pretty underwhelming. 



Also, no thoughts on the leftovers and BCS?"
Reality Z,"I would add a category of ""shows that showed promise but were killed after their first season"" and put Emerald City in there. It's a bizarre reimagining of the Oz story with the delirious visuals characteristic of Tarsem Singh's work. 

Unfortunately, I think that they missed the right tone for the Wizard (even though he is Vincent D'Onofrio) and *specially* for Dorothy, who is that kind of protagonist that we couldn't care less for."
Reality Z,Twin Peaks? 
Reality Z,"You should check out The Son on AMC.  My favorite new show of the year, by far."
Reality Z,"Two comedies I really enjoyed that premiered this year on NBC: Trial & Error and Great News.  I'd put them in the Good/Enjoyable category, they aren't part of the greats quite yet, but they both found their comedic voices and rhythms pretty quickly and have casts with great chemistry.  I'm really looking forward to seeing their second seasons."
Reality Z,"I would take 13 Reasons Why out of the overrated category and put Legion there. I don't think people were making 13 Reasons Why to be anything special but just really showed affection for some characters like Clay, Jeff while detesting some other characters. Legion however I see as wasted potential, it has to have some of the most under-developed characters I've seen(I hardly ever notice things like this) and super weak world building. 

I'm going to stop criticising Legion at this point because I still have  3 episodes left but based on what I've seen I think it's vastly overrated, especially on this sub."
Reality Z,"American Gods is definitely in the overhyped category to me.
It looks nice but is absolutely boring to watch for me."
Reality Z,"Great description on American Gods. Loved the book and was pretty skeptical about it being adapted to a TV show. It ended up having fairly obvious small problems as you described, but very enjoyable still. Excited to see where they take it now."
Reality Z,[deleted]
Reality Z,"Thanks for this list! Ahaha it used to be in like 2009 there were maybe 4 or 5 *good* shows to keep up with, now I have to be picky even with the cream of the crop, so this is very useful.

One question about Legion, is there anything else I have to watch before this? Do I have to be super familiar with other Marvel shows and movies? I've seen a few of the X-Men movies, and Logan, and I haven't really kept up with Marvel since the Avengers."
Reality Z,"I disagree with the negatives for The Handmaid's Tale about the flashbacks and modernization - that personally really made it feel real to my wife and I. 

[spoiler](#s ""The scene where the first shots are fired too, was one of the best and scariest scenes of innocent civilians being attacked that I've ever, *ever* seen. It was terrifying and felt real despite the slow motion effect. I think a lot of that content is vitally important to what happens in the present of the storyline, and they do a good job of setting up the flashbacks."") 

Offred is an unreliable narrator, and so are the others, but you can genuinely feel their anguish when you compare their current lives to their previous lives, and contrast both to their time at the Red Centre."
Reality Z,"I feel like both *Legion* and *American Gods* are overrated. Both are good shows, but they both have glaring issues. 

EDIT: I pressed send too quickly :/

I have more issues with American Gods overall so i'll start there. I read the books, and upon learning that it was going to be adapted into a series I immediately wondered how they were going to make Shadow compelling. He's fine in a book format, but even then he was kind of just....there. Luckily, the show instilled some life into him. But, the actor wasn't good at expressing it. He was decent but he was so clearly out of his depth compared to everyone else it was hard to watch at times. Also, the decsion to instill some life in Shadow backfires in that he just looks past way too many weird things without seriously questioning them. With book Shadow, he's so blase that it's easily forgiven. It's not the same for his TV counterpart. 

I also hated how slow the plot moved. I didn't know how they were adapting the books when the series started. I assumed this would either be a 2-3 season adaptation of 8 episodes, or they were going to expand a lot. I guess we got something somewhere in the middle, but even then the plot moved excruciatingly slow. Ironically enough, however, my two favorite episodes were the stand alone ones :/ Oh, and something has to be done about that damn music. I literally muted my TV during that Vulcan episode because the music was so obnoxious. 

As for Legion, I don't remember as much about it since it's been a few months since i've watched an episode. I do remember thinking the plot moved slow for the sake of moving slow though. They stretched out the mystery farther than they had to and it only served to annoy me. Tying in with that, the whole thing was a blue ball. The slow moving plot was one thing, but we NEVER got to REALLY see the extent of Davids powers. When it seemed like we might get the chance it's either not as big as the tension and buildup suggest or it's avoided or masked in some way. I also thought the show went so far with the quirkiness and unconventional style that it ended up coming off as pretentious at times. Oh, and that was probably the most anti-climatic ending coupled with a infuriating cliffhanger i've ever seen.  "
Reality Z,"Really great list. Gonig to give Legion a try as I'd completely written it off.

You should take a look at SS-GB. Fantastic 5 part mini-series.

It's a look at the world if Germany/Japan won WW2. "
Reality Z,"Legion - gave up after 3 episodes because the deliberate weirdness and obfuscation made it a chore to watch.  
  
American Gods - quit after the pilot episode because I had no idea what the hell was going on and frankly, didn't care at all.  
  
Crashing - it's better than just OK"
Reality Z,"I just can't believe someone thinks Anne is uninteresting and irritating. A better explanation is that maybe you don't get the story or you don't like it. If you watch, it has an amazing story, acting, writing and directing. "
Reality Z,Master of None???
Reality Z,"Taboo is a lot better than ""overrated"" and Legion was let down by Noah Hawley getting carried away with himself (the 6th episode in particular was appalling)."
Lenox Hill,"Sigh, I dont have enough room on my DVR"
Lenox Hill,I'm trying to fill in my blanks on the AFI 100 and for Best Picture nominated movies. Anything on here other than the obvious stuff (Dr. Strangelove/2001/North By Northwest/Singing in the Rain for example)?
Lenox Hill,Will they ever show Angels with Dirty Faces on TCM again!? 
Curon,"> After 17 years, a woman returns home with her teenage twins. When she mysteriously vanishes, her children must reckon with a shadowy family legacy.

A family returning ""home"" to confront some family secret from past is becoming into a really milked premise for Netflix's shows. I mean this, 'Locke and Keys', 'Haunting of Hill House', 'Ragnarok'. Maybe even something else I didn't watch."
Curon,"That church in the water is actually real. See pictures of the lake Reschensee ([https://www.vinschgau.net/de/reschenpass/kultur-kunst/sehenswuerdigkeiten/turm-im-see.html](https://www.vinschgau.net/de/reschenpass/kultur-kunst/sehenswuerdigkeiten/turm-im-see.html)) in Italy.

Curon,this looks really good!
Curon,"When I watched the trailer I actually thought it's going to be a movie. So this trailer being posted to r/television confirms that it's a series, no?"
Curon,Looks like a Spanish version of Dark
Curon,"Which were good, excellent and okay.  

Marianne was also great, same premise hanging out with a drunk french horror writer.

Curon,ITALIAN!!! not spanish
Curon,"Hey, I completely agree with you. I usually am the guy that scolds people because they say ""Nuremberg"" instead of ""Nürnberg"". And now I made the same mistake. Please accept my apology, I will try to remember the correct Italian names from now on."
Curon,"Could be, they're both p similar"
Curon,"No problem man! It's just that in that region there is a lot of controversy with the language with a part of the population straight up refusing to speak Italian, like it can be seen in the series."
Curon,"Is that really the case? People that live there and don't want to speak Italian? I haven't seen the series yet, is it any good?"
Curon,"The region is Trentino-Alto Adige and a lot of people from there refuse to speak Italian as they feel that they are German/Austrian. Some of them straight up think that they are under occupation by Italy... It's a complicated matter which honestly I don't know well enough to talk about extensively. 

Regarding the series, I really enjoyed it and I think it is worth a watch."
Curon,"Ok, thanks for the insight. 

Have a great day down south in Italy - I will visit your beautiful country again as soon as Corona allows."

My Mister,"Before I watched My Mister, Breaking Bad was my 10/10. Now it’s 6 or 7/10 for me. That’s what My Mister did - it redefined my expectations entirely. That’s just how good it is.

And the leads were magnificent. IU is a genius, the world is lucky to have her."
My Mister,This is a child actor going off the rails done RIGHT.
My Mister,I'm still amazed this show hasn't been cancelled yet. Not that I want it to be or anything. It just seems like one of those shows that would be cancelled by now.
My Mister,Can't wait for the next season
My Mister,"I love that he has that Harry Potter money and he can just do whatever the fuck he wants now. 

Be free man!"
My Mister,I fucking love Daniel Radcliffe.
My Mister,"I watched the first season and enjoyed it, but from there it seemed to be a different conceit each season, at least looking at the trailers. Is there a link between the first season and the others, or is each it's own stand alone thing? I'm guessing Buscemi doesn't return?"
My Mister,Without context this scene is something. What is going on in this?
My Mister,yeah she came alright
My Mister,MISTER POTTER!
My Mister,[deleted]
My Mister,Show was way different and more broad after Simon Rich left but it’s still funny as hell!
My Mister,Harry fell on hard times after the whole “defund the Aurors” movement.
My Mister,[deleted]
My Mister,rumor has it that this coming season will be the last. :(
My Mister,Each renewal has been as surprising.
My Mister,"If only that you have no idea why the first season is about some angels trying to convince a god not to destroy the world on a bet, and then the second season is the same actors in medieval times shoveling shit and not working miracles."
My Mister,"For real, I fucking love that he does shit like this, Swiss Army Man, Guns Akimbo and the Weird Al Movie was probably the best movie I watched last year."
My Mister,"It is the anthology comedy. First season is about God, second season is about medieval time, third season is about the Wild West. The fourth season is about the Judgement Day.  I really hope that they can do a Star Trek or Star War parody.  BTW, the first and second season were based on the books written by the creator of the show."
My Mister,"Buscemi is actually in this clip! The one that makes the ""oh"" face and yes he's in all 3 and the upcoming fourth seasons. Each season is based on one of Simon Richs short stories, so different stories every season but recurring themes and character dynamics/relationships. For instance, for two of the actors their characters always end up together. I think the 3rd season was the best so far."
My Mister,The second season is my favorite!
My Mister,"Its an anthology series, same actors each season with different stories and settings, in season three Radcliffe plays a reverend on the Oregon Trail who has feelings for his best friend, a married woman. Here he is drunk on snake oil dealing with his feelings in the best possible way."
My Mister,First time ive seen it. Not everybody lives on Reddit man.
My Mister,Yes
My Mister,"Reply that to every ""Wednesday"" post."
My Mister,"Don’t fool yourself, the UK had plenty of issues with how they treat children on TV — just look at Jimmy Savile."
My Mister,"Nah, it comes down to your parents. For example Rick Schroeder only went off the rails in his 40s because of a divorce. as a child actor his parents did not live off of his TV salary so he was never the breadwinner or the one paying his parents."
My Mister,"> Emma would be building an apocalypse bunker

I mean who’s to say she isn’t?"
My Mister,"In the UK they have wonderful people looking after the children, like Jimmy Saville. I heard he shared a special bond with many children."
My Mister,"He is an executive producer, so I think he will be in all of it."
My Mister,‘Drunk’
My Mister,[deleted]
My Mister,Didn't he mistreat children *off* TV?
My Mister,What other word would you use?
My Mister,"I see what you are saying, ""Those are okay because they are corporate shills, but this thing that people like is wrong."" Sound logic."
My Mister,Nah it's just the only one that works without context.
My Mister,"Bro, the last time it was posted was a year ago. Also I'm just rewatching the show and this is one of my favorite scenes, thats all there is to it."
My Mister,"Uhhh, yes."
My Mister,Both
My Mister,The snake oil salesman says the next morning it wasn’t effective snake oil. So it was just him being himself. So it wasn’t in reference to the word and more in reference to him letting loose while assuming he was getting ‘drunk’ or ‘drugged up’.
My Mister,[deleted]
My Mister,"Well I mean he is a snake oil salesman, it isn’t really a prop using opinion from him that it isn’t “effective”, like what is the end goal of snake oil? I’m pretty certain it isn’t dressing up as a flamboyant wwe wrestler pelvic thrusting to she be coming (cumming in the version?) around the mountain and so maybe he meant that Zeke suffered bad side effects."
My Mister,"This 2013 account poster is not botty, he's previously talking about non-binary fetuses and his own personal stuff. Is this the Sadcliffe you're going to die on? ;)

I also might leave /television, it's really nothing but instructions telling you what to consume."
My Mister,"Not sure I follow. From my perspective it not having any impact on him played into the plot with Zeke and Prudence. That his prolonged repressed feelings being let loose was relieving for him and let Pru see his wild side, yet also all at once made him go too far to the point of offending her. And it just being himself, not drunk/drugged, makes him vulnerable the following morning to own it and open up to Pru about his feelings for her."
My Mister,"See and I think it did have an effect on him. Snake oil wasn’t a legit medicine, they through in some things they new was healthy and a bunch of other shit. The salesman might have believed it would cure an illness but not cause someone to be high as fuck when using it. So it is either a case of bad writing, which caused Zeke to go too far off the deep end or they made him do shit like see satan when in reality it would’ve been better to tone it down a bit but make him cocky and flirty."
My Mister,"I’m two episodes in and loving it. Yeah, it’s a bit over the top, but that’s better than moving like a glacier."
My Mister,"yes - overall, I enjoyed the show (I'm a critic and was able to watch all episodes), but there are plot points like this - a writer from paste magazine took the time to spell out the problem, and it IS quite the problem/careless storytelling choice:  


To choose one example, >!the disastrous hack of 
the UK rail system, resulting in a train crash (that just so happens to 
injure Rowdy’s boyfriend’s daughter), prompts the U.K. to reconsider 
signing a cyber-security deal with the EU, from whom it broke off during
 Brexit. Fair enough. But the signing of this pact is seemingly left to 
two people, and when an advisor to the French Prime Minister wants to 
stop it in its tracks for his own ambitions, he can commission his 
mistress, who happens to be an assistant to the guy in Brussels in 
charge of this stuff, to just tell the Brits that the man in charge is 
out of town. This is, unfortunately, ridiculous; people have phones, and
 email, and the ability to plan; governments, you would think, don’t 
approach the signing of a major security agreement by sending over two 
ambassadors with orders to “see what you can do.” Then, when Rowdy 
circumvents these efforts by marching into the guy’s office (he’s happy 
to oblige), it’s derailed again by more extreme measures, i.e. the 
ridiculous death of a key figure in the negotiations.!<

I keep thinking ""maybe I should go back to that episode, watch it again and make sure that there is nothing that I missed. but from what I remember, it really WAS that simple / hamfisted. here's the review: https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/apple-tv-plus/liaison-review/"
My Mister,Glad you do :)
My Mister,"It was pretty good, I saw it in theaters and I watched it sometimes when I was little. I’d highly recommend the watch "
My Mister,Great doc. I haven’t been to the theater since The Force Awakens but I went all alone and saw this and was definitely not let down 
My Mister,"It’s a travesty this didn’t get nominated for Best Documentary. But then again, who gives a shit about the Oscars?"
My Mister,Worth a watch.
My Mister,I'll have to DVR this! I've been wanting to watch it since I first heard about it! 
My Mister,Will it be on the PBS app?
My Mister,"I was crying with the opening song and crying at the end, with crying in between. He is who we need right now."
My Mister,"I liked it, but did anyone else feel like it was too short? It's like it needed to be 30-45 minutes longer.

Some things were just glossed over. The 'fat Freddy' thing, for example. Ok, from context he was obviously a fat kid who got bullied for it, but it gets mentioned once and then never again. Wouldn't that have been something to ask his sister about? Or explore his history of bullying and how that affected his philosophy? Or if that played into why he weighed himself every day as an adult (and the 143 thing). 

Seems like lots of things got glossed over. His stomach cancer. It talked about the PBS funding fight but not the VCR fight. The implication that he had a more ""adult"" sense of humor than his wholesome reputation suggests. 

It seemed like the filmmaker talked to all the right people, but it wasn't anywhere near as in-depth as it should have been."
My Mister,"Aw man, I missed it. Any idea if it will air again? Or where I can stream it?"
My Mister,"Reminder set, if nothing else materializes I'm watchin."
My Mister,[deleted]
My Mister,Thanks for posting we were just talking about wanting to watch this tonight!
My Mister,Maybe they'll finally explain Mr. McFeely
My Mister,Fantastic doc
My Mister,I might have to check this show out.
My Mister,"Did you notice anyone crying? 

&#x200B;"
My Mister,"The doc category looks pretty great this year I think. Including *RBG* and not *Won’t You Be My Neighbor* is curious though, and doesn't make much sense, but other that.

(And a lot of people care about the Oscars)"
My Mister,It was a pretty good documentary but I didn’t learn anything new. It was one r/todayIlearned post after another
My Mister,"So, what documentary that did get nominated would you nominate this instead of?"
My Mister,My conspiracy theory is they’re clearing the decks for Tom Hanks and his film next year. Fuck Hanks. 
My Mister,"It’s on Canadian Netflix if you have a VPN, neighbour. "
My Mister,Woah you get discs from Netflix still? 
My Mister,"I just watched this tonight and I made it about halfway without crying, but I couldn’t stop for the last half.

This is the most I’ve cried for any reason in a very long time."
My Mister,"Yup, lots"
My Mister,"Since you are the only other person here that didn't like ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" a ton... I saw almost all the nominated documentaries and other ones too... And ""WYBMN"" is like 5th best maybe. "
My Mister,"I really can’t say because I haven’t seen all of them, but this movie had a tremendous effect on me and everyone I know that has watched it. His approach to life was definitely something we all needed reminding of and this film does it so eloquently."
My Mister,"Same here.  I literally said, on accident ""I miss you"" when he first came on screen at the very start.   And yeah , about halfway (or maybe earlier... ) the waterworks just kicked on and didnt see any need to relent. 
"
My Mister,"I pretty much started crying the moment I saw him.  as a 40 year old man, I managed to just get in there and enjoy mr. rogers.  I think I have been a less dangerous person because of him.  Sounds like a flex, but I was raised by wolves and it is a damn mystery I am not a fucking monster like my family. 
"
My Mister,"See, you can praise the film without shitting on the Oscars or the films that got nominated."
My Mister,"Well, some of the Best Picture nominations are laughable. Bohemian Rhapsody was enjoyable enough and Rami Malek was great but other than that I’m at a loss for why it’s nominated. Black Panther was also underwhelming and for it to be the first superhero movie nominated bugs me. But I guess I should just be glad that they didn’t nominate Infinity War. 

Also, the whole Popular Film category thing? Uhhh okkkk"
My Mister,">See, you can praise the film without shitting on the Oscars or the films that got nominated.

Alright, I guess you can't."
My Mister,"> [The writer's children] found the puppets I’d always adored as a kid the least interesting part of the show. They were far more interested in Rogers himself. They loved it when he showed them how something worked, and especially loved it when he fed the fish.

> I asked my youngest two, as they obsessed over the fish, what was it about the show that appealed to them.

> After a beat, they gave me that look that parents will readily recognize, the one that best translates to “Isn’t it obvious?”

> “He likes kids, Mommy,” my daughter said. “Kids know when a grown-up likes them.”

> “And he’s not too loud,” my son added. “When we watch him, there’s no noise. You don’t have to worry about anything.”

> **Kind and calm. So that explained everything. In a world of so much chaos and noise, kids liked calm sincerity.**"
My Mister,That's a nice story even if the quotes from the kids are a little suspect. :)
My Mister,Story is blocked in my country for some reason.
My Mister,"Holy crap The kids in the story are horrible, or the parents are...

Congratulations You've raised people who have no attention span."
My Mister,"r/thathappened stuff right there. Also, she didn't think they'd like Mister Rogers because she tried Footloose?"
My Mister,Possibly GDPR
My Mister,Actually read the article before assuming what it's about 🤦
My Mister,"I did. 

""This is terrible!” the kids groaned, as they watched Bacon and actress Lori Singer on screen. “Since when do 30-year-olds go to high school? Since when does anyone talk like that in high school?”

Fifteen minutes into the film, they insisted we turn it off, telling us they were scarred for life.

The kids had similarly mocked other pop culture icons of our shared youth. They called the vintage Madonna I played for them “boring”and referred to Springsteen as “grandpa” music. They described cinematic classics like “E.T.” and the original Karate Kid as “too slow.” ""

I've got kids, they don't behave this way. They love E.T. and the karate kid. 

They were all raised watching Mr Rogers from '07-currently. Some things are timeless."
My Mister,"Ok. With that explanation your comment makes more sense. My kid isn't like that either, she liked E.T., thought he was cute."
My Mister,">...only The Monkees ever returned on Nick at Nite in the Summer of 1997).

And I think they only picked up season 1 for that run. S1 was 32 episodes, they ran 5 weeks of Monkee Mondays that year (up through episode 30), then switched to Green Acres for the last couple weeks of 1997's Block Party Summer."
My Mister,"Yep. I just remember as a kid when the black and white shows came on, Nickelodeon was done until the morning."
My Mister,"Wow, that was when Nick at Nite as getting into Sketch comedy, they used to also have some stand-up comedy during commercials breaks if there was enough time to fit them between shows.

They had one commercial break and 4 commercials...no voice over on the ending credits...then it was about 6 minutes of commercials after a show ended  until the next show started. That slowly changed over time though.

The sketch comedy ended up going on HA! MTV and VH-1, before going to Comedy Central. MTV owned Nickelodeon (still does) and ""HA! The First TV Comedy Network"" was owned by MTV Networks as well...but HBO created a comedy channel as well called ""The Comedy Channel"" .

HA! had more sitcoms and then at night it would have select sketch comedy...The Comedy Channel was only sketch comedy. Both channels lasted a year and decided to merge to create ""CTV: The Comedy Network"", but changed the name to ""Comedy Central"" two months later."
My Mister,Who exactly are requesting these?
My Mister,"I remember this lineup and my favorite show was Patty Duke.  

Nick at Nite was so much fun in the late 80s and 90s.  I used to love watching Nick at Nite and drawing pictures every night before bed. I also loved their quirky bumpers, stuff like Milkman and How to Be Swell, and the NYE Countdown with Casey Kasem."
My Mister,"Thank you for that golden nugget of information. I did not realize that, but as Nick at Nite used to say...""it' is a part of our television heritage""."
My Mister,I was one of the people who asked for the classic cable schedules. This was during cable's golden age when each channel used to offer more variety instead of airing only 5 shows all day in marathon blocks like they do now.
My Mister,Why didn't you just drop it?
My Mister,"From what I remembered of the show I think you've thought about longer and harder than the writers did.  Certainly more than I did, because I felt it was one of those mediocre military shows that I really don't remember much.  It's typical hero stuff.  Everything the hero does is good, all the people he killed are ""bad"".  It is basically a form of nationalist propaganda."
My Mister,Read the books
My Mister,"Probably, i m kinda sensitive to alot of subject, but i try to be constructiv, it is also good to analyse those kind of stuff to see what it says about a country or a mindset. 

&#x200B;

I just felt meh about this show and kinda needed to express it, so here i m 

&#x200B;

thx for your answers"
My Mister,Exactly how high were your expectations for a 15 year old failed reboot?
Alone,"Nice! She was always a stand out favorite of the cast for me. They gave her great lines, and she had great delivery!"
Alone,The insecure Coachella episode will forever be her best episode on the show.
Alone,LOVED her episode in The Characters!!!  This is exciting!
Alone,"Love her! Whatever she is working on, I wanna see it"
Alone,She was great in White Lotus too
Alone,"She also wrote for Insecure as well, super talented."
Alone,"""Remember me different"""
Alone,From Poppy Cock!
Alone,I did not know she was a writer too! Even more impressive than I realized!
Alone,"> Paramount surpassed **77 million streaming subscribers in Q4, adding 10 million to Paramount+ alone to reach nearly 56 million** customers for that platform...

> The streamer currently has **partnership and distribution deals with Walmart, Delta, Sky, Canal+, Amazon and Roku that contribute to its overall subscriber tally.**



Also, in the news

[Paramount+ Price to Increase as Losses Peak and Company Sets $1 Billion-Plus Write-Down on Showtime Integration](https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/paramount-price-hike-showtime-writedown-1235525076/): 

> Paramount Global is preparing to hike the monthly price of Paramount+ later this year, and the company disclosed its intent to take as much as a $1.5 billion write-down from the integration of Showtime with the streaming platform.

> **Paramount Global acknowledged that the company will have negative free cash flow in 2023 — a situation that would have seemed shocking for a media giant the size of Paramount just a few years ago.** The news of the write-down coupled with the previously announced integration of Paramount+ and Showtime also provides strong evidence that the “Peak TV” bubble of rampant series production is rapidly coming to an end. Paramount Global expects to save about $700 million in the long term on content costs by uniting Paramount+ and Showtime....

> **The monthly price of the premium Paramount+ tier with Showtime will rise to $11.99, from $9.99 at present. The essential tier without Showtime and with advertising will climb to $5.99 from $4.99.** Executives did not specify a time frame for the price hikes but said they would come this year."
Alone,"Please upgrade your servers?   When ever they release a new episode of Star Trek, the app struggles to navigate, the video stream takes too long to load up.  Switch to Kodi using the video add-on, same thing.  So I feel that their servers buckle under the popularity of new episodes of Star Trek."
Alone,They have movies and shows that people want to watch.
Alone,[deleted]
Alone,Tyler Sheridan carrying the entire network...
Alone,"This is the only service I'm paying for right now (at the $5/mo). Started with Halo (meh) but stuck around partly for Strange New Worlds, Lower Decks, Beavis and Butthead, old eps of Twilight Zone, etc.

Main thing though is it has a strong CBS catalog for older family members (plus the likes of Tulsa King). And a solid kids section with Paw Patrol and the like.

Did consider the Walmart deal but no point since very rarely use them."
Alone,Walmart+ gave it out free.
Alone,Yet they still have the worst app in the history of apps.
Alone,"Paramount+ might be the most underrated streaming app along with Apple TV. I love the Nickelodeon content for my kids and they have some really good stuff like Yellowstone and Beavis and Butthead for the grownups. Also, Ghosts is such a fun show."
Alone,"1923 is the best thing since Wind River outta Sheridan. 

I love Ford and Mirren in this, like they’re great but…

Holy hell is the Africa storyline a banger if you’re watching that with your wife. Totally palpable sexual attraction between the leads and the writing is the right amount of schmaltz that we can all enjoy. 

Totally haven’t even touched the latest season of Yellowstone but I’m all in for more of this timeline."
Alone,"Meanwhile, on the same website only 2 hours later: https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/paramount-price-hike-showtime-writedown-1235525076/"
Alone,Everyone who signs up for Walmart+ gets free Paramount+ as a bonus extra
Alone,The Paramount+ PlayStation app is absolute garbage. 2/10 would not recommend
Alone,I wonder how many are people on free trials and deals (like verizon with disney)
Alone,"I subbed because of the Halo show, and despite what the hardcore fandom thinks of the show due to main char taking off his helmet (lol), I really liked it

Hoping for higher budget and a bit more action focus in the next season though!"
Alone,Paramount literally offers me a free month code quite often. I’m sure that also helps their numbers.
Alone,I love the shows. The app is horrible on my fire TV though. And it never seems to pick up where I left off when I go to continue a show. I always have to manually find the episode I was on.
Alone,"it's my Frasier/1923/Tarantino machine. Maybe not worth the cost but hell, I ain't got no regrets"
Alone,"They have some great shows, but it should also note they did give away a free month of the service via codes and what not."
Alone,"If they don't do Players season 2, I'll never subscribe again."
Alone,It’s because of Beavis and Butthead and Top Gun
Alone,RIP Workahollics movie. Let's give Paramount their flowers.
Alone,"Paramount made a net profit of $21 million in the 4th quarter of 2022 down 99% from the $2.058 billion net profit from the 4th quarter of 2021.

The good old streaming money furnace continuing to cripple media companies."
Alone,All due to Halo baby!
Alone,"Yellowstone and it's related spinoffs is boomer cat nip. 

I don't know what exactly the magic dust is on this franchise but my dad, who still struggles with ordering stuff off Amazon, couldn't wait to get Paramount+ so he could stay up to date with all the different series.

(Damn, y'all are sensitive. I didn't even say anything bad about the show(s). I guess commenting that a show people here like is also heavily enjoyed by old people is offensive?)"
Alone,"Gtfo, they've been giving away free 3 months coincidentally on multiple platforms like Xbox gamepass, etc to the point I have overlapping offers for free service lol

It's insulting to ppl's intelligence, 3 months is literally a quarter - which I bet they lied and will try to show as retained since why would you cancel until the 3 month line???

This doesn't mean they even gained a single paying sub, in-fact maybe they lost once all is said and done and the cost of giving all that away *for free* lol"
Alone,And here comes the price hikes
Alone,"T-Mobile gave out a free year to all subscribers, so ya this number is artificially inflated."
Alone,How can they get away with streaming in 720p in 2023? Champions league games look like absolute shit no matter where I stream it from Paramount +
Alone,dont think these numbers mean much when its coming bundles with just about everything and being given away for free. They dont have any shows people care about
Alone,Still will not add to the revenue. Most of those subs were free or discounted. Will end up going back to deals with licensing their programming again.
Alone,And as soon as Mayor of Kingstown season 2 finishes I’m unsubscribing again.
Alone,And that is when they said “time for a price hike” . Paramount just playing the game too. They don’t have money problems. Sponsoring bullshit articles about why they need to increase prices becuase they lost 200k subs or some trash. SMH.
Alone,Paramount plus has great content! The app is SUCH garbage.
Alone,Taylor Sheridan+
Alone,And they still canceled the workaholics movie! Im pissed now!
Alone,"Don’t you love it when the aspect ratio doesn’t change after the advertisements, and you get to see Captain Kirk/Picard/Sisko/Janeway’s face being stretched like they’ve been thrown in that machine from Insurrection?"
Alone,"Upgrade the interface or let me filter by year. 


No logical reason I should see films from the 1940’s directly next to 2022 films. They want to inflate their inventory, I get it, but it makes the service unusable for me."
Alone,"Hold up, what new star trek? What have I missed? Theres picard, strange new worlds and discovery. Is there another one?"
Alone,"I finished the last episodes of ST: Strange New Worlds and Halo months ago and they're still on my ""Continue Watching tab with 3/4 full progress bars even through I watched to the very end."
Alone,Yeah I highly doubt it's the sheer popularity of *Star Trek* that's fucking them up 😂
Alone,And Champions League which is a pretty big deal.
Alone,"It’s quite funny how the reaction is to streaming companies when they’re small and can add more subscribers compared to the much larger ones that can’t 

This is somehow a positive headline when P+ has just 56 million total subs and Showtime has like 20m

But Netflix is failing and falling apart when it has 231 million subscribers, and same goes for Disney when it has 160 million Disney+ subs, 48 million Hulu subs, and 25 million ESPN+ subs and it’s also a failure according to this subreddit."
Alone,They also are giving it away free to Walmart employees (the U.S.’s largest private employer) and Walmart + customers.  So that has probably helped their numbers.
Alone,"They have forced ads even if you pay for no ads. Just what everyone loves!



Come check out the awesome Paramount owned TV shows that for some reason they only put a handful of episodes of on their own streaming service. Want to watch Season 1 episode 4 of Happy Days without worrying you'll see episode 5 next? Paramount thought of that! Don't even worry about seasons 2-11...they made sure to not include them because true fans know you only need to watch 10 random episodes from season 1 to enjoy the entire series.


And now with the option to add Showtime, you can see every Showtime movie and show integrated into the browse page so that you'll think they have more movies and content than they actually do! Isn't it fun figuring our what you can and can't watch!"
Alone,I had it after the initial launch and is was overwhelmed with everything. It felt like there was too much.
Alone,"Yup, for now. Seems like we’ll be in a never ending cycle of switching to whichever service is producing the best content, and they’re all taking turns. Netflix is already out lol."
Alone,oh yeah gotta see the real world and roadrules
Alone,"Great analysis.

There’s also the big marketing push they’ve been making, appealing to different demos - some that are still on cable."
Alone,clearly they dont
Alone,clearly they dont
Alone,"Not really. I'm willing to bet it's all the free year subs and shit they've handed out over the past year. I got a free year from T-Mobile. Used it initially when you could ad block the commercials but once they put a stop to that, I stopped using it. Haven't used it in 5+ months and it's still active til March.

Their interface blows, they don't have complete series, and they're raising the monthly rate.

Another case of bullshit numbers pumped out by a media company."
Alone,I struggle to find any and I have a sub (cancelled after 1 month but I seem to have it free for the last 6 months).
Alone,Bro do they? I can never find anything I want to watch on there
Alone,It also comes free with T-Mobile cell service...
Alone,"The Walmart+ and T-Mobile customers are what drive the numbers. Same with Disney+ that comes with Verizon along with ESPN and Hulu. I have every service, but the only one I pay for outright is Netflix. Oh wait i got a year free if I bought a sports package through Verizon. Er Amazon then, though im mainly in it for the shipping."
Alone,"Yep, you can stop paying and they won’t revoke your access. Dead serious, I’ve been getting it for free for over a year. I started my subscription on an iOS device, canceled before the free trial ended; but a year later I can still access it on all my devices. I’ve shared my password with my whole family and they all still have access as well."
Alone,"Sounds like they’re going with a “fake it till you make it” strategy. So I guess will see if it works?

Personally I have no interest in checking them out."
Alone,"That's why! I used a prepaid debit card to try the service a month ago, it was supposed to be a 1 week free trial, and it's still working 50 days later, no extra charges has been made and the card had like 30 cents ever since."
Alone,"I'm here for 1923. 

Yellowstone is so pulpy but I love it because it's so darn entertaining. 1923, on the other hand, is actually really good"
Alone,Reddit hates it that Yellowstone is so popular lol
Alone,"So true. Outside of Top Gun Maverick and Smile they mentioned that 1923, Tulsa King, and Yellowstone were the main acquisition drivers in a record quarter for the service."
Alone,"Taylor, but yes"
Alone,The Offer is pretty good if you like dramatizations of “making the sausage” in Hollywood
Alone,For some reason (in the UK anyway) they have the (quite violent) HBO Prison drama 'Oz' from the early 2000s.  It kicked off HBO's era of prestige TV and is a treat to watch.
Alone,My wife spent the past year watching the entire Good Wife TV Universe. I’ve just been watching Star Trek.
Alone,"Man me and my partner tried that new show 1923 after the previous season but it's so fucking cringe, completely trash compared to the previous season. That scene where she chased after the car was the nail in the coffin for us. Only good part was that nun getting absolutely fucked up. I won't touch Yellowstone wasted my own time watching the first 3 seasons, it's a hick soap opera idk what I was doing watching that lmao."
Alone,"Yeah that’s the only reason I have it. My Amex card comes with free Walmart+, so I also have free paramount+."
Alone,Dude. I've been paying for both like a goddamn sucker for months. Thank you for making me aware of this.
Alone,God you're so right. It is SO much better on the phone and casting it to the TV or with our Google Home. The PS app was made by a 6 year old just telling a 3 year old how to make an app.
Alone,"Every single one of their apps are garbage, browser, xbox, playstation, vizio, all just didn't work for me. got paramount through amazon prime and wow look at that, it actually worked."
Alone,Paramount + is by far the worst streaming app I've used. It's absolutely terrible. I'm trying to rewatch Twin Peaks.
Alone,"That is the silliest, but far from the only reason fans didn't like the Halo show."
Alone,I did like select episodes. Looking forward to what they do in S2.
Alone,"I thought Halo was a solid 7/10 and a lot of fun.   Reddit just seems to absolutely hate shows that's are just okay.  Not everything is prestige television.

*Of course, this got downvotes.  Lol"
Alone,"I have been tormented by how much I hated the Halo show for the past year. It's an ongoing, intrusive annoyance that follows me every time I bump into the franchise online in some capacity.

It's not a hardcore fan thing, I haven't even played any Halo games since Halo 3 in 2007. What stuck with me is how far removed from the *feel* of the Halo games the show wound up being. I'd be interested in a sci-fi drama in an original setting, or with a different IP like Mass Effect, but we weren't anywhere close to the tone and emotions that the Halo franchise is supposed to elicit. There were only what, three action scenes total? Master Chief is entirely unrecognizable. The awe-inspiring score of the games is gone, too, which might actually be my biggest gripe with the whole thing.

At its worst, I found the show to be profoundly boring. At its best, I was still left wanting from the brief glimpses of a shadow of what actually made the franchise what it is. It was painfully obvious that the showrunners had no idea what the essence of Halo was."
Alone,">Yellowstone and it's related spinoffs is boomer cat nip.

Yellowstone isn't on Paramount+ All of its spinoffs are. Try explaining that to a septuagenarian.

For me it's the Star Trek channel."
Alone,The spin-offs have been amazing.  Writing them off as boomer shows is rediculous.
Alone,"They do, unfortunately, also have the Champion's League."
Alone,"If you use the Kodi Video Add-On, you don't get advertisements."
Alone,"Picard, Discovery, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy, Lower Decks, all considered New Trek by most people."
Alone,"In addition to what the other commenter said, season 3 of Picard just premiered today"
Alone,Lower Decks and Prodigy
Alone,"Yep, I've been subscribed two years, and 95% of the content I watch is the UCL, and some NFL games"
Alone,"... don't forget Europa League too! Ok, you can forget Europa League now."
Alone,I’m pretty much exclusively subbed for the football it offers.
Alone,"All about expectations. Disney and Netflix are supposed to be behemoths and are each worth 10x what Paramount is worth total. 

Also, Netflix had a huge turnaround. Anybody in this sub thinking they’re unsuccessful are kidding themselves. They may be turning a bit anti-consumer with the password stuff, but that’s pretty much the only main criticism about it."
Alone,"The disney ceo that got fired was hiding how much disney+ was losing.  They are all losing money, but netflix and they are trying hard to join them."
Alone,"This is exactly what happened for decades with TV ratings (not to mention box office). These numbers are effectively meaningless when divorced from the context of each company. In an ideal world none of these companies would tell you how many people are subscribed, who's watching a given show, etc because any headline about viewership can be spinned negatively or positively. Number of subscribers doesn't necessarily correlate with profitability.

And quite frankly it isn't even positive with P+, there's another article that just got posted here about how they're losing a ton of money and the price is about to go up. The top comment points out how much of the subs are free or heavily discounted through cable subscriptions, codes, and other ways people get around paying."
Alone,Reddit hates the investor class but also thinks exactly like them
Alone,"Exactly this, most people just bandwagon without understanding a single thing about the subscription numbers and what they represent."
Great Pretender,"Any fans of animation at all should check this out, even if you're not an anime person. It is very much not a traditional anime and it is stylish and gorgeous as hell."
Great Pretender,It's by the guys behind Vinland Saga is it not? (if so... I can't wait to watch this)
Great Pretender,Gorgeous artwork too.
Great Pretender,Hey how did everybody feel about Japan Sinks? It wasn’t what I thought at all but I ended up liking it a lot.
Great Pretender,Anywhere close to Baccano! ? That was one hell of a ride for a heist anime.
Great Pretender,I love Abbie's design so much
Great Pretender,The stills look amazing.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the color schemes instead of just slapping repurposed character cells on a generic backdrop.
Great Pretender,"Oh man there’s so many anime out there that are just stylish.

The entire lupin franchise for example"
Great Pretender,Can you speak to the quality of the dub vs sub? I usually prefer subs but the animation in this looks really beautiful and I’d like to be able to take it all in rather than reading subtitles and risk missing out on some background details.
Great Pretender,Yes Studio Wit did both
Great Pretender,"Got about half way through before dropping it, heard it only went even more off the deepend from there."
Great Pretender,"I watched the first 5 episodes. I enjoyed the first episode but as the show got more ridiculous as it went on, I lost interest. I thought it was by far the worst Yuasa involved show I've watched."
Great Pretender,"I think that's the one Science Saru/Masaaki Yuasa series I haven't tackled yet before his feature-length filmography.  If you like that style, also give Ping Pong: The Animation, The Tatami Galaxy, Keep Your Hands Off Eizoken, and/or Kaiba a try."
Great Pretender,"The plot isn't as complex and the characters aren't as numerous as in Baccano, but it still has a very thrilling series of escalating bluffs that always seem like they're on the edge of being sniffed out. It's a very satisfying show and an addicting watch."
Great Pretender,"Baccano is my 3rd favorite anime of all time and I would say GP is very different conceptually, but has very similar energy. The real world setting, the twisty plot, the well developed and nuanced characters, the flash and style, all are shared between the two, though GP seemingly lacks the supernatural element of Baccano. Would def recommend though if you love Baccano."
Great Pretender,Is that how it used to work? Was I really watching the same drawings week after week with different voiceovers?
Great Pretender,"I think the English dub is fine, but I particularly like how it isn't all in English and thus flows with the situation. When they're speaking in English it's English, when they are speaking Japanese it's Japanese."
Great Pretender,"Not really a yes. They only animated it. It's more about the director and writer, and neither worked on Vinland."
Great Pretender,You dropped something based on the internet telling you to? Wtf?
Great Pretender,"Gumu Gumu no Jet Pistol.

Hey can't release a 22 minute animation every week for 20 years without cheaping out somewhere. Especially [Walking animations oh my god walking animations.](https://youtu.be/QpaiG9Yu5J4)"
Great Pretender,"Oh yeah. To this day, cheap animation reuses alot."
Great Pretender,No I dropped it because I was bored and couldn't be arsed to watch any more.
Great Pretender,"Yeah, the subtitles are for the original Japanese dialogue. The trick is that what works in Japanese doesn't always work in English, so changes are made to help the actors give believable lines that fit in the amount of space they have, while a subtitle can be longer if needed."
Great Pretender,Are there multiple subtitle tracks? Some of them have the subs for Japanese and then also English for the hearing impaired that would be the English dialogue transcribed.
Great Pretender,"Original dialogue is in Japanese so the animations for face/mouth/expressions are for Japanese dialogue. 

When doing subtitles you can have lines of text that don't necessarily match up with the length of the spoken dialogue. The original Japanese could be 15 syllables and the subtitles could be 20. All they gotta do is match the meaning. 

But when doing a dub you have to match the dialogue with the length of the dialogue animation so they take more liberties to match both the meaning and the rhythm."
Great Pretender,"Subtitles are rarely perfect.  If you watch English subtitles on even a native English language production, you'll often notice lines of dialogue missing or changed."
Great Pretender,"Japanese voices.. English subtitles?

&#x200B;

different number of words are sometimes used to express the same message. 

&#x200B;

idioms are a good example..

&#x200B;

""no risk, no reward""

[https://matadornetwork.com/abroad/30-awesome-japanese-idioms-start-using-english/](https://matadornetwork.com/abroad/30-awesome-japanese-idioms-start-using-english/)"
Great Pretender,"I know what you're talking about. When you use subtitles for simple hearing assistance, it can be very frustrating when the subtitles are not exactly what's spoken.

I've found you have to make sure you are on the CC or ""hearing impaired"" subtitles... many Netflix shows have separate English subs and one of them is usually exactly what you're hearing."
Great Pretender,I’ve noticed this.  It makes me wonder of the subtitles are from the screenplay/script  where actors with ad lib or change around a sentence.
Great Pretender,"That seems reasonable.  I also assume it comes down to money and schedule, the more they are given, the better the subtitles are, I assume."
Great Pretender,"It's the ""least anime-like"" anime I've ever seen if anyone here isn't too keen on watching an anime. I haven't noticed *any* of the usual anime tropes and it feels like a mix of Catch Me if You Can & White Collar.

So far only the first 10 minutes have taken place in Japan before it moves to LA and if you get confused by the language switching and the weird accents in the English Dub then that is *also* only for the first 10 minutes, after that it treats everyone as if their American and speak perfect English."
Great Pretender,I read the title and thought it was a sequel to the 90s TV show called 'The Pretender' and now I've made myself sad.
Great Pretender,Is it the one with character design by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto? Because that’s on my to-watch list.
Great Pretender,"idk it felt like low quality western animation in terms of writing.   
anime generally has a more polished tone of writing that i'm used to(atleast with the more stylish mature ones like this is emulating)"
Great Pretender,same...
Great Pretender,"What did you think of it?  I liked it a lot.  The criticism of not being able to tell the boys apart is kind of funny.  Yeah, maybe Craig and Deran aren't too different, but you sure know who Pope is.  Shawn Hatosy is great (again) in this."
Great Pretender,"I liked it too!   Not sure why anyone couldn't tell the boys apart....So far only watched the first episode, but it did keep my interest....watching 2nd tonight...I do have lots of questions, but hopefully they will be answered as I keep watching!  "
Great Pretender,"Just saw the first two episodes last night, i'm really liking it! 

Its good to see a familiar face (Shawn Hatosy) who was also in a previous TNT show Southland. 

"
Great Pretender,Yeah I can't tell the names apart from Pope and zaz but ones the druggie and the other is gay. And the young buck is j
Great Pretender,"Holy shit!  I kept trying to figure out who Pope was, without checking imdb.  He is so creepy, and i can't believe he was on Southland"
Great Pretender,A basic google search showed that the show mostly ranked in the bottom 25 network series in the ratings so that is most likely the answer.
Great Pretender,Loved this show. The story telling was amazing with the time changes.
Great Pretender,"I love that show so much

It was so fun when the actors showed up in back to back episodes of Burn Notice since the basic premise of the shows are so similar"
Great Pretender,"Brings back memories. My mom was so into that show when I was a kid - The Pretender, Highlander, La Femme Nikita, Beauty and the Beast (with Ron Perlman), among others. They all take me back to happier more carefree times."
Great Pretender,"The ratings weren't very good but it was airing on Saturday nights and expectations were lower, even back then. By this point, WB and UPN were running and they and cable had begun diluting networks' share of the pie.

The first season ranked 89th out of 162 shows and was NBC's fourth lowest-rated show. The network probably believed in the show and took a chance, hoping the ratings would get better. 

It landed at #88 out of 175 shows in year two. It probably would have been canned but NBC had 11 shows with worse ratings that year. Seinfeld was also ending. You can't cancel everything so Pretender got lucky and got a third-season renewal. 

Pretender ranked 83rd for season three. By this point, I'm thinking that NBC was ready to let it go but it was sold into syndication in 1999 to WB and TNT. I'm guessing 20th Century Fox made an attractive deal for NBC to renew it one last time, with the studio knowing they'd make up the money in syndication. 

Season four ended on a cliffhanger in 2000, but thanks to a viewer campaign, two follow-up movies were produced and aired on TNT the following year.  Unfortunately, the last one also ended with a cliffhanger."
Great Pretender,That bitchy character played by Andrea Parker was hot as fuck
Great Pretender,Loved The Pretender and Early Edition. I would alternate weeks when I would tape one while watching the other.
Great Pretender,"From what I remember, it was paired up pretty tightly with Profiler, which aired immediately after on the same night (...Saturday...).  Profiler's 4th season was something of a shitshow, with the lead being a guest star for most of the 4th before being being written out of the show, and it unsuccessfully trying to bring in a new lead.  Saturday night was already on the outs as a normal night of programming for most networks, and there had been multiple failed attempts by NBC to brand their Saturday night programming the ""Thrillogy"" block, so I'd bet they just abandoned the experiment entirely once Profiler shit the bed, since IIRC Profiler was the most successful one of the night up to that point."
Great Pretender,"well that title takes me back, i expect there's a lot in this sub that weren't even born yet when it was cancelled."
Great Pretender,"I also loved this show, watching the Pretender and Profiler double headers was a highlight of my childhood, but it was never that popular.  Low ratings eventually ended it, even after an attempted revival on TNT."
Great Pretender,"Pretender, Profiler, The Others!"
Great Pretender,"Wasn't there another show wich played in the same universe? Profiler maybe?

Also Miss Parkers legs carried the whole thing."
Great Pretender,"> I don't know if the show was ever meant to last long considering its story structure. 

I think that is the big one. Frankly, it went on too long as it was. The main motivation for the show was for the guy to learn to navigate the world and find his parents. 

After 2-3 years, it kind of felt like he was just stuck."
Great Pretender,I loved this show! Always saw a little of Jared in Kyle XY- would have made for a great match up.
Great Pretender,"I could be completely remembering this wrong... 

The week to week episodes were interesting for a while but lost steam understandably after a bit. The issue was that the series story arc was just a mess and struggled to be consistent and catch on. 

Or I could be remembering a different series, ha. Like other posters have said other ways, that was a while back."
Great Pretender,Loved this show!
Great Pretender,It's also really difficult to find. iTunes has the first couple seasons for purchase iirc but not the latter two. I don't think it's on any streaming networks other than that.
Great Pretender,"I am on a rewatch of my dvd set now. Loved the show when it first aired. 

Think I can only locate the follow up movies on YT. Haven’t seen the movies ever. So will work my way through the series again and then watch them. 


Miss Parker and Sydney were my two favourites."
Great Pretender,"I thought it was fun, but he should have had some more supernatural powers.

When all was said and done, he wasn’t that amazing or inhuman enough to crave his lost humanity. Basically, I think Stranger Things took the idea of genetically enhanced person who wants a father figure further."
Great Pretender,Because your personal enjoyment of a series years after it's over isn't the metric they base cancellation and renewal decisions on.
Great Pretender,Loved this show as a kid. No clue how I feel into it at the time but glad I did
Great Pretender,"Ratings weren't great.

It likely only made it to 4 seasons to try and get a syndication deal."
Great Pretender,I loved that show as well.
Great Pretender,Four seasons is a lot. But it was never popular.
Great Pretender,But this confused me more. Then why in the hell did it last 4 seasons if it was on the bottom 25 rankings?
Great Pretender,It aired on Saturday nights too back when networks had a Saturday night lineup.
Great Pretender,">Beauty and the Beast (with Ron Perlman),

He was the beauty, right?"
Great Pretender,"Did we have the same Mom?  My mom was super into those shows too, but ONLY those shows.  My dad hated The Pretender when it was live, but loved it in syndication - always watched the Pretender episodes!"
Great Pretender,"You couldn't watch them all, "" There can be only one!"" 😁"
Great Pretender,"The Pretender 2001 was decent. The Island of the Haunted (name?) was horrible, and I’m a Pretender fan."
Great Pretender,She was my absolute crush back in those days!
Great Pretender,"> That bitchy character played by Andrea Parker was hot as fuck

Funnily enough, Andrea Parker's character was named ""Miss Parker"""
Great Pretender,Off the charts sexual charisma.
Great Pretender,Early Edition was such fun. Somehow scratched the same itch as Quantum Leap and Sliders.
Great Pretender,"Yeah, it was The Profiler. They had a crossover event where they appeared on each other's shows."
Great Pretender,"Your correct at least after season two, the story arc was a bloody mess!"
Great Pretender,Torrent.
Great Pretender,I know. I wanted to rewatch the series and did a search for streaming. Nothing came up. So I am watching my dvds. Googled the prices of the dvds and my eyes watered. I got the dvds when they were released
Great Pretender,"I disagree. He was locked away because he was so brilliant and could become anyone, but he couldn't lead a normal life because he wasn't allowed just to be himself. Then again calm I think after the third season it kind of ran out of plot, even for this."
Great Pretender,"That's true for every show, so that doesn't explain why this specific show ended after 4 seasons."
Great Pretender,"NBC had a habit of nurturing lower rated, but critically praised, shows in the 80s and 90s.  Quantum Leap was another show that never had particularly high ratings and it got 5 seasons."
Great Pretender,4 Seasons is like the bare minimum to sell a syndication deal.  It's a little lighter than usual but cable was exploding in 2000 and you could sell just about anything.  Getting the 4th season on was likely to make money on the back end.  Even bad ratings in S3 could be enough to warrant a S4 to get enough episodes.  And this type of show was selling big.
Great Pretender,"Not sure if it applies here, but I read that some shows like Caroline in the City don’t have great ratings but are owned directly by the network whereas a more highly rated show may be produced by a third party and as a result isn’t as profitable."
Great Pretender,It was on a Saturday & one of the last originals for a Saturday.
Great Pretender,I haven’t seen either of the movies. Want to see them once I finish my re watch of the series. I know the first one is on YT.
Great Pretender,She was in the pilot of JAG. Didn’t get picked up in the full time series role. But did a couple of guest appearances. After JAG part she scored The Pretender
Great Pretender,Because the production cost no longer provided a worthwhile return.
Great Pretender,"NBC never stopped doing that. They kept Law & Order on the air just so it could tie Gunsmoke for most original scripted show seasons, because Dick Wolf wanted it. They kept Hannibal on for 3 years even though nobody watched it, because it was widely critically acclaimed and a potential awards darling.

&#x200B;

Hannibal is an awesome show, BTW, everyone should go watch that."
Great Pretender,"It was often on Saturday nights, and networks had low expectations."
Great Pretender,This. Thank you for reminding me how the episode count used to be 26 and you needed about a minimum of 100 episodes to do syndication deals.
Great Pretender,I actually forgot back then other companies could own shows and syndication and not be owned by the networks. Thank you for reminding me about that as well!
Great Pretender,Still hoping for S04 T_T
Great Pretender,Seconded!
Great Pretender,They still do that today.

BG Personal Bodyguard,Wow. I’m surprised anyone even remembers 24:Legacy. Everyone knew it was a joke and it bombed hard. Jack Bauer was 24 and without Kiefer there was no show.
BG Personal Bodyguard,I haven’t seen the show but I enjoyed reading this essay about it. Thanks.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I think it’s interesting that you’re focusing almost exclusively on the *politics* of the show rather than treat as just a piece of storytelling or a piece of entertainment. You seem to be unwilling to digest the show as just a show, and are instead observing it through a prism of your own making.

I’ve never watched this season specifically because it did not involve Kiefer Sutherland, thus making it feel like a waste of everyone’s time. I saw all of the other seasons as they aired back in the day, and it definitely had a mix of really good and really boring seasons. By it’s very nature, the only way to think back on this show is by treating each season as totally unique and separate from the rest. BUT, taken as a whole, 24 was schlocky entertainment that helped usher a new era of television, so overall it was pretty damn cool.

I don’t even agree with a lot of the politics of the show, specifically the constant glorification of torture as being a justifiable method of interrogation. But I’m intelligent enough to understand the difference between reality and fiction. So to me it was just entertaining, campy, fun, those are the words I would use to describe it.

So it’s interesting reading your comment, and feeling like you did not perceive even one minute of it as a piece of entertainment. You only perceive it as a sort of political statement, and thus your entire criticism is centered on those politics. It’s just an interesting form of criticism, but I don’t think it is all that fair."
BG Personal Bodyguard,If you say so.  24 had run its course long before Legacy was released.
BG Personal Bodyguard,I think if they had managed to find some way to make legacy feel like it's own thing while in the same universe it would've worked. Also I only remember it cause I was basically forced to by roommate/fuck buddy three months ago lol
BG Personal Bodyguard,If there was anything of actual entertainment value I could have looked past it. Hell a lot of action shows and movies are problematic as hell. But if they're doing what they do well I can mostly ignore while check noting it in the back of my head. This show doesn't even have the benefit of having a good story so yeah I ended up focusing on the shit that bothered me quite a bit. Also you must have had to have jumped straight to the end of this post to think I only focused on the politics of the show
BG Personal Bodyguard,I never got past season four outside of this so I really couldn't tell you
BG Personal Bodyguard,You missed out. Season 5 is the best season of the show.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Never watched the anime version but knew of it but not the premise. I thoroughly enjoyed the Netflix live action version.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Yeah they tried to make Vicious more interesting and killed what made Vicious formidable in the process. He’s supposed to be an untouchable, unflappable, completely stone cold villain. He’s of course the nemesis to the sometimes silly, laid back to near nihilism (unless his opponent is strong enough to be challenging, in which case he switches on a sort of manic joy in fighting) hero of the story. Vicious being so vaulted an evil level 9000 type is what makes Spike such a mystery through the trajectory of the series, as he has clearly been marked as an equal by this seemingly invulnerable foe even though he seems like he’s playing around a lot of the time. 

They do give Vicious his due in the show when he springs his trap and seizes leadership of the syndicate, but his character flaws and overthrow at the threshold of victory almost completely overshadow his moment of brilliance. Which also weakens Spikes character as well. Why should this guy go back and bother with someone who was stupid enough to be defeated without his involvement?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"From what I've read, people who haven't seen the original have a more positive view of the live action than people who have seen the original; which makes sense because those that haven't seen the original anime have nothing to compare this show to. That said, I felt the show started out pretty good but slowly collapsed and by the end it was bad to awful. 

Vicious and Julia were portrayed terribly. I want to give this a pass because in the original Vicious wasn't really a character and neither was Julia. They were both barely in the show. With the live action they tried to actually make these characters characters, but it just didn't work. Vicious felt like Kylo Ren in a Sepiroth cosplay; and was nowhere near the threatening unstoppable looming entity he was in the original. Jet was the only good part of the show. Mustafa Shakir played him perfectly. Spike was just ok, and Faye was more like an annoying little sister than a secretive untrusting femme fatale. 

I really hope they do not give this a second season."
BG Personal Bodyguard,I enjoyed it but I never watched the anime.  It's a solid show on its own.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"My nerd son told me people didn't like it because it wasn't like the original. I don't read manga and find the show OK. In fact, it's a breath of fresh amongst the American crap."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Both Vicious and Julia are so badly written and the actors don't do anything to help it. They single-handedly drag the live-action version down multiple points. I can't believe how badly they handled them. 

Relegate them back to the occasional involvement like in the anime, let each episode be its own bounty of the week, and this show would have improved considerably. I have other serious complaints about the show, and especially the dialogue, but it's not so awful that it makes the show borderline bad like Vicious and Julia do."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"They cheaped out and cut all the expensive set pieces. And I agree, the story is hard to follow now and doesn't make sense in the context of the original animation. 

They went for style, but it just doesn't work in places."
BG Personal Bodyguard,[deleted]
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I'm curious about fans of the original anime -- am I the only one to whom it is clear that Vicious is the actual hero?

Vicious is the one who realizes from day one that the Syndicate has to be destroyed for humanity to have any chance to recover its true civilization, and the way to destroy it is to kill every single one of its possible competent future leaders, as well as the current ones.  Including himself.   And he does it.

Vicious was committing suicide by Spike.  That's clear and obvious, right?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"The problem with Julia is it's able to make out her story, but they didn't exactly show it, just the edges.  She's basically a nightclub makeup artist who became a singer who 2 gangster hitmen fell in love with and dragged into their criminal bullshit and she was charmed with the money and the prestige, but she eventually realizes she has been manipulated by everyone and is smarter and better than this bullshit so just plays one against the mob itself and against the other gangster hitman and then takes power for herself.

Vicious however is irreconcilably awful.  The story refuge of the lazy of ""Everyone is related!"" should have been seen coming a mile away when it was revealed Vicious was basically Draco Malfoy, but worse.

But I don't see how anyone could care that much about Gren."

It is not perfect, but it is enjoyable as a lighter and fluffier version of a rather dense anime."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">I really hope they do not give this a second season.

I'm torn. Ultimately, I did grow fond of the main cast, even with their different takes on these characters. I wouldn't mind seeing more of that, giving this crew the opportunity to improve their chemistry even more-- and it was already pretty good.

I'm not a jealous fan-- in the same way that people rewatch Shakespeare performed by different troupes to enjoy how different people interpret the material, I can enjoy the live action just to see how a team that *clearly* loves the source material (maybe too much, honestly) handles this world, these characters, and these themes.

But the Syndicate plotline? Julia? Vicious? It's unredeemable. There's absolutely nothing there at all, it's agony to watch, and worse, it's intrinsically woven into the fabric of the show. You just can't have Cowboy Bebop without Spike and the Syndicate. They can't drop that plotline, not realistically, and to my eyes it looks unrecoverable. 

It'd take a smarter individual than me to unfuck this, but at the same time, I wish someone would so I can get more of the other stuff."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"There's definitely some of that going around that's unfair. Because I also find a lot of the show pretty fun and good. But there's a whole side of it that is really just terrible, and it's not because it isn't like the original, it's because it's terrible."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">They cheaped out and cut all the expensive set pieces. 

Was there a space fight in the anime I missed? What are you talking about?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I feel like they made a series of cascading decisions beginning-- unfortunately, and it's very difficult to say this on the internet without sounding like a Men's Rights Activist-- with attempting to inject agency into the character of Julia, that spiraled into completely undermining the essential conflicts of the anime. 

Again, I'm not a stickler for canon in adaptations, if you wanna change things, fine, but you can't change the *central conflict*, and if you're gonna make major changes, then other elements of the story have to be changed to adapt, and they haven't done that."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"It has been said a million times but wtf were they thinking ending the season with that Ed? That ending was highschool anime club bad, maybe worse.

1) Yes they can.  It's not a shot for shot remake.

2)  Also *what are you talking about*?  The central conflict is 100% the same if slightly modified.  The fuck do you think the central conflict of the anime was?  Do you think the final scene in the series changes everything after the fact?

3) They had to find some way to move on from Real Folk Blues - you know, when Spike *dies*."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">It has been said a million times but wtf were they thinking ending the season with that Ed? 

You mean the Ed just like in the anime? What the fuck do you want?  A more serious take or characters just like the anime?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,I mean spike was drunk so of course Ed is going to be annoying and over the top from his perspective.
BG Personal Bodyguard,[removed]
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I can see how you might think that, since I describe how the characters worked in the original text-- but I don't see flaws in the new show because they aren't exactly like the original, I'm using the original to highlight why elements worked together and how in making changes, they failed to fill in new plot points and elements to achieve the same harmony that the original had.

I don't care that they did it different, I care that they did it different and *at the same time* kept so much eerily the same; the same justifications that animated the original characters don't work when you change the essential character of key players.

At the same time, I explicitly highlighted radically different parts of the new Bebop that I liked, so I think it's unfair to boil my opinion down to, 'change bad'."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Yes, I suppose you 'can' write Star Wars: A New Hope but change the conflict to be about the foodtruck business, but allow me the dignity of the vernacular, please.

The central conflict is essentially unrecognizable, I'm having a hard time understanding how changing the actual primary antagonist to the love interest of the old show does not register as a fundamental change to you. Also, I don't think you understand what 100% means.

Why are we even talking about Real Folk Blues in the context of Bebop 2021? It hasn't happened yet. Completely irrelevant."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I think the issue is that you have to change some things from the anime to work in live action without it feeling weird, but they unnecessarily changed a lot of things yet left Ed the same. There is no way that character can't come off as weird and cringe in live action without serious reworking."
BG Personal Bodyguard,Lol wtf is this cope? Netflix Ed is cringe from any perspective.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Because the American audience has a narrow view biased against animation as a medium, so they see live-action as inherently superior while animated works as less serious and made for children."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Yeah I get it, anime isn't my thing."

>The central conflict is essentially unrecognizable, I'm having a hard time understanding how changing the actual primary antagonist to the love interest of the old show does not register as a fundamental change to you.

I don't know why you think something that happened in the last 10 minutes of the last episode retroactively applies to the whole series."

BG Personal Bodyguard,"I like some cartoons, my whole generation grew up with Saturday morning cartoons, but anime is definitely still fringe in the States."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">I don't understand how you think the central conflict changed.

It literally changed. This is actually inarguable. By the dictionary definition of the word 'change', it changed, any reasonable person would look at this and say that the conflict is different.

>I don't know why you think something that happened in the last 10 minutes of the last episode retroactively applies to the whole series.

I don't recall saying that anything retroactively applied to anything. I don't recall saying that Vicious would never return as the prime antagonist, nor did I ever say that it was impossible to veer back to some semblance of the conflict in the original Cowboy Bebop. 

What I said is that they changed the conflict, and they have. You can argue-- unconvincingly, based on wholesale hypothesis and speculation, unless you have a source of information on the writing team that I do not have-- that they're going to bring it full circle, but I'm not interested in playing hypothetical with you, or in arguing based on supposition that conveniently supports your position. And even if they do somehow return the Syndicate plotline to the anime's orthodoxy, you can't shit in a punch bowl, fish out your turd, then tell people the punch is the same. 

You've been moving the goalposts this entire conversation, you *start* with this gem

>The central conflict is 100% the same if slightly modified.

and which you later move to, 'the central conflict *will be the same*, and all current changes don't count because reasons'. 

So what is it? What are you even trying to convey here?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Changing the conflict in the last 10 minutes of the last episode doesn't change the conflict of season 1.  And also, boy is your mind going to be fucking blown when they adapt knocking on heavens door in season 2."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">Changing the conflict in the last 10 minutes of the last episode doesn't change the conflict of season 1.

Congratulations, you've rebutted an argument no one was making. I'm not arguing about the conflict of season 1 of the live action show. I'm arguing about the central conflict of Spike Spiegel's character and arguably what passes for the central totem of the entire anime series. And a villainous turn for Julia fundamentally changes the emotional tenor, the stakes, the players, it literally changes everything about how that plotline works.

Your argument is ridiculous, and you continually reach for strawmans to attempt to maintain some kind of momentum-- why?

&#x200B;

>And also, boy is your mind going to be fucking blown when they adapt knocking on heavens door in season 2.

You seem to be under the impression-- with your willful insistence, despite my baffled protests-- that I can't handle any kind of deviation from the anime, but the entire point of this conversation is that I actually can, I just don't like some of the changes they've made because they're garish and bad for specific reasons that you find impossible to engage with honestly.

I could care less if they completely change Knocking on Heaven's Door: here's a hot take-- I don't find that film vital to the Bebop experience at all and regularly skip it. So they can fire away with the changes-- as long as they don't result in me having to suffer through such hateful, unlikeable characters as Julia and Vicious for absolutely zero return."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"> And a villainous turn for Julia fundamentally changes the emotional tenor, the stakes, the players, it literally changes everything about how that plotline works.

Nope, read again, I'm not explaining it again.

I don't understand why this is a sticking point for you.    You're acting like this is my only issue with the show, or that somehow, because something happens in the last ten minutes it doesn't count. If I follow a recipe for cake, and then I add fish sauce at the very end, it's a different cake, holy shit this is basic."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">Nope, read again, I'm not explaining it again. 
 

You keep saying this then it keeps being your complaint.   I *asked you the first post* what you thought changed and *th only thing* you have talked about is your insane insistence that plot points are retroactive


>or that somehow, because something happens in the last ten minutes it doesn't count 

It doesn't count for *the whole season*. Story elements *aren't retroactive*


>If I follow a recipe for cake, and then I add fish sauce at the very end, it's a different cake, holy shit this is basic.

Story elements *aren't retroactive*. Did you eat 90% of the fucking cake before adding fish sauce or do you not experience linear time? Julia was not a secret fucking bad guy. She doesn't become an antagonist at all until the last few minutes; therefore, *the entire show couldn't have Julia as the antagonist*. The conflict was still vs vicious and the syndicate for season one, **not Julia.**"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"> You keep saying this then it keeps being your complaint. 

It's literally never been my point, I simply use the original show as an example of how the original elements worked, a necessary component of any discussion about how an adaptation works. 

>I asked you the first post what you thought changed and th only thing you have talked about is your insane insistence that plot points are retroactive

I don't know where you get this from. I answered you, very clearly, that they changed the central antagonist of the conflict, because Vicious can no longer solely hold that role given the antagonism between Julia and Spike. You keep using the word retroactive-- why? They changed what the conflict was about, when they do it is irrelevant. If you reshot Lord of the Rings, shot for shot, with the actors perfectly imitating the Jackson movies, but in the very last moment, Gollum turns into a banana, *you've changed the conflict of the fucking films*. It doesn't matter that you've watched however many hundred minutes of normal, extended edition Lord of the Rings Trilogy materiel, *the fundamental nature of the story has changed due to the magnitude of the change*.

>It doesn't count for the whole season. Story elements aren't retroactive

My statement wasn't, 'they changed the antagonist for the whole season', that doesn't even make any fucking sense. even original Bebop doesn't have a completely serialized story, so it didn't even have an antagonist 'for the whole season'. My statement was, THEY CHANGED THE CONFLICT BY CHANGING THE ANTAGONIST OF THAT CONFICT, a statement that impinges on how much we've seen in the season exactly fucking zero.

>Did you eat 90% of the fucking cake before adding fish sauce or do you not experience linear time?

Do you not have the concept of object permanence? The cake is the conflict here, we're talking about it as an object, not a fucking *experience*. **I** am not talking about conflict in terms of minutes spent in opposition to an antagonist, *I am talking about the NATURE of the conflict*. What it is **about**.  THAT'S what's changed you dunce. THAT'S what I'm talking about. 

>The conflict was still vs vicious and the syndicate **for season one**, not Julia.

Emphasis mine. If you want to keep arguing against positions you invent yourself, we're fucking done. You added that stipulation, and you're using it to waste my time. Good day."
BG Personal Bodyguard,">. I answered you, very clearly, that they changed the central antagonist of the conflict

*At the end of the season*. Yes, Julia will be *an* antognist in season 2,she is **not** the central antagonist in season 1.

>because Vicious can no longer solely hold that role given the antagonism between Julia and Spike.

That doesn't fucking exist for the entirety of the show until the last 10 fucking minutes. You keel going ""that's not my point!"" then reiterating that's your stupid fucking point.


>If you reshot Lord of the Rings, shot for shot, with the actors perfectly imitating the Jackson movies, but in the very last moment, Gollum turns into a banana, *you've changed the conflict of the fucking films*.

No you fucking didn't. If the last god damn scene was frodo not falling into the volcano and instead becoming the new evil overlord , that doesn't fucking magically **retroactively** mean the movie is about stopping dark lord frodo. Which is what you keep fucking insisting happened in bebop. Are you a fucking Kurt Vonnegut character and therefore don't experience linear time? That's the only possible explanation I can see for you thinking plotting applies **retroactively**


>My statement was, THEY CHANGED THE CONFLICT BY CHANGING THE ANTAGONIST OF THAT CONFICT,

**WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SUPPOSED TO FUCKING MEAN?!**  You keep saying that then not fucking explaininging what the flying fuck you mean then yelling about how I'm misinterpreting it. **That's God damn gibberish.**  what the fuck is your complaint? Yes, Julia **becomes** an antagonist. **No**, that *does not change the shows conflict.*

>Emphasis mine

*What the flying fuck are you talking about?* Julia is not a god damn antagonist. The show is still spike vs vicious and their *separate* opposition to the syndicate.  Plainly fucking say what you think the central conflict of the show is. **At not point** have you done that. All you've done is get mad I've interpreted your **non statement**


>You added that stipulation

Are you fucking *high*? You understand different seasons have can have different stories *right*? Fucking **surprise**, they aren't remaking the god damn anime shot for shot. Shit, in season 2 they are incorporating the antagonist and story from *the movie*. Boy are you going to throw a god damn fit when you see how *that* is incorporated because in the anime, *they were completely fucking unrelated*"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Yeaaaaaah, I'm done with you. You think a story where events A and B happen and a story where events A and B and also C can be 'the same'. That's like saying WWII and a WWII where we also fought the Moon are the same war.

You're right, we never got to talking about my criticism of the show, because we can't get past your initial stupidity, which you won't acknowledge at all. They've completely changed the Syndicate plotline. It is impossible that the thematic nature, the essential relationships, or even the basic outline of events remain the same now. This in and of itself is not bad, but I think it is bad for reasons I outline in my original post-- not in the conversation with you, which has largely been me being blown away by your continued bad-faith. 

You're blathering about 'season one', I'm speaking holistically, a concept that is above your capabilities. You are blocked now. Goodbye."
BG Personal Bodyguard,You have fun with lord of the Rings - the story of fighting evil overlord frodo
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Deputy, your show seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"this reads like an ad.

&#x200B;

Dorff was great in True Detective, so maybe it's worth a shot.. but I don't trust anything on Fox to not get cancelled."
BG Personal Bodyguard,And how may I ask have you seen this?
BG Personal Bodyguard,"If you don't enforce the laws, you're not a lawman, you're just another worthless piece of trash.  Your personal opinion is irrelevant."
BG Personal Bodyguard,This was just a good fun show and I’m annoyed with everyone taking it so seriously instead of going along for the ride
BG Personal Bodyguard,You couldnt have made this read more like an ad disguised as an opinion post if you had tried.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Bex Taylor Klaus has been on my radar since The Killing and Scream. They’re going to be a big name.
BG Personal Bodyguard,huh?
BG Personal Bodyguard,Early premiere on Hulu
BG Personal Bodyguard,bruh most of the posts on this sub are opinion-based!
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Damn, glass half empty type much?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Dude, you watch the bachelor. The shows a legit ad for dating websites and stuff"
BG Personal Bodyguard,It's a Simpsons reference
BG Personal Bodyguard,I've literally never seen an episode of the bachelor in my life.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Hmmm okay
BG Personal Bodyguard,That's just a weird thing to make up.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Sorry bachelor in paradise*
BG Personal Bodyguard,Also never watched it.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Not what your history says
BG Personal Bodyguard,This is the weirdest troll job ive seen in a long time.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Me too.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Altered Carbon and the Dark Crystal are awesome  and must watch tv for sci fi fans.
BG Personal Bodyguard,">Must Avoid:  
>  
>Dark Crystal

wat"
BG Personal Bodyguard,My  rewatch list would be: 1)Battlestar Galactica 2)Lonesome Dove 3)Stargate SG1 4) Arrested Developement 5) Man in the High Castle
BG Personal Bodyguard,I liked Lost In Space. It's far superior obviously to the original camp show of the 60s.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I felt a lot better about my #1 must watch before she went and won the bloody Emmy. Now it's all anyone's on about.

Also *GLOW*, *Lucifer*, and *The Boys*.

And instead of one recent, I'll give two oldies *Powerless* and *Better Off Ted*. Find them, wherever they may stream, and consume.

That's it. I can't say about must avoid, I bail quick and I don't want to let a bad few first episodes ruin a show that gets better."
BG Personal Bodyguard,You tried “undone”? “Man in the high castle”? Or surprisingly good “Star trek discovery”?
BG Personal Bodyguard,I read sharp objects in one sitting I feel no desire to watch the show
BG Personal Bodyguard,Altered Carbon is great
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I liked Altered Carbon and I thought Sharp Objects was decent.

Chernobyl, on the other hand, was boring. It would have been better as a 2-hour HBO movie."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Must watch:  (insert five extremely popular tv shows that are unanimously rated high).   
Must avoid:  (insert five shows most people think are trash, and include a few that have received mixed reviews)"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I hear a lot of good things about both.  But I felt Altered Carbon wasn't very well acted nor was it very well written.  The plot overall seemed interesting, but episode to episode seemed flat.

Dark Crystal probably is good.  I just seriously couldn't get past the puppet animation.  The voice acting actually seemed surprisingly good.  I may give it another shot later."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I couldn't even make it through the first episode.  I tried!  I like Anime, but some people will never like Anime because they don't like watching cartoons or, in some cases, reading subtitles.  I cannot get passed the puppet/animation of Dark Crystal.  Maybe I'll give it another shot later if it gets so many good reviews."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"> I felt a lot better about my #1 must watch before she went and won the bloody Emmy.

This might be the most hipster thing ive ever read on this sub.

> The Boys.

Wait...as though that hasnt been talked about here since the second it started being advertised?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,Which show was that?
BG Personal Bodyguard,Is undone good? Its on my list but tv season is about to start.
BG Personal Bodyguard,Undone and high castle are on my list!  Haven't tried yet.  TBH never heard of Star trek discovery.
BG Personal Bodyguard,And those would be?  See people like you assume everyone sits around talking about shows all day.  Some of us don't know what those obvious choices are.
BG Personal Bodyguard,"Maybe it's just not your cup of tea, but i love Altered Carbon and am on my 3rd viewing. Also excited about new seaon of The Expanse ."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"To be fair, I only found out about *The Boys* last week.

And while I'm usually adamantly anti-hipster where were all these ""fans"" in the bleak *years* we spent waiting for season 2?"
BG Personal Bodyguard,"*Fleabag*. But it really is something else. It's more like a movie in 12 parts than a TV show, and it deserves all its recent praise. 

Also? I lied about only doing 4 must watch because for a brief moment I forgot about *The Good Place* and now there's a swarm of bees with penises outside playing dubstep."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"I liked it. 

Now i’m totally torn: if they leave it just 1 season it would be great. But on the other hand I would love to see more."
BG Personal Bodyguard,"St:D is kind of reboot... We can discuss how it fits (or not) the lore, some acting, and few other minor things, but as a whole - it is really surprising in a positive way.

Forgot other big surprise: Cobra Kai. But i’m old fan of Karate Kid."
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,"I admit I don't watch any of those RHO shows but ... doesn't she already have her own show?  or is that ""Vanderpump Rules"" show about *somebody else* named Vanderpump?"

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,"It's pretty perfect. This theme and the show helped put FOX on the map. After a low-rated first season that ended in May 1991, FOX smartly launched season two in July and the key audience, out of school for the summer, discovered it."

The Real Housewives of New York City,She apparently has to serve at least 85% of her sentence. So earliest she can get out it 5.5 years.
The Real Housewives of New York City,"This is a Federal sentence, meaning she will do a minimum of 85% of her sentence. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5.5 years minimum."
The Real Housewives of New York City,You’d call three years in prison “no real consequences”?
The Real Housewives of New York City,It almost encourages scamming and fraud.
The Real Housewives of New York City,"It's arguably the campiest of all the Real Housewives franchises due to the fact that production pretty much acknowledges that all the women are nuts and ridiculous. It's not as consistently dramatic as Atlanta, New Jersey or Potomac, but Beverly Hills and Orange County are seen as boring or worse and New York City had to have a complete cast overhaul due to how problematic its most recent season was. Compared to those last three, Salt Lake City is turn-your-brain-off family entertainment."
The Real Housewives of New York City,"Yeah, how many of these are there now? 

Where’s next?  Omaha, Nebraska?"

The Real Housewives of New York City,i think it’s because of how much more money the ghirardi situation dealt with. i also think part of the sympathy that jen gets has to do with that fact that she has kids. i also think people let some of jen’s horrible actions pass because she was battling facing time (who wouldn’t go narcotic) however erika came across evil when all she was facing was handing over some assets. i’m not sure if i wrote that correctly but yeah :)

I wish we could watch this like 60 days in lol"
The Real Housewives of New York City,"The other housewife documentary, also on Hulu called The Housewife and the Hustler, is superior but less satisfying from a justice perspective.  They are both fast, juicy watches and worth your time if you are interested in the topic."
The Real Housewives of New York City,"In comparison to the wealthy, yeah. Wealth inequality is a bitch and people don’t realize how bad it actually is."
The Real Housewives of New York City,It's federal prison. Rules about early release are different for federal than it is for state prison.
The Real Housewives of New York City,What punishment/how many years in prison would you consider “real consequences?”

The Real Housewives of New York City,"10 years like the prosecutor requested. She’s a fucking psychopath, not some sad ass loser with a shitty upbringing.

The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"The list of arrests for people who appeared on these Real Housewives shows is pretty amazing. DWIs, assaults, trespassing, extortion (as part of a drug smuggling/kidnapping plot?!), theft, and now Jen Shah is the second one to be convicted of fraud."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Shah-mazing!!!  🤣🤣🤣. This lady sucks so bad. Justice served!
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"In the video they're saying that RHOSLC will have her as a full-time cast member next season. Are they going to have the non-criminal ladies visit her in prison, or will she host real convict parties in her jail cell?"
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"I don’t know who this woman is, but GOOD. I can’t stand constant, annoying telemarketing calls. She deserves to rot."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"What was the scam?

All that I can find is that she acknowledged that the ""services"" they offer had no value.

The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Real House Wives of State Prison coming soon.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Every housewives franchise exposes some criminal activity. I can’t fathom knowingly committing criminal acts and then having the audacity to go on “reality” TV

The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Salt Lake City? That’s the bottom of the barrel.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Bank of America fined Billions each year over the past number of years for outright fraud and not a single executive sees time in minimum security lock up to work on their golf swing. Justice?

The Real Housewives of Atlanta,How many people in the Housewives franchise have gone to jail for finance-related crimes?
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Not enough for what she did.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"Are there really people out there that are feeling sorry for this woman?? She’ll get out in less than a year and will still be a reprehensible criminal, she has no remorse. No soul."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Good riddance felon.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,I guess the people she scammed bought those 2 watermelons on her chest.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"What I don't get is the HUGE deal they made out of Erika's (RHOBH) ALLEGED connection with her husband's crime. But with Jen Shah? She was given the benefit of ""innocent until proven guilty"". She was running around dropping suicide bombs as a means to escape blame for treating her friends like shit. She's acting like a victim! Such a double standard. AND SHE'S CONVICTED AND SENTANCED!"
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,How she going to do her hair?
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,Not enough time iyam. That woman used vulnerable people as her personal bank account.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,She’ll probably get paroled—or even released outright—in ~3 years.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"That’s the thing about an honest dollar, it’s hard to make. None of these people have every made an honest dollar but they flaunt their thievery like a serial killer taunting police."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"There are two on Hulu about the housewives, one about this person in particular. The Jen Shah one is called “The Housewife and the Shah Shocker”, it definitely goes into the how more than the why but it definitely covers the consumption cycle that leads a lot of the people into unsavory and illegal activities."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"After watching multiple reality tv shows based on wealth and seeing how they have zero humility, I’m glad I’m not rich if being rich means that you act the way they do."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"I’ve seen how people prepare to be considered for reality tv & some casting or producers buy their BS, like “wow that person has a big house and has 5 assistants” bitch those 5 assistants were hired yesterday on Craig’s list & all the rocks you see them wearing are paid by the 2nd mortgage they just made so you can cast their ass. It’s all a big con to promote unethical behavior in exchange for fame. Jen Shah and most of the RHOSLC cast are ratchet - but she’s a criminal & thief plain and simple. There’s better shit we should be doing with our time than celebrating these trashy scam artists."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,It really is and they flaunt that shit lmao
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,They’re all narcissists
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"Google puts her net worth at $3m, which really is not that much for her age. I don’t watch reality TV and she may be a terrible person, but I wouldn’t call her wealthy.

Of course, she could be hiding assets too."
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,It’s almost like it’s obscenely difficult to make large amounts of money in an ethical way. I’m seeing a pattern the older I get.
The Real Housewives of Atlanta,In what franchise was the extortion?

The Titan Games,"I swear I remeber hearing the first epsiode that the weights for men and women were different. Specifically concerning the wall push up an incline and the pole raised. So I feel confident that the ball and chain are a lighter version, perhaps just made out of a less dense metal. "
The Titan Games,"My biggest complaint about the show is it’s just too simple.  You win one match and then you immediately go to mount Olympus. 

Best part of the season was in the first episode when the very buff chick dragged the concrete ball like it was nothing. "
The Titan Games,I’ve caught the end of it the last couple weeks and it is laughable when this huge ass dude struggles to pull that ball and then a girl comes up and just drags it across in like 5 seconds. 
The Titan Games,"They spend way too much time on the show talking about the back stories, this is the same reason I got tired of watching American Ninja Warrior. I love watching competitions on obstacle courses, but I seriously dont want to watch a show where more time is spent telling us about the competitors than is spent showing them competing (at least that how it feels on Titan Games). If theyd cut most of that fluff they could have run a whole extra event every episode and made it far more satisfying to at least half pay attention to


Edit: and I gotta agree with the other commenter saying the best moment so far was the first episode when lady came from so far behind and hauled ass with that ball like it was a bag of trash"
The Titan Games,Show seems fake as shit. From the 2 episodes I watched I saw a handful of laughable cliches where the one person had the other pushed all the way to the end about to win only to have them make some ridiculous comeback that didnt even make physical sense. 
The Titan Games,Whatever about the rest the last ep I watched said the final ball was 250 for the men and 200 for the women. 
The Titan Games,"well duh, all of it is scripted tv. it's far cheaper to make reality tv than a pocerderal. Why do you think almost all of the reality tv shows are around now, it's super cheap and they can make it look anyway they way. 

Look at even deadliest catch. it's the most non-scripted TV show and even it's scripted sometimes. 

The idea is to put out as many as possible of reality tv shows and see which ones are a hit and miss. if it's a miss, you don't have to worry about the people. if it's a hit, some become stars, but you don't have to pay star prices to them. "
The Titan Games,"Nope. They specifically say the weights, and they are all “the same”. 

Edit: I went back and watched the last episode. 

Men and women are all the same weights, wall - 1000lbs, gates of Olympus - 450lbs, crank for torch - 600lbs...
And the ball, you are correct was 250 for the men and 200 for the women. 

Either way, my point still remains. 

Edit 2: you get downvoted for admitting you were wrong. 
Piss off all you downvoters. "
The Titan Games,"Too simple and too little action. 
Plus, everyone has a sap story, which I’m kinda tired of. "
The Titan Games,"It's all about technique. The girls have all pulled the chain closer to the ball, versus most of the men fully extend the chain and pull that way. Also look how the chains are positioned. In a couple of the runs the way the chains are positioned at the base of the ball is creating extra friction making it harder to drag. "
The Titan Games,It’s the same ball too. 
The Titan Games,"Guess you've never heard of ""sandbagging"" in sports, then. It's a common strategy to let your opponent wear out first before powering back."
The Titan Games,"Although you didn’t really address what I was saying about the show, I hadn’t thought about your point of why there is so much reality tv before. Good point. "
The Titan Games,"Guess I was wrong for the other two, but isn't the height of the wall they have to go over also different? "
The Titan Games,I was thinking that too and it seems the girls do take some time to make sure they pull it right and the guys just grab and pull. 
The Titan Games,"You mean the 3 toward the end they leap over?

Those were all 5, 6, and 7 feet for each. "
The Titan Games,">  I love the series I really do.

Yes, this should actually be the end of the series. No more parts or editions, this is the end."

I've been really loving this ""final season"" though, so I hope that the wait will be worth it."

What a fucking episode.

i am more positve towards the narrative/plot points of the ending (but i dislike the pacing and dialogue), but if the anime expands and makes some extra scenes like this first cour did, then i will be more than happy with the end result."

The Titan Games,Hasn’t it been on the final season for a really long time?
The Titan Games,Jesus Christ. Wrap it up already!
The Titan Games,why you guys make the same joke every time. its just a fucking title.
The Titan Games,"This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.

Part 3 Part 1 was just a 1 hour episode..... now it's back to a 7 month wait. Damn. They are really hurting this show. It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio."
The Titan Games,"I gave up on this show a while ago. I’ve read the manga and just, no."
The Titan Games,"So I always wanted to binge watch this show ever since it was announced.... kinda glad I did, it's been what, 10 years? Is the anime follow the manga closely?"
The Titan Games,"I think I'll just wait until part 2 of the finale is out to watch it. This would've been great as a full feature, rather than two separate parts."

- four year gap between season 1 and 2: ok, fine.
- breaking season 3 into 2 parts: I'll bregudgingly accept it

but release something called 'the final season' and it should **be the final season**.

Dividing it into *four* chunks over **three long years**... It feels like an intentional slight. 

I don't know if theres a good reason for the delay, if there is I would be less annoyed. I cant imagine what one would be as covid alone can't be it. But if theres not the fans should each be presented with the person responsible and be allowed to yell at them for a bit."

The Titan Games,They'll finish with a three hour movie. Released as a trilogy.
The Titan Games,I'm still confused lol. How many more episodes after this one? Just one and that's the end?

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
The Titan Games,It's about as final as Final Fantasy
The Titan Games,Attack\_on\_Titan\_Final\_(Final\_edit)\_2.avi
The Titan Games,Haha as a fellow editor this got me good
The Titan Games,"I don't even use the word anymore. ""Cut 8"" please."
The Titan Games,It's gonna be like witnessing a kid realizing there's no santa.
The Titan Games,They changed something from the manga in the episode that aired yesterday.
The Titan Games,"With how this episode came out, yeah they can take their time till Fall."
The Titan Games,Pandemic fucked everything up...
The Titan Games,The Penultimate Season doesn't sound very final
The Titan Games,"You forgot about Attack on Titan: Oh, wait, just one more delay before the end, see you next year (Final Final Pinky Swear)

I don't even care anymore after what they've pulled already."
The Titan Games,Attack on Titan: The Final Season: The Final Edition: THE FINAL PAM
The Titan Games,[from the vault]
The Titan Games,"I feel most people manga fans will agree with you there. I have a fairly negative opinion on the ending, but improving the dialogue and pacing will definitely make the experience much better. They did an amazing job with the first cour (especially with Hange) and I hope they continue to improve."
The Titan Games,Pretty good one but the sequels... You cannot watch... You have to wait... And my favorite... You thought this was it.
The Titan Games,Since 2020.
The Titan Games,Clearly because it’s a ridiculous title lol
The Titan Games,Why are you mad? It's just jokes.
The Titan Games,Because it's fucking ridiculous that they can't manage to just fucking make the ending and keep making these stupid ass titles because even they don't *know* if they've actually ended it or not *somehow*
The Titan Games,fr. hahah the final final final final final season part 78 part 5 part 7!
The Titan Games,"> It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio.

Agreed the committee did a pretty bad job with the naming convention of the seasons and the release schedules, but the change in animation studio wasn't really that bad. MAPPA has done a great job for the time they were given & the direction of the previous seasons."
The Titan Games,"> This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.


""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title now I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
The Titan Games,"They know the ending is bad so theyre milking the build up for as long as they can. Honestly, Todd Howard should hire them all. Impressive stuff."
The Titan Games,Yeah the ending is straight ass
The Titan Games,the show levels up massively with the second half of season 3 onwards. if you were even like 60% interested/invested in the story after finishing season 1 then its worth watching.
The Titan Games,"Yes. And don't listen to other people's opinions on this there's a lot of bitter manga readers out there who didn't like the ending and have since made it the mission of their pathetic lives to shit talk and hate on the entire franchise whenever possible.

While the very end is controversial, there's been near consensus among fans that the rest of it only gets better and better and is peak fiction. I don't think a bad ending changes that. Why should what would eventually be one bad episode dissuade you from consuming 63 incredible ones?"
The Titan Games,Season 2 is really good and the second half of season 3 is peak TV.
The Titan Games,The second half of season 3 and first half of season 4 is seriously 10/10 TV. The other stuff is still a solid 9/10 but those parts are just incredible.
The Titan Games,"As someone who took a while to get into it and then really fell in love with the series is it worth it?



No.



After a certain point the story becomes incredibly rushed and the ending is honestly dog water I reread the final chapter 3 times thinking this couldn't be it that it was just some joke but nope it's all legit and it ruined a really good series. You're better off watching the goofy spinoff series where there chibi's and in school cause at least that's more satisfying to watch (it's also pretty good)."
The Titan Games,"the content in the very last parts of the manga are pretty insane. basically the final battle has an absurd amount of shit going on. they probably were planning on releasing it all in march as a 2+ hour movie but it got too much. 

someone somewhere high up decided itd be better to still release something in march to keep discussion goinf"
The Titan Games,Says Paths.
The Titan Games,Says there only being 60 to 90 minutes of source material left to adapt.
The Titan Games,Only Ymir knows..
The Titan Games,That OST will live in my head rent free for the next decade.
The Titan Games,im sadly like 90% sure its just not gonna have a 2nd season
The Titan Games,First half was amazing but I felt like it really lost steam and they didn’t know where to go with the plot
The Titan Games,"The studio (MAPPA) already handles big names like Vinland Saga, God Of High-school, Chainsawman etc, and according to reports they picked up One Punch S3 as well, so i would keep my expectations low"
Top Chef,"Succession, Succession, Succession!!"
Top Chef,Daisy Jones and the Six and Swarm look exciting.
Top Chef,The Mandolorian and Ted Lasso
Top Chef,Attack on Titan
Top Chef,"Ted Lasso, Succession, and any news about Severance."
Top Chef,Part 2 of The Glory.
Top Chef,"Yellowjackets, Ted Lasso, Mandalorian, Succession, and Big Brother Canada!"
Top Chef,"I'm really looking forward to The Fall of the House of Usher.

I've enjoyed all of Mike Flanagan's Netflix mini-series (except The Midnight Club, which I haven't seen yet). Midnight Mass was especially good, with some very thoughtful and thought-provoking dialog regarding the nature of sin, guilt, and death."
Top Chef,"Mando, Ted Lasso, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon, Survivor, Doogie Kalikimeha, and I am intrigued by, but not too hopeful for True Lies."
Top Chef,Only time yellowjackets and top chef have ever been together in a sentence lol
Top Chef,"From this group, I am really looking forward to ***Perry Mason***.  The lead actor is one of my favorites (The Americans), and I thought they did a solid job with the character."
Top Chef,& Ted Lasso!!!
Top Chef,"shadow and bones, and the mandalorian"
Top Chef,Yellowjackets is a big one for me.  Ted Lasso and Mandalorian and MLB baseball are the others
Top Chef,History of the World pt 2!!!!
Top Chef,I’m a big sucker for Justin Theroux and political scandal so I’m very much looking forward to White House Plumbers on HBO later next month
Top Chef,MLB Opening Day March 30th! Every team is playing on opening day this year
Top Chef,"Succession far, far above anything else coming out in the same period"
Top Chef,Party Down Revival
Top Chef,I think You is by far the fucking dumbest TV show I've ever seen and yet I can't stop watching. I love to hate it.
Top Chef,Perry Mason was surprisingly good.  Looking forward to Season 2.  Yellowjackets was great too.
Top Chef,"Daisy Jones and the Six and Succession

I was excited for “You” but Part 1 was boring compared to season 3 so I’ll probably still watch it but I’m less excited for it"
Top Chef,"The new season of Mandalorian, Shadow and Bone and Ted Lasso. SO MANY NEW THINGS IN MARCH"
Top Chef,Survivor
Top Chef,Rabbit hole
Top Chef,"Uh, like, yeah- fuck you OP. I mean, uh, succession."
Top Chef,"Yellowjackets, Succession and Mandalorian"
Top Chef,"* Succession.
* Yellowjackets.
* Lucky Hank."
Top Chef,There is Succession and then everything else.
Top Chef,Yes for Perry Mason!! I wasn't sure it was coming back since it's been so long since season 1 came out.
Top Chef,Attack on Titan Season 4 The Final Season Part 3 Segment A or wherever we're at by now
Top Chef,"I don't watch any of those... I considered Perry Mason but just never really bothered, I hadn't heard of Yellowjackets until it was halfway done I think but I'll probably watch it eventually.

There's a few things starting in March but I'm most looking forward to Ted Lasso... but I'll also be watching Superman & Lois, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon and The Mandalorian. 

I'm actually more looking forward to April with season premieres of Schmigadoon, Single Drunk Female, From and The Afterparty... and whenever the final season of Endeavour starts on PBS, hopefully won't be too long."
Top Chef,So hyped with top chef and Ted lasso
Top Chef,Yellowjackets! Ready for the cannibalism
Top Chef,Barry
Top Chef,How is Yellow Jackets? Been on my list to watch just haven’t had the chance to start it
Top Chef,So looking forward to Severance but I am so worried that it won't be as good as the first season. That final episode had me literally on the edge of my seat.
Top Chef,I'm excited for whenever S2 of Severance will happen.
Top Chef,"Succession first of all so much wait coming to over 
Kendall and shiv they gone rock the company 😂

Then you season 4 part 2 gone be a epic i have seen the trailer look so hyped up i want to know next move of joe 

Yellowjackets i have not seen but gone watch in this week 
Season 2 will be good as per review of season 1."
Top Chef,">Yellowjackets Season 2:  **Showtime**

showtime's gonna milk thing to death, aren't they?"
Top Chef,"yellowjackets? woke crap no thanks

Perry mason season 1 was terrible with this stupid drama shit. so i do not have high hopes for season 2.

Love top chef? why the fuck would i want to watch a show about cooking? i hate cooking myself so no thanks.

never watched you, but seems another of those oh i feel so sorry for the main character kind of bullshit, i wonder how he will survive all this.

in other words i have completely different taste then you. i mean i have good taste and you do not :)

what i am looking for is succession, shadow and bones season 2. Mandalorian, ted lasso,  swarm"
Top Chef,"Attack on Titan, Yellowjackets, You S4 pt.2"
Top Chef,"I have not watched ""The Last of Us"", I've been waiting for the whole season to be out, to be able to binge watch it all at once!"
Top Chef,"Yellowjacket’s and succession
Tried really hard to like perry Mason but felt it was a total drag"
Top Chef, Top chef!
Top Chef,God damnit. Yellowjackets can not be coming out. I have accomplished nothing...
Top Chef,"Yeah I hope Top Chef ends up being good. I just don’t see how any of them can ever beat Buddha, he’s not only the most dominant Top Chef competitor basically ever save for one or two, he's also had the most recent experience."
Top Chef,Succession and Perry Mason. Loved the first season
Top Chef,"March is pretty stacked, honestly. Most looking forward to *Succession*, *The White House Plumbers*, *Perry Mason*, *Yellowjackets*, and *The Mandalorian* (among quite a few others)."
Top Chef,"So much more than that.

Probably most excited for mando.. yellowjackets.. succession ..shadow and bone..and Perry Mason...and You.. tho this season has been a bit ridiculous and the ""eat the rich"" undercurrent was not as subtle as normal..not as good as other seasons but still great.

There is a large amount of great shows in season now that are all headed towards the end. Was kinda worried. Didnt realize this much stuff was about to drop."
Top Chef,All bangers all the time
Top Chef,Fuck off!
Top Chef,If it had to be said so it be...so it is.
Top Chef,My bruh
Top Chef,Where do I watch this at
Top Chef,Ooww i almost forgot Ted Lasso
Top Chef,"My son is so excited about Mandolorian! 

🏹🎯"
Top Chef,[deleted]
Top Chef,From what I've seen filming should be wrapping up end of May
Top Chef,"✔️

I really need to start on ""Succession"" and ""Severance;"" they both get such excellent audience and critical raves"
Top Chef,Don't think there is more severance until 2024.
Top Chef,"When i finished the first part like 2 weeks ago, I thought it was really good but not amazing. but since then i couldnt stop thinking about how i need more. excited for march 10th"
Top Chef,"Completely agree with your assessment of ""Midnight Mass;"" loved that show


Heard mixed things about ""Midnight Club,"" apparently it's from YA fiction & aimed at teens but sometimes that works out ok, guess will have to check out to see for self"
Top Chef,"""On today's quickfire challenge, you are to hunt, clean, and cook a rabbit dish. In your stations you will find scrap metal salvaged from a plane crash. These will be the only tools at your disposal. The dish you will prepare should be appropriate for a Michelin star restaurant. Tom, release the wolves."""
Top Chef,I feel like this show has zero hype and I just loved it. There was a Carnivale vibe to it. So well done.
Top Chef,World. Baseball. Classic.
Top Chef,"Hell yes, I'm so excited to hear about this happening."
Top Chef,"Didn't know about this; I'm a big fan of a lot of his work, too, and my sister got me HBO Max for my birthday...thanks for the heads-up!"
Top Chef,Yay! ⚾🏃
Top Chef,You know the first ep is out already? It's good!!
Top Chef,"✔️✔️✔️

I'm really looking forward to both. The art direction, sets, & costume design on ""Perry"" are remarkable 🔥

I've read the writers on Yellowjackets promising big reveals this season as per the ""who is this cult?""  & ""cannibalism--did they or didn't they?"" questions"
Top Chef,"I'm also excited about ""From.""

Give ""Perry Mason"" a chance, it's very well done. 


As others have said, if you're from a certain Riot Grrl or Gen X generation you will probably love ""Yellowjackets.""

I've been curious about the new ""Superman & Lois"" and Shadow & Bone but haven't seen any eps of either yet"
Top Chef,Yellowjackets is amazing and I highly recommend it. I can't wait until The Afterparty season 2! I loved season 1 so much. I constantly watch the dance/rap clip of 2 shots whenever I need a laugh.
Top Chef,"Expertly cast. Hauntingly creepy. Uproariously droll. 

Also while the timelines seem to line up with Millennials as the girls' birth generation, they are built of pure Gen-X rocket fuel."
Top Chef,"It's awesome. I usually stay clear of teen drama but this show has a perfect balance of it. It's creepy, I like the mystery and the cast is great!"
Top Chef,Severance is still filming.  Succession comes out in March.
Top Chef,You’re so smart! You’re in for a treat. It’s excellent!
Top Chef,💯🔥💯🔥💯
Top Chef,This is the way.
Top Chef,"I thought there is going to be just one, one hour long episode"
Top Chef,Succession is on track to be on the GOATs with season 4 being its last and Severance has one of the best pilot seasons of a show I've ever seen. Highly recommend both.
Top Chef,Might as well add Shrinking to your collection of S shows to watch.
Top Chef,"Both are near perfect shows for me to be honest! I was disappointed HotD won over Severance at the Golden Globes, even though I really enjoyed it - it was a significantly better, tighter series premiere."
Top Chef,"Don't bother with Midnight Club, it got cancelled... and it wasn't all that great to still warrant a watch. The YA stuff didn't bother me, it was more that the actual show's plot took a backseat to the stories the group would tell. Sure, the stories are meant to be used as a way to work out their issues, but it shouldn't have overshadowed the actual show itself. Though it was cool that some of the stories they told were small adaptations of some of Christopher Pike's other novels.

Flanagan seems to work best with a confined story, instead of trying to stretch it out just in case it gets another season."
Top Chef,"Just checked it out. It's definitely teen-oriented, so not really my thing."
Top Chef,"Definitely had a ""Carnivale"" vibe; excellent observation ✔️✔️✔️"
Top Chef,It's just been SOOO long since S1. Nearly 3 years. It did solid ratings wise (S1) but now it's been delegated the Monday night slot and hasn't really had a big marketing push. Worried it may be toast after this season
Top Chef,"It’s worrying how little promotion there is for this show, which by all accounts sounds excellent. So far only a teaser has come out, but it looks quite good."
Top Chef,Oh they did. It's just a matter of who they ate at this point.
Top Chef,"Came here to say From (and a few others that were already mentioned). Surprised no one else has mentioned it, but maybe because EPIX (now mgm+) isn’t super popular or well known. Anyways, I hope it gets strong viewership and continues past this season."
Top Chef,I think they’re Xennials. Hence the hybrid.
Top Chef,"If I'm not wrong, this time it will be 4 1-hour long episodes. 2 in one season, two in another."
Top Chef,"Yup, completely agree with both statements. I will also add that while Succession and Severance are very different, they both are compelling dramas that also have many laugh out loud moments."
Top Chef,The Golden Globes are a joke. The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards have more legitimacy at this point.
Top Chef,Thanks for the 411! ✔️
Top Chef,FWIW Mike Flanagan did give all of the details of where the show would have gone had it gotten renewed so viewers weren't left hanging forever.
Top Chef,[deleted]
Top Chef,"Yeah, that's basically it lmao there were delays on the second half of episodes, so rather than release everything all at once like would be normal, they would rather release two parts of 2 episodes each"
Top Chef,Obviously going for the record of longest season time span wise. Ridiculous.
Top Chef,"Whoa that’s actually very exciting, I got into this show over the pandemic and I love how they’ve been making each new season more interesting and it’s been quite enjoyable!"
Revolutionary Love,"I’m sure there were like a dozen shows that did it before Lost and people are going to point out that I’m a moron, but I love that Lost format of having a chunk of every episode be flashbacks about something that happened one character that both works as exposition while also echoing the A-Plot happening on the island."
Revolutionary Love,"There were others before it, but The Office definitely popularized the mockumentary format

Lost popularized serialized television (rather than traditional episodic ) for network tv. It also started the mystery box show trend"
Revolutionary Love,"**Twin Peaks** is often seen as the grandfather of modern ""prestige TV"" because of how it combined serialized storytelling, mature themes, and feature film-like cinematography. It's been directly cited as a major influence for dozens of subsequent shows."
Revolutionary Love,"I Love Lucy basically invented the sitcom. It was the first sitcom to use a live studio audience, it pioneered the three-camera filming setup, it was the first to broadcast rerun episodes, and it originated many classic sitcom tropes."
Revolutionary Love,"Firefly - first shows that did snap zoom CGI effects, where things end up being out of focus. They were creating deliberately imperfect effects to give everything an older TV visual feel."
Revolutionary Love,Lost
Revolutionary Love,"**Wiseguy** (1987-1990)  A series about an undercover agent Vinnie Terranova, who investigates various criminal organizations.  The series used clear episode ""arcs"" for each investigation.  In between the main arcs were ""filler"" episodes that explored the lives of not only Terranova, but his supervisor Frank McPike and his main handler ""Lifeguard"" Burroughs.

The arc storylines ran anywhere from 4 episodes to 11 episodes.  This allowed the series to introduce and develop antagonists and supporting cast for each story.  It was one of the first network series to use regularly use serialized story telling at a time when most series were episodic."
Revolutionary Love,I'm almost certain 24 ushered events occurring in real time and binge watching
Revolutionary Love,Mad Men started the basic cable prestige drama trend.
Revolutionary Love,"Dallas. The first really grand night time soap opera, inspiring many copycats.

All in the Family. First comedy that handled really heavy political issues and had shocking plotlines covering topics like rape and hate crimes."
Revolutionary Love,"The Sam and Diane relationship on  *Cheers* was the first ""will they?/won't they?"" type of character dynamic.

*The Sopranos* was the first (and still the best) antihero drama.

*American Horror Story* invented the seasonal anthology (others had thought about doing it earlier, but *AHS* was the first to pull the trigger.)

*Louie* was one of the first successful auteur-driven sad-as-often-as-funny sitcoms."
Revolutionary Love,"Babylon 5 - I think it started the trend of having the full story plotted out ahead of time, and the episodes tied in to that story rather than being self contained.  The story arc, in other words.  Not like what came before where most shows were purely episodic and you could watch almost any episode by itself and have a nice little gift-wrapped, self contained story that required you to have watched no other episodes of the show.

Also I think one of the first shows to really rely heavily on CGI for FX shots."
Revolutionary Love,Coupling: first sitcom that went Rashomon often and played with showing events from different characters perspective and being a-chronological.
Revolutionary Love,Lost. The big mystery cliffhanger show. Every season finale set up an even bigger next season.
Revolutionary Love,"Oz. First scripted oroginal TV show on HBO and it came with dark protagonists. Several actors on the show went on to star in other groundbreaking shows like Band of brothers, The Sopranos, the Wire, Breaking bad and Dexter"
Revolutionary Love,"I think Seinfeld really ushered in a totally new type of comedy sitcom.  The “no morals, no learning” ethos with all the characters being bad people paved the way for iasip, curb, whatever else followed.

I aftually sont know if british did it beforehand as well (earliest i can think of is peep show but havent seen stuff like fawlty towers or countless other countless other british classics….) but shows like peep show follow the same ethos."
Revolutionary Love,"Columbo, for the most part, had just the one actor, Peter Falk, and nearly everyone else was just a guest star. Might be the only TV show that did that."
Revolutionary Love,I was going to say Lost as well. At the very least it popularized the structure it uses.
Revolutionary Love,"Yeah I see that structure in everything where the characters are stuck somewhere. Orange is the New Black, The Patient, Keep Breathing, etc.

I guess it’s kind of necessary when you’re stuck with one location."
Revolutionary Love,And then flipped it to flash forwards. No show did both
Revolutionary Love,"Oh Lost was definitely a trendsetter not even woth just shows but movies. That craze of having Flashbacks as an integral part of pilot and as part of a mystery box, it definitely started with LOST."
Revolutionary Love,"It’s a movie, but shoutout to This Is Spinal Tap, I know they had to explain to many people it wasn’t an actual band"
Revolutionary Love,"Lost was certainly a trend-setter, but Twin Peaks arguably invented the format.

I think Lost also set the trend of having no opening credits and a very minimal low sequence."
Revolutionary Love,"It’s interesting because what Twin Peaks did for prestige drama, Northern Exposure came out the same year and did the same for prestige “dramedy” - look at any Dramedy (even Buffy on the list above, which I’d also argue has a little Twin Peaks influence too)) and I bet you’ll see a tiny bit of Northern Exposure blueprint in it. 

Basically shows like Gilmore Girls and Pushing Daisies probably had writers influenced by Northern Exposure. But you rarely see it come up anywhere anymore."
Revolutionary Love,I’m thinking about watching this series. In a Mafia type of mood. It deal with that a lot I assume?
Revolutionary Love,I believe Sopranos was the first time the main character murdered someone
Revolutionary Love,Why did you get downvotes?
Revolutionary Love,The season 3 finale would have broken the internet if Social Media were a thing back then. It was such a general holy shit
Revolutionary Love,"Excuse me they even say it in the movie: it's a ROCKumentary, not a mockumentary."
Revolutionary Love,"also shoutout to Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run, probably one of the earliest examples of mockumentary ever"
Revolutionary Love,"I'm glad you mentioned that! I've never actually seen Northern Exposure but I always meant to watch it because it was one of my parents' favorite shows when I was growing up.

I think the main reason it's rarely mentioned anymore is because it's not available for streaming anywhere (at least as far as I know... something about music rights I believe). I'm planning on getting the DVDs so I can finally watch it, but from everything I've heard, it's a shame that it isn't more well known."
Revolutionary Love,"I'd say about half of the series deals with the traditional mafia/mob stories.  The rest deal with arms dealers, white supremacists, various industry corruption, and political corruption.

The main character, Vinnie Terranova, is an Italian American in NYC.  So he and his family often deal with various mob characters around the neighborhood.

The series was overhauled in season 4 with a new lead. The quality dropped and the series was then cancelled.  So the end of season 3 is a good stopping point."
Revolutionary Love,"Ugh, you’re so right. If if ever started streaming, I honestly think it would explode. It’s the perfect winter cozy show and it holds up. I watched it for the first time in 2012 and rewatch it every couple of years, especially in Dec/Jan/Feb. 

You CAN find it here if you want to watch it! https://archive.org/details/northern-exposure

I don’t think it had the original music though - for that, you gotta go to the high seas and even then not every episode is perfect in terms of the soundtrack from what I understand."
Revolutionary Love,Yeah it's a shame about all these shows that existed before the idea that they'd be available to buy in perpetuity on recorded media was something most shows really considered. I think Freaks and Geeks also had a bunch of music issues and I'm sure other shows as well.
Revolutionary Love,Ghost is a hilarious show and one of the best comedies out there right now. The cast and crew is amazing. I am truly looking forward to the new season to see who might get sucked off.
Revolutionary Love,"They can both be good, as a fan of the original, I find the new one just as charming as the other ones. 

But I think Abbott is getting more praise ( rightfully in my opinion) because they are depicting a real world subject matter which is teaching/public school systems, which lot of people have experience with either as a teacher or student. And showing the very real struggles that come with that environment. And the fact that that's mostly never been done before is the reason why it's being so lauded.

Again both are good, both have great ensembles but if im voting, im choosing teachers over ghosts."
Revolutionary Love,"Abbott definitely has bigger buzz and awards chatter, but Ghosts has better ratings overall and in the demo.  I saw an article that said something to the effect of Abbott saving the network sitcoms, which confuses me when CBS’ sitcoms regularly bring in more viewers.  I’ve hear good things about American Auto too."
Revolutionary Love,The UK original of Ghosts is done better imo.
Revolutionary Love,"It's not quite as good as the British original IMO, but it's still better than most other network comedies. I do think Abbott is better, but they're both in their first seasons and one could easily surpass the other."
Revolutionary Love,"I enjoy it. A rarity for a single camera - it actually got ratings (#16 for the year). Even rarer, it seemed to be holding its audience pretty well through the season.

I've seen about 10 of the UK episodes. From what I've seen, I like both but prefer the US version""s characters, though I prefer the UK's female lead to the fairly squeaky US heroine. I had a sense at the end of Season 1 that the US version was running on fumes- we'll see if they're revived for Season 2."
Revolutionary Love,"I've seen the full season of both, and enjoy both, but I agree with you OP, I prefer Ghosts over Teachers. Rose McIver is, and will always be, a treasure.

Also, I think Ghosts has a lot of untapped potential to grow into. Now, the show is on CBS, so that might well never happen, but secretly I hope they explore the mythology and worldbuilding in a way similar to how The Good Place did it."
Revolutionary Love,"Love both and Rose has me from Izombie, but Abbott is a little better imo.  Abbott feels so much like The Office and that is a great thing imo. 

Also, the living humans are too nice in Ghosts and come off as incomplete people at times.  I love Ghosts but I see a lot of untapped potential."
Revolutionary Love,The ghosts in ghosts are caricatures. Writing explaining why they're that way barely makes them better. I don't get it but might just be me.
Revolutionary Love,Both are great for different reasons
Revolutionary Love,Ghosts is what I watch when nothing else is on. Abbot is only somewhat watchable.
Revolutionary Love,"Because Abbott Elementary has more buzz. That buzz is good publicity for network sitcoms. Also, CBS tends to have a very dedicated viewer base that watches anything and everything on the network so a lot of their hits don’t really stand out as notable successes anymore. Abbott has become that show that lots of people who don’t typically watch network TV tune in for. And folks have been vocal about that fact"
Revolutionary Love,">I’ve hear good things about American Auto too.

IMO it's decent but not great."
Revolutionary Love,"I agree completely. I like both, but sometimes I think the US one is a bit too sweet. I also miss having a character like Thomas, but that honestly might just be because I love Mathew Baynton so much."
Revolutionary Love,I cannot agree more
Revolutionary Love,"I’m from the UK and disagree. I like both the UK and US versions, as I enjoy them for different reasons. 

Same thing with something like The Office. If I want cringe and/or just a blistering attack on corporate life I’ll watch the UK version. If I want just a fun and hilarious watch, I’ll watch the US version (which I’ve rewatched more times than the UK one by far)."
Revolutionary Love,"I enjoy the American version more in every way. Rose McIver is just a million times funnier than Charlotte Ritchie to me, which is he most important part, but also Kittie is the only Ghost from the UK version that I prefer to the American ghosts.  Plus in one season in the I got more episodes and more plot development than I got watching three damn seasons of the UK version on HBO Max"
Revolutionary Love,S2 premieres Sept 29th at 8:30.
Revolutionary Love,That’s very true.  Ghosts isn’t the typical CBS sitcom show though.  I’m glad both are successful.
Revolutionary Love,"All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

    + 29
    + 8
    + 30

^(Summon me on specific comments with u/LuckyNumber-Bot.)"
Revolutionary Love,"I think the CBS brand has hurt Ghosts’ initial potential in grabbing audiences. Unless you’re a true TV fan like most of us in here, you’re not likely to tap into a CBS show just for the sake of curiosity if you’re not already engaged with the network as an audience member."
Revolutionary Love,Holy wall of text
Revolutionary Love,I think Star Trek Enterprise would have really hit a sweetspot with the whole romulan war and stuff that would've happened had it not been canceled.
Revolutionary Love,"So, CBS had a whole NCIS universe happening, and through various crossovers, it tied into the Peter Lenkov reboot universe (Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.) as well as Scorpion.

At one point on Five-0, Kono leaves the island to go hunt sex traffickers, never ti return. IRL, her departure was tied to a contract dispute (fuck the producers, she deserved the raise, but that's another story).

However, it would have been so cool to have a massive, season-long crossover event where Kono went coast to coast chasing those traffickers, guest starring on the various shows in the shared universe as she continued her hunt. She could have teamed with NCIS: LA, then gone elsewhere in California with Team Scorpion, petitioned the Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver) to help somewhere, stopped in New Orleans, and made her way to Washington to come all the way back to the original NCIS. 

Epic fucking fail, CBS."
Revolutionary Love,"I wish that Harper's Island had spawned a series of ""who-dun-it"" type shows where the fans could interact online with different clues as to who the killer was. That was the original idea behind the show but it only had one season and very few viewers.

I always thought there was a lot of room to grow a show where each season was a different mystery and you could go online to their website and look for clues, interact with other fans, watch video shorts, etc.

I still haven't seen a show do this, and I think there is a huge missed opportunity here."
Revolutionary Love,"1. Friends - Ross should've stayed together with Emily. They seemed to be more equal , have more in common. Ross and Rachel made ZERO sense. I think if Emily stayed it would've been refreshing for the show which got stale at that point. 

2. LOST - the mystery of ""What's the deal with Walt?"" never got addressed satisfactorily and IMO, was one of the more tantalizing mysteries on the show 

3. Dawson's Creek - Andi was by far more interesting than Joey or Jen ever was. She should've stayed with Pacey. And i think they should've gambled by writing off one group of characters and following the other - either have Dawson go to USC and retool the show to focus on his time there OR write out Dawson and follow Pacey/Joey in Boston. 

4. Felicity - Season 1 was fantastic. The rest sucked. Felicity never really grew as a person. She ended the way she started. She should've dated Noel and stuck to art. I would've written off Megan, Elena, and Sean early on. And frankly, write out Ben - he clearly was failing school, didn't belong."
Revolutionary Love,Jackie and Hyde should have stayed together.
Revolutionary Love,"Quantum Leap should've gone through with it's planned crossover with Magnum PI

And while never planned like that one was... Murder She Wrote and Columbo should've also had a crossover."
Revolutionary Love,Star Trek Picard should have really killed off Picard at the end of season one. Rios’ ship should have then been renamed “The Picard”.  Any seasons after that would follow the adventures of Rios and the rest of the gang without Patrick Stewart.
Revolutionary Love,"In Doctor Who, The Doctor and Master's relationship should have evolved after season 10 when Missy wanted to join his side. The character had a clear progression in that season, so I wish he didn't revert back to 'hehe I am evil and I just want your attention' psycho that we saw in Season 12. Of course, the characterisation of the Master is the least of the problems with that run of the show, but it really upset me how they flushed down one of the better character arcs for the sake of cheap villainy. He could have been a friend/advisor/companion/rival. Many things really."
Revolutionary Love,"A Faith the Vampire Slayer spin off could have been amazing. The rumored concept of Faith travelling from town to town like the Littlest Hobo would have made for a cool niche of its own between Angel's big city LA and Buffy's small town Sunnydale, well predating Supernatural & Co, but could also have been used to function as essentially an anthology. I think she would have been a really interesting character to see out there, cut off from any better or worse influences, and having no safe havens or support systems to lean on. 

It would have allowed for a huge amount of storytelling flexibility, and the format would also have played to Eliza Dushku's strengths way better than Dollhouse. 

The only caveat is that I was never sure Whedon (all else aside) really understood the character's appeal. A lot of her best moments/episodes were steered by other writers.

Supposedly it was proposed to Dushku but she was afraid of being typecast."
Revolutionary Love,"Grimm should gave left both love interests as they were(no redemptions, stay dead, etc), and stuck to no magic, everything being biochem/bio stuff"
Revolutionary Love,"The Flintstones had success with the future spin off, The Jetson, but I feel a current day spin off would have garnered the same sort of success as The Simpsons. Being able to reference current events in the jokes would have given the show a lot wider appeal than the predecessors."
Revolutionary Love,OP should have picked one example…
Revolutionary Love,"yea, i just upvoted n scroll down to the comments. lol. don't have time to read all that sorry OP. 😅"
Revolutionary Love,Sometimes I feel like the only person who really liked Star Trek Enterprise. The Romulan War would have been amazing :(
Revolutionary Love,"Yeah, they should've been focusing entirely on the Romulans and the first steps into the Federation from the very beginning.

Not that Temporal Cold War crap."
Revolutionary Love,It's a shame because while seasons 9 and 10 were not golden era strong they were still solid. The problem was the wrecking ball that was 7 and 8. Losing Carl completely fucked up future story lines especially the Whisper storyline yes I know Henry took it but fans never liked him in the first place not to mention the future massive Carl moments coming up in the next arc.
Revolutionary Love,"If I could magically make a handful of changes to the show to improve it...

- nix the entire 'slab town' Beth storyline, it was garbage. Daryl helplessly seeing Beth disappearing in the back of the car, and then being forced to move on through sticking with the reunited group after terminus and moving on to DC begrudgingly accepting they'll never see Beth again would have been better.  One of the most realistic and grounded gut twisting *horror* aspects of any apocalypse is that fear of not knowing and separation without ever knowing if you'll reunite again. TWD plays with that sometimes, but almost exclusively has any story that flirts with it end it people reuniting or at the least learning and gaining knowledge of what happened to others. Lack of closure is painful and scary and should have been something that we got to see weigh on Daryl the rest of his life, never know what happened to her.

- have the comic story beat of Maggie attempting suicide by hanging herself from a tree, the tension of Abe trying to stop her from reanimation and Glenn trying to revive her. It would have been a great powerful moment during season 5A that would have added some eventful character interactions on the desperate  hope starved trek to DC. Abe had too much of his comic interaction with Rick syphoned away into the Rick and Daryl bromance, which don't get me wrong I loved Rick and Daryl, but I loved Abe in the comics too and felt he didn't get done justice in the show. Having this scene and the badass fuckin moment of ricks gun to the back of Abe's head would have been great. And it would have fit perfectly with the post prison depression of the group, particularly for Maggie losing her father and then her guilt over not being able to find Beth and having no idea what her fate is (playing on the same thing I mentioned before) this also would have strengthenes her character development later after Glenn's death with her resolve to life and fight in his memory instead of give up and try to kill herself again

- no dumb fucking Glenn dumpster death fake out. Completely undermined his real death, and was just filmed terribly as well. 

- season 7 premier be the season 6 finale, as it should have been. Negans introductory episode should have concluded it's season with the viewer thinking 'fuck, what do they do now?' Looking forward to what happens next, not 'who did Negan kill?' Looking back at something that has now already happened but been withheld from the audience fully knowing. 

- in season 7 and 8, cut the fuckin trash people storyline entirely. Cut some other of the copious filler as well and have season 7 and 8 condensed down from 32 episodes to 24 (or even less). 

- no Carl death, of course, this is probably the single most easily suggested thing to fix for any fan. 

- Morgan should have been the key important death during All Out War. They foreshadowed it's potential so well, between Morgan's and Rick's ongoing clashing opinions about life and punishment and death, and they even had Morgan build the fuckin jail cell. It could have absolutely been laid out as just as solid reasoning for Rick to decide on imprisonment for Negan, without the stupidity of losing the Carl.

- side bar: Fear the walking dead should have been the anthology series, with each season (and sometimes multiple times per season) storylines ending with essentially everyone involved dying or being scattered. They could have intermingled new tv only stories with existing characters, like Abe or Bob before they'd come into the show, and existing comic side stories like Here's Negan and the minicomic about Ricks brother in Spain. And the Morgan flashback episode could have been shown in this Anthology, I hate that they made that episode in season 6, it felt so utterly out of place I wish it was it's own stand alone movie or an episode of an anthology.

- I'm ok with Glenn's death in the show, but I can understand your points. I hate that Abe was spared his comic death, only to die two episodes later and for that to be overshadowed by Glenn's death right after. If I could change that Negan encounter, and spare Glenn for the sake of this discussion.. I'd have had it be just Daryl gets Lucille'd and then Negan smashed or cuts off Ricks hand after the Carl hand fake out. Abe contribute military skills during All Out War, and dying during one of the clashes would have made a better impact

- the show remixing the Governor's comic iconic sword beheading of Tyrese to be Hershel's death was one of the most successful things in the entire show, and having Negan kill Daryl in his introduction line up, AND then fulfilling the long time change from the comics of Rick getting his hand cut off would have been on par with the Hershel death change. Unfortunately I think it's been pretty blatantly obvious since season 4 that the show runners love Daryl and Norman Reedus and would be too afraid to give him the axe"
Revolutionary Love,"I began to lost interest when they tried and failed miserably to add some nuance to the conflict with the Saviors. I mean, if they wanted to add some shades of gray and make the audience question the morality of Rick’s group, maybe they shouldn’t have written the Saviors as cartoonish evil and sadistic as they were. It’s something that annoys me in several pieces of fiction: they want to present a complicated conflict to make you question the actions of the protagonists, but screw up the balance by making one side much, much worse than the other. 

And then there’s Negan. Yeah, the characters simply didn’t work that well in the show, if you ask me. Glenn totally shouldn’t have died in the hands of such an uninteresting villain. And then there were the other exits. Carl, Rick, Michone… The show had its problems, but I really liked the relationship between those three. The show lost a lot without them. And it’s not like their exits were necessary, but AMC isn’t known for treating their actors well."
Revolutionary Love,"I once had a Disney coloring book when I was very little. I was so young, that I sucked at staying in the lines when coloring. One of the pics I remember ""coloring"" was of Bambi. My horribly colored version of Bambi was more realistic than what they tried to pass off on an international television show as a realistic depiction of a deer."
Revolutionary Love,"Stopped watching somewhere during season 4 and really I was forcing myself back then. Followed the comic up to after Negan's fall and once again forcing myself.

Zombie films/TV/media only work as long as you don't treat the audience like idiots. When your audience can think of better ways to survive a zombie apocalypse they tend to tune out. 

But this is a bad trait that most horror media suffers from. So much so that it has been come stereotypical. 

The solution:
Make smart characters that make smart decisions then have those smart decisions be overcome by an even smarter evil.

Example films: 
John Carpenter's The Thing
Scream
Cabin in the Woods"
Revolutionary Love,I bailed out after season 2 and never looked back.
Revolutionary Love,"Half of this show’s problems came from the introduction of the ‘mid-season finale’. Instead of writing however many episodes slowly building to a finale, to get a cheap pop from the audience they introduced the ‘mid-season finale’. So now they have to introduce things to happen as a ‘mid-season finale’ like the dumpster fake out and killing Glenn. I honestly can’t remember if Glenn died on a mid-season finale or an actual one at this point. I just remember the writing falling in the toilet to accommodate these pointless halfway point finales. 

Another part that didn’t help was the Talking Dead show after it. Out here in real world we’re all acknowledging the downturn in quality and you’ve got Chris Hardwick popping ecstatically at episodes we all think were shit. I know that’s his job but it was still bizarre to watch a terrible show and then have him looking like Nelson Muntz at an Andy Williams show."
Revolutionary Love,"Killing Carl was a stupid mistake and supposedly it was done so they wouldn't have to pay Chandler Riggs ""adult money"".

Once season 3 adopted the 16-episode format, episodes 1,8,9,16 seemed like the only good episodes, and the rest are just filler.

I still like the show and will finish it, but when season 8 ended, i stopped watching it live and wait for full season drops on netflix.

Season 7 and 8 were such a drag...i think just a few actual weeks passed as far as the story goes...and the bad far outweighed the good.

Season 9 was a return to form when Angela Kang took over instead of Scott Gimple, but many people had already checked out."
Revolutionary Love,"I have always been a zombie fan, but somehow had never seen one episode of TWD until last month. Needless to say, I became completely addicted and binged watched all 10 seasons somehow within 30 days, even though I have a job and life.

  
What I've always loved about the zombie genre is that it, though the circumstances of the zombies themselves may be unbelievable, there is something raw and completely believable about how humans behave when shit hits the fan. Think of Day of the Dead or Dawn of the Dead, with people going on shopping sprees, hording awesome guns and creating hierarchies that inevitably crumble. Groups bonding together and feuding with others. All of this is very real, human behavior. And we love watching zombie flicks because it often feels so strangely real.

  
TWD embodied all of this up until about the 4th season, and it was awesome. Then things started to fall apart.

  
The villains started getting too evil, and the worlds they inhabited started becoming unbelievable. In my view, it started with Neegan. He was just too evil. In a zombie apocalypse, would the leader of a gang of road hogs really name a wire-covered bat Lucille and love her like his dead wife? Would he pulverize the brains of people for seemingly no reason? I started to feel like things were taking a turn away from the raw believability into a new place.

  
Then came the Kingdom and its leader, King Ezekiel with his tiger. Then the people would wear flimsy body armor and use bows and arrows and spears (I know bullets must run out, but still). Then came the garbage people and their unbelievable way of talking. Somewhere around this time, the former priest becomes one eyed, begins wearing a Puritanical black quaker hat and begins speaking of miracles and demons while getting it on with the Latina badass.

  
Then two of the main characters disappear without a trace, no explanation, for 1.5 seasons. Then you get the Whisperers and this frumpy bald butch with the worst Southern accent I've ever heard in my life. She, somehow the leader, is followed by a giant monster named beta who hears things from the zombies.

  
At this point, all semblance of a ""believable"" post apocalyptic world looks entirely like a cheap fantasy movie, replete with masks, medieval weapons and townscapes with dutch windmills and wooden walls.

  
I kept watching, albeit leaving it on in the background, from season 8-\`10. At that point it had already lost its magic, but had become almost hard to watch. I realize it was based on a comic book, but there is no law stating you have to follow every twist and turn.

  
As a viewer, I was so frustrated with the way this show developed I felt compelled to create a reddit account and post this essay lol. I know, maybe I'm overreacting. But when you invest so much time in the characters and show, and the show takes you down this ridiculous road, it makes you angry. It violates so many basic principle of storytelling.

  
I've read many threads on various annoying elements of the show but had yet to read a full on account about just how the show went completely off the rails.

  
TLDR: TWD began as a believable and riveting post-apocalyptic zombie tale with great characters but devolved into a cheap fantasy show while losing its original allure and credibility. How could they snatch away the main character for 2 seasons without explanation? WTF is that?"
Revolutionary Love,"Agree completely - I stopped watching once Glenn died.

It would’ve been super easy to have him live too…Daryl doesn’t exist in the comics so you could just have him do *something* that saves Glenn, and the meta narrative could’ve been that Glenn survives because Daryl exists in this universe."
Revolutionary Love,"Unwatchable after season 3, only solace is finding out through this post that Coral died.  I hope it wasn’t fast."
Revolutionary Love,"They went wrong by changing the style and tone of the show every 2 seasons. and making it incredibly boring. No one wants to watch people staring into space and talking slowly.

That and the massive amount of plot armour for the main characters. If Daryl existing in the comic he'd be dead by issue 30."
Revolutionary Love,"Stopped watching after Beth died. Darkness without some light is just blackness. I like hopeless post-apoc, and it can fit well into a feature film where you are trying to make an artistic statement, which can certainly be ""there is no hope."" 'The Road' is a pretty good example of a good post-apoc media product in that vein. You watch it, it's over, you think about it, but you're not asked to watch it again.

But to make a zombie show where all hope dies (all the young uns) just means I won't keep watching it.

Beth particularly pissed me off because she just survived the whole hospital thing. These small stories were great, they expand on the characters and the world. They are fun, these like arcs in a bottle. But in general you can't ask a viewer to spend 4 hours following a plot then make the whole 4 hours *meaningless* in pursuit of shocking the viewer. If Beth died in the hospital, *you don't need to tell the story of how she escaped* (and then died). I just felt like I had been robbed of my time by the show's producers"
Revolutionary Love,"There were many missteps.  The biggest was Carl followed by Rick.  The biggest problem with the show is that it has no direction.  

We have accepted that we will never see the origin of the virus or a cure for that matter, but there has to be more to the world than what we have seen.  There has to be better safe havens around the world etc, but they have milked it so long that we no longer care to find out.  I bet zombies aren't even an issue in japan.  I bet they have family heir loom swords all over the place and basically have thousands of michonne-like people walking around cleaning house.

I miss Shane.  That character was intense and we haven't seen anyone replicate his performance like at the barn house when they find Sophia etc."
Revolutionary Love,"Maybe unpopular but I think what GOT did with Jon Snow, making everyone think he’s dead at the end of a season only to bring him back two episodes into the next season is 1000x more annoying and lazily written than what they did with Glenn 

I don’t think killing Glenn was a mistake at all, in fact I think Negan is one of the best parts of the show as a whole. I think the biggest issue was trying to make every character be a main character even when they were disliked by most of the fans"
Revolutionary Love,"Very well put.  I loved the show too but after Glenn and then Carl's death, I didn't have any desire to keep watching.  I know it is the risk you take when watching but too many of our favorites dying and all the time we invest in them make people tune out.  The series could have ended much earlier on a high note."
Revolutionary Love,">Maggie's arc (which the show failed spectacularly at anyways because the Hilltop arc was a massive snoozefest) is on its own a terrible idea.

God, you're so right!  You are absolutely right.  And I can't even think about Carl's death without getting angry."
Revolutionary Love,I stopped because I was fine with one spinoff but then they started talking about multiple spinoffs then several movies and it became too franchised for me
Revolutionary Love,"Great write up! It really does come down to Glenn, Rick, and Carl. The show could have survived it's popularity in my view if at least one of these characters was still on the show. 

2/3 I believe they'd still be getting 5+ mill viewers per episode. 

Honestly all three should still be there."
Revolutionary Love,"Will the dozens of flash back episodes about every character, its a let down to not have a origin episode about how it all started.  Of course I get backlash from fans who say we dont need to know how the virus started turning people into zombies, but thats it, every zombie show or movie never talks about it.  28 days is the only one that shows you how the virus got out, but after 11 seasons of Walking Dead, were never gong to get that episode.  We'll get a flash back episode about everything else, except for the origin."
Revolutionary Love,"I just think they need to kill Maggie.  She can't be trusted to stick around, and yet she wants to be in charge and expects people to obey?  Please.  If you want to be the boss of everyone, you need to prove that you're worth following.  Above all, you need to be *consistent,* not fickle/temperamental/selfish like she is.  She couldn't even be bothered to look for her own sister after they got separated, so how can she be trusted to keep her community safe?  She can't.  She's proven that she'll abandon them if the mood takes her, and her fans just eat that up.

Where the show went wrong...I think it depends on who you ask.  For me, it involved a bus and Washington DC.  I was willing to give Maggie a pass even though I didn't like her, because things were so crazy after the group got scattered.  Then she *got on a bus to go to Washington DC,* like they were going on a field trip, and I was like, ""Um, excuse me, Karen, but your sister is still *out* there.  Yeah, if you could, you know, actually go and *look* for her, that would be great.  Oh.  Okay.  We're doing *this* now.  Fine.  Hoping to watch you die at some point. 😡""  But of course I'm not that lucky.  

Her romance with Glenn bored me, but it was fine.  It was Maggie's attitude and selfish actions that really put me off.  Putting her in charge of *anything* is a deadly mistake."
Revolutionary Love,"As someone who’s read the comics, I can confirm that there is no way the ending will be good. I love the show but they’ve just fucked up their future when they killed Carl and got rid of Rick, because the ending in the comics is heavily dependent on those two characters. Also they’ve got to much on their plate, the reapers or something storyline (the group that was hinting Maggie) and the Commonwealth."
Revolutionary Love,"Returning when season 11 is gradually com by out, and it’s the worst season yet. There is no plot, there is no main characters it’s genuinely painful just watching it. And the worst part is, it brings down the rest of the series, what was all that struggle for in the prier series if it all ends like this? With all the characters people cared about either just disappearing without explanation or dying meaninglessly."
Revolutionary Love,"They should finish the show when Negan Part complete. But you know the Americans they squeeze until the everything dry out.

Greed kill the show :D"
Revolutionary Love,Dude just compared walking dead to breaking bad….hard stop. Immediately no
Revolutionary Love,Did the show change writers and/or producers? Everything just seems different on the show now. Even the way the show is shot is different. Almost as if they have a lower budget.
Revolutionary Love,I effing hated Carl... I could not wait to see him gone
Revolutionary Love,"Anyone else just want the majority of the main group to die? The show has gone on for so long that I’ve turned against them and see that if other communities don’t see their vision on how things should be, they just go and fuck shit up."
Revolutionary Love,"One year later...

So the show is over now. I watched the finale weeks ago. But I've been obsessed with figuring out why people hate on it now. TWD haters rarely elaborate beyond ""Glenn died, so I stopped watching."" 

This post explains everything perfectly, though. If the show kept Rick, Glenn, and Carl in, and did everything you suggested the show should've done, I can only imagine how praised it would be today. Probably would be considered as great as Breaking Bad.

Sucks that won't ever happen. The damage has already been done.

I'm really hoping that one day a new zombie show comes in and beats The Walking Dead in length and rating. A new zombie apocalypse series that's better than TWD in every way. I can only hope.

Thanks for this analysis. It's the first one I read that greatly explains why TWD went back and is genuinely helpful. I'm still a fan of the show(I'm easily entertained) but your post proves TWD could've been loads better. If only."
Married to Medicine,Commenting just to let you know that I have absolutely *no* clue what you’re talking about. But good luck!
Married to Medicine,Care to explain what any of those acronyms are…?
Married to Medicine,Those acronyms are IPP and ECP which are abbreviations for in program pointer and end credits promotion
Married to Medicine,"I watched this show as a kid, but I don't remember much anymore. I see it's on Prime, I might start watching it again."
Married to Medicine,"I totally forgot about this.  I enjoyed it.  For some reason, it reminds me of that show where a guy started getting a newspaper a day early and tried to help people."
Married to Medicine,"Yes! Loved this show. Really enjoyed the concept. The theme song in seasons 2 and 3 was really good. It was part of a ""double header"" on Saturday nights on NBC with ""The Profiler."" They crossed over a couple of times, too.

John Gries (aka Uncle Rico or Roger ""Workman"" Linus) was on it before his Napoleon Dynamite days."
Married to Medicine,"I liked it a lot, and Ms. Parker is still one of my favorite characters because the trauma and the pressure seem very... contemporary: she's a mood, and I think many people often feel like her.

I wasn't a fan of the individual jobs/""cases"" in most episodes, and Jarod often felt a little creepy. I wish the show leaned into that a little stronger.

also, I wonder what happened to Michael T. Weiss, the actor: does he have some personal issues? plus, most people assume that he is queer, but I never read anything official.

completely random: Apple TV often has shows that fit the ""Pretender"" mood (geniuses, 60s retro stuff etc.: Hello Tomorrow, Severance, For All Mankind) and I would love to see what they would do with that concept."
Married to Medicine,"What ever happened to that guy, Michael T. Weiss.  It's like he entered the Witness Protection Program or something, the way he disappeared."
Married to Medicine,"Jeez, I hadn't thought about this show in over 20 years."
Married to Medicine,I'm still mad we never got a proper ending.
Married to Medicine,One of my favorites
Married to Medicine,Great show. Watch is every few years.
Married to Medicine,Great show. It's unfortunate that it's fallen out of the collective of good shows such that you rarely hear about it.
Married to Medicine,"I remember it, watched it a lot. I might have missed a few episodes, though. 
It had crossovers with Profiler, which otherwise wasn't that similar. 
Had also neat cast of antagonists, and a larger background plot. Though it did feel a bit like they were making it up as they went along."
Married to Medicine,"They took the perfect ""plot of the week"" show and ruined it with a monomyth."
Married to Medicine,It was okay on TNT or whichever it broadcast on
Married to Medicine,Loved that show - I think of it often whenever my career is getting me down.
Married to Medicine,"I pretty much just remember the main dude looking kind of like Bear Grylls, the premise of the show and... that's it. I know I watched some episodes, but it was one of those shows I never made a note to actually watch. It's weird how the title ""The Pretender"" still rings a bell though."
Married to Medicine,I watched it as a kid with my parents. Had a crush on Ms. Parker.
Married to Medicine,Like The Hulk and Quantum Leap: gifted guy finds a new person in need every episode and apply their wholesome skills.
Married to Medicine,"*The Pretender* was great. I'd support a reboot...if they kept the tone more serious than light-hearted. 

I do think the original show skewed a bit light-hearted in places, but there's a dearth of shows of that nature which tend more towards intensity, and a Pretender reboot would fill that gap nicely."
Married to Medicine,"I remember a promo for a new episode where the voice over is asking, ""Is he crazy? Or crazy like a fox!"". I never watched the show, but that stuck in my head for some reason."
Married to Medicine,Shocked to find all 4 seasons on amazon prime today
Married to Medicine,Extremely underrated. Jake lloyd was in it before phantom menace
Married to Medicine,"The myth arc got a bit away from the show, but really enjoyed it overall."
Married to Medicine,"Man, have not seen anyone mention this for quite a while. Then there's two of you asking about it in the span of a couple weeks. Everytime I watch ER & it gets to the part where Doug is dating Linda-I say Ms Parker! Weirdly it's her real name as well. Michael Weiss, I think back to when I watched DOOL & he played Michael Horton.  Angelo pops up on Chicago Fire once in a while...like just this season."
Married to Medicine,"Miss Parker made my pants fit funny. God, she was gorgeous."
Married to Medicine,"I used to be a fan, bought the DVDs and all but the ending was disappointing, though not entirely unexpected, I guess?"
Married to Medicine,It was cheesy as hell but really quite watchable.
Married to Medicine,"How would you imagine the show end? They capture him? He would just escape again.  I can't remember the plot, was there something you wanted to see wrapped up?"
Married to Medicine,"So much love for the show!

I recently re-watched, and although I love the characters very much, the show went silly as the seasons progressed. It seemed to me that every season finale was even more ridiculous than the previous in an attempt to raise up the stakes, only to return to the status quo in the first episode of the next season.

It was a good show for it's time, but I think it would have played out differently if it was made today.

For example, it was procedural tv in the sense that every episode followed almost the same formula, with the exception of the finales where the vague overarching theme converged to be somehow resolved for that season. First season was fine to have Jarod discover the world and himself, after that, for me at least it became boring and I didn't care for it. I enjoyed more his pretends when it was about dirty Centre secrets, and I think the show suffered a lot not having those showed on screen, in stead of the umpteenth time Jarod saved some poor soul. We already saw that, we have established he is mostly a good person and why he does that. Can we please move on and have a more comprehensive story about his specialness and family he so desperately tries to find. Maybe even an open confrontation w/ Centre trying to sabotage their current evil doings.

Although, I  love to watch procedurals from time to time (Grey's, NCISs etc.) I feel that a mystery/sci-fi show has no legs to stand on for that kind of format. Sooner or later you have to answer those mysteries you are hooking people in and to make things interesting an to have some sense. I don't know if the writers didn't know if they'll be renewed or what added to many rehashed plots or not, but the show definitely suffers from Chris Carter effect in the sense that by the end they were making $ up.

Plot holes just grew bigger. For example, in the first season we have that the blond lady knew Jarod and MPs mom from the convent and she helped his parents hide from the Center. And Jarod has a brother who was kidnapped too. Ok, that is believable. Maybe we can build from there. But no.

Then in season two we have the genetics lab from the late 50s/early 60s who knew how much Jarod's genes were important for the Centre to steal him and their parents needed fertility doctor to make him, and they kind of forgot that he had a brother who the Center also kidnapped because he was also special. How were two people who barely could have children able to pop two more after Jarod and for Center to find them and steal one of those too? Timeline is more confusing than Teen Wolf (and anybody who's watched that can confirm how vague Derek's age is and anything to the timeline of the past). 

Not to mention even more plot holes and progressive ridiculousness of season 3, 4 finales and adding supernatural element out of nowhere.

I loved Jarod/Miss Parker dichotomy and most of the characters and that was the shows strong suit and the actors really did their job very well."
Married to Medicine,I love the foo fighters song ...
Married to Medicine,Total cheese factor but loved it anyways. John Gries has made leaps and bounds since then.
Married to Medicine,"I remember this from back in the day, for some reason I thought there was a season or 2 more than the 4. And i don't recall the movies at all. And for some reason I think I fell off around season 3"
Married to Medicine,"Loved that show! 
It was also the reason I wanted to buy a leather jacket 😆 Miss Parker looked so good in it.
Looking back it had a lot of stuff that didn’t really make sense and/or fit with earlier story about the centre but it was great to see Jarod’s new job this time. 
Love when I see some of the actors in other shows/movies though I can never get used to Mr Lyle being a good guy in other things"
Married to Medicine,"Yeah. I liked it back when it aired. It was one of those late 90s/early 2000s sci-fish shows that were pretty formulaic but had some fun twist. And an attractive female main cast member in a position of power. 

7 Days had a guy who time travels one  week into the past, The Invisible Man had... Um.. the invisible man. John Doe had the guy from Prison Break but as an amnesiac who knows everything (though noticeably half the stuff he says is wrong if you Google it). They all felt pretty similar and all got cancelled before their overarching mystery got solved."
Married to Medicine,It is 23 years later and people are still talking about this show.  It is a shame it never got the conclusion that it deserved.  I still research for updates.  It is truly a classic now with STILL a strong following.  Hollywood is clueless.
Married to Medicine,Love watch old shows that I maybe missed the last season didn’t know prime had this so thanks
Married to Medicine,ohh its on Prime..  I may have to take a look
Married to Medicine,"Same, randomly watching it when I got home from school on network cable."
Married to Medicine,Early Edition.
Married to Medicine,"I came here to mention Early edition ! Ya beat me to it. There were a lot of 1 or 2 season sci Fi type shows in the late 90's that have kinda faded into obscurity. Andromeda, Dark Angel, Earth, final conflict to name a few"
Married to Medicine,"That's not surprising because my parents watched both of these when they were on and i was a kid who like half paid attention, but the one thing I remember is that they did not call the shows by their proper name, they just said ""Oh Jared is on tonight"" or ""there's an episode of Gary that we recorded""."
Married to Medicine,which reminds me of Now and Again... which I remember enjoying
Married to Medicine,"Jarod was creepy? In what way?

That one episode where he made that prisoner give up his kidney for his son was beyond messed up. Usually Jarod never went that far. 

Also it’s just a tv show but Jarod really put peoples lives at risk sometimes. Because he wanted them to feel how their victims felt. Taste of their own medicine."
Married to Medicine,Agree on Miss Parker...
Married to Medicine,"Last thing I remember seeing him in was an episode of a burn notice, which is funny since Jeffry Donovan (the main actor in BN) played Jarrods brother in The Pretender"
Married to Medicine,Idk but my mom was obsessed with that guy.
Married to Medicine,What do you mean?
Married to Medicine,I watched it on Amazon the other day and 30 years later I still have a crush on Miss Parker.
Married to Medicine,I second that.
Married to Medicine,Myth arc? What was that?
Married to Medicine,"The show never fully ended. 

After 4 seasons and 2 movies they still don’t wrap everything up."
Married to Medicine,"The show ended on a cliffhanger.

And even the 2 movies didn’t wrap everything up."
Married to Medicine,"It wasn’t perfect, but man the show was a lot of fun."
Married to Medicine,Waiting for him to snap at Desperate housewives'
Married to Medicine,Thank you!
Married to Medicine,The first season of Andromeda is so good. The season finale was insane. It slowly faded into being the kevin Sorbo show though and the last few seasons are unwatchable.
Married to Medicine,I still can't believe Andromeda had 5 seasons.
Married to Medicine,"I think you answered your own question here, yes. that's what I found creepy. that... Batman-like ""let's scare them straight"" vigilantism shit."
Married to Medicine,"I just went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole on the pretender because I’ve been rewatching burn notice, saw the pretender and started googling. 

I think the pretender might be remembered better if it had a ending or at least revealed more of the back story."
Married to Medicine,"They overly focused on the centre and the conspiracies.

Jared could slot into essentially any role, his only limit was that he eventually had to move on.

The initial premise was the best one, a Genius child is kidnapped by criminals who rent out his skills until he is strong enough to escape.

Burn Notice made a lot of the same mistakes The Pretender did. And Jeffrey Donovan was in both!"
Married to Medicine,A myth arc is a genric term (coined by the X-Files) for a story arc that spans a show's entire series.
Married to Medicine,"They did, by going back to the beginning. Kind of a time loop. Which I found a bit frustrating."
Married to Medicine,"TIL there was two movies- Wikipedia says they wrapped up the cliff hanger at least-

Oh and I read that the two books explain some of the mysteries from the show, so at least there is that"
Married to Medicine,"I agree with that. i still love to watch. And to find people who also like it to discuss. The subject is not like a hot like when you go to the LotR, HotD, Last of us etc. boards  to share the love for the series. Glad to se there is still love for it.

Who knows, maybe we get lucky to get a reboot or something."
Married to Medicine,I don't remember a lot about the later seasons. I only found out recently that Kevin Sorbo is a lunatic. Which is disappointing.
Married to Medicine,"Yeah sometimes Jarod took it a little far. But not always. 

A lot of times? Yeah. Always? No.

But yeah I mostly agree with you."
Married to Medicine,"I disagree with you. The Centre mysteries is what kept it going for me. Because at the end it is Jarod's character journey after he escaped a hellhole and how he regains his humanity and how he relates to the world that is important. There also needs to be some resolution to his inner life and turmoil.

You see that also in modern procedurals like Gray's anatomy or NCIS. Yes characters are in their job setting and are resolving those mysteries, but there is also plot B with an even more important task that is their personal problems that they are trying to resolve.

How many copy pasted aimless episodes would the show last if Jarod only did random pretends and not look for his family or work on cases where Centre destroyed someone's life because of his invention?"
Married to Medicine,"I think you’re in the wrong thread. 

I think you have some other show in mind.

We’re talking about the tv show “The Pretender”."
Married to Medicine,"Im sure the 2 books dont wrap everything up totally tho.

I wish someone could pull that relevant information and put it on a wiki or something. Because I really dont want to read those 2 books."
Married to Medicine,">Oh and I read that the two books explain some of the mysteries from the show, so at least there is that

There are books? Are they from the creators of the show or something akin to Star Trek Books?"
Married to Medicine,They wouldn't confess on their own.
Married to Medicine,"I like the last part, him fixing things he unintentionally damaged."
Married to Medicine,"Maybe, in the 2001 movie how they got back to Jarod escape and other pretenders when they previously established that the Jarod was the best of them all and that the children were phased out and Jarod was basically alone and isolated from the world with the exception to Sydney. And then suddenly there were others that Jarod socialized and worked with. That was weird.

And it is not like they didn't hit the reset button on every season premiere despite all the revelations only to put the players on the same positions all over again.

Also, no ending is also an ending. The only one we got. Nothing was resolved. All the characters stayed in their eternal limbo of doing the same thing over and over again. That can be like a time loop.

Jarod will eternally escape the Centre, Miss P will chase him (never leaving the place she hates), Sydney and Broots the same. There was not even a hint of  a hope that these people can escape these destructive cycles and be remotely happy or away from that misery. Ant that can be ok, just look at how bleak was the OG Nikita."
Married to Medicine,Funny thing you should mention this. So am I :)
Married to Medicine,"Yes they are written by the creators of the show. They are both prequels, they got into his first 'pretend' and more of the Centers origins and stuff it seems.  I need to do a tv show, then movie, then book marathon one day, I haven't watched the show since the episodes were new lol

[https://www.amazon.com.au/Pretender-Rebirth-Steven-Long-Mitchell/dp/1939927781](https://www.amazon.com.au/Pretender-Rebirth-Steven-Long-Mitchell/dp/1939927781)"
Married to Medicine,Yeah I agree. But sometimes Jarod would take it too far.
Married to Medicine,"I dont agree with you because I saw what happened in the 2nd movie. 

Believe me, I probably remember more about the show and the lore than you.

Like, you’re forgetting some important things.

The creators said they had an ending. They know how the show is supposed to end. But they haven’t told us what it was or done anything with it yet. 

Some important things happened in the 2nd movie as well."
Married to Medicine,Well what do u mean they went back to the beginning?
Married to Medicine,"Ok. We can agree to disagree.

Yes, there are probably important plot points in the second movie that they tried to explain away the whole series and maybe the third movie would have been great in tying all in. However, I personally didn't like it as the show was very sciency, only to go supernatural in the end??? It didn't make sense to me. Kind of like the second season of Dark Angel. Recently, I did a re-watch of that too, and boy it did not age well.

>The creators said they had an ending. They know how the show is supposed to end. But they haven’t told us what it was or done anything with it yet.

Also one of the things I resent the authors for. It's been twenty years, you can tell us how it would have ended. It is pretty clear you are not getting more seasons/movies.

&#x200B;

In the spirit of good discussion how you think it would/should have ended? Ok, Jarod was the ""Chosen One"". Chosen for what? Is he JC? Prince That Was Promised? What?

Personally I didn't see it going nowhere, because when you have the chosen one, you usually have some great evil/cataclysmic event that person/McGuffin is supposed to stop. By the end i didn't see it, unfortunately.

All that being said, that doesn't stop me from loving the show and characters and doing a casual re-watch for old times sake."
Married to Medicine,"I don't remember well if they decided to forget everything they discovered about their past during the four seasons but they sure did resume the hunt for Jarod that was part of the premise of the series.

So it felt like a sort of giant reset button, to be more accurate."
Married to Medicine,The only thing you could argue was supernatural was the scroll thing. And I guess the inner sense thing sort of.
Married to Medicine,"The show didn’t reset. 

It just never fully ended and wrapped up. After the 2 movies we still didn’t have a lot of things answered even."
Married to Medicine,"Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pretender:_Island_of_the_Haunted):

>  During one of Jarod and Ms. Parker's infrequent phone conversations, Ms. Parker expresses sympathy for Jarod and his mission, but sadly warns that she will continue to try and capture him.

Which is more or less what I remember."
Married to Medicine,"They were always after Jarod since day 1.

I’ve seen the whole show so I know a lot about it.

Sadly, the wikis don’t have much information on little details of the show and stuff."
Married to Medicine,"> I’ve seen the whole show so I know a lot about it.

And I haven't?

Ms. Parker paused the hunt (not telling the Center of course) while they were searching for clues of their pasts. Giving hope to the viewer that maybe she could turn against the Center. But it the end, she told Jarod she would never stop. With Lyle conducting his own hunt in competition with the Center."
Married to Medicine,"I didn’t say you haven’t. I just wasn’t sure. 

I think you’re right come to think of it. I remember a lot about the show but it’s also been a long time. 

But yes, even the 2 movies didn’t wrap everything up."
Married to Medicine,It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
Married to Medicine,The bear
Married to Medicine,"It's more unique when comedies do it

Seinfeld - no Jerry/Elaine

Mythic Quest - has a lesbian couple, but avoided Ian/Poppy relationship or giving them separate love interests, and characters like Jo get off on the power only"
Married to Medicine,"Silicon Valley

I'm not certain if there's a single romantic interest for any of the characters that lasts more than an episode.

From the first season, it seems like they were setting up Monica to be Richard's eventual love interest, but they remain work colleagues throughout the entire series."
Married to Medicine,Jeopardy
Married to Medicine,"Criminal Minds 

Derek and Garcia flirt a lot sure but that's for fun."
Married to Medicine,Squid Game
Married to Medicine,Elementary with Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu
Married to Medicine,Succession fits! All the romance left in that show is definitely not romantic 😆
Married to Medicine,Classic Doctor Who. 26 seasons of no hugging or kissing.
Married to Medicine,Mr. Robot is pretty unromantic
Married to Medicine,"As much as it surprised me, I'm going to go with Reservation Dogs. Going into it, I was pretty confident that it was going to be full of teen dating and relationship drama. That was not the case at all. Although sex is discussed occasionally, relationships between the main characters are almost asexual, and the contrast really stands out against inferior shows."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"I'm very curious if this was a Kardashian decision or a network decision, given that E! is on life-support."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I guess that means E! is over.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,TIL keeping up with the kardashians is *still on*
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,In the end... Turns out that we really did... Keep up with the Kardashians.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,[deleted]
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Idk why everyone's so surprised. They (E!) milked the cow till it was dry. I bet the Kardashians didn't want it anymore as they're getting older and probably just wanna lay low now. Plus covid, wtf would the show be about? Quarantine life is boring."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,It's easy to clown on the Kardashians but it's pretty impressive it's lasted this long. It's had a cultural impact (not necessarily saying a good one) and has influenced a lot of reality television for years. Kris is a lot of things but has whipped up an interesting legacy for the family.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"I salute the Kardashians, particularly Kim. They took a lousy porno and parlayed it into a 350 million dollar empire and managed to stay relevant in the social media world. A world where fame is measured with an egg timer."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"20 fucking seasons. I’m not even mad, that’s impressive. 

RIP E! Network"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,This whole thread is about to be an r/redditmoment
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Say what you will, but they cashed in on their name and it led to incredible success. I won’t be surprised if there’s a spinoff series"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I wonder if they all die in the last episode.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Like them or hate them, end of an era. Honestly the show was a weirdly intriguing watch and I get it why the show entered pop culture with a bang."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,7 years ago I thought this was finally gonna get cancelled because of Kanye dating Kim and how he would never appear on a reality show... boy was I wrong lol. Kardashians had a good run not gonna hate on that.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,The Kardashian occupation is over and Bajor is finally free.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"This kind of makes me sad. I remember it airing when I first started high school. I remember my mother disgusted by the fact that OJ’s lawyer’s family would be documented through a reality series. We were driving near the El Pollo Loco. I still remember the whole conversation. Reminds me of my childhood, when things were still simple and unadulterated."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"As much hate as they get, it’s genuinely impressive that they turned themselves into global pop cultural icons with jack shit reason for them to be. A truly stunning feat of masterful publicity work and self-branding."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,[removed]
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I guess E! itself is next.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Cue the hundreds of “DAE this show was still on” comments

but seriously there will be at least 6 different spinoffs made after this is over, the Kardashians will never truly go away"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Hopefully it will end when Kanye is arrested for voter fraud and crimes he participated in an effort to manipulate the 2020 election with Trump.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Please tell me The entire E! network will burn with it.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally some good news this year.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Here’s what I’ve discovered being a KUWTK fan.

People love to hate them, love them, watch them, talk about them, learn about them.

They live an interesting lifestyle and have had to deal with a bevy of tragedy. Losing family members to cancer, dealing with drug addiction, mental health issues, self-confidence, victims of violent crimes, health, exercise, birthing babies and post-surgical complications like Kim’s catheter and pee bags. 

Who cares if they are famous for ??? They work hard, very hard and are scrutinized for any and everything.

Whenever I watch and others are around, they are pulled into the screen as if by a magnet.

People who denounce them become utterly fascinated, asking questions, becoming part of commentary, laughing at the entertainment that this family provides.

Some may scream what a cultural cess pit! Good riddance! But to me it’s like saying goodbye to long time friends, a end of a era, a void being created in my comfort zone of entertainment."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Ugh can it be 2020 instead?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,it's one of my lesser known accomplishments that I've managed to not see single frame of this show in 20 years. my journey is soon over.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I've never cared about anything less in my entire life.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally some good news
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,They're gonna kill Kanye at the end.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I thought this garbage ended a decade ago.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally!
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Finally, some good news."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"I try to have a very ""Live and let live"" attitude towards a lot of things in entertainment and TV. Does it really matter in my life that this show on a network I barely, if ever, watch has been on? Does it matter in my life is someone likes the Kardashians? But every so often I hear them talk and a little part of me can't stand that these people are fmaous"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,good.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"People: don't be duped by the most shameless marketing cartel on TV.  This is just a renaming/promo exercise.  

A real cancellation isn't announced two seasons early, and it's no coincidence this comes on the eve of next week's season premiere.  

Kris Kardashian, who gleefully sold her daughter's sex tape and eagerly directed her porn photo spread, knows there's no such thing as bad publicity.  Announcing a fake cancelation is as instinctive as breathing for her.

Notice it's not the network canning the show, and notice they aren't cancelling the 10 spinoff shows.  

They'll just re-evaluate in a year and make some other fake announcement.  ""Fan outcry demands we give you just (X) more seasons!  Don't miss them!"" 

Or they'll milk it as a farewell, followed immediately by a ""new"" series called ""Retirement with the Kardashians"".  

Or, and this is my more likely prediction, they'll just announce a Kardashian streaming service of the same kind of rubbish.

If Kardashians ever take all their shows off the air for a full year, I'll buy a Kanye West clothing product... that's how confident I am."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank God for that!
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"In the series finale, the camera fades out until you see OJ Simpson staring intently into a snow globe with the Kardashian house inside it."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,The poison they have placed in the chalice of society will last well beyond their cancellation.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I didn’t even think it was still on.  What possibly could happen thats new and who the heck watches it.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Who gives a flying fuck, that whole family is a toxic bunch of privileged whiney cunts! Good riddance and thanks for taking the international IQ down 40 points!"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,And the dignity of the human race increased.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Who the hell watched this crap for so long?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally! Some good news in 2020.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Good riddance
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I am happy because that show is just so lame
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Good riddance!
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,20 seasons too many imo
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Oh no, I missed the last episode... and every single one before that too.

Finally some good news out of 2020."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Wonder which Kardashian will get killed off
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I am glad I  never wasted a second on this show.  I knew it existed but thats about it.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"The kardashians are one of my biggest guilty pleasures. I don’t watch the show or anything but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think they were fascinating. They are creating a false image for little girls and even grown ups and I think they’re pretty selfish and vapid but, the scandals that have gone on through those 20 seasons are crazy. The kardashians started their path to fame with the OJ trial. Enough said. What I want is, in ten years when they’re old and washed up and still needing attention that we’ll get some insane tell all. They have to have so many secrets. That family is like their own Illuminati"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Good. It’s exactly what is wrong with this country
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,20 seasons and I’ve yet to watch any of this drivel.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Never watched it and dont care
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,No.  Don't.  Stop.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,20 seasons too late.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,2021 already off to a better start than 2020
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I thought this show was only a couple seasons... people really watch that garbage?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank god. Maybe some people with get their brain cells back. These trashy people ruin America. There’s not much worse for our society on tv than the kardashians.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,I couldn't keep up with them even before season 1
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Finally, good news in 2020."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank god!!! Im pretty sure no matter what they say that they've actually been paying E! to keep them on the air.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Americans will watch absolute trash.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Who knew that OJ getting away with murder would elevate the celebrity status of a bunch of rich kids.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank god
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,This should've happened 20 years ago
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Excellent!! Haven’t watched one episode of the most twisted, dysfunctional family on the planet."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Oh - they're still on?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,They’d like you to think this was her decision.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,2021 already looking better than 2020
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Fucking trash needs to be taken out.  Good riddance.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,20 seasons too many
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,THANK GOD.... the one bit of good news we've received in 2020.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank God. Let's move on to real role models for our kids.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank fuck.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,This is 20 seasons overdue.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Does that mean that Kanye goes away?😄
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Best news I've heard all year.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Why did it ever get to season 2?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Hopefully the last season will be a crossover with The Purge.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"2020 isn’t all bad, I guess"
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Now that it's back on TV/Streaming, I guess the Cardassians can now go back to filming Star Trek."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Only 20 seasons too late.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Good
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Proud to say I have never watched it.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Best news all year.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,FUCKING FINALLY
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally some good news this year
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,TIL there's 20 years of this crap. Holy shit...
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Jesus fuck this show is still on? And we need another “season”?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Grats America, you made this shit last 20 fucking seasons. Cheers got 11."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Good riddance and Fuck off.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"Good, long overdue."
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Thank fuck. I want to keep away from the Kardashians.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,They have their own TV show..? They seem like very boring people to have their own show.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Finally.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,So i pose this question; if kim never made a sextape would this trash of television ever have seen the light of day?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Who?
Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"So even the best news of 2020 won’t be enjoyable until 2021?

I’ll still take it!"
Dear My Friends,Interesting tidbit in there that Overlook has also been scrapped for the second time.  3 years into a huge deal and he’s provided absolutely nothing but sunk costs for WB.
Dear My Friends,That's a mouthful of a title
Dear My Friends,That makes two series JJ's lost in the last few months.
Dear My Friends,"> According to sources, Garner exited My Glory Was I Had Such Friend ***for scheduling reasons.*** The show has taken quite awhile to get off the ground, and the Alias alumna is currently filming another Apple TV+ limited series, The Last Thing He Told Me, an adaptation of Laura Dave’s bestselling novel, which is produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine."
Dear My Friends,Has Bad Robot done anything significant with its TV deal?
Dear My Friends,"Still waiting for that Portal movie, JJ."
Dear My Friends,"Okay but what kind of title for a show is that? 

10 points for style but minus several million for good thinking."
Dear My Friends,"Am I correct in saying that the streamers losing all these huge payouts to these development deals isn’t as bad as people say?

I am pretty sure when X talent is “given $300mm” they aren’t stroked a lump check for that amount for their personal gain. Rather, that is a funding commitment to future projects by X talent’s production company and is allocated by project as they proceed. Right?

So if X talent does fuck all after signing, the streamer doesn’t lose $300 million, just some smaller amount that was piddled away on the front end of some stalled projects.

I think."
Dear My Friends,Bro I’m starting to think this JJ Abrams guy is lacking……
Dear My Friends,"Damn, is everything alright over at the house JJ built?  Sure seems like they're struggling at output for the past few years."
Dear My Friends,Why produce anything from this guy when he just goes on vacation for four years after every project? He's great at fleecing studios out of their money.
Dear My Friends,"Yeah that’s what happens when you dick around and dick around for 4 years, dipstick. 
Dude is seeing a whole slate of his projects getting scrapped because apparently he’s become too good to complete jobs he’s been hired for."
Dear My Friends,JJ is a hack
Dear My Friends,I guess they couldn’t manage to succeed without having Jennifer Garner on the show giving the same exact performance she always does as simply just being worried about something with a worried look on her face.
Dear My Friends,"If even Apple, which until now seems to be a well of patience and almost automatic renewals, is giving up waiting, it's because things are bad for JJ."
Dear My Friends,"Once again, probably for the best."
Dear My Friends,I still want to know what Demimonde was going to be about
Dear My Friends,Good. Abrams is a overrated hack who got lucky for far too long.
Dear My Friends,"At this point Bad Robot and JJ Abrams are jokes. Dude messed up Star Wars and Star Trek, and hopefully WB keeps him away from their properties."
Dear My Friends,"Honestly, I don’t need to see Jennifer Garner in anything ever again. I’d likely avoid viewing something after seeing that she was in it. Just a substance-less, shell-person."
Dear My Friends,OH NO poor JJ
Dear My Friends,"We are witnessing the death of originality, if the brand isn't already established, no company wants to go through a bunch of bullshit developing the brand just for it to get picked up somewhere else or not take off at all... Every complication is just another concession to scrap the idea and find an actual established brand, where as when the brand is established the complications are more readily worked through."
Dear My Friends,worst title ever since Bonekickers
Dear My Friends,"Honestly seems like his career might be dying out. He hasn't really done anything in years now, and WB is kind of signaling to the industry that the guy will take money and not do shit in return. With Hollywood starting to cool down on crazy spending as streaming levels out, I don't imagine a lot of studios are going to be giving him huge developmental deals going forward."
Dear My Friends,">	Another big-title Bad Robot series to get a pass includes The Shining spinoff Overlook, which was part of the company’s inaugural slate at HBO Max. The project subsequently moved to Netflix, which recently also **opted to release it**, I hear.

Doesn’t that say Netflix are still moving forward with Overlook, or am I reading that incorrectly?

I interpreted it as a poorly-worded “passed by HBO but proceeding with Netflix”."
Dear My Friends,It’s a quote from Yeats.
Dear My Friends,"I read it several times, thought I got it right but still didn't.  Enough reason to cancel it in my opinion!"
Dear My Friends,Is this a Japanese Light Novel?
Dear My Friends,"Another show that was officially ordered in 2018 and does not appear anywhere near ready to actually start filming. Losing the lead was probably the final straw for Apple. 

Bad Robot need to get their shit together!"
Dear My Friends,Next month we enter year four of his five year deal with WB worth $250 million that has now spawned a single show that was cancelled after one season (and he was barely involved with that).
Dear My Friends,"In case of emergency, open the Mystery Box."
Dear My Friends,tbf this seems more of a normal happenstance for shows languishing in development. Think the last news about this show was like 2018.
Dear My Friends,"Hot take, Abrams is nothing more than a Spielberg wannabe hack who has never made a good film or tv show (some will argue Lost, whatever). 

He’s only gotten to where he is because he’s friends with Kennedy and others. He stinks."
Dear My Friends,oh... I thought those two were the same project
Dear My Friends,Nope and that's why Warner/Discovery scrapped JJ Abrams projects after the merger. He was getting a pat on the back and told to take his time and now Bad Robot has gone from several projects on deck to none. Tbf though I wouldn't be shocked to see him wind up at Netflix now. They love their names.
Dear My Friends,No shows have been produced under that deal as of yet.
Dear My Friends,"Yup, looks like everything they've worked on in the last few years was co-produced by WBTV."
Dear My Friends,[deleted]
Dear My Friends,"God, I'm not.  

He has had his way with too many existing franchises.... and not to their benefit."
Dear My Friends,Fumbling star wars probably didn't help his coinage.
Dear My Friends,"Their execs have been fleeing in droves over the past year, they still haven’t got a show or a film released under their $250m 5-year deal, 4 years in. ."
Dear My Friends,"same, I would love to see the pitch deck for it"
Dear My Friends,Whatever will he do now.
Dear My Friends,[deleted]
Dear My Friends,"Paramount had the same thing happen. They signed a huge film overall deal after Trek and MI, and all they got out of it was Super 8 before he ran off to Disney."
Dear My Friends,We'd be so lucky if he took his money and disappeared. There were just so many cool things that could have been done with Star Wars and this guy gave us shit on a stick.
Dear My Friends,"To be entirely fair to him, this is happening with a ton of PODs at all the streamers and networks. Bad Robot is getting shit from Warner, Peele Uni, Lisa Joy at Amazon, Berlanti at HBO, hell, even Murphy at Netflix.

Studios pay out for MASSIVE overall deals to get content from big creators. Sometimes it works out. But more often than not, they simply don't deliver enough IP to make the 300 MILLION BUCKS worth it. 

It's honestly a huge problem, because studios are spending less every year on projects from even mid-level creatives, while pretty much blowing their loads on a small handful of deals with piss poor batting averages."
Dear My Friends,"The word ‘also’ implies Netflix also passed on it and released the project to be shipped for a third time.

I think there’s a reason there was never any official press release regarding Overlook and Netflix."
Dear My Friends,"Release could mean released the project from their contract to make it, so now it's available for other networks(but would probably be done since they would be the second network to do this)  rather than that they are releasing it as in it is coming out."
Dear My Friends,"Can we please stop quoting Kanye West already?

/s"
Dear My Friends,It got Yeated alright.
Dear My Friends,“Bad Robot” was enough to cancel it in my mind.
Dear My Friends,Honestly not that hard to read. Lol people on Reddit have trouble reading headlines a little to much. Idk if you guys are serious most of time or making a joke.
Dear My Friends,"WB paid a shit load of money for JJ to make that and other projects, and didn't want to lose his business by *rushing him to actually film it*.

The new ownership doesn't want friends, it just wants its fucking money. And killed the project since it wasn't making any."
Dear My Friends,I honestly think they are going to finish out that contract with no other projects. WB is cutting its losses and wants to move on from JJ
Dear My Friends,"His deals tend to be pretty bad for the studios. Paramount paid far too much for what they got second time around, and that was before he jumped to Disney on Paramount time to make Star Wars. 

WB signed him for film mainly to keep his TV but that has dried up too."
Dear My Friends,What show was that?
Dear My Friends,West World
Dear My Friends,"so westworld doesnt count since its from 2016/17? because unless im mistaken bad robot is involved in it.

i wonder how exactly does the deal works because shows like little voice and castle rock were produced by bad robot and warner but distributed by other services..."
Dear My Friends,Yeah it probably wasn’t realistic to expect Garner to keep hanging in there year after year for a project that might never materialize.
Dear My Friends,I thought Fringe was quite good
Dear My Friends,Mission impossible 3 is amazing
Dear My Friends,"nah alias and super 8 were both great. then we have lost and fringe, which he sort of kick started but left to others...

i would say he has a better eye in choosing which stories deserve being told then as a director or even writer, as he and/or his company also produced some good shows like persons of interest and westworld, which yeah is sort of a mess but season 1 was great and the show is at very least still entertaining, and some entertaining movies like cloverfield, and overlord or even mission impossible..."
Dear My Friends,"> Hot take, Abrams is nothing more than a Spielberg wannabe hack who has never made a good film or tv show (some will argue Lost, whatever). 

I view it slightly differently but we might net be saying the same thing: I think Abrams is a competent director but an entirely inept creator so he needs to be putting to film what other, smarter people write."
Dear My Friends,"Person of Interest is my favourite show ever and really, really good. He had minimal involvement though besides giving Nolan the opportunity to develop it. So for that I am thankful."
Dear My Friends,"When story gets in the way of making a movie (or TV show).... Time travel!! 

That's JJ's 'go to solution, and it's a cheating."
Dear My Friends,I hate to say it because Kurtzman was also involved but I still love Fringe. Of course they actually solved all of their mysteries.
Dear My Friends,"That's one hell of a hot take. He's certainly not one of the greatest, but to say he's never made anything good at all is pretty egregious. He's made 4 hit shows, one of which being LOST. He also added decent-good entries into 3 famous franchises (granted 2 of those, he made not so good entries). But to say he's never made anything good just seems silly."
Dear My Friends,One would argue that the reason Lost was good was because of Lindelof and the reason it went off the rails was JJ and network interference.
Dear My Friends,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a great movie on its own. Mission Impossible 3 is also great, Fringe is an alright show too. I think people lose track of the fact that JJ is much more of a producer than anything else."
Dear My Friends,fuck you! Alias was quite good. Lost really lost me with that ending and the Polar Bear.
Dear My Friends,I highly disagree he was the main writer on Armageddon and that film is a masterclass in stupidity.
Dear My Friends,More like s**t take
Dear My Friends,"> Spielberg wannabe

This is what I've always thought. I haven't hated all of his projects, but Super 8 was just one giant homage and the fact that it was so obviously trying to be 70s/80s Spielberg-esque was distracting. Then he just kept getting big films and making the same thing over and over. Spielberg was able to make a different movie when he wanted to, but Abrams just creates the same general outline in all of his films."
Dear My Friends,I am ROCK HARD at how many people this comment triggered.
Dear My Friends,"disagree, but I don't hold JJ in much higher regard than you anyway, his expertise is very limited to certain things. Star Trek 2009 may get lots of shit but I think it's a damn fine movie"
Dear My Friends,"No, they just both have long and forgettable names that nobody will ever remember."
Dear My Friends,That was all under the previous deal he had with WBTV. No film or show has yet been released developed under his 2019 $250m 5-year deal.
Dear My Friends,"That came out of the old deal, with work starting in 2017. The current deal started Sept 2019. None of the TV projects started since then have made it to air."
Dear My Friends,"I mean he fumbled Star Trek in the exact same way (decent but shallow first entry he directed, bed-shittingly bad and incoherent, lore-breaking second time at the helm) and then got Star Wars."
Dear My Friends,"To be fair, Reddit is a place where most people are trying to pass repost off as their own, I'm not surprised"
Dear My Friends,Minor edit. He did ST 2 before SW as well
Dear My Friends,Super 8 was so good
Dear My Friends,And not even a *good* stick!
Dear My Friends,"Besides Rogue One and Mando, the other new Star Wars content has been lackluster too. Abrams was only part of the problem at Lucasfilm."
Dear My Friends,"Naw man, kids don't like Jedi. No need for Jedi. Also Harry Potter was not popular so having any sort of Jedi school would also be such a stupid move."
Dear My Friends,"There is a lesson in this. 

Hollywood would have a better average overall with less money being thrown around. 

Less money forces more creativity. Creativity  means new ideas. Hollywood needs that. 

Also less money allows for bigger risks. 

The model currently is adapting or expanding existing IPs. What Hollywood isn't doing is growing its own."
Dear My Friends,What’s happening with Peele??
Dear My Friends,"TBF, moving to the subscription base and adjusting to a more stable/steadier revenue stream was bound to happen now that their forecasts/metrics are in solid form.  Wonder if this is the reality check that unless you're going disney crazy having an all star cast every time on the ticket with material that hits the majority of the market, you're SoL in maintaining the pace."
Dear My Friends,">	could mean

Yes, hence:

>	poorly-worded"
Dear My Friends,Actually I heard it got changed to Yeasty. That's what I call him anyways.
Dear My Friends,Wtf does I have such friends mean?
Dear My Friends,Apple cancelled development because Garner dropped out. This isn't necessarily part of the WB shift in strat.
Dear My Friends,Lovecraft country? Idk if that's the one OP was referring to
Dear My Friends,"lovecraft country, probably. it was pretty good actually."
Dear My Friends,Fringe was excellent and the mythology was far more interesting than the X-Files.  Alias was amazing too.  JJ had his day but lost his way it seems.
Dear My Friends,"Basically a ripoff of x-files. Like I said, pure hack."
Dear My Friends,"J.J. gets more credit *and* blame than he deserves on many of the projects attributed to him. He had very little to do with Lost past the development phase, and shooting the pilot. FRINGE---same thing (I dont even think he directed any eps?) Alias--he left in latter seasons to do MI:3. Westworld, he pitched to the Nolans and put it under his production umbrella."
Dear My Friends,Fringe was awesome. Anyone who says it was an x-files rip off didn’t watch the show. The characters were great and they actually built out interesting sfi-if story lines that were actually resolved and explained.
Dear My Friends,"It started as a JJ, Kurtzman and Orci project and was surprisingly good but thankfully other people and writers took over to satisfyingly build on and answer mystery boxes. Love that show! (JJ's name and clout probably helped keep it on the air, he was good in the producer position)"
Cocomelon,Well on the bright side I’m learning that I can target shows for cancellation by starting them and never finishing them. I’m coming for you Cocomelon
Cocomelon,[removed]
Cocomelon,Breaking Bad probably wouldn't have survived.
Cocomelon,"I think the issue, at least for me, is that there’s not many shows like this out there. Sure theres Dark, which was good. But I personally like this genre and when Netflix comes out with these types of shows I’m excited. Instead they focus on more basic shows that require no thought put into the plot, so that everyone can follow along. When people have to go out of their way to figure something out about the show, then it just isn’t worth it."
Cocomelon,Viewers are getting punished by Netflix for watching the new Netflix shows. Not a great idea. I have literally stopped watching new Netflix originals until I know the series is confirmed to have a conclusion. I’ve been burned too many times.
Cocomelon,Maybe I’m in the minority but I actually liked 1899
Cocomelon,"It’s too bad that this cancellation is getting celebrated as much as mourned.

Netflix allows projects to have inflated budgets but then hold shows to unrealistic standards. 1899 was the most expensive German series ever, an estimated $63 million for the first season. That’s a high budget for a cerebral science fiction/period piece with multiple languages. 

I’m very curious to what the viewership/completion of Dark, whose first seasons budget was $21 million. 

No doubt if 1899 was in the $20-30 million range that we’d be getting 3 seasons."
Cocomelon,"I posted this the other day on a similar thread: 1899 would have succeeded had it been released weekly rather than in one go. 

Like Lost - who’s creators say would fail on Netflix - 1899 needs time for viewers socialise the show, have conversations with colleagues, light up the sub Reddit on theories etc

While full series binge watching has been great for mindless viewing, it doesn’t work for shows that need reflection and contemplation"
Cocomelon,"I watched 1899 and went from initially intrigued to somewhat hooked, to somewhat annoyed, to ""this doesn't make any sense"" and finally appreciative of the ending, but I could see how some people never made it all the way through."
Cocomelon,"They look at three things primarily:
1. Cost of production, this one was high.
2. Viewership, this one was high, they marketed it a lot and paid for big names so not shocking
3. Decline in viewership per episode, where this one stumbled. People who started it mostly didn’t finish it - sure the market probably brought in some mismatched audience, but that decline means that most people who tried it didn’t like it that much. By the end of the season it was looking far less popular which made it difficult to justify cost wise.

Personally the ending viewership was still decent and I suspect the decline is steeper among heavily marketed shows like this, and I think Netflix should pay for more series finales so series in the library retain more value as ‘complete’, but I kind of get it."
Cocomelon,i will never start a netflix show when it is new. i wait till all seasons are there and start then.
Cocomelon,I loved this show. One of the best that has came out recently. I dig shows like this. Very disappointed with the cancelation.
Cocomelon,"I didn't hate it, but it didn't captivate me."
Cocomelon,"> If Netflix does want people to finish their series in less than one month, they would be wise to space up big releases to give the audience time to consume multiple original productions. Unfortunately for 1899, the series didn’t even have a full week before the release of Wednesday. 1899 came out on November 17, while Wednesday followed on November 23. 

I know a few people who said thinks like “I don’t have the mental energy to watch something like 1899 while I’m trying to deal with the holidays.” or just weren’t watching as much in general because of being crazy busy with holidays and end of the year stuff. 

Wednesday was easy to watch while wrapping gifts or folding laundry and doing something else that has to get done. 1899 required *full attention* given that it was a complex show that also included subtitles! 

Netflix definitely set it up to fail if it was measuring against those metrics."
Cocomelon,Reddit is such an echo chamber it’s hilarious. It’s baffling that people can’t comprehend that a show they liked did not do that well lol
Cocomelon,"It might not even be about what gets cancelled, more like what doesn’t get cancelled….. some really terrible shows that continue to get green lit"
Cocomelon,"Viewership metrics mean fucking nothing.

Completion rates are what matters.

You don't renew a show that no one bothered finishing.

Just as it was in the last hundred fucking million threads with this exact same uninformed shit take, just as it will be in the next hundred million."
Cocomelon,"From Wikipedia:

“The budget for the series was at least €60 million ($62.2 million) with €2 million coming from Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg,[7] €10 million coming from the German Motion Picture Fund,[8] and Netflix investing €48 million in the project. 1899 is the most expensive German television series of all time.[9]” 

Can we please try and crowdsource season two? Lol anyone have 62mil?"
Cocomelon,Loved this show gutted it’s finished
Cocomelon,"30% retention rate.

That’s an issue more advertising or more viewers won’t fix"
Cocomelon,Netflix treats their originals like YouTube videos: just push out as many as possible hoping a couple go “viral”. If you’re not the next Stranger Things then you’re fucked
Cocomelon,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, again"
Cocomelon,"I started this show and paused after ep 1 with the intention of coming back to it because it was so complicated I wanted to actually have time to pay attention. 

I guess Netflix thinks the show is a failure if a lot of people do that?"
Cocomelon,Apple TV is King. Netflix is worst. Everything else is somewhere in between.
Cocomelon," All the shows I found and were subsequently killed by Netflix in 2022

1899. Warrior nun. Midnight club.  The imperfects. Blockbuster. Space force. Archive 81. Another life. 

I have literally just cancelled my subscription."
Cocomelon,Collider has become such a terrible platform. Sad how shitty its become. Just an awful aggregate machine with 0 soul or personality.
Cocomelon,"Reddit will never learn that they're in a bubble. The show didn't fare well with the majority of the users, it had a 30% completion rate, it was super expensive to make and it just wasn't that popular."
Cocomelon,How many people started it and dropped it when they realised it was a multi language show?
Cocomelon,"I never watched it, but now I’m really considering ending my subscription. My 12 year old subscription. Not because Netflix can’t create quality content… I know they can. But they also fail to understand that I might have watched 1899, but put it off for the very fact that they’re a streaming service. I don’t watch stuff right when it comes out. I watch it when I want too."
Cocomelon,"Is it worth watching the first season, even though there won’t be a second season?"
Cocomelon,1899 seems to be getting a lot more media attention for its cancellation then all the other shows that have been cancelled from streaming platforms in recent years. I wonder why.
Cocomelon,[deleted]
Cocomelon,"I’ve truly never been this upset with a cancellation of a show. I’ve been constantly begging my friends, family and coworkers to check this out and now I feel like a fool.

This is the first show I’ve ever advocated for in this way. Sure I’ve recommended other shows and films but this one is on a different level.

The best show of 2022 in my opinion and that’s tough to say because a lot of great shows came out last year. 

Truly a shame"
Cocomelon,"The writer of this article hit the nail on the head. The decision makers are actively running this company into the ground.

Forget subscription fees and password sharing… if this company can’t even keep its own successful shows funded, what is the point of watching another original? 

Quality is the only thing this company has going for it and clearly that aspect has slipped away"
Cocomelon,"I almost feel like 1899 was used as a sacrificial lamb for more viewers. Up until it was cancelled I did not see or hear anything about it, it was completely off my radar. Now that it's been cancelled there's news articles everywhere. They're getting loads of free advertising all of a sudden."
Cocomelon,"Did you read the article Reed Hastings & Ted Sarandos??  

We, your customers are getting sick of your start/stop crap on quality shows.  Want to know why you lost so much money in 2022, it’s not from password sharing, it’s lack of quality.  Kill your algorithm or at the very least fix it !  Most people, who work, can’t “binge” a show like a 15 year old without a summer job !"
Cocomelon,"I was on episode 4. I'm not continuing. I have no confidence that the mysteries will have a satisfying pay off in the first season. Saving myself the disappointment. I still miss Raised by Wolves, that one hurt. 

How fast are we supposed to consume these shows? It's kinda crazy how fast they deem a show a failure. Let it find its audience. Word of mouth is a real thing."
Cocomelon,"Too many excellent Netflix shows, particularly genre shows, have been canceled after one season. With the cancelation of 1899 they’ve guaranteed I’ll never risk watching a new show on Netflix. I’d say I canceled them, but the truth is they’ve canceled my willingness to support them. That’s $19.99/month to split between other streamers. 🖕"
Cocomelon,Give these shows a chance dammit. Just had a few people recommend 1899 to me and now I see no point watching something unfinished with only one season.
Cocomelon,Who’s all posting these; y’all really liked 1899? I couldn’t get into it myself
Cocomelon,The show was only okay. The writers thought they were a little smarter than they were.
Cocomelon,"So basically what I should be reading between the lines and loosely at is that there may be a chance of someone else somewhere down the line would and could be interested in picking it up?

Seems there is a demand for it, and everyone involved (save Netflix) is on board to continue so maybe I’m just being hopeful; but it would be nice."
Cocomelon,Damn I wanted to finish this series.
Cocomelon,"The taste clusters just weren’t there, apparently"
Cocomelon,"Seriously WTF Netflix, this show is incredible"
Cocomelon,"I've stopped watching ANY original Netflix series. Because they almost always cancel series early or mid-way, I'm not even wasting a second of my time on anything Netflix produces for series.  This cancellation validated my choice."
Cocomelon,"New New Year resolution:

Do not watch Netflix series! It will be cancelled"
Cocomelon,The only metric I see from Netflix is that only the shows that create trends on Tiktok since day 1 are renewed.
Cocomelon,"I wonder if another network/streamer can pick up future seasons.

Anyway I suspect based on the ending that this show had a big chance of turning into something very unlike the first season (mystery, period piece) and so there might be some apprehension."
Cocomelon,"I mean, how else will they fund “Too Hot to Circle your Cake Brother”?"
Cocomelon,"Speaking as an adult with a full time job and responsibilities, I have a limited amount of discretionary time. Sometimes I intend to watch something but don't have the time immediately. Ya know, something like a heavier workload at work or the holidays pops up and I don't watch a show I think i'd like for a while. Then it gets cancelled before I even gets a chance to see it and now I just don't bother. It's pointless."
Cocomelon,"Fuck this is annoying. I really enjoyed 1899. Great slow burn. Very confusing, just how it should be. Stupid Netflix"
Cocomelon,"It’s like they misread the signal of people watching background noise TV working from home during the pandemic and decided to abandon quality tv. Seeing Warrior Nun getting canceled reminded me that Netflix is no longer investing my subscription into the well-written, diverse stories that prompted me to join 10 years ago so I canceled"
Cocomelon,Netflix ducking sucks. What a n incredibly stupid decision. I hope prime or Apple picks it up
Cocomelon,"“I am upset by a cancellation of a show I liked”

Brigade of Redditors: “actually here is why you are wrong and praise be to Netflix”"
Cocomelon,"There was no surprise, that show was boring."
Cocomelon,"Fuck you Netflix, I was really enjoying this.

As usual, they're pandering to the brain-dead simpletons and continuing the basic, predictable nonsense. God forbid you should have to use your noggin' once in a while."
Cocomelon,"This is actually one of the shows i agree with cancellation, ive yet to come across a single person i know who liked this show.  The reviews aswell is kinda telling."
Cocomelon,"Why should I bother getting into any Netflix show that doesn’t already have an ending, if they cancel most of their content?"
Cocomelon,"I love that they are begging people to stop paying them for their services with these actions, ""don't share your account"" , ""oh everyone liked that show?? too bad its canceled now"""
Cocomelon,"If you're gonna use the phrase ""throwing shade"" at least fucking use it right."
Cocomelon,"trouble is you want shows that are foot long subs   


and netflix only makes shows that are sliders, single hamburgers at best"
Cocomelon,Netflix has entered the TLC model of instant trash gratification which absolutely harkens the demise.
Cocomelon,"Netflix needs to start advertising shows, that aren’t just Wednesday and stranger things"
Cocomelon,"Netflix has come full ⭕️ in becoming the brain dead network boards that cancel anything with half a plot and story. Good job, they’ve become the villain but worst cause they hog the rights, fk up the s1 and run. Leaving fans behind. 

The only reason I got NF was because they rebooted Arrested Development"
Cocomelon,Netflix is going to end up being TikTok.
Cocomelon,Yet Emily in Paris gets renewed.
Cocomelon,Noooooo!  Dark was so so so good. Was really wanting to see where this story went!  😫
Cocomelon,I don't know anybody that binges a series immediately when it drops. People have other stuff to do besides watch tv. And cancelling shows just further incentivizes waiting.
Cocomelon,"Solid article.   


With 1899 it seems the type of show that was bound to not have huge numbers but get numbers over time. Netflix seems to just go by numbers and not much else. 

&#x200B;

Also why the rush to cancel it??? There are people who have not watched that wanted to...but now will not because the show got cancelled!!"
Cocomelon,Oh man I was actually waiting to watch it with my boyfriend. I guess its a waste of time now
Cocomelon,"If they didn't cancel it, it would just be reinforcing more shitty, plot holed, uninspired stories than ever before.   


The vast majority of people would not have cared for season 2. We're really listening to a loud, tiny fraction of people complain the cancellation."
Cocomelon,I didn’t even watch this show and yet it made me want to cancel Netflix after 2 years of defending it because no show is safe anymore. I watch Too Hot To Handle with my wife and while we enjoy the drama I can’t believe it has 4 seasons…4 seasons of the same shallow shit. Just makes no fucking sense.
Cocomelon,I think a weekly release schedule for 1899 may have helped as it allows people to discuss theories.
Cocomelon,Netflix is shooting their own foot… I love it
Cocomelon,It was total trash. “Let's take some dark/gothic/mysterious pictures and characters. Cliche - even better. Let's add some evil-looking kids. And time traveling. And a murderer. Well... Have no idea what to do with this shit” - that was my impression after watching this trash show.
Cocomelon,I thought this was another Yellowstone prequel.
Cocomelon,"My rule for the last year or so has pretty much been ""don't start watching until season 2 is renewed.""

Thing that sucks about this one is season 2 _was_ renewed! Guess I'm just not going to watch any shows until they're completed. Hope Netflix likes that."
Cocomelon,"Look people, 1899 was an extremely expensive show that a large majority of people did not have an interest in finishing. That can't be reconciled. There's no reason for Netflix to greenlight another season when there's no confidence that it will help them make money at all. 

Me, my buddy, my dad, all of us couldn't get past the second episode."
Cocomelon,Makes it easier to cancel Netflix when I get around to it.
Cocomelon,"> the show was nevertheless one of the best releases of 2022, pleasing both critics and fans

Was it?

We're huge *Dark* fans but I didn't even start this after reading reviews and not seeing a single forum post or Reddit post saying anything other than that the show was a confusing mess with an absurd language rotation.

But this is also why I'll never, ever watch the first season of one of these shows when it lands. Kinda like I won't start a giant fantasy book series before it's done now that GRRM and Patrick Rothfuss have proved you can just stop halfway through."
Cocomelon,"Fuck Netflix. 

https://youtu.be/ktAbh39aoU8 (Barry S3 spoilers)"
Cocomelon,"fuck sakes, not again. To hell with netflix?!


i loved dark, was so excited about 1899, not only for being similar to dark but because i love gritty 19th century stories and several of the actors they chose  for this. 

I only didnt start it yet as i thought it would get a season 2 in 2023, as 1 season is obviously not enough to properly develop this.

if at least netflix would give the fans of cancelled shows a movie to at least minimally tie  up the story, as they did with sense 8.

but no, just a big FUCK YOU to anyone interested in watching more complex and niche series and movies. 

complex and deeper shows with substance are becoming rarer by the day, and they usually get abruptly cancelled after 1 or 2 seasons. Everyone knows they will never have the viewership of Game of Thrones or Stranger Things why even bother making them if money is all they care about??? 

i also have no reason to get a netflix subscription of my own when they start with the password bullshit, there is hardly anything interesting on netflix worth watching nowadays

 MEH"
Cocomelon,"I didn’t watch but I heard it was actually really well done.. it keeps happening with “good shows” over there.. yet shows like “Ginny and Georgia” which are objectively dog shit get renewed.  Shit, “Sweet Magnolias” is getting a 3rd or 4th season which is mind boggling considering how great “Mind Hunters” was.. I’m glad I don’t pay for that subscription honestly"
Cocomelon,"No one finished the series because it's not a good show.

Reddit is a hivemind."
Cocomelon,"Netflix is going to end  up killing their streaming service through these policies. We can say it won’t happen, but who would have thought MySpace would be the has been to Facebook? Or yahoo would lose market share to google? Just because you are first to market, doesn’t ensure long term success. Also Netflix is suffering from other streaming services pulling back their IPs. Look at all of the secondary Marvel programs that Netflix lost to Disney+. Netflix needs original content to survive, but canceling programs will lead to skepticism amongst subscribers that the show will receive a second season. This policy will further perpetuate lower viewership for new and even existing programs. Take the Warrior Nun, great first season waited through the pandemic for it to return. It returned at the start of the holiday season, by time we got a chance to sit and watch it had already been cancelled. Why waste our time even watching season 2 at that point. Instead went to prime and began watching a series.  Had Netflix been in charge of programming then Seinfeld would have been canceled after just 8 episodes."
Cocomelon,"I feel the only reason 1899 would have been renewed was becasue they trusted the show runners and had a relationship with them. I feel like season 1 was a bit of a dud, especially with the general audience."
Cocomelon,Nah not surprised. Excellent (and expensive) production quality but writing is bad.
Cocomelon,"Its ridicilous. You can not put all decisions into AI statistic tools.   
Netflix is a total shitshow right now"
Cocomelon,I honestly hated the show
Cocomelon,"> **The most obvious metric of success used by Netflix is the number of hours viewed.** So, if a movie or series has enthralled subscribers longer than other productions, they are considered successful. **However, things are not so simple, as Netflix limits its analysis for a short period of time and seems to take into account completion rates when deciding if a show should be renewed.**

> **Every time Netflix reveals a new production broke viewing records and entered the streamer's permanent top-10 chart,** as recently happened with Glass Onion: A Knives Out Story and Troll, **it’s actually measuring viewership for a period of 28 days.** [...] So, **to be successful, an original production must catch the public’s attention immediately.**


> On top of all that, **it seems like Netflix values completion rates more than the raw number of hours viewed. For instance, in the months that followed The Sandman’s release, Neil Gaiman used his Twitter account to tell fans they should binge the whole thing as soon as possible if they ever hoped for a series renewal.** As Gaiman said at the time, Netflix is “looking at ""completion rates."" So people watching it at their own pace don't show up.” While the company has never made a statement about its use of completion rates, that enlightening behind-the-stage whisper helps us to understand why 1899 was canceled and how ultimately Netflix set the series up for failure.


> **If Netflix does want people to finish their series in less than one month, they would be wise to space up big releases to give the audience time to consume multiple original productions.** Unfortunately for 1899, the series didn’t even have a full week before the release of Wednesday. 1899 came out on November 17, while Wednesday followed on November 23. Surprising no one, Wednesday became an instant hit, holding the first position of TV shows viewership for weeks without an end. And as a side effect, 1899 lost traction."
Cocomelon,"What people fail to understand is that Netflix doesn't care much about how many views the show has.

Netflix cares about how many new subscribers the show/movie brings to the platform, that's the deciding data. 1899 did not bring the amount of new clients and the show is expensive, so it's out."
Cocomelon,"The quality of Netflix shows has largely nosedived but as long as viewers watch whatever trash they throw their way, it won’t care."
Cocomelon,...wha...?  Not a surprise to MOST NETFLIX VIEWERS who never heard of the show or never had an interest to watch it
Cocomelon,"Netflix is not very smart about considering the medium they are seemingly mired in. They are running the company like they are still stuck in the mid-20th century boomer-paradigm... because they are. Streaming movies and shows at home is the kind of medium that DEPENDS UPON, and thrives off of sharing and word-of-mouth. It is a shared experience, inside the house, across town, on a national, sometimes global scale. It should be a model that builds upon the inertia and goodwill of their accumulated cultural-momentum, which is in-turn generated and sustained by the cultural-engagement/discussion, meme-culture, fandom, etc arising from whatever hit-series they subsequently cancel after 1 or 2 seasons. 

So they killed account-sharing. Whatever, that was a loss-lead. Major dumb-asses. Now they have an Ad-tier. Everyone from gen-xers on down to wayward tik-tok illiterati... WE EFFIN HATE commercials. We RESENT them. It's like the moronic GM's at major-grocery chains. The plain flavor of seltzer is always hulk-smashed out of existence, always out, and it has become my personal running nuisance/inside-joke. The aspartame-warped, Boomer-Mind, has *decided* that millennials *want* all these dumb-ass flavors, waaay over-stocked, that clearly none of us are buying (it's the same in every chain). The most profound and detrimental thing to Netflix's existence, is their seeming inability to grasp the innovative vitality of *THEIR OWN* business model... understanding that their currency *WAS* primarily the cultural-zeitgeist that arose because of the transformation of how we consume and access entertainment. 

Finally, they are pissing off and turning off their most important demographic... that is millennials and zoomers, who are now taking over the lion's share of the market. Out with the old, in with the new! It's probably worthwhile to examine the possible effect that boomer-shareholders might have on the current direction/downward spiral of netflix... It is not even ironic that they are flailing, while trying to establish an entrenched presence based off of worn-out boomer concepts and rigid-moronic idealism. Somebody needs to get their boomer mitts off a thing they clearly do not understand at the fundamental core-level, if it is not too late. Good, reliable, sustainable content CANNOT, SHOULD NOT, be dictated from the top-down by some clueless sociopathic CEO. It should be driven by the artists, writers, and content creators. Give *THEM* the budget and leave them to their work. Law of the jungle i guess."
Cocomelon,Totally not cancelled because it sucked
Cocomelon,"Netflix is a joke. 

Most companies are though."
Cocomelon,"Netflix is bound to be the worst of the big streaming companies. They do not give time to more nuanced series to shine. I feel like if Stanger Things released its first season today, it would be cancelled. Sad"
Cocomelon,It sucked.
Cocomelon,"Not shade *at*, shade *over*"
Below Deck,They sure know how to milk this stuff…
Below Deck,Looks like hot garbage.
Below Deck,More shit for my wife to watch and me to hate on.
Below Deck,[deleted]
Below Deck,"She's just a ray of sunshine, and her stews already seem fun."
Below Deck,This show is mad addicting.
Below Deck,"If TLC can have a version of 90 Day Fiance on their schedule all year round, why can't bravo do the same with Below Deck?

I don't like the spinoffs as much as I like the originals, but I'll still watch them"
Below Deck,It's such trash but I can't stop.
Below Deck,Seriously? I can totally resist watching the marathons of past seasons they play on Bravo every single week. Not. What the fuck is wrong with me. How many times can I watch that damn show.
Below Deck,"Yeah, it happens to be the only show I watch on DVR. But I can’t get enough."
Below Deck,"Hate to say it, but production of Below Deck is ten times harder than 90 Day Fiance.  Shoots are time sensitive with a huge number of crew and guest cast, all crammed on 3/4's of an already cramped vessel.  The schedule clock is rapid, 24 hour, and unrelenting.  It's subject to a panoply of health and safety and weather conditions.  There's little to no ability to reshoot, as time, light, people, uniforms, even food all conspires to control continuity.

Compare to 90 Day Fiance which is almost entirely interview-based and can be easily scheduled.  It's entirely scalable, just have a trio of production crew available wherever there's a couple.   You can shoot an unlimited amount of couples in various locations on different schedules and weave them into a season however works best.  Deadlines and timelines are largely fluid and malleable.

To scale a Below Deck show, you first need a yacht, which is hard enough.   You have to find one good enough to portray as a ""super yacht"" but it also has to bad/old enough that someone is willing to let you trash it for several weeks of filming and be operated by people who you would normally not let polish the stern let alone captain it.  You have to tear it up, wire every inch, and turn the master stateroom into a television control room.  You have to convince the owner to leave whatever dignity and reputation that vessel's name carries to be sullied by cereal box captaincy and the sex and intoxicant-fuelled antics of narcissist performers.  

Then you need to coordinate 10 performers plus several dozen guests plus several dozen crew, and every single person and event has to be scheduled down to the minute.  

90DF needs... a rental apartment.  Maybe clearance to shoot in a bridal shop or a restaurant.

It's not impossible to add a Below Deck spinoff.  I'm just saying it's ten times easier to chuck together a season of 90 Day Fiance."
Below Deck,MTV has 52 weeks of Teen Mom too
Below Deck,"And 1380 minutes a day of  Ridiculousness.

Below Deck,Interesting that he watched Formula 1: Drive to Survive. Would not have pegged him for a racing fan but maybe he just likes documentaries.
Below Deck,I have to admit this show is one of my guilty pleasures. I don't watch any other reality shows except this and I don't know why
Below Deck,I have tried to watch this a couple of times and I just didn't get into it.
Below Deck,"Compared to all the other ""reality"" shows on bravo it really at least feels genuine. I watch it all the time and It really feels like a glimpse into the everyday of a unique job. The last season had one of the crew almost die and the cameraman jump in the water to help him. The show seems legit to me and I love it.

Edit: Also I don't see how its a ""dramedy"", reality show/quasi-documentary feels more accurate."
Below Deck,Paywall
Below Deck,We're not rich enough to read about yachts.
Below Deck,Hannah getting old. Time to replace her soon
Below Deck,"I would gladly pay to see an episode where the boat is attacked by zombies, or pirates, or zombie pirates. Most of the show’s “catastrophic drama” would be considered mild inconvenience in any other context."
Below Deck,"As big as bitch Kate is, at least she's so much better at the Chief Stew job"
Below Deck,she’s actually working this season instead of bossing her underlings
Below Deck,Below Deck is one of the best reality shows on television. It’s got a Downton Abbey upstairs/downstairs thing going.
Below Deck,"I have never watched any of these shows, sorry. I would have to ask my daughter. I think she would say *Bachelor in Paradise* but I could be very wrong."
Below Deck,Whomever Proctor & Gamble thinks will get people to watch their commercial
Below Deck,Survivor
Below Deck,Nope
Below Deck,[deleted]
Below Deck,I'd almost sit through 12 new seasons of Rock of Love before watching any of these.
Below Deck,"I will say, I watched Bachelor In Paradise for the very first time this year, and I was pretty entertained. So I'd say Bachelor In Paradise or 90 Day Fiance based on entertainment value."
Below Deck,"I would hope *Below Deck* because it's nowhere even close to as trashy as all the other nominees (looking at this list it sticks out like a sore thumb), but maybe that's what the people who vote on these things would want."
Below Deck,90 Day Fiance
Below Deck,Fair.
Below Deck,"Lmao. Seriously though, have you seen any of these?"
Below Deck,It’s not a nomination unfortunately
Below Deck,These are the ones that are nominated
Below Deck,Why not Real Housewives of ATL?
Below Deck,yes
Below Deck,I understand.
Below Deck,Which ones?
Below Deck,"Unfortunately 90 day and Below deck, not by choice"
Below Deck,Commenting just to let you know that I have absolutely *no* clue what you’re talking about. But good luck!
Below Deck,Care to explain what any of those acronyms are…?
Below Deck,Those acronyms are IPP and ECP which are abbreviations for in program pointer and end credits promotion
Below Deck,The Circle - surprisingly sweet and quite fun to get caught up in
Below Deck,I recently found out about The Great Pottery Throwdown and fell in love with it! Super sweet and cute and just a really relaxing and fun watch!
Below Deck,Great British Bake Off and Terrace House
Below Deck,"I really enjoyed Top Shot partly for this reason. There were one or two people that didn't get along but it was never a big part of it and most encouraged each other. I also thought that program looked gorgeous, probably because I live in a grey land."
Below Deck,Forged In Fire - I really love this one.
Below Deck,"I tend to think that the reality shows that are better and less dramatic are the ones that actually showcase an unusual talent. I'm a baker, not an unusual talent, and I find most cooking shows (particularly American ones) to be incredibly full of drama and BS. Cooking shows and people who cook are 10 a dozen. 

But when you get a show that showcases a less popular talent, the contestants seem more focused on displaying that talent than just trying to get attention for their loud personality. 

I like the glass blowing show, most of the British ones that came in the wake of Bake Off (A sewing one, a pottery one). I loved Jim Henson's Creature shop challenge."
Below Deck,"Million Pound Menu

It’s a British show & it’s like Shark Tank for restaurants. Available on Netflix. Nothing crazy & no forced drama. Investors choose restauranteurs who run a 3-day pop-up restaurant in Manchester. At the end of the 3 days the investors may or may not cough up their money. Host is a cool French dude."
Below Deck,"Only ones I watch are Pawn Stars, American Pickers, American Restoration. Occasionally Hardcore Pawn, but the bro and sis do my fucking head in lol"
Below Deck,"Face Off, the early seasons were my jam"
Below Deck,"[The Genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lng4dn1uAc), unlike other reality shows is not set on a remote location and features contestants meeting for just a day to play games.

[The Genius celebrates intelligence and ingenuity](https://whatnerd.com/the-genius-smart-reality-game-show-for-thinkers/) which is completely unheard of across the entire American TV industry.

Where other reality shows wallow in cringe and shallowness, The Genius shows class and smarts."
Below Deck,I like *Cops* and *Live PD*. Refreshingly free of made up drama.
Below Deck,"I tend to like competitive reality shows that highlight a skill or talent (I even watched knitting). *Making It* is my current favorite.

The only unstructured reality show I keep up with is *Married at First Sight.* Even so, I can only hang in with the first few episodes through the honeymoons and then I just read the discussion boards to see which couples are horrible and which stay together."
Below Deck,Fuckin love Top Chef
Below Deck,I survived a Japanese game show. Very little drama and you get to see people take part in the craziest games on Earth! You also learn a bit about Japan in the meanwhile. It's all on YouTube and it's worth a watch.

Below Deck,"I adore the actual baking! It's just the jostling to be the most interesting, hilarious character that I dislike."
Below Deck,"No, but they would work for that. I think *Cops* better than *Live PD* because *Live PD*'s host segments are too disruptive to the flow. 

For background viewing I like *Mystery Science Theater 3000*, football, and the kind of stuff they have on /r/SlowTV."

Those guys are a bunch of goofballs but they never fail to make me laugh."
Below Deck,Gossip Girl and One Tree Hill. I started watching them one day on netflix and loved them both.
Below Deck,"Felicity and gossip girl

Felicity is a beautiful series about a girl who finds identity and independence away at college in new York. Beautifully written, it's the first show  j j Abrams created. 

Gossip girl is a compelling story about absurdity rich kids with way too much power living and partying in the city  (plus an annoying gossip site cheeseily narrating"
Below Deck,"Nashville. I'm a lifelong Metalhead and I hate almost all Country music... except in this show. My Metalhead friends torture me about it, as I will refuse any Wednesday night plans so I don't miss it (Thursdays now with the move to CMT)."

The show is AWFUL, but my god the eye candy is fantastic and I get enough cheap laughs that it lightens my commute. "

Below Deck,"Supergirl. Dumb, but pretty"
Below Deck,"It used to be Suits, but it's fallen way below ""guilty pleasure"" now. It's unwatchable."
Below Deck,"Supernatural. It's just dumb fun. There was a lot of undeniably great stuff in the first 5 seasons (and in later seasons too, just a lot fewer and farther between), but even then, it was just something to put on when I'm too sleepy for something better.

That being said, I couldn't stomach any more of it after I finished season 9, although I have revisited some of my favourite earlier episodes a few times."
Below Deck,"Melissa and Joey, Hart of Dixie "
Below Deck,"I feel *really* guilty about this one but Keeping Up with the Kardashians. I hate incessantly seeing their names and faces on social media, bilboards, magazines, ads, etc. but the show can actually be pretty entertaining once you accept that most of the drama is created by the producers and editors if the show and that they're not actually the scum of the earth like pop culture portrays them to be. I know people who have wayy worse vices then any of them."
Below Deck,my guilty pleasure is like Hollyoaks and some other soapy shows.
Below Deck,"Forged in Fire. Im not normally a knife guy, but something about drinking a beer and watching that show is appealing."
Below Deck,Bachelor in Paradise. I even had a hard time writing that. :)
Below Deck,Definately Keeping up with the Kardashians and Especially Are You the One. Like I know that show is so fake and set up but I can't help but watch every episode.

I'm not from the UK, but kept reading about how popular the show ""The Great British Bake Off"" is. I had to check it out. I'm hooked. I can't bake to save my life and I'm trying to get off sugar. This show is like porn to me.

There's this cheesy online reality show I've been watching called ""The 20's"". It's produced by Beachbody--a company that makes workout videos. The show is about a bunch of 20-somethings living in the same house and competing to be the company's next big trainer superstar. It has the same ridiculous and predictable reality show tropes used from shows that aired, like, 10-15 years ago, but I find myself checking in each week. It's a total guilty pleasure."
Below Deck,"I used to watch all those gold mining shows set in Alaska.  But now they're getting repetitive, and they're trying too hard to ""create"" drama/conflict."

New School,This series was a really pleasant surprise last season. It got stronger as it went.
New School,Coming back September 21st!
New School,"Good, this show is great and realistic. Also a big fan of the creator, she called out everyone for making shows that regurgitate Twitter. Instead of making shows about people,  people problems."
New School,Just saw the elementary school exterior set on the Warner Bros backlot and it was huge — really thought they had filmed that on location!
New School,yes!!!! so excited :)
New School,"Is this show any good? I was visiting friends in LA recently and we decided to do the WB studios tour one morning, where this show is filmed, and they were pushing it HARD during the tour. The amount of times the tour guide mentioned the show was a little ridiculous."
New School,I call bullshit if more than 50% of the teachers at this school return.
New School,"I just finished the first season this evening and it has potential, but I can't get over how iffy the Principal and her actions feel. I get that she's the clueless boss character and while she does have some of the best lines, her actions don't feel quite as harmless as Michael Scotts"
New School,"This was a nice feel good show, despite the backdrop being a slightly depressing, rather real look at things. But it has optimism and heart."
New School,"Does it ever get less…bleak? I watched the first few episodes and I was enjoying it, and I found it funny, but at the same time, the realism of it all made it harder for me to appreciate the humor. I kept finding myself never in the right mood to watch it. I’d love to give it another go, but if it maintains that. Leanness, I may just not be in the right place for it yet."
New School,"And for a year-long season like ""old times"" sitcoms. Great to see that again now."
New School,thank you!!!!
New School,The struggles surrounding the school stay but for the most part the teachers end up coming with creative decisions to get over those hurdles and I think it's pretty aspirational overall.
New School,I found it very hopeful
New School,"There are a few obvious problems with this conceit. First, the pool of ""old-school"" players who haven't been brought back in the ""new-school"" era is very small, and the pool of those players who would be competitive or interesting are even smaller.

The bigger issue though is that the ""new-school"" mechanics are all built on top of the ""old-school"" ones, not replacing them. The metagame constantly evolves, but factors like tribe strength, group dynamics, social maneuvering, and vote awareness are all still imperative. This would put your hypothetical ""old-school"" players at an even further disadvantage.

I think an easy tweak to achieve your desired effect might be a return to more ""old-school"" mechanics for a season, but that seems pretty unlikely, and for me, it would be a bit of a step backwards because you're basically just handcuffing the players."
New School,"The old school people would be at a disadvantage bc they don't play the ""old school"" game anymore. It'd be like giving a boomer and a millennial the same job at an ad agency but making them run it like a modern day agency not one from the 70's.

I say just get rid of Edge of Extinction and bring in all new players."
New School,"What disadvantage would the newer players have then to counterbalance the older players not having these gameplay strategies?

It's a moot point anyway as the older players still watch the show and are fully aware of how it's played now, even if they didn't actively play it that way."
New School,"They should just stop doing episodes that need to get pulled when a school shooting happens. It's not going to stop. First time I heard it happens was the ""Earshot"" episode of Buffy back in Season 3."
New School,Did.. they think school shootings would stop?
New School,Finale? Didn't the season just premiere?
New School,You can already get it on pirate sites
New School,"Or just stop pulling episodes, period. A police show doing an episode on school shootings shouldn't be off limits. If people want to fix the problem, don't blame TV. Fix the source."
New School,If CBS tries hard enough!
New School,They could of aired it in the summer...which just ended and now kids are back in school.
New School,"Season 5 just premiered, season 4 finale was pulled"
New School,Airing it would be in bad taste and could be seen as a network trying to capitalize on a real-life situation. Better for it to be delayed than shelved.
New School,Pulled from where?
New School,"Yeah, true. I guess at least they're airing it now, so it's not like they shelved it permanently."
New School,From TV
New School,Didn't it already release?
New School,Not officially no
New School,Nick from New Girl
New School,"Dr. Jack Shephard - I know not a popular opinion. But there it is. The character with the most relatable backstory. Someone whose parent says something to shatter their self confidence at a young age and who spends the rest of his life trying to prove to himself that his father was wrong. And his character arc was the best IMO.

Saul Goodman - such an amazing character. It's impossible for me not to love him. Charismatic, funny, smart and irreparably flawed. A pleasure to watch.

Coach and Tammy Taylor.- my favourite married couple in all of television.

Larry David - a genius (the real Larry David). The character is just so OTP. There are times when he's 100 percent right but most of the time he's so cringe. Extremely entertaining."
New School,"1. Jimmy McGill - To take a comedic side character from Breaking Bad and have him become one of the most layered, tragic and nuanced characters on TV was unbelievable, and Bob Odenkirk’s performance was fantastic 

2. Walter White - Brilliantly written and acted, and an incredible character arc, such an brilliant character 

3. Tony Soprano -  what else needs to be said

4. Kendall Roy - Took me a while to get into Succession but so glad I did, Kendall is such a complex character and brilliantly acted

5. Kim Wexler - I loved her character in the earlier seasons but in the later seasons of Better Call Saul her acting and writing was unbelievable and she quickly became one of my favourite tv characters"
New School,"No particular order:

Jack Shephard (Lost)- because of his complete and convincing transformation from the start of Lost until the end.  A ""man of science"" to his core at the start of the show.  But events change him and by the end he is the antithesis of where he started, the ""man of faith""

G'Kar (Babylon 5) - another superb transformation over the five years of the show.  The way he goes from a place of anger and ambition to a place of forgiveness and seeking the greater good not just for himself but for everyone is a masterpiece of writing and acting.

Bubbles (The Wire) - I could probably find a half dozen characters from this show to include here, but for me its Bubbles that stands out.  And I guess there's a theme to my list, because once again its his transformation.  This guy's a junkie.  At the start of the show its difficult to imagine that he's not at rock bottom, but the show shows us again and again that he has so much further to fall.  But its when he truly hits rock bottom that he finds the strength to start crawling out of the hole he's made of his life and through a lot of work and soul searching, the redemption he seeks finally becomes his.

Vic Mackey (The Shield) - ok, this is probably the first guy on my list who doesn't really transform - he just keeps reaffirming what a terrible, terrible person he is, even in the rare cases where he's well-intentioned, each time showing us that he can, indeed, sink deeper.  Murder?  Violence?  Betrayal?  Just another day at the office for him.

Walter Bishop (Fringe) - another deeply flawed and superbly acted character who's past is revealed to include some choices he made that morally would almost be unthinkable.  Also a man haunted by his demons and mental issues that ultimately have a surprising origin, and a genius so complete that it literally has to be suppressed for his own good."
New School,"For whatever reason my favorites are always Frenemies or Bromances.

Raylan Givens & Boyd Crowder. Want to try and solve an unanswerable question? Who's cooler, Raylan or Boyd.

Odo & Quark. Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek because they let characters grow relationships together instead of just in service of the Captain, an none more than these two. So good. (Honorable mention; Bashir & Garak)

Shawn Spencer & Burton Guster. You know that's right. Maybe the best friendship ever put on screen.

Brian & Joe Hackett. Best friends, worst enemies, brothers, pilots... they were all of these things, and they had a real big sandwich.

Kakarot & Vegeta. God damn I love Vegeta always getting 1 up'd by Goku, and then getting pissed but not letting anyone else beat Goku so he can beat Goku only to lose to Goku and start all over again..."
New School,CJ from *The West Wing*.
New School,"1) Jay from Kingdom. Not only is he the only likeable character in the whole show but he's the most likeable I'm any series I've seen. He's kind, generous, thoughtful, hilarious, charming, loving, considerate and charismatic as fuck all whilst being a total bad-ass. Top notch acting too - definitely a show-stealer 

2) Villanelle from Killing Eve. I just find her absolutely hilarious and look forward to every scene with her. In terms of her acting, Jodie Comer is a real force of nature.

3) Ragnar from Vikings. I can't really put my finger on why, because he's clearly not a nice man, but he just has that raw charisma on-screen. His death was the death of the series for me.

4) Mike Ehrmantraut from Breaking Bad. Total badass who sticks to his morals. 

5) Jackson Lamb from Slow Horses. He doesn't look it, but he's just so fucking cool. He's amazing at his job and cares for his colleagues but doesn't let anyone know either of these things. Love his banter and put-downs. I wish to be like him when I'm older."

New School,"Mines:  

1. Walter White (BB)-- What cinched it for me was the final episode of BB when he admitted to Skylar he did what he did for himself and not the family. 
2. Tony Soprano (Sopranos)--  His moral complexity throughout the entire show including the dream episodes/sequences.  
3. Gemma Teller (Sons of Anarchy)-- Lady MacBeth realized on Television though ironically Jaxx is more like Hamlet. 
4. Vic Mackey (The Shield)-- Yes, per the other 3 above... I have a type but what he did through the series, some messed up shit but you also couldn't help but watch 
5. Larry David (Curb Your Enthusiasm)-- Despite me thinking he's a schmuck. I just can't stop watching"
New School,">  And his character arc was the best IMO.

There are a lot of characters I like more than Jack, but the more I watch LOST, the more satisfying his character arc is. Jack's philosophical conflicts with Locke are so interesting to see played out"
New School,"Agree about Jack.  If ""daddy issues"" are one of Lost's themes, he has the biggest of them all, and he's tortured time and time again by them, only getting the resolution he so desperately needs at the very, very end.  And he also has the biggest, most sincere transition of any character on the show, from hard core ""man of science"" at the start to a true ""man of faith"" by the end."
New School,"How dare you ignore Turk and JD from Scrubs, to me that’s the best TV friendship ever (tho Shawn and Gus are great too)"
New School,YES
New School,Clara was zero-dimensional in season 7. Her arc in seasons 8 and 9 is soul-crushingly masterful.
New School,The best interactions on the show are between Locke and Jack IMO.
New School,"Joey and Chandler from Friends
Abed and Troy from Community
Aziraphale and Crowley from Good Omens"
New School,"I do like Turk and JD, but Shawn and Gus are just better and putting both of them on the list just make that obvious"
New School,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
New School,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
New School,This was a great read.
New School,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
New School,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
New School,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
New School,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
New School,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
New School,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
New School,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
New School,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
New School,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
New School,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
New School,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
New School,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
New School,Delta state was the shit!
New School,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
New School,Dragon Ball was on YTV
New School,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
New School,It was on both actually
New School,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
New School,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
New School,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
New School,"“One of the most groundbreaking shows I’ve ever seen, 7/10.”"
New School,"I loved the first few episodes, but they rushed to slap together an “Avengers-level event” for her to defeat that ended up being pretty lame. I would’ve loved to see more of her day-to-day family life and trying to thwart a few “street level” crimes and whatnot. That said, I get that they had a lot about the character that they wanted to establish with only 6 episodes, but the pacing was kinda bad in the latter part of the season. I’d still put it at an 8/10 though just because of how much I liked the character and her family/adolescent struggles."
New School,"My father, who just recently passed, was a geography teacher and when we were kids every once in a while he would bring home some of the films he showed in class and one of those was Blue Men of Morocco.  It was a travelogue style film but I always was curious about the difference in cultures and that was one of the starts and Ms. Marvel took me back to that time.

Ms. Marvel as well as Wandavision and Hawkeye were my favorites on the Disney package."
New School,I like how >!Zoe ends up nice the entire time with Kamala  having been more of a bully.!<
New School,"If you like the show, I would recommend the first run of the comics. The show gets everything the comic put out right. Kamala is just a loveable character. She is the adorable geeky little sister that everyone wants. MCU lucked out with finding Iman Vellani to play her. She was born to play the role."
New School,It took me to the second paragraph to realize I had misread the title and this wasn't about Ms. Maisel.
New School,"I thought the show started off really slow but finished strong.  Do I think it is ""groundbreaking?""  No.  But that is pretty much my opinion on all shows / movies."
New School,I thought the time traveling was weird.  Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson.  We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures.  I just want to see powered people fight.
New School,"It probably is groundbreaking in terms of providing a realistic portrayal of pakistani-american culture to a mass audience. Groundbreaking in the art form of making good TV shows, probably not."
New School,"""groundbreaking"" doesn't have to necessarily mean 10 out of 10 to be honest."
New School,He's probably a reviewer from 7GN*.
New School,It has flaws but it does feel like a gigantic step forward. You can really like something but be aware it has problems. Ms. Marvel gets so much right that while it does has some issues but those issues weren't enough for me to hate it. But I also can't say it's perfect.
New School,"You can tell at what point where the showrunner told the story they wanted to do and where Fiege came in to make the show fit in with the rest of the MCU. Because the Jersey part was so alive and well thought out. The Big Bad was almost an afterthought. Like you can hear the, ""Sigh....fine. Here are your MCU fight scenes. Now can we get back to Jersey already?"""
New School,They should have deleted the weird Clandestines storyline and made Damage Control the true villains instead.
New School,I'm definitely considering it now. Is there an app that has all the old marvel comics?
New School,The fact that Spidey is a New Yorker is a *huge* part of the character.
New School,">Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson. We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures. I just want to see powered people fight.

Um...okay. 

It's a show about a Pakistani American Muslim superhero. What made of that made you think we wouldn't at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?"
New School,How dare they expose you to other cultures and religions!!
New School,"But 7/10 ain't ""groundbreaking"" at all lmao"
New School,I mean wouldent that atleast warrant a 8 or 9.
New School,It's like why do these superheroes have to use super powers? Just focus on a teenage girl and her real life struggles not some comic book powers
New School,I mean they were. Kamala beat the aliens with TNJ
Space Force,"i think the worst part of this is never getting anymore of Lisa Kudrow’s character and the outrageous, horrible felony she committed but never revealed what it was"
Space Force,I’m annoyed because John Malkovic was fucking crushing it
Space Force,"Fred Willard was fantastic in this. In his few moments he absolutely stole the show and gave me the best laughs I’ve had in years. RIP.

[I crawled under the house, I didn’t tell anybody and no one knew I was under there.](https://youtu.be/mopK81w5_Tw)"
Space Force,"Honestly, this show was a huge disappointment.

They had Steve Carell, John Malkovich and Ben Schwartz starring and with Greg Daniels as creator? I expected something great. But the whole show was lukewarm at best and never reached its full potential."
Space Force,Boondoggle of a show. Hugely expensive and just not very good.
Space Force,"Kind of a shame, but not too surprising with the state of Netflix and how much it must have cost, even though season 2 clearly had a budget cut, and a shorter season. Didn't seem like they advertised it particularly well since a lot of people didn't even realise there was a season 2.

I thought it was going in a better direction with season 2, they toned down the absurdness of some of the characters, especially Steve Carrell, made them all a bit more likeable and relatable. There was less of the big budget space stuff, but less ambitious storylines. Less pointless side plots, but also less laugh out loud funny moments. It was an improvement overall and I think they could have improved on it, but for what it made up for in character development, it lost a little of the uniqueness and edge that it was trying for in season 1, and became a bit of a generic workplace comedy.

So I'm a little disappointed that we won't see what it could have developed into - Parks and Rec comes to mind as the obvious comparison, which took a big change of tone in season 2, but even then took a while longer to evolve into it's best seasons. Maybe Space Force could have been that given a bit more time, but maybe that was as good as it was going to get, and I won't mourn it's loss that much.

Also, kinda funny/sad to look back on the ending now >!where they discovered there was an asteroid heading to Earth. I guess that was the end of the world.!<"
Space Force,"This one was no brainer, Season 2 flopped hard in Netflix's numbers they release, and no doubt they're paying a lot for that cast. Probably should have been one season cancel."
Space Force,Does anybody else think they were relying on trump being president to keep season 2 funny? I reckon alot of the script went out the window when he lost.
Space Force,"The first season had some really funny bits.  The entire Lisa Kudrow storyline was so off-putting.  I think it was a giant drag on that first season.  The second season was definitely less ambitious but the ""we are family"" was an odd choice.  The contentiousness in the office in the first season is where it mined most of the comedy.  The original premise of the show was funny.  Clueless military leader makes idiotic decisions while team of brilliant govt scientists react helplessly.  Thats where the space chimp episode comes from.  They should have leaned into that direction heavily.  They could have done so much more with the exoskeleton episode.  

Its too bad.  I thought after the first season, the series would find its feet and become really good.  The pieces were all there."

Space Force,Even season one was kind of weird when they went to cringey places to try and make some kind of statement about polyamory. 🤷‍♂️
Space Force,"I remember watching the first couple episodes and thinking ""wow this is terrible"" surprised it made it past the first to be honest"
Space Force,"Amazing cast, but awful show. I wanted to enjoy it but it was poor use of amazing actors."
Space Force,"Wow, reading the comments so far..people didn't like it.

I thought it was pretty wholesome and the 2nd season was pretty good imo."
Space Force,One episode was enough for me. Comedies are supposed to be funny.
Space Force,"I hated the way it was retooled to make the characters more broad and much, much dumber."
Space Force,"> Netflix: “Pitch us your show, Daniels”

> GD: “Trump made this military division and called it Space Force”

> Netflix: “He sure did. And?”

> GD: “Comedy? Steve Carell maybe? That’s all I’ve got.”

Honestly surprised it managed two seasons."
Space Force,This just flat out was chuckle funny at best.  Not a surprise.
Space Force,"Makes sense. The first season was terrible, and the second had literally no buzz. Carroll was getting over $1 million per episode, and Malkovich couldn't have been cheap either, so there was no way this was getting a third."
Space Force,"At this rate, Netflix will have zero shows, hundreds of ads, and the inability to sign in from more than one location from the same account.

I’m sure that’ll encourage subscribers to come flooding back."
Space Force,"This was a weird one for me.  I couldn't make my mind up if I loved it or was indifferent to it.  At the very least, it had its good moments, and was helped by its quality cast."
Space Force,"Damn it, I had to wait too long for the second season FFS.

Now this?!"
Space Force,"It’s a shame. When it was announced I thought that the show had a lot of potential but the end result was just disappointing. I personally wanted a show in a similar vein as Veep since I feel like there’s a lot of material you could pull from about the defense industry. 

I could never figure out who the target audience for the show was. The satire wasn’t landing and it felt like they just didn’t want to offend anyone. The comedy was too safe and the current event stuff was already dated by the time the show was airing."
Space Force,This show wasn't good. I love Greg Daniels other work but this one didn't come together at all (for me)
Space Force,"Surprised to see so many people not liking the show. It's simple comedy but at least these one-dimensional characters didn't suddenly do out of character stuff just for the plot of the episodes, looking at you Brooklyn Nine-Nine."
Space Force,There was a second season?
Space Force,"The thing is this whole show was Ill conceived.  No cast or writers could save a show based on the premise of:

“LOL Trump made the space force!”

They did a good job of not making it about that, of course.  But it’s not like this was a show that someone had a grand vision for.  It was just capitalizing on a news cycle event that made us all laugh for 10 minutes."
Space Force,"The show is bland as fuck, reliant on happy go lucky story telling, and centered around a niche plot device. And yet everyone continues to praise Ted Lasso as if it’s different at all."
Space Force,Cue the people complaining about Netflix cancelling shows
Space Force,"Another day, another Netflix show canceled."
Space Force,"My understanding of this whole show is:

* trump announces space force
* Steve carrel gets high and calls Netflix and says, “I’m gonna create a show called space force”
* Netflix exec, who is also high, says, “sure dude. Here’s 100 million dollars “
* both of them get sober and realize this was a shit idea after all, but now need to produce a show."
Space Force,"NETFLIX - COME for the re-runs of House of Cards and Orange is the New Black! STAY for the, um, well, erm .... please stay? Pretty please?"
Space Force,"The series was ok, not too bad, but also not great. 

As for Steve Carell, will be waiting to see him in the upcoming series ‘The Patient’ on FX."
Space Force,That sucks. That was a fun show.
Space Force,"For one, I loved it. It was not ""hilarious"" but it didn't need to be. I liked the fact it was often bittersweet and Steve Carrell was really touching. 

Judging by the disappointed reviews, I suppose it was not marketed correctly. I stumbled on it without reading about it anywhere so I was not expecting anything.

This is for sure a cancellation that I'll regret."
Space Force,"This seems fair. It was a B- at best. Space Force was really only relevant under Trump. But if it was a sitcom on NBC or FOX or TBS, it probably would’ve gotten 11 seasons"
Space Force,I feel like every failed aspect of this show could be a kekw meme video. It was awful.
Space Force,"It's criminal that Archive 81 didn't get a second season, but Space force did."
Space Force,Thank goodnezs
Space Force,Shouldn't have been green-lighted at all. What a terrible series.
Space Force,"And people across the world responded with a ""meh."""
Space Force,"From watching the first season, I'm surprised there was a second season."
Space Force,"Good think I have not bothered with the season 2 yet. Annoyed at the misused rebellious daughter trope. Imagine despite heading a new department, your father the general still finds time to help you with your schoolwork and yet you still complain about being neglected.  You're not 9 yrs old.  
 
I was expecting more from this, but was so bland."
Space Force,"Can't say I'm surprised. Season 1 really didn't seem to know what it wants to be—military *The Office*, wacky astronauts in space, or family comedy-drama. It had some funny moments, but most of theme were worth a chuckle as most.

Watching Season 2, however, was like seeing someone try to resurrect a corpse of Season 1, Frankenstein-style. The whole cliffhanger with everyone stranded on the moon gets resolved offscreen, as does the conflict with China. What's left is a boring office romance that somehow gets the spotlight."
Space Force,Not sure if it gets any better but I watched the first episode with really no expectations.  Barely got through it.  Just wasn't funny at all to me.
Space Force,"Stupid show, who cares?"
Space Force,"While it was enjoyable, I was surprised that they got a second season."
Space Force,"I love Steve and most of the cast, but for whatever reason this was just not good. I hope Steve doesn’t give up on trying another sitcom"
Space Force,Why not after the pilot?
Space Force,I was starting to like this show and this again. maybe just stick with the classics and start a new show when it got like 6 seasons
Space Force,this show was so incredibly unfunny
Space Force,"This show was horrendous, poorly written, no story and absolutely unfunny."
Space Force,"The show was pretty toothless and disappointing from the get go. It was supposed to be a send up of the Space Force idea and government spending/waste but the biggest critique was “Lol Trump is dumb”, which we all knew by then. And then it did weird shit like make the AOC proxy a relentless bitch for Carrell’s character to lecture about why wasteful government spending is actually good."
Space Force,"People didn’t like it because:

A: it wasn’t funny 

B: it was a smug dig at Trump, and people are over that . And the space force of course is a good idea"
Space Force,"To me, the premise just never had any appeal. There isn't anything inherently funny or absurd about a separate ""Space Force."" All the memes and jokes people made about it on social media just revealed their ignorance about what was, in the short term, just a transfer of existing responsibilities of the Air Force to a separate branch. In the long term, the militarization of space is already ongoing and likely to continue, and I actually think the creation of a separate space branch was a prudent decision, one of few by the Trump administration.

However, I admit I never watched anything other than the trailer - not a big fan of workplace comedies in the first place."
Space Force,"I didn't really get why it got a season 2.

Like the entire premise of the show is to mock the guy who was not president by time they got a second season.

I only really watched it for John Malkovich and Steve Carell but it probably isn't the best vehicle for them. Carell seemed like a kid wearing his dad's suit in that role, it didn't fit him."
Space Force,[deleted]
Space Force,Garbage show. Shockingly bad actually
Space Force,"I watched the first few episodes and though it was terrible. Wasn’t funny, wasn’t interesting. Couldn’t tell who it was supposed to be for."
Space Force,[removed]
Space Force,"Thank god, so much comedy potential squandered."
Space Force,"Season 2 was unwatchable, so don’t blame them.  Every character’s storyline became even more boring in season 2, they wrote a sitcom and forgot all the jokes."
Space Force,"I literally just binged this last week. It’s pretty funny.
“It’s great to be black on the moon”"
Space Force,Was a horrible unfunny show.
Space Force,It should never have been commissioned. Utter trash.
Space Force,It was a horrible show so fair enough
Space Force,"Season 1 had its moments and was overall enjoyable.

Season 2 was an unfunny cringefest. I couldn't make it past the 3rd episode despite looking forward to it."
Space Force,"Oh No, What could be the reason?"
Space Force,Fuck yourself netflix. Bet they use this money on 100 more crappy reality shows
Space Force,Not a good show anyways
Space Force,"Given how many shows they are canceling or dropping altogether before they even air, I am curious to see what sort of direction Netflix is going to go in next. 

Honestly, if they put the majority of their eggs into reality shows which seems to be what they are doing lately, I can see Netflix slipping further down and down. It will be like how back in the 90's all those individual cable channels like The Learning Channel, Bravo, Discovery Channel had strong themes but eventually boiled to reality show channels ten to fifteen years later. Netflix has been putting out original shows for...what, ten years now? So, yeah, this could be the way they are going to which isn't good. But it also doesn't bode well to the other streaming services. Why? Because the business model for all the streaming services is flawed. You can't keep up a growing profit every year on a finite consumer number. There are only so many subscribers out there. And once you hit your limit, that's it. 

Times are going to be interesting for the next ten years when it comes to the streaming platforms."
Space Force,"I can't say that I'm sad, only that I can't remember the last time I thought on paper something was going to be a certain level of funny at a minimum and was totally let down."
Space Force,"What a shame. Looking at this entire cast even the supporting cast was all stellar. Even the creator is out of this world and the writing cast is full of stars that really had much more potential. 

Oh well."
Space Force,"Was a given after it only managed to chart in the viewership hours top 10 one week registering the equivalent of 3.8 million complete viewings on its best outing. All told it probably got around 7-10 million at best over 28 days. Absolutely horrific for what was probably a very expensive sitcom. THR report that Carrol alone was being paid over $1 million an episode. 

Archive 81 and Raising Dion s2 got canned after doing around 20 million over 28 days. Space Force had zero chance with those horrific numbers. Folks just had no interest in watching the second season. 

Next on the chopping block is Russian Doll. The second season failed to chart opening week. Absolutely horrible for a US Netflix original."
Space Force,Another half-baked Netflix show ordered to air too soon when it needed development.
Space Force,Good riddance. This show is complete dog crap
Space Force,"Not surprised. Season 1 was meh, but showed a little promise. Season 2 however, was an absolute dumpster fire."
Space Force,"I feel like *For All Mankind* was what this show should have been. A modern space race story during a new cold war between the America and China, but they basically fumbled the premise by making it a ridiculous and unfunny comedy."
Space Force,I actually liked season 2. Not surprised this was cancelled though. Especially since it was Netflix footing the bill.
Space Force,"The format is outdated, the Netflix bloodbath continues."
Space Force,"I’m trying to remember if I liked it or not, but I guess that speaks for itself…"
Space Force,Surprised it got a season 2 honestly.
Space Force,Damn it!
Space Force,Guess it’s not so good to be black on the moon
Space Force,Netflix finally cancels something that deserves to be cancelled.
Space Force,Nobody cares about propaganda anymore
Space Force,In related news I cancel Netflix after seven seasons
Space Force,I gave it a try but it really didn't amuse me.
Space Force,It was a decent show. Nothing special and it definitely could’ve been better but it wasn’t trash like a lot of the stuff Netflix pumps out.
Space Force,Wow how did this happened? Netflix never cancels shows after only one or two seasons. Shocking…😐
Space Force,No!!!!! I loved it!!! and i want to see what happens with the meteor!!!!
Space Force,Dammit! Another show canned *just* when the aliens show up…
Space Force,this show is an incomprehensibly bad missed opportunity
Space Force,Omg lol I forgot this show existed
Space Force,I cancelled it in my mind after 1.5 episodes
Space Force,It was a garbage show imo
Space Force,This show never could figure out it's tone. Was it funny or serious? It just never got a grove.
Space Force,"Lol, can't hold this one against them. Saw one or two episodes of season two and that was it. Who was writing this thing?"
Space Force,"Not surprising, it was made to poke fun at something that hasn't even had time to give them material yet and with Netflix making it you know they'll cancel it as soon as they can"
Space Force,Start wrapping up your stories at the end of every season guys!
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I don’t know how they made this whole video without mentioning any weird CIA/Mossad connections with her and her dad, and didn’t mention the book she was holding in the carefully staged/photoshopped in-n-out photo."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"She is suing the Epstein estate for not continuing to pay her a living wage, so the premise that she can't be reached is outdated or just wrong."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Cómo aún no la encuetran?
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,She’s the fucking devil.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"If you notice, no mainstream media outlet has ever spoken badly about the CIA/ FBI and there has never been a story that exposed them in the last 20 years or so. These guys are clearly bought off by the CIA/FBI ."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"That's fucking delusional lol. Seriously, did you research that claim at all? People like you seem to just pick what they *want* to be true, and then spout these sorts of ignorant, dumb comments. But please, explain how they're *clearly* bought off by FBI/CIA. Ill wait."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,found the fbi/cia agent
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"What examples do you have of a MSM outlet breaking an expose on our counter intelligence?

I don’t have proof, if I did I’d be making millions. But we have concrete proof that companies like Disney have been in cahoots with the FBI and CIA for awhile. Walt Disney was literally an FBI informants lol"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Shhhh. Im like... undercover bro.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"There's a difference between media doing (or not doing, rather) what your first sentence here describes, and being paid off *not* to report things they've found. You know that right? And if you make claims like that, It's on you to prove it... not on anyone else to refute them."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I understand that. Again, I can draw conclusions based off of circumstantial evidence in spite of not having concrete evidence as proof. The media conglomerates are monopolizing and merging into just a few amount of people controlling out information. It makes absolutely no sense that none of them call out the intelligence agencies. Why else would they not ? Unless you genuinely think they don’t have anything. ABC literally got bullied by the crown to not run a story on Epstein. NBC killed a Weinstein report by farrow because Weinstein pressures them. Do I have a smoking gun that oil lobbyists pay off most conservative outlets? No, but because they are so egregiously in favor of them it’s logical that they’re paid off. The same holds true regarding the Mainstream media and intelligence of agencies. As I said- companies like Disney literally have direct ties to the FBI and CIA and being incahoots with them to do business. Amazon and Google have insanely lucrative contracts with our intelligence agencies. Walt Disney himself made deals with them that would portray them positively in his movies. That’s enough proof for me. Maybe not for you, that’s fine."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"No, that was actually an interesting read. Certainly some shady stuff, but i dont think its *all* nefarious/evil things. I guess i shouldn't have started this conversation on such a hostile foot lol... shitty days as of late have caused me to lash out here just to... vent i guess. Cheers."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Haha all good mate enjoy ur weekend
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"But seriously, this heartbreaking documentary about Jeffrey Epstein and his victims might as well be an example of how detrimental and influential power can be. Throughout watching this thing and hearing them talk about the Ponzi scheme and all his investments, I still don't have a clear understanding of how Jeffrey Epstein made so much money he could buy a fucking island, or why the IRS wasn't all over his ass. The man literally avoided serious jail time back in 2008 because he seemingly had a U.S. senator in his pocket. Goddamn, I can't make this shit up. Watching this documentary makes you want to believe those crazy ass conspiracy theories you see on twitter about politicians and rich famous people. My heart goes out to all the victims of that sociopath. Also.... arrest Ghislaine Maxwell."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Ghislane was arrested like weeks ago
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"> .. or why the IRS wasn't all over his ass. 

Why do think the IRS should be all over his ass? There has never been any suggestion that he was not paying taxes."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,really? thank you!!! 👏👏👏
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Interesting to see containment show up.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,How about movies??
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,[deleted]
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Pandemic boost
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,He write it at the end of his post.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Last 100 days
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

Thank you for that other correction"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,[deleted]
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Had to stop reading that article. Only watched the first episode and it's already mind-blowing how it's beginning, I can tell he's just getting his footing in the predator game. And to see Ghlisain Maxwell involved so significantly from the get go is insane to know she's still out FREE."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"For me,  to truly understand how powerful and scary someone like Epstein could be,  it's best to look at it on a much bigger scale.   I think R. Kelly is a great example.   He wasn't born into some society that protected him where people naturally cover for you.   He developed his predatory behavior on his own, increasing as he got money and power.  Look at all the damage he did and how long it took anyone to take him seriously as a predator,  and recognize that he is basically an idiot that fell into it.   Now picture someone with 1000 times more power, influence,  and connections.   That's absolutely terrifying"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"The one that really broke my heart was Shawna Rivera.  No one should suffer this damn much in life.  And then to have a predator exploit those events, it’s sickening.

Right before his death Epstein transfers every dime to the Virgin Islands to skirt his victims.  Glad the pos is dead but how many other predators are out there?  My god."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,A sobering and sad documentary for sure but shout out to the lawyer who started a deposition asking if Epstein's dick was shaped like an egg.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,i'm so excited to watch this but it'll probably just end like the Aaron Hernandez series... Unsettling
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,[deleted]
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"If you're wondering how infuriatingly deep this hidden world of money and power goes, I suggest you read [Moneyland](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/07/moneyland-oliver-bullough-review). Also incredibly frustrating to read since it basically lists all the ways the ultra-rich scam people and countries out of money and get away with it.

It's not explicitly about Epstein but he is definitely someone who lived there."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Vile humans. When you harm a child, you harm their whole existence. I don’t mean it defines victims, I mean that it will always be a part of them. To harm young humans is seemingly not that serious when it comes to these vile creatures. The establishment is once again shown to be thoroughly and morally corrupt. Also shown to be a lesser news story. Humanity needs to stop fighting sideways and start fighting up."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Alex Acosta was proven by a federal judge to have conspired with Epstein against the victims. How the actual fuck is he not in prison!?!
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"1. Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi built a yacht in 1980 for $100M and sold it to Donald Trump for $29M in 1988

2. One of Adnan Khashoggi's nephews was Dodi Fayed, who was dating Princess Diana and died in a car accident with her in Paris.

3. One of Adnan Khashoggi's nephews was Emad Khashoggi, who built and sold the most expensive home in the world, the Chateau Louis XIV, to Saudi Prince Mohamed bin Salman. 

4. Emad Khashoggi sold his yacht in 1986 to Robert Maxwell, owner of the Daily Mirror and NY Daily News. Maxwell renamed the yacht ""Lady Ghislaine"" after his daughter Ghislaine Maxwell, longtime partner of Jeffrey Epstein.

5. Robert Maxwell was a super spy, working for Mossad, in elite London circles. He died by falling overboard from the ""Lady Ghislaine"" urinating while nude into the ocean near the Canary Islands.

6. One of Adnan Khashoggi's nephews was Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter, who was killed and dismembered in the 
Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul on the orders of Mohamed bin Salman.

Probably just rich people running in rich circles, but it is weird that all these are true."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Alan Dershowitz is sooo slimy.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,A limited hangout: tell a bit of the truth so they don’t ask any more questions becauee they think they have the whole story...when the total real truth is still hidden
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,something that strikes me with so many stories involving underage girls is how they are called prostitutes and written off as criminals. every underage “prostitute” is being trafficked if they’re not legally adults how are they criminals? it’s just a loophole to discredit victims. why isn’t coercion more of a crime than being trafficked?
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,What's the hold up why isn't Ghislaine Maxwell in jail? We can find osama bin laden rotting in a cave...we can certainly find and persecute this cunt!
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I’m not one for conspiracy theories, but it’s mind boggling how this guy gets taken down, he’s connected to so many high profile people - clearly is killed in jail to silence him, and all the evidence just gets buried. Talk about losing faith in the justice system.  
Where are all the investigative reporters?  Where is the fallout?  Just bury the whole thing and blame it all on the dead guy.  Damn."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"These sorts of productions forget the colder truths. These networks existed long before Epstein. To understand Epstein fully is to understand an abyss few dare look into. 

The key thing to take away is that Epsteins path was not happenstance, there are many ""Epsteins"" that fall under the same umbrella. Anyone who has glanced into the abyss will see that all things are connected via the fibers of the spider. 

What Epstein did, many do today, albeit most on smaller scales. These sorts of blackmail ops are par the course. The only fix is by making intelligence agencies legally accountable for intentionally failing justice for children. Many turn a blind eye simply due to the treasure trove of information that can be gathered. Blackmail, one of the oldest games ever played, still plays a prominent role in US politics. Who would a corporatist rather have as a legal superior of which it is criminal to make contracts prior to election with? Someone who may stab them in the back at any moment, or someone who you have compromising information on. 


If the embarrassment were to ever be released, we would never get to the end of that list."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Well doesn’t that just snap my neck.
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Today I learned that The US Attorney, Alexander Acosta, who gave Epstein a sweetheart plea deal was later given a cabinet position by Epstein’s buddy, Donald J. Trump."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Someone save me some time please. 

Is the Netflix series ""infuriating"" because it covers the material accurately, and the content is infuriating?

Or is infuriating because it does not cover the information accurately?"
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,[removed]
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"I binged all 4 episodes yesterday. Look at all the people who associated with Jeffrey. Donald Trump, Clinton, woody Allen,  kevin spacey, Harvey Weinstein,  allen dershawitz,  there all human  trash.

Jeffrey's girlfriend I forget her name, suck fuck she was too. So many victims who were so young. I'll never understand what attracks a 55 year old man to a 13 or 14 year old child? 

I was sickened by all the corruption and how money equals power and how jeffrey got away with things for so many years. I dont care if it was suicide or murder, just glad he can never victimize anyone anymore."
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Lawyer: ""Have you ever had sex with a minor in the virgin Islands""

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,“Terrific guy”
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,Everyone should watch the S4 finale of The Good Fight that was just released today. Episode deals about Epstein. Excellent television
Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,"Trump has been a Russian asset ever since he fell in to the Epstein honeypot in 1987.

>Giuffre, formerly Roberts, claims she was 15 and working as a towel girl at Trump’s posh Palm Beach club when she was recruited nearly two decades ago into sexual slavery by socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, then Epstein’s girlfriend.

https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/04/jeffrey-epstein-trump-lawsuit-sex-trafficking-237983

>Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl.
Radar Online reports that a woman in California, “identified” as Katie Johnson, filed a $100 million lawsuit against Trump on April 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old.
Johnson “claims Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family,” notes The Independent UK. “She claims the alleged abuse took place over a four-month period at underage sex parties held in New York City in 1994.” Epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats.

>Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”- article from 2002

2002-15=1987

http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/

>The first intimations that Trump might harbor a dark secret originated among America’s European allies, which, being situated closer to Russia, have had more experience fending off its nefarious encroachments. In 2015, Western European intelligence agencies began picking up evidence of communications between the Russian government and people in Donald Trump’s orbit. In April 2016, one of the Baltic states shared with then–CIA director John Brennan an audio recording of Russians discussing funneling money to the Trump campaign. In the summer of 2016, Robert Hannigan, head of the U.K. intelligence agency GCHQ, flew to Washington to brief Brennan on intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The contents of these communications have not been disclosed, but what Brennan learned obviously unsettled him profoundly. In congressional testimony on Russian election interference last year, Brennan hinted that some Americans might have betrayed their country. “Individuals who go along a treasonous path,” he warned, “do not even realize they’re along that path until it gets to be a bit too late.” In an interview this year, he put it more bluntly: “I think [Trump] is afraid of the president of Russia. The Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult.”

http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-collusion.html

>He stayed at the National Hotel in Moscow and during his entire trip was almost certainly under 24 hour surveillance from the KGB.
Kalugin, who headed the KGB’s branch of the First Chief Directorate, which was responsible for foreign operations and intelligence gathering, said that it was widespread practice at the time to use prostitutes to entrap foreign businessmen.
‘In your world, many times, you ask your young men to stand up and proudly serve their country,’ Kalugin once told a reporter. ‘In Russia, sometimes we ask our women just to lie down.’

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6041093/Trump-compromised-Russians-1987-used-Kremlin-DECADES-new-book-claims.html

>Trump’s first visit to Soviet Moscow in 1987 looks, with hindsight, to be part of a pattern. The dossier by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele asserts that the Kremlin had been cultivating Trump for “at least five years” before his stunning victory in the 2016 US presidential election. This would take us back to around 2011 or 2012.

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842

>It is a conclusion that even Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has appeared to confirm, saying in 2008—after the Trump Organization was prospering again—that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.”

Snowpiercer,"The season is already completed, but WBD is writing it off. It's currently being shopped to other networks."
Snowpiercer,">Tomorrow Studios will now shop the series to other outlets.

As long as Season 4 is aired somewhere, I’m fine with TNT not showing it."
Snowpiercer,"It's on Netflix in the UK and I imagine other regions too, hopefully they will pick it up."
Snowpiercer,Are they still on that train?
Snowpiercer,Remember when they said binning shows was done with? Turns out that was porkie pies!
Snowpiercer,"Why the fuck is this happening so often?

I’m not even a fan of this show, I’m just tired of seeing that studios have a completed project and scrap it.

It’s not fair to their fans and it’s a bizarre waste of money, time, and talent."
Snowpiercer,Glad Animal Kingdom got to wrap up it’s final season before Discovery took over.
Snowpiercer,"david zaslav is real piece of work isn’t he, totally killed HBO MAX, and all the while  fucking over the people who work BTS of all series he’s written off, so he can shovel more unscripted crap."
Snowpiercer,No surprised. But it would have been nice to see how it wrapped up
Snowpiercer,Is this show any good? I was watching the pilot but just couldn't get into it
Snowpiercer,I got Covid in Mexico and was stuck there in my room for 2 weeks.  I binge watched this as it’s on Netflix in Mexico.  It was awesome.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Snowpiercer,"I totally forgot about this show. I gave up 2 episodes into season 2, which took a year to get on HBO Max."
Snowpiercer,"I do hope they get the chance to complete the story. I suspect someone (Netflix?) will pick up S4, but is there more story to tell?"
Snowpiercer,I mean it is just not airing on TNT. Season 4 was also the last season in the series.
Snowpiercer,Netflix has the show here in Australia. Can it be released through them?
Snowpiercer,My surprised face
Snowpiercer,TNT! I'm dy-no-mite! TNT! Gonna cancel your favorite shows alright! TNT!
Snowpiercer,"I'll just ask. All these shows getting scrapped, why don't they just get leaked somewhere or why don't they just dump them on a free service or something. They want the write-off? Fine, just release it on YouTube or something. I mean why not? Maybe not as TNT or a brand name, but maybe allow the creators to release it. What would they be losing if they did that?"
Snowpiercer,"I liked this series, what a loss."
Snowpiercer,"Nooooooooooo, I love this show! Only getting better!"
Snowpiercer,"Even as a fan of Bong Joon-Ho and the original film, I've never watched this. It feels like it has gone on with very little fanfare. Is it any good? Anyone have any idea why this has flown under the radar it seems?"
Snowpiercer,"I fucking hate this trend. I don't even watch the show but that's just completely utterly fucked beyond comprehensible reason. WBD need to get their shit together and realize that what they're running is more than an average business, but a relationship with the world."
Snowpiercer,The last season was boring
Snowpiercer,TNT is still around?????
Snowpiercer,"I'm grateful that in this (rather rare) situation, they are able to shop it around, but that is the exception, not the rule.

I'm not sure I'll ever watch a non complete show again at this point, I just simply cannot trust ""them"" to allow the writers/creators to tell a complete story.

It was bad before, but now we have confirmed renewals, and in some cases *filmed seasons*, but greed is greed and yachts don't buy themselves, so it becomes ""more profitable"" to just toss all that into the garbage.

So much fucking waste."
Snowpiercer,"It's on Netflix here in Australia, and I believe everywhere but the US. Be good if Netflix picks it up in the US, gets a lot of steam behind it, and takes the story beyond four seasons. Be a good ""own show"" for them that already had four seasons and a fanbase."
Snowpiercer,"Fuck sake Netflix, not agai....oh wait."
Snowpiercer,"Fuck Warner bros discovery, doing this shit to already finished unaired seasons is fuckin bullshit."
Snowpiercer,Honestly shocked it got the 3 seasons. I cannot stand Daveed in the show personally
Snowpiercer,At this point I don't see how this shit doesn't eventually end with multiple guilds and unions striking over these blatant write off plays that are blatantly designed to save money by hurting actors and creators income streams with residuals and all that jazz.
Snowpiercer,Well I guess I don’t need to subscribe to TNT anymore
Snowpiercer,I still don't get why WBD doesn't burn off the shows completed before dropping scripted content.  Couldn't they still bring in more $ than selling it to someone else.
Snowpiercer,"Nobody wants to pay for the cgi or editing and it’s getting the full BatGirl, as a guess"
Snowpiercer,"But the new leadership said last week that was over. Apparently, they still haven't managed to close the financial statement."
Snowpiercer,this show got 3 seasons already?
Snowpiercer,This show managed to jump the shark every single episode starting in season 2
Snowpiercer,Shitty premise and shitty movie.
Snowpiercer,Already filmed and just scrapping it anyways? Someone's gotta buy it I'd think?
Snowpiercer,Is this show still good? I never made it past season one.
Snowpiercer,Nooooo. I loved this show!
Snowpiercer,Be a shoe
Snowpiercer,"Did connelly still in this show?

The last time i watch this show s2 ep8 and still not finish yet"
Snowpiercer,I don't mind. One of the only shows I've given up on.
Snowpiercer,I didnt finish the season after they wrote off the last best character from the show.
Snowpiercer,They really should've ended it with season 3 without that last scene. That was perfect already
Snowpiercer,I love this show.
Snowpiercer,Is this show worth watching? I've watched the original movie but heard bad reviews from this show...
Snowpiercer,"Ah yes, WB continues to WB."
Snowpiercer,"Damnit, hopefully it finds a landing spot so we can get it wrapped up"
Snowpiercer,"Noooo, i like that show"
Snowpiercer,"It was a great guilty pleasure watch, will miss it"
Snowpiercer,If its already completed why not release the season in one buy in package on Amazon or something.
Snowpiercer,WTF!?  Shooting is done.  Its a sunk cost.  What the fuck is TNT going to put up in its place that will make the network more money???
Snowpiercer,"The only scripted show that’s going to be left on TBS, TNT or TruTV is going to be Tacoma FD on TruTV."
Snowpiercer,"TNT to become a 24/7 ""Reality"" Show Re-run channel."
Snowpiercer,It’s not a perfect show by any means but it’s a fun ride. Jennifer Connolly and Sean Bean are just so fun to watch
Snowpiercer,Discovery is a virus.
Snowpiercer,I am so confused. If it's already been filmed.... the rest of the series is on netflix internationally so hopefully they can go there.
Snowpiercer,Honestly that was my first thought as well. The fact Miracle Workers has made it as far as it has is kind of a miracle in itself. Always felt like an after thought of a show despite its really good cast and concepts.
Snowpiercer,"It was supposed to premiere next Monday, January 16 but it's not on the schedule."
Snowpiercer,"Yeah I didn't think they would even get a 4th season but hopefully there's more down the line. I love the themes for each season (Mad Max world looks great!) but I still kinda wanna see a sequel of the 1st season's concept but I don't think that will happen.

By the way: awesome profile pic, I just re-watched that episode the other day."
Snowpiercer,"Isn't that a British show? On a British network? So far, this trend seems to be contained in the US."
Snowpiercer,"Thought this talked about? Discovery CEO was scrapping everything on those cable channels to save money. American dad, miracle workers, don't find a new home after their next season it's getting the axe."
Snowpiercer,Worst television trend ever. Hopefully they can pull a Minx and get picked up elsewhere.
Snowpiercer,">The season is already completed, but WBD is writing it off. It's currently being shopped to other networks.

I thought WBD said they were done with the write-offs?"
Snowpiercer,Hopefully Netflix picks it up since the other seasons already aired as Netflix Originals outside the US.
Snowpiercer,"If they are shopping around it means, it wasn't written off. Tax break window is over no studio can do tax write off's now"
Snowpiercer,"WBD are not writing it off since they haven't bought it yet.

If WBD wrote it off it wouldn't be able to be sold to other distributors."
Snowpiercer,"Netflix has rights for this show in most of the world, hopefully their viewing figures are good enough to buy it out

But all streaming platforms are in money saving mode these days"
Snowpiercer,Surely it's more cost effective to just run the season if it's already completed? Writing off content that's already prepared for prime time makes zero sense.
Snowpiercer,What!!!! That’s so annoying
Snowpiercer,"The show has already been a Netflix Original, I assume everywhere outside North America, since season 2."
Snowpiercer,You can’t write a show off tax wise if you’re shopping it around. That is very obviously tax fraud lol
Snowpiercer,"My hope is this is a blessing in disguise as some other studio buys it and goes beyond 4 seasons. But then again this is the the age of cancellations.

Imagen Netflix buys it completely just to cancel it a month later too."
Snowpiercer,Ditto. Can’t help thinking with all the *Agents of SHIELD* connections with S4 (new showrunner is Paul Zbyszewski and he’s pulling in Clark Gregg) this would be a good one for Disney+/Hulu to pick up.
Snowpiercer,"I only watched S1 but since this seems to be the final season and it's already filmed, it would be a shame if nobody picks it up. Shows will get canceled at times, just the way it is but having a show go out like this would be next level tragic so i hope this won't happen."
Snowpiercer,>!yes and no!<
Snowpiercer,"I’m guessing >!they sorta always will, without snowpiercer there’s no snowpiercer!<"
Snowpiercer,"No, they actually found a 'warm spot' in Africa now."
Snowpiercer,">!1,029 cars long!<"
Snowpiercer,"They were never on a train, far as I'm concerned. The railcar sets felt far too large and concrete to be actual railcars, even for a mega train."
Snowpiercer,"This isn’t a WBD production, so they’re not really “scrapping” it, they just don’t want to pay for distribution rights to air it on TNT like the other seasons. It’s been hypothesized since the merger was finalized that Discovery was likely going to gut many of their networks and sell the channels. TNT and The CW were both WBD studios (half for CW, at least), and they’ve more or less cancelled all the programming for both since the merger was complete. Not trying to defend the company, but this isn’t really all that shocking, and ITV (production company behind the show) likely has known or assumed this was how things were going to go for months now."
Snowpiercer,"They've said they were done two or three times now, only to keep removing shows and binning projects wholesale. It's absolutely fucking ridiculous."
Snowpiercer,"Not to defend WBD but the deadline article about this said the decision to not air it on TNT was made last year. We're just getting the news about this now which means they are keeping true to what they said, for now. Also, the studio behind it are looking to do offshoots on it (prequels/sequels)."
Snowpiercer,Inflation
Snowpiercer,Unfavorable global economic conditions require cutthroat decisions to be made.
Snowpiercer,"Don't forget to blame AT&T as well. They didn't help by turning Warner/HBO into a money loser that was billions in debt. They mismanaged the brand (financially not creatively) for ages prior to finally cutting their losses.

If they hadn't done that Discovery wouldn't even be in the equation"
Snowpiercer,Can you please point out all the unscripted crap that's being shoveled in place of scripted shows since Discovery merged with WB?
Snowpiercer,Its alright. At the start its quite an intriguing concept thats hooks you in. But the main character is very stale and boring and the latest season felt very stretched and filler
Snowpiercer,S1 is fairly week. As the world and characters open up it becomes legitimately very good. The detective story aspect of it lasts like 3 eps lol I don’t know why people keep mentioning it
Snowpiercer,If you like train detective stories.
Snowpiercer,"Season 1 is alright, slowly turns better. Season 2 was mostly excellent. Season 3 is pretty uneven (and to be honest, that's being kind)."
Snowpiercer,"It was shit, couldn't get past season 1 even though I liked the movie."
Snowpiercer,"Season 2 was actually an improvement over season 1, but season 3, throws everything away immediately."
Snowpiercer,"People from my family were watching it, I wasn't interested in the slightly even with it having actors I like. I already seen the previous movie and know the book I doubt something else was going to interest me more about this story I already know."
Snowpiercer,The headline is misleading: the season has been completed already: it is just that they need a new distributor.
Snowpiercer,"The show was aired as a Netflix Original (except for the US and China), so it is possible."
Snowpiercer,"From reading [https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/when-will-season-4-of-snowpiercer-be-on-netflix/](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/when-will-season-4-of-snowpiercer-be-on-netflix/)

anyone other than US will get Snowpiercer on Netflix."
Snowpiercer,Because that breaks the terms of the write-off.

"Berlin, Berlin",Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.

"Berlin, Berlin","Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it’s such a good show."
"Berlin, Berlin","I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
"Berlin, Berlin","Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
"Berlin, Berlin",Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
"Berlin, Berlin","Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
"Berlin, Berlin",Never heard of Money Heist
"Berlin, Berlin","Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
"Berlin, Berlin",Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
"Berlin, Berlin","Well now I’m intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
"Berlin, Berlin","Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
"Berlin, Berlin",Dark is on there for Germany.
"Berlin, Berlin",You are welcome :) [https://wikirank.net/#tvseries](https://wikirank.net/#tvseries)

"Berlin, Berlin","That link took me to some alternate world where Wikipedia ain’t in American, I dint like it."
"Berlin, Berlin",you should look it up on wikipedia
"Berlin, Berlin","reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
"Berlin, Berlin","That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
"Berlin, Berlin","I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
"Berlin, Berlin","Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
"Berlin, Berlin",It’s by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it’s great. Ultra realistic
"Berlin, Berlin","I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
"Berlin, Berlin",Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
"Berlin, Berlin",What movie? There is only the animated series.
"Berlin, Berlin",Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
"Berlin, Berlin","Do it, you won’t regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I’ve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can’t compare right now."
"Berlin, Berlin","Two reasons.

1. Netflix isn't willing to pay up for it at the moment. In America, it is actually not that popular. In fact, it's absurdly unknown. If you check [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4378376/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt) you'll find that only 4,000 out of 26,000 voters are from the USA. It's very geographically concentrated, and the longer it takes to get on Netflix, the more Americans will either just pirate it or forget about it.

2. Sky isn't willing to sell it at the moment. Someone on r/babylonberlin said:

""What I understand is that *Babylon Berlin* is a co-production between Sky and German public broadcaster ARD.    
Sky has the rights to show it first and s4 ran on the Sky channels and their affiliates in Late 2022.    
ARD doesn't get to show season 4 until Fall 2023.  And I assume the contract implies that Netflix doesn't get to show it until after it premieres on ARD.  ""

But I agree generally that it's a shambles. It's 2023. If you have a new TV or film production and you do not make it accessible to the world on day 1, the internet will do it for you. This should be unacceptable now.

[Season 4 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNi2a22ZvDk)

Masterclass in how to destroy a show set in one of the most fascinating periods of modern history that could have easily have been closer to Peaky Blinders or Boardwalk Empire in popularity if not destroyed by a brainless release schedule and non-existent advertising."
"Berlin, Berlin",How is this show? What can I expect from watching it?
"Berlin, Berlin","I'm curious, when it airs in the US is it dubbed or subtitled? 
In UK it's aired subtitled and while I loved the first two series I found series three a bit of a slog and gotta admit hadn't even realised there was a series 4. Might revisit three and see if I'm more receptive to it now."
"Berlin, Berlin",They should because season 4 was much better than season 3
"Berlin, Berlin",I love this show and did not even know there was a S4 completed.  I really hope to watch it at some point.  May have to take to the high seas since Netflix is lagging.
"Berlin, Berlin","The ocean is lovely this time of year, set sail.

I waited long enough for the 4th season to drop i'm not waiting any longer for media companies to distribute it out to all regions."
"Berlin, Berlin",Season 1 was amazing. Two was a bit hey hey. 3 was better than 2. Heard good things about 4.
"Berlin, Berlin",That's nuts you guys haven't been able to watch season 4. I forget not everyone is willing to sail the high seas
"Berlin, Berlin","> you'll find that only 4,000 out of 26,000 voters are from the USA. 

I figured it was niche but not that niche. That's a shame it's quite good."
"Berlin, Berlin","Wow, thanks for the amazing answer!!!"
"Berlin, Berlin",">rst and s4 ran on the Sky channels and their affiliates in Late 2022.  
>  
>ARD doesn't get to show season 4 until Fall 2023.  And I assume the contract implies that Netflix doesn't get to show it until after it premieres on ARD.  ""

A complete absurdity. I mean season 3 aired back in the States on Netflix in January of 2020.  That is now over three years ago. I get that Covid delayed the production, but it is absolutely a shame how little gets communicated from anyone over that time period.

I have been waiting patiently for season 4 since about March of 2020, and now we have to go by mere rumors to understand that if we want to see it legally, we may have to wait until 2024 to see it on Netflix. Likely waiting atleast  \~ 5% of our lives for the release of the following season, while being provided zero information and paying the netflix subscription fee every month.

This was one of my favorite shows of all time back in 2020, but now I can barely remember what happened.

Streaming services are as bad if not worse than cable providers now. A complete lack of transparency to string along subscribers that might just pay for their subscriptions for a couple of shows. Screw them. Long live torrents then."
"Berlin, Berlin","It's about the Weimar Republic, during the worldwide market crash and leading (so far) into the rise of the Nazi party, when they're about at the stage the Proud Boys are now. The main character is a police detective solving cases that take him through the underground culture of the doomed era. It's great"
"Berlin, Berlin",High production value and a good story. It is definitely worth watching.
"Berlin, Berlin",It will be both
"Berlin, Berlin","Season 4's only been out since 2022.

But dude, just pirate it."
"Berlin, Berlin",That might explain the delay since their isn't a dub to my knowledge
"Berlin, Berlin",That would be weird. Many people are quite happy now to use subtitles.
"Berlin, Berlin","I detest the dubbed version, I was pointing out a possible reason to explain a delay to US as the show doesn't have a dub and that's how Netflix has been releasing the show to my understanding"
"Berlin, Berlin","All in all, a mixed day for Adam Devine."
"Berlin, Berlin","This was way better than I expected, some sharp comedy writing, surreal moments and throwaway jokes, and tbh kept the “acapella” to a pretty chill minimum. I maybe saw pieces of the first film and none of the sequels so I definitely wasn’t the target audience but watched because of Devine and enjoyed it. It reallllllly helped that it was shot on location and made Berlin really pop, too. Great late night fun show, all in all, don’t mind watching another season."
"Berlin, Berlin","I haven't seen it, but I'd be interested to know more about the production of this series. It's cool to see that it was successful enough for a season 2, but I am curious who thought (and was evidently right) that there was an audience for the secondary antagonist in a 10-year old a cappella comedy whose role was then cut down in the sequel, and then removed from the third.

Pitch Perfect rocks though."
"Berlin, Berlin",[deleted]
"Berlin, Berlin","Wow this is surprising, I was sure this would be cancelled. Checked it out because I enjoyed the movies, but the writing was laughably bad. Only finished it for Sarah Hyland (and because it’s short)"
"Berlin, Berlin","Trailer looks ridiculous and really old-school. Like those boring sitcoms from ABC. Peacock is really stuck at old broadcast production. Making ,,sequel"" show about the most annoying character from the trilogy is somehow ,,original"" and surprising choice (at least). But watching the whole series Adam Devine being ,,stupid"" and loud is more torture than I could handle. 

Some renew I cannot understand."
"Berlin, Berlin",Who watches this?
"Berlin, Berlin","If there's more Flula to be seen, just give it to me! BOOM!"
"Berlin, Berlin",This was a totally fine and fun but unnecessary show. Don't love it or hate it and am ambivalent about it continuing. Maybe they'll get their groove in season 2?
"Berlin, Berlin",This was a totally fine and fun but unnecessary show. Don't love it or hate it and am ambivalent about it continuing. Maybe they'll get their groove in season 2?

"Berlin, Berlin",This guy is not funny
"Berlin, Berlin","Glad to see Peacock's sticking with its two and (likely) done formula. Following in the footsteps of Saved by the Bell (2020), Rutherford Falls, Girls5Eva, the A.P. Bio save.

At least Netflix saved Girls5Eva."
"Berlin, Berlin","Ugh. Peacock has a tendency to cancel (good) shows after one season, but this gets renewed?"

"Berlin, Berlin","I like it, it has a much more surreal Tina Fey-style instead of the comedy in the films."
"Berlin, Berlin",Probably because theres an audience for DeMamp fans. The only reason I watched Pitch Perfect with my wife was because I'm a Workaholics fan.
"Berlin, Berlin",What does it even mean?
"Berlin, Berlin","Nah. Peacock is the ""two seasons and cancelled no matter what"" service."
"Berlin, Berlin",I'm sure you were her second choice.

"Berlin, Berlin","Yep, she’s great, for sure. Hopefully they’ll keep it up for the second season."
"Berlin, Berlin","My brother is SUPER critical/picky when it comes to TV especially comedies and he was surprised how good the writing is.  The comedy is fantastic and really makes this thing work.  If the comedy wasn’t as clever and witty I think this would be just another meh show.

"Berlin, Berlin","a bit light on details, though I think it's likely by ""mafia"" they are specifically referring to the Sicilian Mafia (rather than the Neapolitan or Calabrian Mafias -  Camorra and 'Ndrangheta respectively). It would be interesting to see something like this set during the second mafia war... or maybe in the aftermath when it started to become not entirely uncommon for women to involve themselves in their now imprisoned husbands' mafia business."

I have seen many on reddit take certain Netflix documentaries at face value because they have people with impressive credentials saying things that sound right.

You should actually be skeptical of every documentary. Their inherent purpose is to convince you of something, not to be purely informational."
History 101,I mean… *is* there a (significant) difference between corn syrup and sugar?
History 101,"You think Netflix documentaries are bad?

Try Tubi ones.

A while ago I saws a Titanic documentary on Tubi, one of their 'experts' was a Tiktok guy called 'Titanic Toktok guy"" or something like that. The other expert was some black woman who studied in African American studies, which has nothing to do with the titanic. But I guess they wanted to add a token black person.

The tiktok guy was spreading myths int he documentary about how the 4th funnel was a dummy, while it actually was used for air intake for the engines and ventilation throughout the ship.

Then some other woman kept saying dumb things like ""It was harder to get in the life boats because they weren't wearing yoga pants back then"" or ""They didn't know if anyone was around because they had no phones on them"".

Tubi is worse than Netflix."
History 101,"I have not watched the show but you have to realise that a benefit of HFCS is cheaper processed foods, free refills and huge portions. It would be unbalanced just to state the disbenefits (diabeties epidemics, weight gain etc etc). It’s history so it’s likely showing what historically we thought about it (people loved this crap) rather than what we are educated to in 2022 in terms of it is mostly bad for you. 

HFCS wasn’t a blimp on the radar in terms of health in the 1990s and to demonstrate what we thought of it back then can only help educate us better to be wary in the future for the next fad."
History 101,"It seems like the episode is just quoting the science. Look at the FDA website for example and you'll see the general scientific consensus is that HFCS is no worse for you than table sugar (sucrose): https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/high-fructose-corn-syrup-questions-and-answers They both contain similar ratios of fructose to glucose, and the chemical bond in sucrose rapidly breaks down once you ingest it.

What HFCS appears to have done - as the episode explains - is provide the food and drink industry with a cheap and accessible alternative to sugar, meaning they can increase portion sizes to enormous sizes and make unhealthy processed foods a household staple (note: this is NOT a good thing)."
History 101,"Never seen the show. The only cover thing from my point of view that you posted is that they glossed over the actual history but maybe you are exaggerating or there’s certain negative history you wish they reported about? I don’t know again haven’t seen it, or know the history of it. The quotes you posted sound pretty neutral to me and what I’d expect from a non health documentary. A lot of health messaging nowadays is “bad” things are okay in moderation.that’s pretty much all the messaging I hear about alcohol, sugar and red meat growing up."
History 101,"> They also decided to end the show by basically saying the HFCS industry is not at all at fault for the wide-spread obesity epidemic facing the world today.

I'd wager the obesity epidemic has something to do with people eating more calories than they burn."
History 101,"That's funny because I watched the same episode last night and had mixed feelings about it. 

It clearly blames the obesity crises on the prevalence of cheap, processed foods and noted that the cheapness of HFCS is part of the reason why processed food is so cheap. Its also true that sugar and HFCS are basically the same metabolically. Overall I thought it was pretty balanced. The problem source of obesity in this country isn't HFCS, its cheap processed foods and a precipitous decline in physical activity."
History 101,I don’t think it left out the history of HFCS. It painted a pretty clear picture of the fact that the heavily subsidized corn industry needed a product to turn its excess supply into and HFCS was the perfect option because Americans love their cheap sweets.
History 101,"""I cant believe Netflix would put out such an unchecked, biased, and propaganda filled documentary series and have the audacity to call it history.""

You can't? It's Netflix, what have they ever done to convince you that they have quality control? I mean if everything they released was Stranger Things, Squid Game, and Bojack Horseman, then OK, I would agree that they clearly have a system of checks and balances in place, but those are the outliers with Netflix, not the norm."
History 101,"But sugar and hfcs are the same lol
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649104/

""Since then, a broad scientific consensus has emerged that there are no metabolic or endocrine response differences between HFCS and sucrose related to obesity or any other adverse health outcome. This equivalence is not surprising given that both of these sugars contain approximately equal amounts of fructose and glucose, contain the same number of calories, possess the same level of sweetness, and are absorbed identically through the gastrointestinal tract.

History 101,"Thank you - I was thinking of watching this but I won’t now.

HFCS is cheap and readily available & because of this it’s usually poor people who usually end up consuming it.  Which makes them fat - which means they develop health issues like OBESITY, diabetes and cardiovascular disease and they have a miserable life.  Yes, it makes them fat.  So you can blame HFCS and free refills aren’t a good thing."

History 101,"No.  The only difference is that industry is able to economically increase the sugar content in food using HFCS rather than other types of sugars. The amount of fructose is the issue, not the source."
History 101,"Normal sugar is mostly sucrose. In, high-fructose corn syrup as the name suggests, the fructose ratio is much higher than you would typically find in most normal foods. And there is evidence to suggest that the fructose percentage seems to affect how the body processes sugar, and messes with the gut bacteria. There is a quite nice ""pop-sci"" explanation of what it is and where the concerns may lie by Adam Ragusea (one of my favourite food youtubers):[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEKrfvgPGDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEKrfvgPGDY)"
History 101,"The primary differences I know of between sucrose (table sugar) and HFCS are:

* There's some concern about possible leftover reagents from the production process in HFCS
* Sucrose (table sugar) is a single molecule composed of one glucose and one fructose molecule. HFCS has more or less exactly the same balance of fructose to glucose, but they're already disassociated. The body reacts differently to them because it has to process the sucrose to break it down into the two component molecules, which presents itself as a feeling of fullness and resistance to consuming more sucrose. The HFCS doesn't trigger that reaction so you can sit and pound down soda after soda instead of feeling satisfied after just one. That could also lead to general overeating, theoretically."
History 101,"Fructose is a much larger contributor to NASH.  Naturally occurring fructose in fruit is less of a problem because the fiber content prevents it from hitting all at once, causing a major insulin spike. Fruit juice, on the other hand, can be as bad as full sugar soda.

NASH, BTW, is second only to alcohol as a cause of end stage liver disease."

Further randomized clinical trials are needed to resolve many of these issues. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the metabolism, endocrine responses, and potential health effects of sucrose, HFCS, and fructose.

>Don't listen to me, listen to this guy who has a PhD in sports physiology and was a prof of sports science [https://youtu.be/KunePIY\_C6o](https://youtu.be/KunePIY_C6o)

His PhD was looking at correlates in athletes performance vs their phenotypical characteristics (muscle mass, limb length etc.). That does not make him anywhere near an expert in metabolism. And his video only mentions ""multiple studies"" and talks primarily in the context of obesity rather than other conditions that are currently subjects of research (fatty liver disease and allergies for example).

In any case, my original post was a critique of how you presented the conclusions of the study you cited, not that the conclusions were necessarily wrong. A single meta-study is not definitively conclusive of anything, and the part of the abstract you omitted stated itself that there is conflicting evidence for things other than obesity, and states explicitly that more data is needed for firm conclusions."
History 101,"If the only thing you care about is that things are cheap, then things getting cheaper is a good thing. Asbestos made construction cheaper. Diethylene glycol made Austrian wine cheaper. Is it a bad thing that those were discontinued?"

History 101,"Yes, my point is there is nothing special about HFCS that isn’t just as bad about every sugar at high intake.  The problem of highly processed foods is not that they contain HFCS.  The problem is that they contain too much sugar. And salt.  And calories."
History 101,"Yeah, that article says two things, both of which I agree are true.  High sugar intake (glucose and fructose) lead to an increase  in intestinal tumors in mice.  (I won’t even get into the fact that mice develop tumors to all sorts of things that humans do not). And, HFCS increases the amount of fructose and glucose in the intestines.  But “line the intestines”? And, what would be the difference if you just feed mice the same amount of fructose in their feed as comparable percentage to using a concentrated form?  Where do they show that it matters that it is the form of HFCS?
People have latched onto HFCS as a convenient demon when truthfully, a diet high in sugar has always been known to raise your risk of cancer. The amount of sugar that we consume has steadily increased.  And much of that is industry taking advantage of easily replacing calories in reduced fat foods with sugar, and still promoting foods as “heart healthy.” But, there is no difference between high sucrose content and HFCS except HFCS is way much more economically advantageous to industry.  It’s capitalism. But it’s bad science to single out HFCS as the problem.  It’s using sugar (of any type) at higher and higher amounts."
History 101,"Did you read what I was saying?

There was more than 1 black person in the documentary plus whatever ethnicity the tiktok guy was. Race isn't the problem. But  to insert someone who had a degree in African American studies and who knows nothing about the subject shouldn't be in a documentary. Same goes for the tiktok guy and some other people who had no idea what they were talking about. The entire point of a documentary is that people sit down in front of the camera, who have a great deal of knowledge about the subject, tell interesting facts and unfold whatever occurred. The point of a documentary should be to enlighten and educate people. 

Her saying repeatedly ""I don't know what I would do in a situation like that"" or ""There was probably panic on the boat, or something"" is not someone who had anything insightful to add to the conversation."

Okay, so have you established how the very slight difference in HFCS vs normal sugar would play a role in how an individual processes it? where is the evidence? 


> His PhD was looking at correlates in athletes performance vs their phenotypical characteristics (muscle mass, limb length etc.). That does not make him anywhere near an expert in metabolism.

Bruh...he's a coach for multiple high level athletes and bodybuilders and his company revolves around diet plans. Not only are you glossing over his credentials but it would be total failure on his part (and the businesses) to advise his clients to consume HFCS if that meant his athletes failed or had poor body composition.

>A single meta-study is not definitively conclusive of anything, and the part of the abstract you omitted stated itself that there is conflicting evidence for things other than obesity, and states explicitly that more data is needed for firm conclusions.

On the inverse, what studies have you provided or evidence to show that HFCS has any appreciable effects that are different when consumed in the same proportion as sugar? you're just being a pedant for the sake of it lmao

Again, here's the mayoclinic
https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/high-fructose-corn-syrup/faq-20058201

Another source:
https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-fructose-corn-syrup-vs-sugar#regular-sugar
""A major difference is that high-fructose corn syrup is liquid — containing 24% water — whereas table sugar is dry and granulated.

In terms of chemical structure, the fructose and glucose in high-fructose corn syrup are not bound together like in granulated table sugar (sucrose).

Instead, they float separately alongside each other.

These differences do not affect nutritional value or health properties.

In your digestive system, sugar is broken down into fructose and glucose — so corn syrup and sugar end up looking exactly the same.

Gram for gram, HFCS 55 has slightly higher levels of fructose than regular sugar. The difference is very small and not particularly relevant from a health perspective.

Of course, if you compared regular table sugar and HFCS 90, which has 90% fructose, regular sugar would be far more desirable, as excessive consumption of fructose can be very harmful.

However, HFCS 90 is rarely used — and then only in tiny amounts due to its extreme sweetness"""
History 101,You dont want to understand my point. Thats fine. But I am not going to answer this further ;-)
History 101,"Except that isn't entirely true. 

Most monosaccharides (simple sugars) will cause insulin spikes and progress you towards some form of insulin resistance and resultant hyperglycaemia somewhere down the road they are not equally skilled at triggering such a response nor is the body equally adept at responding quickly. Fructose causes a much higher insulin spike than an equal moles/time glucose does, pushing your cells to insensitivity faster and generally much more pro-diabetic.

However, beyond this, unlike most monosaccarides which can be taken up from the blood into cells directly, and fed through glycolytic and oxidative pathways to provide energy rich intermediates else phosphorylated or stored into compact, osmotically inert polymers. 

Dietary fructose however is almost entirely metabolised within the liver used for the replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis since that is where the enzymes that drive the reaction forwards are expressed to high levels. The issue comes because your liver and the enzymes that run these reactions can only process a certain amount per unit time and any extra is basically dumped onto the liver as fat - an excess of which causes inflammatory macrophage infiltration and eventually cirrhosis and death. table sugar as sucrose is 50% fructose by mass and also comes along with fibre that slows it's absorbtion so it never overloads liver enzymic processing, HFCS is much much higher. While it is true high intake is ultimately responsible, since HFCS is in most things at high concentration and is much less tolerated that other sugars it is easy to overload and begin the process even on a ""normal"" western diet. Glucose alone doesn't require this process so really doesn't lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease anywhere near as frequently.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructolysis

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fructose-metabolism

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567

If 50 years ago you went to the doctor and were diagnosed with fatty liver diease and said you were not an alcoholic you'd be laughed out of the practice, now we have a name for it, non alcoholic fatty liver diease and it is primarily driven by high quantities of ingested fructose. This is one of the main problems of using Fructose in bulk."
History 101,"I completely understand the argument of “these people are not qualified to talk about this subject in the way they’re portraying themselves as”, but to me the way you made that argument appears as if you’re more upset about the fact that non-white people are on your screen. If that’s not the issue, very happy to hear that. 

That said, there is a place for ~~EE~~ emotional experience history & storytelling. If not on [shitty streaming service], then where? The whole reason educational outlets have shit the bed is because they *don’t* segment their content that way."
History 101,"Nah, you don’t want to understand mine."
History 101,"Its not directly due to high quantities of ingested fructose.  You wont find a legitimate research paper saying that, it is attributed to a high caloric diet, and syndrome x (metabolic syndrome).  Even your links say this."
History 101,"Which is what I said?  ""Ultimately high intake is still responsible"" did you read that part? 

Also the link says ""A wide range of diseases and conditions can increase your risk of NAFLD, including"" and then lists many conditions, diabetes (which I mentioned above) among them not just metabolic syndrome as you suggest.  It's also irrelevant since half the conditions that are associated with NAFLD progression including metabolic syndrome (which itself is very poorly defined) are they themselves either caused or driven to progression by high fructose intake which then feedbacks onto fructose metabolism to cause NAFLD. It's such a moot point to argue.

Nothing I wrote here is incorrect - Fructose induced de novo hepatic fatty acid synthesis is the implicated suspect in NAFLD and this sets it's overconsumption apart from other simple sugars like glucose which was my original point of contention in response to the poster above that said it was not fundamentally different in regards to health. The vagaries and minutiae of the condition aside, Fructose is far more strongly implicated than glucose by virtue of it's differing import, processing pathways, processing location and ultimate fate of it's downstream derivatives.

Episode 2, states there have been 30 astronaut deaths ""all in training""  um excuse me, both the Columbia and Challenger shuttles were on missions, not training. Also, the Soviets had a disaster in the 70s as well. I turned it off after that flub, I couldnt take any more."
History 101,Just watched it. What a load of garbage.
History 101,"Yeah I dunno, it's a clearly biased program created by western, eurocentric writers.

The *""Even in China!""* line made me cringe.

And I wish that documentaries and news stories covering obesity would stop showing those clips of fat people walking around in public with their heads out of frame, living their lives completely unaware that they're being used as a visual to go along with ominous music and ""facts"" about how fast food is killing us all. Fuck that. I would be mortified if I recognized my body being used on tv to foster fat-phobia."
History 101,Opinion based history. AKA Propaganda.
History 101,"I don’t promote the Chinese government, but that episode reeked of propoganda to me.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they made this show just to have that episode. 
The other “health” or “eco” ones are so yawn."
History 101,"hey I watched the Middle East episode and I do think its oversimplified but it’s literally what we were taught at school (Ontario, Canada). 

I think Americans are taught a very different version of history and that’s why they can’t recognize the true history doesn’t match up with   they’re taught."
History 101,Jesus. Crazy how everyone here is apparently an expert at every topic covered on this show.
History 101,"The one on feminism claims there is a wage gap, when I know for a fact there is equal pay (standardized for the union) in my field of work, and plenty of men and women working along side each other. So it had me up until there."
History 101,"I'd still go with American Experience or Frontline for informativeness, this feels more like a solid capstone project for a communications degree between the voiceover work and stock footage. But commercial grade historical content is definitely rare enough that it's worth watching if you're a fan."
History 101,"Cleary not much fanfare here, But I was wondering which movie a particular clip is from in Episode 1, where the guy asks about if his mom cooks 1095 meals a year."
History 101,"just watched the episode on china, not good"
History 101,In the Space Race episode they said there have been 30 deaths all during space training. That sure is a load of crap. There have been multiple explosions of take offs killing astronauts. Most notably the Challenger space shuttle. How can someone mess that up?
History 101,"Trying to make a cliff notes version of history automatically means things will be left out, and what gets left out is often read as slant. I don't hate it, but it's definitely infotainment. Anyone willing to fact check will be fine. Anyone not willing to probably doesn't with anything else either, so it's irrelevant. For those people, this still might be better than nothing."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Ken Jennings or cancel the show.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"""I just wanted a picture!!!"""
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I think LeVar is to nice for the job. Alex mocks you for saying stupid stuff instead of comforting you. LeVar needs to be the next Mr. Rogers.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"While I think he'd be a good host, I think Jennings would be better.  I also think that LeVar Burton would be much better doing an educational show for PBS/Discovery/etc or perhaps even staring in a family-oriented sitcom (like Full House, Cosby Show, etc)."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,He will be perfect!!! But you don't have to take my word for it!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I would watch it if he wore his visor.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,and it has 8 signatures... poor guy...
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Butterfly in the sky...
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Lavar Burton is the voice of education in my mind. Him and that dog Wishbone are why I am literate, and also an avid reader."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Troy would love this!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I'd have to hear him pronounce non-English words with an impeccable accent before I signed on.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"I would rather see him acting or directing a new ST series. 

But maybe this would get me to watch Jeopardy. "
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"I can see it now, a special week where people who appeared on reading rainbow as kids now compete on jeopardy as adults. "
LE PETIT NICOLAS,post this in /r/startrek and it might get more. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,This is the most astronomically fantastic thing I've ever witnessed with or without a telescope
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Is Trebek, like, retiring? I do think it would be nice if Burton had a job. "
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Why in the seven hells is he not still hosting Reading Rainbow, also this could be the updated theme song sung by jimmy fallon. "
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I always thought Neil deGrasse Tyson would be a good Jeopardy host. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Anything other than Matt Laurer. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I signed it.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"I think he would be great. Of course, you don't have to take my word for it."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Do we know if he even wants to host it?
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Only if we could get a cameo from Troy on Community!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"As much as I like him, his background and education is in tv and theater. Without someone as educated and wise as the great Alex, the show would suffer. But who..."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Watson could guest host from time to time.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"He would be absolutely perfect, might even revitalize the show"
LE PETIT NICOLAS,That was my first thought when I heard Trebek was retiring.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"I'm curious: other than being the most successful Jeopardy! contestant of all time, what qualifications does he have to host the show?  Has he hosted a game show before?  Is he charming on camera?  Does he even want to be a game show host?

"
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I think the robot overlords got to him. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,YOU CANT DISAPPOINT A PICTURE!!!

LE PETIT NICOLAS,Staring is an acting technique that is usually reserved for soap operas   rather than comedy. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Something like Reading Rainbow?
LE PETIT NICOLAS,... And nothing else?
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"its because no one wants to write out their full address, name and email to sign a petition"
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Sign! Share with your friends!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I can go twice as high.....
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"What's the story Wishbone? What's that you're dreaming up? Such big imagination from such a little pup?


When my son was in Pre-K, our local PBS station (dunno if it was nationwide, but it was definately on the local one) re-ran episodes of Wishbone every afternoon and he'd watch it while I was making dinner. He LOVED that show."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Don't tell me what I would love!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"His contract is up in 2016 and he said he wasn't going to renew it. He's also what, 76 now? He should be enjoying his Jeopardy money."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,He has had health problems these past few years. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,PBS cancelled Reading Rainbow almost 7 years ago.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Why waste a scientist like that on a job that is basically reading things out loud?
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Imagine Watson giving Trebek's trademark 'heh heh' when someone responds with a stupid answer
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"He is charming, hilarious, and has boyish good looks. Check out his twitter account or watch an interview. He would be perfect for a game show host.



^^^^of ^^^^course ^^^^that's ^^^^just ^^^^my ^^^^opinion

EDIT: I forgot a letter"
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"He doesn't have any past experience but he is pretty clean cut, clearly understands the game since he won the most, has written a book and presents himself well in interviews and stuff.

Now there are people who have better past experience hosting shows who probably would also fit pretty well but honestly if I was in charge of finding the replacement I'd give Jennings his fair shake."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Set phasers to love me!
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Could also be that people realize that nobody cares about stupid petitions, especially online."
LE PETIT NICOLAS,That is the petitioners fault. I've run these things and you don't need to have people provide any info other than an email which remains private. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Lol i used to watch it when i was like 13.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,He broke his leg chasing a thief across a hotel lobby. Typical Trebek. 
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Yup...the day Reading Rainbow bit the big one was a sad day in our house. D:
LE PETIT NICOLAS,Fair enough.
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Here's what the execs at jeopardy will think: ""Hey guys look some people wrote their name on this website staying that they want Levar Burton to host, so we have to do that! """
LE PETIT NICOLAS,I remember watching it in middle school...we thought it was so freaking cool that the series was filmed not that far from us (I grew up just outside of Ft. Worth).
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Also read his AMAs, /u/watsonsbitch"
LE PETIT NICOLAS,"Huh.  That was one of the most entertaining AMA's I've read.  He managed to be both witty, genuine, and informative with most of his answers.

Not only that, but he demonstrated that he's a Redditor.  I find it both surprising and reassuring that Jeopardy's greatest contestant and a published author is a Redditor.  You can waste some time on Reddit and still be successful!"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,">""We’re not going to go full Dr. Brenner on you, but we ask that you please (1) not extend the pop-up beyond its 6 week run ending in September, and (2) reach out to us for permission if you plan to do something like this again.""

Honestly, that's *totally* reasonable and nice of them.

Unfortunate thing with IP law is that it kinda has to be zero tolerance, otherwise it sets a legal precedence."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Netflix has to protect their IP, that is perfectly reasonable. So this is about the nicest way they could go about that."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"There was a pop up in Hollywood called scum and villainy, inspired by the Star Wars cantina. It practically looks identical to it inside but they never say Star Wars or have any copyrighted material in it. It did so well it's now a permanent bar. That's what they should have done. Don't make it explicit that it's Stranger things. "
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"I mean I get it.. Trying to make money of some one elses property, Could see why they'd take a bit of offense. "
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I like that they threatened to call their moms. Classy way to handle the whole situation.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"As someone who doesn't frequent bars, what is a pop up bar?  

Is it a recently opened bar with a Stranger Things vibe?  I'm confused on why they would try to make them close instead of insisting they change the design."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Planning on hitting this up this weekend. Netflix keeping it classy tho
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I do like that Netflix left the door open for the future. That there is a possibility of the owners reopening the bar as long as they have permission from Netflix this time. 
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"It's kinda weird that there's a bar for a thing where half of the cast is not legally allowed to drink, and more than half of the characters aren't legally allowed to drink."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Bar was nothing special imo
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Fuck they actually let it go on
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"> Unfortunate thing with IP law is that it kinda has to be zero tolerance, otherwise it sets a legal precedence.

No it doesn't, you don't have to protect your ip, you won't lose it, trademarks are what you are thinking of, this was just people being assholes."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,It doesn't set a legal precedence. They own the IP they can do what they want with it. Everyone says this zero tolerance shit but that's not how it works.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,What is the actual law here? Can't they just give them a temporary license for free or at a nominal fee that gets expired every month unless renewed?
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"It's also brilliant.  In the age of twitter, you don't want to anything to be used against you.  Now it makes the pop-up look like bad guys for not reaching out to them."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Just call it Topsy turvy and make the drink the waffle instead of elevens eggo. It's not hard to do a themed bar without getting shut down. I love themed bars. 
Mystic Pop-up Bar,It doesn't seem like they are upset by it. It's just copyright law in full force. They have to defend their ip.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Usually it means a recently opened bar that has a limited run theme.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"It's like the Halloween costume shop, but it sells beer."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"A pop up bar is one that just temporary. A bar owns or rented extra space next door and built a bar to look like scenes from the show. They even have signature cocktails. Their regular bar is still open, but this pop up was supposed to run through October.

Chicago even had a pop up Saved By the Bell restaurant last year. They're fun and drum up a lot of business due to only being open for a limited time"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Look up ""Beetle House"" NYC or LA. Tim Burton themed bar, primarily Beetlejuice themed. They're bars, but have a nice twist to them. I was at Beetle House LA a few weeks ago and had a great time. Various actors walking around in character (Willy Wonka, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) at all times was a funny experience.

There is also the ""Scum and Villainy"" Star Wars pop up, as well"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Literally just bars with themes from stuff so people pay much extra for drinks to stand next to posters of things. 
Mystic Pop-up Bar,It does.  You need to enforce your IP rights whenever there is a violation or future parties can violate those rights and then point to other cases where the IP owner chose not to enforce their rights.  
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"> Can't they just give them a temporary license for free

They might of if they asked"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Companies aren't in the business of letting other people profit for their own IP.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I don't think either the bar or the show end up looking bad here. 
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Yeah there's a handful of them in my city that are permanent and they operate just fine.  One's the Overlook Lodge themed after the Shining, the other Video Archive themed after Tarantino movies. They even have a third karaoke one coming based off Lost in Translation. They never mention those titles or characters but you know them.

  If anything it helps me love the movies more, but it is definitely different than using direct IP from a series currently in its production run. "
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Yes, they HAVE to defend their IP. Copyright laws are super weird. If they chose not to acknowledge this clear breach, in the future, somebody could do it continuously. If Netflix tried to file a C&D, they could easily lose, because ""they didn't do it last time."""
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Yes. That's literally what they are.

Mystic Pop-up Bar,"The bar looked bad.

e: to all you who want to disagree, the vote has been tallied and the bar did look bad."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I don't think so
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"No, nobody cared that they had it up but a company that nobody really cares about unless they want to watch the show."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Not really.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,+1 for the one TV screen that just has the DVD logo bouncing back and forth.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,These pop-up bars always seem like they'd be neat to visit but then you see the huge lines and people packed in like cattle and it just doesn't look worth it.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,How fun is that!?!

Mystic Pop-up Bar,There’s a permanent bar in Chicago also called The Office and it’s the most expensive cocktail bar I have ever visited. They have some drinks priced above $250!
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"These types of things are great, they ensure I can get a seat at a real bar."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,They better have Orange-vod-juice-ka in the menu.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Don't forget the $8 bottles of domestic and $12 ""Janaritas"".  "

Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Thank you for making this thread, so the front page isn't half Rings of Power reviews lmao"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"The common thread in every interview seems to be that it’s visually spectacular - no surprise there. 

The division is at whether the plot, writing and characters are any good, which is more or less what I assumed would be divisive from the very beginning.

I’ll hold my ultimate judgement until after the season finale (keep in mind most critics only got the first two episodes), but until then I remain a bit skeptical that Amazon Studios has what it takes to produce HBO level prestige television.

Edit: Something to keep in mind - it seems like everyone besides LA Times (who got 6 episodes) only saw the first two, which are undoubtably going to be worldbuilding heavy. Considering that a lot of recent Marvel/Star Wars offerings on D+ seem to start off promising and become gradually more divisive in reception, it’s plausible that ROP is the opposite. There’s some heavyweight talent on the writing staff which is basically the only reason I have some optimism."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I dunno man. Calling a work based on Tolkien “Game of Thrones-lite” is not the compliment rogerebert.com thinks it is.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"I just watched the first two episodes in a fan screening. AMA I guess.

Overall pretty good, with not really impressive writing (especially when compared to HOTD), but some actually decent dialogue I thought.

Absolutely astonishing production value.

Missed some of the warmth of the LOTR films.

I’ve never read LOTR so feel free to disregard my opinion.

EDIT: Also, serious moments were serious (no random quips) and the comedy was still pretty good when adequate. That was nice."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Making a judgement off two episodes seems dumb.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"So far it all indicates at starting slow and taking its time to building the world.

Rather than just throwing people into the LOTR universe. And I prefer for shows to take their time rather than having 5 minutes if world building and that's it and roll the action.

Also I imagine it will be hard to compact 2 or 3000 years worth of story into several seasons."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I find it kind of annoying that everyone frames their take around how expensive it is. It’s not like you or I had to pay for it. I don’t see why it matters
Mystic Pop-up Bar,[removed]
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Seems like its visually spectacular (which you would hope considering the insane pricetag) but so far we haven't got much meaty or satisfying characters or story yet. Lets hope they can deliver some solid character work considering they've only got three quarters of the seaosn left.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,How long are the first two episodes?
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Saw the premiere last night at my local theater and loved what I'm seeing so far. First episode is slow setting things up, but I'm already familiar with the characters, their motives, etc. come the second episode. Can't wait for more next week!"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, very intrigued to see how things play out. The guy on the raft could not have looked more like Vijo Morganstein if they tried. I assume he'll have something to do with Numenor. Also, I loved Frankenstein Gandalf."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"How's is bezos Washington Post giving it the worst.


That's oddly funny..fuck Bezo btw.

But I hope this show is good"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Color me cautiously optimistic.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I rate it 19 out of 20 rings of power.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,It seems like it's too early to tell if it's good or if it just looks good.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Would like to say the Grace Randolph review is pretty funny
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Why does it just screams…. “The story is just slow as hell”
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Just saw the first two episodes in a fan screening. As a mild Lord of the Rings fan, I really enjoyed them.

Visually it's absolutely gorgeous. I haven't been so inspired and awestruck by sets and locations like this in years.

As far as writing goes I'm very excited with the direction and setup. I know a handful of people who think Lord of the Rings is boring. I don't think so but I understand why. I'm exaggerating here but they're kinda like watching a textbook of events that occured. It's similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong. There's a lot of characters and they try to inject warmth and relatability into the characters but at the end of the day it feels like it's more about the plot and getting from point a to point b than exploring characters. I feel like to get the full experience and to love the characters completely I'd have to go research their lives.

Rings of Power however already does a lot more groundwork introducing the world and characters in a way that in my opinion isn't boring and builds more of a rapport between the viewers and the characters. Already I feel closer to and care about many of the characters nearly as much as I do the Lord of the Rings characters. I found them very charming. I chuckled a lot and even characters I was unsure about ended up being my favorites. Take this with a grain of salt though, because as I stated I'm a mild fan. I haven't read any of the books and am not bringing textbooks of lore into my opinion.

I keep seeing this compared to Game of Thrones which is just a bunch of tribal marketing in my opinion. The way I see it Game of Thrones is great for all of the politics, intrigue, scheming, and human interactions. And I think Lord of the Rings is great for it's fantasy, wonder, adventure, and beauty. So I think it's completely reasonable to like one more than the other or both (in my case) for different reasons.

Anyways. Ask me anything if you want."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"The AV Club just released their review, and they grade it an A-, saying it's ""one of the most captivating fantasy worlda in TV history"".

Mystic Pop-up Bar,"so, Prime is the only service I don't have, so I may have to end up sailing the high seas for the premiere of this one, man, why couldn't this be on HBO?"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Its amazing tonsee the massive disconnect from professional critics and audiences. To critics, this show is a masterpiece. To the actual viewers, who make the show money, its a disasterl... mostly. Sitting at high 30s on RT right now and no better elsewhere for viewer reviews. 

Everyone seems to agree that the show is visually stunning. Its amazing looking, but thats what throwing an ungodly amount of money at a show will do. However, most agree that the rest of the show is just bad. There are a variety of reasons given. Bad acting, bad writing, ignoring set lore, injecting real world social views into a world that it doesnt fit into.... then we have actors on social media making things worse, as usual these days when a show was likely doomed to fail to begin with. 

I watched it. Not a fan. I loved the previous entries. I even rewatched and read everything again before. Its something I like to do when things like this come out. I was let down. They ignored the source material. They ignored established lore and changed it. In ky eyes, they solidified that this can not and will not be canon too. 

I was excited at first, despite the bad press. I was let down. I was bored and disappointed. I made it to the second episode and I am done. I wont watch any more. I am one who gave it a bad review. If you are going to base a show on an established world with a lot of rich lore, you need to actually follow that lore. You need to try and add story to the world, not change it. 

Thats my 2 cents on the matter. Agree with it or dont. Watch if you want. If you enjoy it, great for you. Thats awesome. I dont. I think its a polished turd and nothing more. Shiny on the outside but inside, its still just a turd."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"I don't like it, struggle to stay awake after 4 episodes."

I had hoped it wouldn't be review bombed. I have friends and family who worked on this show and they all are very positive with the results."

Mystic Pop-up Bar,Why is rottentomatoes site so fucked? RoP and HotD are only showing like 5 reviews
Mystic Pop-up Bar,So far it's not a disaster is what I'm getting from the reviews. I'm hoping they can pull it off. Please be better than that Nexflix Shannara series!
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"""It either races through astonishing action scenes, or lingers on a single conversation or meaningful look.""

At least they're successfully emulating that aspect of Tolkien."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"From the 'positive' reviews:

Mystic Pop-up Bar,It's better than The Hobbit trilogy at least
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"To be fair game of thrones season 1 took a while to gather some  to steam 

Problem is you have a very entitled fan base who have decided there is no room for error (which is ironic considering there’s plenty Peter Jackson changed and everyone loves his version)"
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Anything has to be better than the Hobbit movies.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Damn. Entertainment Weekly had every exclusive leading up to the release and threw it right under the bus once all the marketing money was paid. Gangster. That means they probably tried to be as nice as possible even in a negative review. Can only imagine Bezo's rage reading that review.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Hopefully it looks like Lord of the Rings and not The Hobbit.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,[deleted]
Mystic Pop-up Bar,I'm not going to write the whole show off based on two episodes but these reviews don't give me much hope.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Someone explain to me how you can spend a billion dollars and fuck up this bad. No coherent story line. 2D characters. No back story. The acting was trash. Everyone is saying that it looks good but you can tell it's just cgi. I'd rather watch Amy Schumers comedy special. 

1/10 would not bang."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"I did a double take because I read many of the reviews blurbs in your post before noticing you had sectioned it off as positive at the top and mixed/negative at the bottom. Reason why is many of those positive reviews sound very mixed or maybe backhanded complimentary at best.

I feel confident no matter what happens we should all get out our popcorn for the discussions around this show coming up."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"What you're going to see in this thread:

Cherrypicking parts of reviews to confirm this sub's predetermined opinion that the show is going to fail. They said it looks gorgeous? That must mean the content sucks!

It's been hilarious watching the run up to this and HOTD. It's clear which show this sub wanted to succeed and which one it wanted to fail. The Amazon hate runs deep."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Who knew that a mega thread of Rings of Power reviews would have so little comment on this sub. Apparently, reddit is upset."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,It’s just never gonna beat the trilogy is it? Why bother
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Lots of buts in those positive reviews.
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"Imagine seeing the shit show of the star wars sequel trilogy and thinking ""Let's do that to Lord of the Rings."" Damn, as soon as I saw JJ Abrams being involved with the show runners I knew this show was a lost cause."
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Karendriel is not a great character.

Mystic Pop-up Bar,The last people I would trust to review a movie or TV show is 'critics'... They're always paid shills that are not in line with the general public
Mystic Pop-up Bar,Sticking to the writings of the master of high fantasy -Tolkien - whose work they were adapting would have helped. But they chose to write their own garbage plots
Mystic Pop-up Bar,"So the writing for the show is terrible as expected and visuals are stunning as expected. Inorder to keep viewers hooked for a high fantasy show like this, the writing has to be extremely good else casual fans will lose interest. The reviews also point out a lack of interesting characters.This show is going to be a major disaster."

Mystic Pop-up Bar,"So at best, a Tolkien effort..."
The Queen and the Conqueror,This show was awesome as a kid. I refuse to go back and watch it again to find out how cheesy it probably was.

The Queen and the Conqueror,highlander is such a cool concept only to fall on its face in practically every attempt to extend its universe.
The Queen and the Conqueror,I remember coming home from a 4AM shift at 10AM and Highlander was that show I could watch before I had to get to class at 11:30. I miss the 90s in a lot of ways.
The Queen and the Conqueror,*Princes Of The Universe* just doesn't sound right without clashing swords in it.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Queen soundtracks make everything 1000% better.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Travelling back and forth through time and across the world - But mainly 90's Vancouver.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Greatest intro song
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Now is the time of the gathering, where the stroke of a sword can release the power of the quickening. In the end, there can be only one…."
The Queen and the Conqueror,This is one thing I'm confused about when it comes to Highlander is the movie and the tv show each a separate thing? I thought with the quicking at the end of the first movie that was it! Conner won the prize he could read minds? and live a normal life.
The Queen and the Conqueror,I would have original Mercury Queen do all the music for all my films if I could.
The Queen and the Conqueror,There was another Queen song in one of the movies called Gimme the Prize. Really good.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Someone go find the intro to Renegade....
The Queen and the Conqueror,Face it. [Jayce and the wheeled warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9K0SzFIf4A) was the hands down best theme from the 80s.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Legit a top fav song. I liked this song before I liked music.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I tried to watch the movie on streaming a few days ago.

Pure 80's Energy in the intro.

My goodness it did not age well. The opening fight scene is atrocious, it looks like the choreography was done in the time it took me to write this comment."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I raise you [HERCULES!](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2m3n62)

I still think that for it's time they had some pretty good CGI/effects in most places."
The Queen and the Conqueror,I hadn't heard this song in 30 years and still remember it perfectly.
The Queen and the Conqueror,It's crazy to think that a US-French syndicated tv show was allowed to use a Queen song as it's theme even it was written originally for the movie.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I wouldn't mind if they remade this show. Get some solid casting and they can run 3 to 4 storylines next to each other. Immortals dodging each other , being forced to fight due to exceptional circumstances.
""Young ones"" and ancient ones. One gathering his wealth, the other boss of a faceless world Company, one world Traveler,.... So many possibilities."
The Queen and the Conqueror,One of the best TV intro’s ever.
The Queen and the Conqueror,The best ever!
The Queen and the Conqueror,Flash Gordon 1980 into by Queen. Straight flush.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Queen also did the entire Flash Gordon soundtrack.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Goosebumps- I LOVED this show, and the intro played a big part in the hype"
The Queen and the Conqueror,Don't want to spoil things but the episode that ended with Dust in the Wind kinda broke middle school me.
The Queen and the Conqueror,holy fucking nostalgia Batman! Seeing this gave me goosebumps. I use to absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW and the intro was 10/10!!!
The Queen and the Conqueror,RIP Stan Krisch.
The Queen and the Conqueror,HERE WE ARE
The Queen and the Conqueror,I used to JAM to this.
The Queen and the Conqueror,I loved the idea of the highlander but the concept just didnt make any sense like what happens when all the immortals are killed??? why was their immortals in the first place? wasnt they exposed to the govts of the world and hunted down? i had so many questions highlander 4 didnt answer. lol. the intro for the show was dope with the queen song btw
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I wish the latest movies didnt kill everything. They were so bad!  Could be cool to have a GOOD reboot, now that stuff like GoT became giant hits. 
Still was great as a show, how many other shows were all about sword fighting and immortals??  
I even played the card game for a little."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Nah shit, MacGyver better"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"The movies were decent… the show, not so much. Queen is probably the best thing about it."
The Queen and the Conqueror,By the way Ricky... I watched the highlander movie... It was shit!
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I watched this and the movie thinking that Princes of the Universe was an awesome song…because they only played the first part of it. I’m sorry Queen, but you fucked up with that last part.

Edit: For everyone downvoting: you have heard the whole song, right? You telling me you like it past the part played on Highlander?"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"You think that's hype you're feeling, when in fact it's... orbital wobble."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"The '90s had these one hour cheesy action dramas (Highlander, Heracles, Renegade). Did this genre ever get a label or moniker like how USA's shows were called 'blue sky shows'?"
The Queen and the Conqueror,I always thought this show was dumb in the sense that they should just have had the dude be Conner McCloud. The movie made a whole thing about how rare it was for someone to be an immortal and the show is like “Y’all liked the Highlander? Guess what! He had a cousin!”
The Queen and the Conqueror,Major teenage crush here
The Queen and the Conqueror,Is it just me or does the music not match the action at all?
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I don't know if it's changed, but back then you could not find this song on any album, you had to record it from tv :/"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I grew up watching this show. I’d use a broom as a sword and do imaginary sword fights. Ah, nostalgia. I rewatched a few episodes a few years ago and I still like it. It’s cheesy but that’s the 90’s for you. IIRC there was a spin off show staring Amanda but it was soooo awful. Which sucks because Amanda was always great in the main series. Probably different writers."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"haha yeah you can't beat the Queen, easily my favourite band ever. Music here doesn't even gel much with the images, which is to be expected since it's from the movie,  but who the hell cares when it's so bloody awesome"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"It’s a banger for sure. For me nothing will ever beat the HBO theme. But since that’s cheating and not actually a show intro I’ll say this….

Beeee leave it or not. Iiiiiiiim walking on air"
The Queen and the Conqueror,One of the best intros
The Queen and the Conqueror,Great show.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I remember when this show was on the air it was considered fairly horrible at the time.   Didn't stop me from watching it, but it was impossible to ever call this show ""good"".

I guess because a lot of it was filmed in Europe the styles were a bit different than the US.   So in the mid-90s in the US, when I watched this show, it looked like everyone was still wearing clothes and hairstyles from the previous decade.  

But the truly humorous thing about this show is how two immortals in skin tight jeans from the 80s could just pull a broadsword out of thin air at a moment's notice.   They had to be shoving those things into a body cavity for safe keeping I figure.

And then there's the whole issue of why they keep fighting with swords centuries after nobody else does.   If the goal is to remove another immortal's head, there are many ways to do that in the modern world that don't require a sword.   Hell, just hit them with a tranquilizer dart and take the victim to a guillotine, right?   

I hope they don't remake the movies or the show however.   It's perfectly bad just the way it is."
The Queen and the Conqueror,I scream this song every morning 😆
The Queen and the Conqueror,"If the quickening has ever occurred before, how can there be more than one now?"
The Queen and the Conqueror,I am not ashamed to say that I have seen every single episode of this series.
The Queen and the Conqueror,This is the first season's intro it got better over the later seasons! Loved Highlander.. still own Season 1-5 on DVD =) ( 6 doesn't exist lulz)
The Queen and the Conqueror,so much better than the movies
The Queen and the Conqueror,Is there anywhere to still watch the methos chronicles?
The Queen and the Conqueror,Now I’m waiting for Airwolf.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"""A Kind of Magic"" is a bad  ass album all the way through."
The Queen and the Conqueror,That’s decent but it’s no Greatest American Hero.
The Queen and the Conqueror,Best intro song ever.
The Queen and the Conqueror,premiered in 1993.  disqualified
The Queen and the Conqueror,"HEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE, WE ARE

BOOOOOORN TO BE KINGS

WE’RE THE PRIN-CES OF THE UUU-NI-VERRRRRSE"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"So fucking 80’s-and it looks so bad now, but I did like it as a kid/teenager.



What a glorious song by Queen tho."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Ah yes, one of the last long-haired male TV show protagonists. Gone were the days of Lorenzo Lamas."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"My father loved this show. I enjoyed it myself but he really digged it. 

If you want to see more of Adrian Paul there is a South African movie called Merlín The Return where he plays Lancelot. It also has Tia Carrera as a hot mad scientist trying to use science to open a portal to another universe and free King Arthur's enemy Mordred. Yeah it's as bad as it sounds which is why it's been done by Rifftrax"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I gave it a rewatch recently, it actually wasn't *too* bad. We've definitely come a long way in action/stunts."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"It’s one of my favorite show.
Season 1 is super cheesy, Season 6 completely lost the plot.
Season 2-5 are fairly solid.

Yes there is still a fair amount of 90’s content but I find it bearable.  Coming from the movie I was attached to Christopher Lambert but Adrian Paul has actually better leading man quality and eventually grew over me. Duncan character has a “man of the world” quality that is very different from Conor perpetually depressive vibe  and is quite endearing. The fact the show kept moving between Vancouver and Paris really helped the credibility  and I wish there were more shows like that. A bit of 90’s cheese yeah every once in a while  (printed necktie, mullet, etc…) but 2010 show have their own brand of cheesiness and I find it far less sympathetic. The show is relatively tight by season 5. The fact 90’s shows were far more episodic than nowadays help too : you can cherry-pick/watch episode in disorder and it doesn’t make that much of a difference. There are  some season plot and some important Deaths but it’s not overbearing. Most supporting cast go in and out anyway on a steady basis (Richie, Methos, Dawson, Amanda, ,). You might as well think they're simply busy somewhere else.

“Chivalry” is a favorite episode of mine. But there are other episodes like “The vampire”, “Modern Prometheus”, “The end of innocence” , “Prodigal son” that are pretty good.  Adrian Paul gets more and more comfortable, with a sword and generally speaking, as the show progresses. 

“Duende” duel is probably the peak of swordplay and is fucking awesome - “La destreza” style of swordplay is like an elaborate dance and it is a joy to watch -  by this point Adrian Paul was fairly comfortable with swords and Anthony DeLongis Is a professional stuntman/swordsman   - even today  I don’t think there’s that many movies that do better . Swordplay wise, the serie is actually much better than the highlander movies for instance. Christopher Lambert swordplay is pretty basic compared to Adrian Paul. You already see the difference in the very first episode and by the end of the serie they’re world apart. It’s been a while since I watched Pirates of Carribeans but I think it hold up pretty well and is actually more believable swordplay wise."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I did that to the cartoon. Please do not watch it. I wanted to see how it ended, but it looks like it was canceled. 

I wish we could have a conclusion to the Pirates of Dark Water."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"My dad was a huge fan in the '90s but never watched the final season. For twenty years he never missed a chance to mention he wondered constantly how Highlander ended.

Finally streaming let him watch the final season a few years back. He was disappointed. Two decades of curiosity couldn't stand up against '90s camp."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"My wife once told me that most 90s shows, like the X-Files and Highlander have a pornesque quality to them.  I can't watch them anymore because of this."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I think you'd be surprised at how well it holds up.

I watched a few episodes a while back and didn't hate it.  They were even episodes I hadn't seen before, so I'm pretty sure I've missed a few"
The Queen and the Conqueror,Same
The Queen and the Conqueror,It’s SO bad. I tried to rewatch it a few years ago. Half the show is the immortals whining about how terrible it is to live forever.
The Queen and the Conqueror,"It was and remains glorious. Go back and embrace your inner eighties child.

Sincerely, made in 1981."
The Queen and the Conqueror,It was one of my dad's favorite shows and so it has a special place in my heart because of that. He passed away in 2005 and we were very close and i will not tarnish his memory by going back and learning the show he loved was schlocky 90s cheese. Which it probably was.
The Queen and the Conqueror,I AM IMMORTAL / I HAVE INSIDE ME BLOOD OF KINGS
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Yeah, the ""watcher intro"" is better"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I mean the next line is 

I HAVE NO RIVAL, NO MAN CAN BE MY EQUAL

It's a close run."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"You’ve heard the whole thing though, right? I feel mistakes were made."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I think because it was a cool ""one and done"" novelty concept that was raised above its potential by some excellent casting and soundtracking.

The plot - immortals are driven to fight until only one remains, they fight, only one remains - doesn't really hold the doors open for sequels and expansions because the natural conclusion of the story is what happens in the first movie. 

The first movie is great because of Sean Connery, Clancy Brown and Queen. Remove any of those key ingredients and you just have the trashy B-movie that it would've been otherwise."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"It has the Star Wars problem. Writers only want to follow one bloodline.

The concept is solid enough that a streaming service could easily run 4-5 different storylines in their separate shows, and only merging for a moment here and there.

Especially since the oldest known living was 5k+ years old. There's a lot of ground to cover that can have nothing to do historically."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"they painted themselves in a corner in the very first movie with the Prize thing. Epic music and Thoroughly enjoyable performance aside, the lore itself is all about this moment.

The serie was by far the most  convincing : retcon the movie ending and keep the Game going. That’s pretty much the only path practically available.

Any other path  requires messing with the core rules/lore/genre to keep things going.  you need to find another endgame and that’s where you start wandering into extraterrestrial, time travel, mystic source,.and the cringe begins. It’s kinda like  Seven - you don’t find a concept like that everyday.

You had the prequel road too. Back then it was not fashionable but I suppose showing Conor numerous fights over the centuries/losing friends/growing isolation could have been interesting character study… in competent hands. Not many prequels that are actually good.

 they could also have shown Conor uniting mankind but honestly who would have watched a Highlander movie without swordplay and lightning effect ?"
The Queen and the Conqueror,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235529/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I have the perfect way to revive it: 4 different 6-10ish episode seasons following four different main characters, each making their way from their first death to the final gathering place, with their own empathetic reasons and plans for being the champion. Then we have a final 2-4 episode limited series called The Quickening where we watch them face off, knowing at the end There Can Be Only One."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"The second movie shows they were never planning for a sequel at all. 

Hopefully the Henry Cavill remake can be a bit better thought out."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"After seeing how well Sandman pulled off, in one episode, what it might be like to be immortal, and be thrust about by chance, and see your star rise and fall throughout ages, watch your friends die, have to keep relocating to disguise your identity, to find peace and watch it slip away, I was captivated.

And then add in being constantly hunted/hunting, to have to be ready at any time to be attacked, to hold onto feuds that last millenia, to be present at the greatest events in history but having to remain anonymous, and then to find yourself in the modern era where that kind of information is much harder to keep secret.

Plus just a shit ton of sword fighting.  I mean, we got ourselves a show, baby."
The Queen and the Conqueror,[Damn Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmrHTdXgK4)
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Similar to Stargate, a show about travelling to alien worlds... which 9 times out of 10 end up looking suspiciously like British Columbia."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"False. ""The Munsters"" Halloween surf rock theme song slaps harder."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Yes, the first one ended the story, so they retconned it.  Multiple times."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"They're sort of the same continuity? The problem is Connor also cameos in the pilot for the series, and then Connor and Duncan costar in the film Endgame (which I think is normally counted as the 4th film, but given all the different cuts of 2&3 and how they were marketed, and how every sequel at least sort of retcons previous events, things get fuzzy...)."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I had a problem as a kid with all of that. None of the sequels or the show made sense after the first movie. I eventually just looked at it as reimagining of the concept, it helped, a little"
The Queen and the Conqueror,"Who Wants To Live Forever as well.

I think the ""A Kind of Magic"" album is mostly Highlander tunes."
The Queen and the Conqueror,Not to mention “Who Wants to Live Forever”
The Queen and the Conqueror,https://youtu.be/CmVg0nQ6sY8
The Queen and the Conqueror,Holy shit anyone know if this show holds up at all?
The Queen and the Conqueror,Snake Eater
The Queen and the Conqueror,BORN TO BE KINGS
The Queen and the Conqueror,"They explained what happens when they’re all killed at the end of the first movie. Apparently the Prize is mortality, being able to have kids, and being able to read the minds of everyone in the world. Not sure why all that is that desirable or how immortality leads to it. 

Why immortals in the first place? Same reason as why the X men or wizards in other shows. Because weird shit just happens, especially in fiction. More interesting than regular folks running around chopping each other’s heads off for no reason sometimes. 

The show had Watchers, regular people that knew about them. Why weren’t they hunted down? That’s a little mortal-ist of you. Why hunt them down? Some were assholes, but others just defended themselves or others. Some of the Watchers did have a problem with immortals and killed some, mostly they were just historians though."
The Queen and the Conqueror,"I think the second movie explained a lot of this, they are originally aliens and if they all die more aliens come from their home planet to fight more."
Blood & Water,"How do you know it's actually weed? Because you know, it's surely not."
Blood & Water,Just out of curiosity what's the right tone iyo?
Blood & Water,"For real, I found the idea of the story quite compelling but the writing and acting on it is so, so bad. So rushed as well, hardly any character development for any of the characters and so many plot-holes."
Blood & Water,I love seeing my home town on Netflix.
Blood & Water," *Ok so this was a short one guys because I've seen 3 other new series since I've watched this (that I have to do write-ups for) and now I can barely recall all the details from this one. Now I've learnt not to make these shows stack up on me. uggh!*

Blood & Water,"I'm just coming here now to say how shittily the swimming scenes were shot, it's ridiculous! Also the main character is built nothing like an elite swimmer apart from all else, at least make good use of a body double!
I mean, the plot and all that seems interesting so far though."
Blood & Water,…
Blood & Water,"Definitely something along the lines of Quicksand, or Ackley Bridge, or (even though I didn't like this series) 13 Reasons Why? Set in high school, but about serious issues (because Blood & Water is about a serious issue). Not too much melodrama. Not too much focus on love triangles and petty feuds. Tells its story while giving its critiques on society. 

As i said in the post, it's like this series wanted to be Unbelievable and Élite at the same time. And I love both of those series, but Èlite is an intentional soap drama with over-the-top scenarios, while Unbelievable is the realism of rape and the faulty criminal justice system, so you can see the incohesion there. 

I guess basically what im saying is Blood & Water is a badly written series tbh."
Blood & Water,No idea what it’s about but seems interesting
Blood & Water,Excited for this South African production
Blood & Water,I love a good teen drama
Blood & Water,No comments?? Just finished this show... fucking amazing
Blood & Water,Enjoyed the show but not surprised at all
Blood & Water,"first season was fun.  second season's villain was too big(?) >!infiltrated every single intelligence agency, eliminated every hacker worldwide who wasn't working for them, coordinated global attacks, etc...for a heist!<"
Blood & Water,this is the show that only put out two seasons since 2019
Blood & Water,"When the show finished production in December 2020 and it took 19 months to actually get released, I figured it was pretty much a goner.

I enjoyed season 1 but season 2 was meh."
Blood & Water,I tried watching this show but found the main characters acting to be pretty bad and gave up
Blood & Water,Nooo we all loved this show
Blood & Water, Never heard of it
Blood & Water,Did it end on a cliffhanger?
Blood & Water,"Never seen it never heard of it but if I was reading up recommended shows I would skip this. Not sure what it is but I really really dislike this trend? Of shows being called ""Blood &...""
Hate it."
Blood & Water,i would love more shows like this but for some reason this one didn't really interest me.
Blood & Water,"This is a show where the idea is great but the execution not so great, perhaps because neither of the leads has real charisma or chemistry. But it moves, is colorful, is way different than other fare, and doesn't really disappoint."
Blood & Water,Not surprised but at least they got a second season. Enjoyed the show and would have liked more seasons. Putting the show as a paramount+ exclusive certainly didn't help it but apparently they had no options.
Blood & Water,Not surprised - it can't have been cheap to do all that travelling.
Blood & Water,It was a fun show and I would have liked to see more season.
Blood & Water,"Agreed, I also thought season 2 was a bit weaker and I didn't always agree with the decisions the main characters were making. But overall the two seasons are worth watching if you don't take it very seriously. It is a very light hearted show with some fun set pieces that look higher budget then you would expect. (Even though it does have some weird low budget moments where the CGI is just plain bad)"
Blood & Water,Same! I can’t even get far in a show when it’s obvious bad acting or writing
Blood & Water,Who is we? Are they the same people who wanted more from the DaVinci Code and the National Treasure shows?
Blood & Water,"No, they finished the season arc completely, so it is safe to watch."
Blood & Water,"Yeah, I assumed season 2 was a covid cancelation for a while, was surprised to see it eventually come out"
Blood & Water,"Yeah, I really wanted to like it. I definitely have appetite for an Uncharted/Indiana Jones/National Treasure kind of tv show. I was even prepared for the acting to be a little CBS. The writing was just too weak. It wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention."
Blood & Water,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Blood & Water,"Is outer banks that good, didn't see much buzz here"
Blood & Water,"Neat. Thanks for this.

Space Force's stats are quite impressive for a show that only debuted a week ago."
Blood & Water,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.
Blood & Water,I’m surprised Ozark is that high

Blood & Water,Interesting to see containment show up.
Blood & Water,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Blood & Water,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Blood & Water,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Blood & Water,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Blood & Water,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Blood & Water,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Blood & Water,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Blood & Water,How about movies??
Blood & Water,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Blood & Water,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Blood & Water,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Blood & Water,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Blood & Water,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Blood & Water,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Blood & Water,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Blood & Water,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Blood & Water,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Blood & Water,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Blood & Water,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Blood & Water,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Blood & Water,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Blood & Water,[deleted]
Blood & Water,Pandemic boost
Blood & Water,He write it at the end of his post.
Blood & Water,Last 100 days
Blood & Water,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Blood & Water,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Blood & Water,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Blood & Water,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Blood & Water,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Blood & Water,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

I use this which considers all 3 to be exclusive international distribution deals.


Thank you for that other correction"
Blood & Water,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Blood & Water,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Blood & Water,That's why I thought you should know...
Blood & Water,[deleted]
Blood & Water,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."
Blood & Water,"Was kinda odd place to put it anyway.

Had to scroll all the way down to read what they meant then scroll up again.. :p"
Blood & Water,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Blood & Water,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Blood & Water,[deleted]
Blood & Water,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Blood & Water,Tom's character tries to sell Larry a reverse mortgage.
Blood & Water,Thankfully we never got version of Indiana Jones with this hairy mofo.
Blood & Water,Blooblub!
Blood & Water,Have they ever had Tom Selleck on the rebooted Magnum PI?
Blood & Water,"I find it hysterical how people are clutching their pearls about the quality of this adaptation. I haven’t seen it yet but I did read the book and the source material is the definition of mediocre wine mom schlock. Chill the fuck out you fucking weirdos, there’s no sacred ground to trample here."
Blood & Water,"5 f*cking days. That's how long it's been out. Chill. Wtf. Literally just heard about it 3 days ago. People have lives, we can't binge everything the moment it comes out. Entire series' can not be consumed and discussed ad naseum in one news cycle or you end up Kaleidoscope. Yeah remember that one? The one everybody watched but no one has mentioned in over a month?"
Blood & Water,"I see this show has been getting lukewarm reviews, but I absolutely love it."
Blood & Water,"The critic ends with this: ""Sure people will watch, but we’re not getting the adaptation we deserve.""  

Who deserves what? It's like reddit wanting things to be the way they expect. Overcome.  Don't watch. Nobody cares. As has been said, people will watch. End. The rest is nonsense from people who value their own opinion too much. That's why everyone is seeing Yellowstone around."
Blood & Water,"I *really* like this show. I loved the book.

Here's what I like about the show: adjusted for the 1970s era, it feels like a really accurate portrayal of a group of musicians and an good snapshot of that time. I doesn't feel like a fictional story. Daisy Jones reminds me a great deal of a current musician I know. Billy Dunne reminds me of a few people: now hitting middle age and reflecting on their musical careers. The casting and acting is good. It feels like a genuine human story to me, especially as I know the twist that is coming. I love Last Of Us, but I don't need every series I watch to be an epic."
Blood & Water,"We've seen pretty much this same story play out the same way in so many movies, TV shows, etc. I didn't read the book, but none of the plot turns in the three episodes I've seen so far were in any way surprising or unexpected."
Blood & Water,"It's not brilliant, but I find it pretty entertaining so far."
Blood & Water,did reddit write the review?
Blood & Water,It’s like apologists on Reddit wanting to hear nothing but praise for things they like. Overcome. Don’t read the comments. Nobody cares.
Blood & Water,A pretty substantial part of this subreddit whines whenever people critique shows.
Blood & Water,Never heard of this - any good?
Blood & Water,Cool. While it had its flaws I enjoyed it while it aired. I thought it was cancelled.
Blood & Water,"Disappointed they're locking this behind Paramount+. 

I hope it does well for them so we get more of it, but I worry that, with all the time lost since Season One, it will get lost in the streaming shuffle."
Blood & Water,"Never heard of this show before now but it looks interesting, the treasure hunt/adventure thriller ala Uncharted/Dan Brown have always seemed to be a good fit for TV IMO but it isn't really common.

I guess it needs a big budget to be done well (that type of genre kind of rely on spectacle, action, beautiful vistas/ruins/historical places) and I'm not sure this one has a big budget considering they didn't really market it a lot"
Blood & Water,[deleted]
Castle Rock,Does Cleese need to pay for another divorce?
Castle Rock,Sounds like John needs money.
Castle Rock,"You know when would have been a great time to make more Fawlty Towers?  Right after they stopped making Fawlty Towers.

So re: this particular project, I think the trick this time would be not to have him be the manager (as he would have gone out of business ages ago), but a permanent guest who has to be on his best behaviour or he gets thrown out on the street.  Have  one of Manuel's kids running the place, so the only reason Basil gets to stay in the first place is as a favour to dear old dad."
Castle Rock,I'm sure it'll be as funny as all of Cleese's other projects of the past decade
Castle Rock,"If Cleese on Twitter is anything to go by, this'll be 6 episodes of Basil Fawlty complaining about how everything is too politically correct now"
Castle Rock,"A lot of times these things don't work. What is Cleese like 80? He is a genius, but old age gets us all in the end.

The saddest thing I ever saw was the elderly Laugh-In cast at the Emmys trying to do their old routine where they opened up small doors in a groovy wall and spouted one-liners. Went over like a lead balloon.

Life with Lucy was an attempt for a very old Lucielle Ball to have one more sitcom. Sad.

Sometimes you have to have the grace to know when to leave the stage."
Castle Rock,"You know studios have gotten so risk averse in their appetite for new writing or production when we're rebooting Fawlty Towers. Fuck me, I like the original, but it died and was buried years ago. Let it rest in peace."
Castle Rock,"In other news, duck's off."
Castle Rock,"I'm going to bet there will be an episode with Cleese ranting endlessly about cancel culture, since that's all he seems to do now."
Castle Rock,"Dang, can't wait till they bring back *Keeping up Appearances*"
Castle Rock,Is this the final boss of unnecessary revivals?
Castle Rock,"Hehe, Farty Towels."
Castle Rock,Why though
Castle Rock,Please god no.
Castle Rock,"Boy, he must owe those ex-wives a lot more money than I thought for him to be doing this.

I guess if we had one positive, it might help Americans learn how to pronounce ""basil"" properly."
Castle Rock,Never thought I'd see this happen. Honestly don't know what to think about it.
Castle Rock,I love Fawlty Towers. This is terrible news.
Castle Rock,I dunno guys...
Castle Rock,Even the thought of this happening is horrible.
Castle Rock,"""You couldn't make Fawlty Towers today!"" cried John from the GB News studio, as he signs the contract to make Fawlty Towers today."
Castle Rock,I can’t wait for Basil Fawlty to complain about the woke left /s
Castle Rock,"Not gonna lie, never thought this would happen. I hope they don't mess it up cause the original is flawless."
Castle Rock,"Fuckin' train wreck waiting to happen. 

Maybe they can cross over with Frasier and Night Court and form the ""over-the-hill guys make sitcom reboots no sane person asked for"" club."
Castle Rock,"Well, that wasn't on my bingo cards possibly because it's actually a calendar for August of 1997,

He's welcome to try, but I'm pessimistic.  It's hard to catch lightning in a bottle like that twice, especially given that this time he'll probably use a fanny pack^(\*) or something like that.

^(\*I believe that the British English term is, ""bum bag,"" and the British reaction to the American English term is confusion with slight alarm.)"
Castle Rock,Que? I know nothing.
Castle Rock,"Leave it alone. Christ, come with an original idea ffs"
Castle Rock,"If we're going to get a new project from one of the Pythons, can we just get a new Michael Palin travel documentary instead?"
Castle Rock,"Isn't Cleese one of those people that keeps banging on about how you could never do Fawlty Towers now without getting ""cancelled""?"
Castle Rock,How many episodes in until one of these characters shoehorns in a reference to cancel culture?
Castle Rock,"one of my all-time favorites. absolutely hilarious!!!

<edited>"
Castle Rock,"I’m sure it’ll be as funny as SNL! That is to say, not funny at all."
Castle Rock,"Camilla Cleese who? Never heard of them, cool that they are somehow starring and writing they must be really good. /s"
Castle Rock,Isn’t he a Conservative now?
Castle Rock,Well lah dee dah.
Castle Rock,This is what multiple expensive divorces reduced him to. Sad.
Castle Rock,Oh dear
Castle Rock,ugh. Ugh...
Castle Rock,Oh basil
Castle Rock,Just no.  You cannot remake perfection.  Sybil is everything.
Castle Rock,This is a terrible idea
Castle Rock,"Dan Stevens as Basil, Jamilla Jamil as Sybil, Emilia Clarke as Polly, and Nick Frost as Manuel."
Castle Rock,Awesome to see. I just rewatched all of the episodes last month!
Castle Rock,wonder if it will be on netflix...
Castle Rock,"Piss off, they won’t pull it off again. Different times now."
Castle Rock,"I can see the script now, written between stints on GB News ""Don't mention the woke, I mentioned it once but I think I got away with it alright""

Episode plots will no doubt include Basil's hilarious misunderstanding with a trans couple and lots of bellowing at Gen Z."
Castle Rock,"I can't wait for the episode where the Major says something horrifically racist and a blue-haired guest at the hotel has a go at him until John Cleese comes in and smacks them round the head with a tea tray then does a 10 minute monologue directly at the camera about ""freedom of speech"" and ""cancel culture""."
Castle Rock,"All these people on Reddit piling in to shit on Cleese… And I bet y’all think of yourselves as individuals and free thinkers. If you don’t find the old man funny, don’t watch. Second thread today I’ve been in where people who supposedly don’t care constantly mention they don’t care as they rip on someone they don’t care about."
Castle Rock,Hell yeah!
Castle Rock,One of my favorite shows of all time
Castle Rock,I used to love that show but I feel like this might be just another opportunity for Cleese to whine about cancel culture. I hope its good but I'm skeptical.
Castle Rock,Camilla is a painfully unfunny nepotism baby and her dad is a cranky old asshole now. No thanks.
Castle Rock,"Cancel culture has really taken it's toll on Cheese then, eh?"
Castle Rock,Hells yeah
Castle Rock,This is going to miss the mark so hard it’s going to destroy the legacy of Faulty Towers. The old man just hates minorities now and is likely look for an excuse to bitch.
Castle Rock,"Fawlty Towers is top 5 favorite sitcoms of all time for me. It only lasted 12 episodes so it didn't reach any point where they ran out of ideas. That's why it's so beloved.

 I still think John Cleese is hilarious (despite his very boomer mentality on comedy today) but I don't really know how they can replicate the genius of the old show with all these old writers. Basil had great physical comedy that I don't know if 80 year old John Cleese could pull off. If they get a good cast and some fresh writers, I can see it working. But with Cleese's stance on comedy, he may not be as welcoming of new ideas."
Castle Rock,I feel like Murray Bartlett's Armond belongs somewhere in here.
Castle Rock,This could be something special or a total dumpster fire.
Castle Rock,So this will be Cleese walking around calling everything woke and being edgy about it. Hard pass.
Castle Rock,Nah
Castle Rock,John Cleese is going to fuck this up and try to be edgy.
Castle Rock,The only thing I've heard from Cleese lately is racist and misogynistic. So I'm not really that excited for this.
Castle Rock,Here for all the cynical Sally comments.
Castle Rock,I can’t believe the negativity around John Cleese on this sub. The man is a legend in comedy. Enjoy his art while he is still here.
Castle Rock,The german scene with comb is the most insane humor nobody else could pull off
Castle Rock,"Well, this is certainly very unexpected. I love Fawlty Towers but this is a lot to process. I have faith in Cleese as an actor and writer, but why is he doing this so late? And I wonder if Connie Booth will be involved at all.

Although a couple years back he did reprise Basil in a specsaver commercial, that was pretty funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9tSN0178Us"
Castle Rock,You had me until John Cleese
Castle Rock,Terrible idea. He went from young and triumphant to old and directing his bitterness and bigotry towards whatever the Tory party says is bad
Castle Rock,"I can't imagine this will be any good... but that's what everyone here is saying, so I'll switch it up and be positive about it. :)

It's a pretty simple/solid premise. Hotel manager who hates his job (would probably rather see the guests just stop coming so they would stop bothering him), is always being bossed around by his wife, and has to deal with staff that have no clue what they are doing, and an assortment of difficult/odd/quirky guests.

Lots of ways it could go wrong, but if they stick to the original formula, avoid politics, and keep things simple, it could work. 

I think I'd want to see the whole hotel solidly stuck in the past. Not modernized in any way. Refusing to install wifi, rooms with ancient TVs in them, dining options from the 70s. And I don't want it to be about them becoming hip by learning about social media presence or anything like that. Just Fawlty stuck in this never-ending cycle. Maybe it being stuck in the past would make it into a popular boutique hotel, much to his dismay, and bookings would start flooding in from people wanting to gawk at the blast form the past.

Maybe that idea sucks... lol. First thing that came to mind."
Castle Rock,"Other great ideas 
-starting a land war in Asia"
Castle Rock,that sounds fucking great
Castle Rock,###YES!!!
Castle Rock,this is going to be so much out of touch boomer cringe
Castle Rock,No
Castle Rock,"**Prediction**: John Cleese demands jokes about how trans people are bad, is told no by the studio, and leaves the project within a year."
Castle Rock,Ooof. I hope they ony do 6 episodes or so. Each episode of the original is perfect.
Castle Rock,gonna suck so very much
Castle Rock,Reboot everything why not
Castle Rock,"We already have a Fawlty Towers reboot, it’s called White Lotus"
Castle Rock,would be awesome
Castle Rock,"You never know, he might cark it before this abomination gets into production."
Castle Rock,Fuck John Cleese and his ugly Fucking face
Castle Rock,"Maybe this time they could avoid taking the piss out of Spaniards (although I know there was no malice in the ideation of the character of Manuel, but still)."
Castle Rock,Oh wow.
Castle Rock,ty waterfowls
Castle Rock,And now for something completely different.
Castle Rock,Don't talk about the war!
Castle Rock,"Oh god no. The original is such a classic, sure it might have been short but I think it was the perfect length. Every episode was funny and unique and because it's short it never got to the point where it's stale. It said everything it needed to say, we don't need filler watering down the series just so John Cleese can pay for his divorces.

Not to mention he hasn't been particularly funny since 1988"
Castle Rock,What's the point? Someone is going to talk about the war.
Castle Rock,"Without even reading the first paragraph I knew exactly what the premise was going to be.... 
""Old man navigates modern world aka woke culture""

No guesses for which direction the jokes will be thrown at.

I REALLY hope this will be good, but I foresee this being a cynical comedy about a bitter man complaining his views aren't relevant enough."
Castle Rock,"Faulty is a total classic and I love watching it from time to time. I would love it if they could create some more that would be as good as the OG but that's just not going to happen. Leave it alone for the love of all that is good!

Ps I'm not looking forward to the Frazer reboot.. another I really love watching."
Castle Rock,They should get Murray Bartlett to star!
Castle Rock,I can’t stop reading all these comments in John Cleeses voice.
Castle Rock,Oh no.
Castle Rock,"I hate all his cancel/antiwokey stuff but what i liked best about FT were the plot set ups and the farcelike timing. If he can still manage that level of writing, it'd be great."
Castle Rock,"This would have been seriously exciting news 15 or more years ago.  


Now....I'm not so sure"
Castle Rock,Not everything needs a revival
Castle Rock,Que?
Castle Rock,Basaaaawl!
Castle Rock,Can I get a reboot for “Are You Being Served?”
Castle Rock,"Gods, that was a funny show. I remember himtelling somebody that a woman's laugh sounded like somebodymachine gunning a seal, which it did."
Sweet Magnolias,This and 'Virgin River' is catnip to the Hallmark crowd.
Sweet Magnolias,this is the first time I've ever heard of this show lol
Sweet Magnolias,"Anyone else love the first season for its unapologetic cheesiness, and then HATE the second season for becoming a terrible soap opera?"
Sweet Magnolias,Goddamn Netflix always cancelling shows after the second season.
Sweet Magnolias,"Has anyone seen this? I tried to watch the pilot and it was about as interesting as watching paint dry. Maybe it gets better, but I never went back to it."
Sweet Magnolias,"Netflix renewing the shows people least care about, sounds about right."
Sweet Magnolias,Good news for Georgia production!
Sweet Magnolias,"Virgin River is such a strange show. My wife and I watch it, and we both acknowledge it's not a *good* show, but there's something compelling about it. It's...cozy, I guess?"
Sweet Magnolias,My wife resembles that remark
Sweet Magnolias,a terrible soap opera with a whole lot of religious crap thrown in.
Sweet Magnolias,"It’s definitely not typical Reddit fair. And I wouldn’t say it’s a bad show if it’s the kind of show you like. 

I go through phases on what I want to watch, and sometimes, a low stakes show where everybody is happy for the most part is just what the doctor ordered"
Sweet Magnolias,"Lol you think you know more about what people are watching than the company that *actually has the metrics in front of them?*

r/television, ladies and gentlemen"
Sweet Magnolias,“If they don’t like the shows I like they’re not people”
Sweet Magnolias,This might be the most willfully ignorant comment I've ever seen on this subreddit.
Sweet Magnolias,My thoughts exactly! Hoping I can get on this show
Sweet Magnolias,can't believe they named an entire river after me
Sweet Magnolias,This is also the place where if you don’t like something popular that means the rest of society has been lying about liking it for some reason.  Empathy is a foreign concept. If you don’t think exactly like I do you are not real.
Sweet Magnolias,"Reddit:  Fuck Netflix, I'll just pirate the shows I like.   I'm not giving them any money.
  
Also Reddit:  What the fuck?  Why does Netflix keep cancelling the shows I like for this other bullshit?"
Sweet Magnolias,"""Wow, Sam Elliot is really old. Wait, that means he is 138 years  old. It must be the name of the TV show."""
Sweet Magnolias,"Sam and I, we go *way* back"
Sweet Magnolias,"There's a whole universe of popular Netflix romantic dramas that Reddit doesn't know exists. Virgin River is a huge one, it just got a fourth and fifth season which is unheard of for Netflix."
Sweet Magnolias,"I was gonna watch this once, then read the synopsis and was like, ""*Oh it's set in the South? Pass!*"""
Sweet Magnolias,"I don’t think the kids are very good at acting, the boys at least. Tough to watch for me but I already invested the time for season 1 so might as well continue."
Sweet Magnolias,Jamie Lynn Spears is acting again? How was I unaware of this?
Sweet Magnolias,I've been wondering about Jamie Lynn returning to the show! Glad they're all regulars now.
Sweet Magnolias,"No matter how many things Brandon Quinn appears in, I will always see him and think ""That's the guy from Big Wolf on Campus"" which used to repeatedly air on kids TV here in the UK"
Sweet Magnolias,"I saw S1 and she was.......OK. She played a very young, very naive, very sweet, very vulnerable character. It didn't ask much in terms of emotional range, which worked in her favour. 

Hopefully she gets more confidence in S2."
Sweet Magnolias,"Yeah I know what you mean. That show was a classic, why isn't it available anymore?

Still its nice to see him getting steady work again."
Sweet Magnolias,"I realise this is pure soap opera, but I really enjoyed it. Wall to wall hot guys on that show, thank you very much."
Sweet Magnolias,Its like a soapy version Reba.
Sweet Magnolias,"Yes, now I can finally watch the show! I've been wanting to give it a chance but chose to wait until it was renewed.

  
And so glad JoAnna Garcia-Swisher finally broke her one season curse!"
Sweet Magnolias,"Happy this has happened.

It's a good family show which is needed.

Renew Anne With an E also!

Otherwise it's just same type of show on Netflix."
Sweet Magnolias,"It reminds me of Hart of Dixie, but less funny. If you liked that one, you might like this one too."
Sweet Magnolias,"My wife loved this show, so she'll be happy to hear it got renewed. I on the other hand just couldn't watch it. It seems like I am not the target audience."
Sweet Magnolias,It’s not so much soap opera as it is a 10 hour hallmark movie
Sweet Magnolias,"Oh cool, I always liked her show when I was younger.

Its a shame she hasn't done anything since then. Its always kind of nice to watch a show with someone you liked when your younger in it."
Sweet Magnolias,"Good for her! If anyone deserves a second chance at acting, it’s her. I watched Zoey 101 and got back to watching some clips and she still does has a great deal of talent, so seeing this kind of warms my heart a little."
Sweet Magnolias,She is awful in it
Sweet Magnolias,So ur saying they can bring back Zoey 101? Pretty Please😆
Sweet Magnolias,">The Woman In The House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window 

that's a damn long title"
Sweet Magnolias,Interesting! I imagine Resident Evil must be on the chopping block for sure.
Sweet Magnolias,still pissed they cancelled archive 81
Sweet Magnolias,Where is Arcane on this list? Or did you start on the new year
Sweet Magnolias,Where's Heartstopper? That seemed to be much more popular than many of these shows and was defnintely in the top 10 for weeks
Sweet Magnolias,I mean I wouldnt have minded seeing the worldwide numbers
Sweet Magnolias,"It's a parody show, so the title is intentionally very long. I loved it and found it hilarious"
Sweet Magnolias,It's doing ok but if it has a high budget maybe that's not enough.
Sweet Magnolias,As dumb as it was it was fun and I made my way through all of it. Prob one of the few people hoping for a S02. Def not holding my breath for it though lol
Sweet Magnolias,"I started the week after Arcane's last appearance on the list, but it would only have 2 points"
Sweet Magnolias,Nobody cares about cartoons
Sweet Magnolias,It did better worldwide than in the US
Sweet Magnolias,"That’s a shame, it’s a really good show"
Sweet Magnolias,"Things worth noting:

- Vikings: Valhalla had a good second week but not a great one. It got the equivalent of 16.7 million complete viewings. Up from 11.9 million in the first week. A good performance but one of the lower second week gains for a “big” drama lately. 

- Inventing Anna finished week four with an impressive 7.7 million. Roughly the same as week one figures! An excellent hold and the first time I’ve seen numbers hold up like that outside of Squid Game. It finished its 4 week run with 47.9 million. Making it the biggest hit series on Netflix since Cobra Kai s4. The biggest show of 2022 so far just edging out All of Us Are Dead. 

- Two new arrivals had OK starts. Pieces of Her got an OK opening of 7.8 million. The hit of the week was docuseries Worst Roommate Ever which got a very impressive 13 million opening week! 

- Cuphead was solid again netting another 4 million viewings in its third week. This has been a shock hit. 

- Juvenile Justice bounced back a tiny bit from a dreadful week one (1.6 million) to hit 4.5 million viewings in its second week. Still the worst South Korean original post Squid Game but a small recovery and more solid week two numbers. 

- Five of the ten foreign language slots were filled with South Korean shows this week. Impressive! With Forecasting Love & Weather, Twenty Five Twenty One, Business Proposal, Thirty Nine, and Love ft Marriage & Divorce s3 all running weekly through April it probably explains why April is the first month in ages without a Netflix original South Korean show scheduled for the service. 

- Midnight at the Pera Palace made the charts in it first week but only managed 1.8 million viewings. After failing to make the charts in their opening week both Back to 15 (4.7 million) and Fame Game (1.9 million) did chart in their second week. 

- Space Force, Murderville, and Young Wallander s2 all failed to chart…again! It is fair to say these three shows have been massive flops for Netflix. Especially the expensive Space Force. 

The shows to look out for next week are The Last Kingdom s5, Queen of the South s5, and Formula 1 Drive to Survive s4. On the foreign language side they have Love Life & Everything in Between and An Astrological Guide to Broken Hearts s2 arriving. Probably going to be a quiet week for them outside of the F1 show. Looks like they are focusing on The Adam Project movie as the big drop of the coming week and avoiding any big hitting competition on the TV slate."
Sweet Magnolias,"Juvenile Justice is a good watch. It slips into silliness on occasion, and some of the directing choices are a bit too on the nose, but it’s very enjoyable. Korea are just cranking out quality shows left and right at the minute. 

Midnight at the Pera Palace is decent if you’re after something light with a bit of Turkish history thrown in."
Sweet Magnolias,"Nice to see that despite some negative comments, Valhalla is performing excellently."
Sweet Magnolias,Cuphead's figures are impressive considering how short the episodes are. I haven't watched it. Is it worth it for someone who hasn't played the game?
Sweet Magnolias,Of course it is. Most people don't give a damn that there's a half black woman in the cast.
Sweet Magnolias,"It’s the same old groups of people who kept bashing it. By now, we all know who they are and we all know what they are doing.

The show started at around 6.2 imdb score and has increased to 7.2 which is very impressive, plus indicates that review bombing exists."
Sweet Magnolias,"I hadn't even read that was something people were upset about, however it's (depressingly) not a surprise to hear that."
Sweet Magnolias,"The problem is that they gender and race flipped an actual historical character, Jarl Haakon - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_Sigurdsson

Had they simply invented a fictional character that was a half-black Viking there would be no issue with that, as Vikings actually went as far as Africa through their south incursions and technically mixed race Vikings would be possible. She even explains at some point that her grandfather met her grandmother in Africa.

Edit: someone posted [this link](https://www.newsweek.com/vikings-valhalla-jarl-haakon-real-person-black-viking-female-leader-caroline-henderson-1682608) below explaining that the Jarl Haakon from the show is not intended to be the real Jarl Haakon and is actually inspired in an amalgamation of characters. Anyhow, the article itself observes that ""History buffs may assume Jarl Haakon is based on the real historical figure also known as Haakon Sigurdsson"", which was likely the case for everyone. It wouldn't have hurt if they had used a fictional name without a clash with historical ones."
Sweet Magnolias,"Who cares, Vikings has never been historically accurate. Why kick up a fuss about it and let the dozens of other historical inaccuracies go without issue?"
Sweet Magnolias,History buffs would know that Kattegat is a fictional place not a historical place so they would understand she isn't Haakon Sigurdsson who was ruler of Norway. Also her character's name is Estrid Haakon.
Sweet Magnolias,"Except they didn't  gender and race flipped an actual historical character. It is just people like you keep spreading misinformation because of ill intent.  They invented a fictional character who was inspired by male and female characters from the Viking era. Kattegat is literally a fictional place and she rules Kattegat but Haakon Sigurdsson was ruler of Norway.

https://www.newsweek.com/vikings-valhalla-jarl-haakon-real-person-black-viking-female-leader-caroline-henderson-1682608"
Sweet Magnolias,"Vikings is known to be historically inaccurate in many cases, but you draw the line on black women?

The whole last season is based on a completely invented geopolitical event."
Sweet Magnolias,"Vikings always had historical inaccuracies, the fact that a town leader could just take someone's plunder, the shaman or whatever who looked like he was from a horror movie rather than an actual person, shieldmaidens and probably a bunch of other stuff this is just season 1 or so. Still I never remember it having such a gross historical inaccuracy, a black viking and female leader is nonsense. Just like how a white male Penthesilea Queen of the Amazons would be nonsense."
Sweet Magnolias,Because that's something that *looks* unusual and automatically drives to the history books lots of people that would otherwise just enjoy the show. =)
Sweet Magnolias,"I get it, black person = bad"
Sweet Magnolias,So race is the answer. Yikes. People really need to get a grip of themselves.
Sweet Magnolias,"And you=ignorant, do you just believe that anyone that has an opinion which challenges yours on a sensitive topic is automatically just a troll or some word that ends in ist?"
Sweet Magnolias,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent second week for Inventing Anna. After a middling first week (7.7 million) it got the equivalent of 19.5 million complete viewings in its second week. That brings it in line with the best weeks of Netflix hits like Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris. Though those shows did two weeks of that type of number rather than just a single week. It performed similarly to All of Us Are Dead!

- All of Us Are Dead (44.2 million), In From the Cold (12.8-14.5 million), and The Woman in the House (39.3 million) completed their 4 week run that Netflix loves. Two of the bunch were big hits. In From the Cold…not so much. Both the other shows topped the 4 week total for the latest season of Ozark (35.3 million). Impressive stuff! 

- Sweet Magnolias and Raising Dion chugged along in their third weeks with 3.5 million and 3.3 million complete viewings respectively. Not bad but neither show are big hits. I’ll be super interested to see if these middling ratings performers are going to do good enough for a third season renewal. 

- Space Force s2 and Young Wallander s2 failed to chart in their opening week. Which meant less than 3.4 million for Space Force s2 and less than 2.7 million for Young Wallander s2. Pretty poor for both! It shows why the performance of shows like Raising Dion and Sweet Magnolias might be good enough to stick around! Murderville failed to chart again on week 2 meaning it got less than 3.3 million. All flops. 

- One of Us is Lying got 2.4 million complete viewings week one in the charts. Not bad for a show that is not on in its biggest market (The US). 

- Cuphead was a big winner! I did not expect it to pop up in the charts due to its tiny runtime but thanks to the fact it got 5 million complete viewings in its first week it made the chart! 

- Both Fishbowl Wives (2.8 million) and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire (4.7 million) charted in their opening weeks. Pretty solid for Devotion! I’d expect a drop second week though as both got an unusual Monday release. 

I never did the numbers for Love is Blind but it is clear the show is another reality hit for Netflix. 

Vikings: Valhalla is the big release to look out for next week. On the foreign language side we have another South Korean show in Juvenile Justice to look out for as well as Fame Game from India."
Sweet Magnolias,Space Force only came out on the 18th. I assume it will be on next week.
Sweet Magnolias,It would be nice if these numbers were adjusted for the length of the show. A half hour show with the same amount of episodes as a full hour show has to get twice as many viewers to get on these lists.
Sweet Magnolias,"Its crazy to me that Inventing Anna is doing that well. The source material is great, but the execution is a disaster. I'm happy for Anna Chlumsky tho."
Sweet Magnolias,"None of that appeals to me at all, glad I cancelled Netflix. I'm even a cuphead addict but I'm not going to support that garbage."
Sweet Magnolias,You are getting downvotes but I agree with you. I’d rather they gave the equivalent completions data. I’ve calculated a bunch of that data myself and included it in my own post. The viewing hours metric absolutely favours shows with long run times.
Sweet Magnolias,"You’re being downvoted but there are literally only 2 shows here which have above average critic scores. Most of them don’t even have reviews lol

This is why I don’t like how people get defensive when someone complains about the quality of Netflix material. Sure they produce the same amount of good stuff as other streamers, but it’s frustrating when they do so despite releasing so much more content than other streamers."
Sweet Magnolias,Thank you. I've been paying for Netflix for 10 years but 3 weeks ago let it cancel and my wife hasn't even noticed yet. She prefers peacock or even Pluto tv with tons of ads.
Sweet Magnolias,"Things worth noting:

- All of Us Are Dead held well in its third week on the chart and was the top TV show of the week not only by viewing hours but by the far more relevant complete viewings metric. It pulled in the equivalent of 9.3 million completions this week. It has more viewings in three weeks than the latest season of Ozark managed in four weeks. It has been a big hit for Netflix!

- Inventing Anna had an OK start but nothing special. It got the equivalent of 7.7 million complete view in its first week. It will definitely do better week two but how big the jump is will be crucial for how successful this show ends up being for Netflix. 

- Sweet Magnolias (6.9 million) and Raising Dion (5.6 million) both did OK in their second weeks but are not trending to be one of Netflix’s more popular English language series. Sweet Magnolias second week increase was a little disappointing while Raising Dijon’s week two decline was also a bit disappointing for it. Both have performed OK over the opening few weeks so I’ll be interested to see if that is considered good enough for renewal or not by Netflix in the coming months. Sweet Magnolias in particular does not look an expensive show to produce. 

- The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window has been an excellent performer for Netflix. It got the equivalent of 6.5 million complete viewings in its third week. That puts it at around 36 million total over its first three weeks in the charts. That is good! Netflix finally have a hit comedy and unfortunately it was a limited series! 

- In From the Cold just made the list in week three with 2.4 million complete viewings. It has been one of the worst performing English language shows of recent releases. A few comedies like After Life and Murderville failed to chart but for all we know might have performed better. The charts do not favour shows with short overall runtimes. 

- Dark Desire s2 had a decent second week with 5.1 million complete viewings but Toy Boy s2 had a quiet opening with just 2.4 million completions in its opening week on the chart. Until Life Do Us Part, a Portuguese dramadey, failed to chart in its opening week. 

Space Force s2, Young Wallander s2, and One of Us is Lying are the big English language TV shows to watch out for next week while in the foreign language category we have Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire, Fishbowl Wives, and Secrets of Summer all hoping to make an impression on the chart!"
Sweet Magnolias,"I always expect these ""top watched shows"" correlate with whatever Netflix wants on the frontpage. Like, back when I had netflix the most watched was often the one highlighted. It's not really that much of a surprise. Like, take a terrible show/movie and put it on the frontpage + tell everyone that this is the most watched show/movie = profit."
Sweet Magnolias,Season 2 of Raising Dion was......Interesting
Sweet Magnolias,"All of Us Are Dead is a hit and Sweet Magnolias looks like a solid mid level performer for them 

Disenchantment Season 4 flopped, for a returning veteran show I expect at least one solid week in the top 5. It didn't even show up on the other Netflix top 10 thing.

In from the Cold and The Silent Sea are the most DOA of new Netflix shows of the last few months"
Sweet Magnolias,Thanks for the break down.
Sweet Magnolias,I think just throwing up various minutes watched for various length shows with world wide viewer data is already munging things up enough that it's impossible to tell what actually is and isn't popular.
Sweet Magnolias,"The Silent Sea performed decent enough. It got the equivalent of around 15-17 million complete viewings over four weeks in the charts. Nothing special but better than a lot of shows. The big negative for The Silent Sea is the fact it was the least popular of the 4 Korean shows that have followed Squid Game. D.P, the Korean show that released before Squid Game, got renewed with a 4 week viewership of under 9 million. Though it is fair to say it was not as expensive to produce as The Silent Sea. 

For perspective Narcos Mexico s3 got 13 million over the same timeframe. Locke & Key s2 got about 18 million. After Life s2 got around 7 million. Lost in Space s3 got 18 million. Archive 81 got around 18-20 million. 

All is not lost for The Silent Sea!"
Sweet Magnolias,I agree.
Sweet Magnolias,"Maybe. My method is to track by netflix top 10 (giving 10 points to #1, 9 points to #2), since I started tracking in December Silent Sea is my lowest ranked new show of the ones that made it with 5th on its debut and then off the chart. In from the Cold did 9, 6 then off, Bebop had 2, 9 then off."
Sweet Magnolias,"Tracking by viewing hours or equivalent views (my favourite metric of those available) is far more relevant than tracking by Top 10 points. If only because where you land in the Top 10 can vary by competition but viewing hours and equivalent views are solid regardless. 

Which is to say some weeks the 5th placed Top 10 show or movie could beat the best in another week. Just depends on when a popular run of shows come along. Unfortunately for The Silent Sea it got released alongside four of Netflix most popular shows of the last 6 months in Money Heist, The Witcher, Emily in Paris, and Cobra Kai. Those shows were absolute monsters and that made an OK performing The Silent Sea look bad by comparison.

Bebop was a massive flop by every metric. It only got around 10-11 million complete viewings. Even In the Cold is going to beat that!"
Sweet Magnolias,You appear to be using global which is also why you have the total hours viewed and why shows like Emily in Paris do better than in my ranking where it is more of a mid level success. I am using US.
Sweet Magnolias,"Things worth noting:

- The big winner of the week is All of Us Are Dead. It gained the equivalent of 19.5 million completions in week two. That is a figure that brings it in line with Netflix’s biggest hits of recent times like Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris. Squid Game got a lot more but that show is just an absolute monster and an anomaly. Be interesting to see if All of Us Are Dead can mimic Squid Game and peak in week 3 or if week 2 will be the peak as it is for almost all Netflix drama series. 

- The Women in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window also had a fantastic week. The viewing hours metric favours longer runtime shows but the reality was this show got 17.8 million completions in its second week. Nearly matching All of Us Are Dead! A very good week two. 

- Ozark slowed down in week three. It got the equivalent of 6.5 million completions. It has been a solid performer for Netflix but lags a good bit behind shows like Emily in Paris and The Witcher in terms of viewership. 

- In From the Cold looks DOA. It got 6.7 million completions in week two (up from 3.7 million week one) but is one of the worst performing Netflix English language shows of recent times. 

- New arrivals Raising Dion (9.1 million) and Sweet Magnolias (5.1 million) had decent opening weeks. The numbers for Raising Dion were particularly impressive. Murderville failed to chart meaning it got less than 5 million. The metric simply does not favour short run time comedies like Murderville or After Life. 

- It was a good opening weekend for Dark Desire s2 with the equivalent of 5.8 million completions meaning it pipped a number of English language originals! 

- I’ve not crunched the numbers for I Am Georgina but it has racked up impressive numbers for two weeks in a row so it is fair to assume it has been a big hit for the service. 

One other small thing of note: this is actually just Feria: The Darkest Light’s second week on Netflix. For the curious it garnered 2.4 million completions. 

All in all this was a good week for Netflix with both All of Us Are Dead and The Woman in the House performing at the top end of Netflix shows in the last 7 months. Then they had some solid performances from the supporting shows."
Sweet Magnolias,I think we can basically gaurentee The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window a S02 at this point.
Sweet Magnolias,"I started In From The Cold, but it just didn't grap me at all. Even though in theory it sounds like something I would like. 

Ive only heard bad things about The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window, mostly that it is supposed to be a parody, but that it just falls flat. But apparantly there are people watching it, so maybe I should give it a chance."
Sweet Magnolias,They listed it as a limited series but given the excellent ratings it will be interesting to see if they try to bring it back. They probably need it considering how poorly the comedy genre has done for them lately!
Sweet Magnolias,"Yeah, the only real thing that's popping in the numbers in the last while has been Emily in Paris. And neither this show nor Emily In Paris are critical darlings. Netflix needs to step up its game."
Sweet Magnolias,"I’m not sure what has gone awry at Netflix in terms of comedy hits but something definitely has as they have cancelled 18/24 comedies launched across 2020 and 2021. That is an abysmal record. Most have sank with hitting with either viewers or critics. 

At least Emily in Paris and now The Woman in the Window were big hits with viewers. 

As for award winning shows? I think Netflix seem to be struggling in that department since axing senior TV executive Cindy Holland and replacing her with Bela Bejaria. Bejaria has found a bunch of hit shows with the viewers but seems to be struggling to win over award voters with her commissions. 

Be interesting to see how Inventing Anna fares. Netflix have been pushing it hard and I do think they had hopes it could be this years Queen’s Gambit or Maid. Unfortunately for them the critics do not seem to be taking to the show. We will see in the next couple of weeks how regular viewers feel. I think The Woman in the House was another Netflix awards hopeful that seems to have meet a lukewarm response from critics but the failure there was mitigated by the fact it has proven to be a viewer hit. Be interesting to see if the same thing happens for Investing Anna. 

Netflix definitely need some new comedy shows though as a lot of their awards friends stuff like Grace & Frankie, The Kominsky Method, Glow, Dead to Me, and After Life have wrapped or are heading into final seasons. There does not seem to be any replacements on the horizon."
Sweet Magnolias,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent third week for Inventing Anna. Week three (13 million) beat week one (7.7 million) and that is still pretty rare for Netflix shows. It is a sign of good word of mouth. It has racked up the equivalent of just over 40 million complete viewings over three weeks and should hit around 45-46 million by the week four mark. That will make it a decent hit for Netflix and have it just behind stuff like Cobra Kai and Emily in Paris and about level with All of Us Are Dead. 

- It was an OK opening week for Vikings: Valhalla. It got the equivalent of 11.9 million complete viewings. That is solid. If it jumps week two we can consider it a hit. 

- One of Us is Lying got 5.2 million week two. Pretty solid considering it is not in the US domestic market. It beat stuff like Space Force, Murderville, and Young Wallander comfortably and those shows were everywhere! It has been a solid pick-up. 

- Space Force s2 finally charts with 3.8 million week two! Pretty awful. This must be headed for cancellation. It cannot be cheap to make with the talent involved and it gets beat by limited region buy-ins like One of Us is Lying and animated shows like Cuphead! 

- Raising Dion s2, Sweet Magnolias s2 , and Dark Desire s2 wrapped their 4 week run with totals of 20.2 million, 17.7 million, and 15.4 million respectively. Solid but unspectacular for the English language shows but pretty impressive numbers for Dark Desire! 

- Cuphead exceeded expectations again by growing from 5 million week one to 7.2 million week two. It is definitely a surprise hit! 

- Terrible start for Juvenile Justice. It just got the equivalent of 1.6 million complete viewings opening week. By far the worst of any post-Squid Game South Korean original by a large distance and easily being beat by licensed weekly shows like Forecasting Love and Weather and Twenty Five, Twenty One both of which only released their opening couple of episodes. 

- Two new foreign language shows Fame Game and Back to 15 failed to chart opening week putting them below 1.8 million and 3 million respectively. Not a great start for either show though they probably did not fare much worse than Juvenile Justice!  

- Fishbowl Wives and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire chart again but with 1.9 million and 2.6 million they are definitely not big hits. 

- Poor Young Wallander s2 joins After Life s3 and Murderville as rare English language shows that just fail to make the charts. 

Overall it looks like viewership at Netflix was down this week on the whole compared to previous weeks. Mostly thanks to shows like Space Force, Young Wallander, Disenchantment, Murderville, and Juvenile Justice all flopping and not holding or gaining any decent numbers. 

Next week Pieces of Her is the big English language release to look out for in the charts with Midnight at the Pera Palace, Lies and Deceit, and Savage Rhythm the non-English titles due for release."
Sweet Magnolias,"Vikings is at number 1 now. It was released on the 25th (end of the week) which is presumably why is 2nd here.

Agree about Space Force, but wish it was higher up as I really want this to continue. Guess it depends on what the budget was."
Sweet Magnolias,Almost done with Inventing Anna. What a Bullshit show that wastes so much time getting to the fucking point. This should be 4-6 hours tops.
Sweet Magnolias,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Sweet Magnolias,"Is outer banks that good, didn't see much buzz here"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,May 19
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"His last one was the saddest and funniest thing I've ever seen. I was laughing through tears. Not laughing so hard I cried, I was dreadfully sad and full of empathy for the man and laughing at the jokes he was telling about his crushing grief."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,“I want all the ham!”
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I hope the crowd just names what shows he been in, he makes a shit ton of money and walks off the stage"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"The Angry Magician is legitimately one of the funniest bits I’ve seen.  It kills me every time.  Also Dr. Pepper.  I’m glad to see him doing better.  Grieving a loss that profound in the public eye had to be excruciating.  

And to the trolls saying he killed her: his deceased wife was a true crime writer who cracked the very cold Golden State Killer case 30 some years after the fact and from beyond the grave.  If Patton were a killer, she would have known it before he did."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I hear he doesn't like Bill Cosby.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I can't wait for this. I still use ""And what the hell, a couple of corn dogs!"" from his Black Angus routine while listing out something exhaustive."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"TIL that there are people on this sub that think Patton Oswalt isn't funny.

And I just realized this is /r/television and not /r/StandUpComedy"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I'm currently binging season 4 of *Justified*, and I have to say I love his recurring character on that show.

Maybe five years ago, I had no idea who he was, then suddenly he's in everything I watch."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,But does he love Demon Cop?
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"""I love everything"" even Demon Cop, Alian Force and Games of Survival?"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Didn't he talk shit on Cinemassacre because James didn't want to watch Ghostbusters (2016)?
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Love Patton Oswalt. I just finished the fourth season of Veronica Mars, and the whole time was thinking “damn, I could use more Patton Oswald in my life”"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Patton seems like one of those guys who wants everyone to think he's nice and kind but secretly has a heart full of hate. I think many celebs are like that.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,except his wife
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Such a legend
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,His last special was brilliant
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Never watched his stuff, any good? I remember his scene in 22 jump street which was hilarious"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I hope I’m not the only one that loves Happy!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,He's not funny
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I love Patton sooo much.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I love Patton’s style and delivery. He’s gotten much funnier to me as I get older
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I want all the HAM
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,This guy sucks.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Fantastic news! One of the best stand ups. Can't wait. :D
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[removed]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I need more Patton Oswalt in my life. By far my favourite stand-up comic.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I don’t think he’s a very funny guy, just saying."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,He deserves everything good in the world.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Patton Oswalt Loves little boys. - sick pedo POS
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"His last one wrecked me, talk about a nightmare."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,It was meh.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Fuck that guy
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Wonderful news for a wonderful man. If you have not read his autobiography I would highly recommend it. Love this man so much 🥰😍❤️
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[removed]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Stand up comedy has really sucked the past 5-10 years imo
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I was supposed to see this set last week in Anaheim but he has to cancel to Corona. Glad I’ll still get to experience it
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[removed]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Glad he's back at it
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Hm.  Nah.

Not liked the guy ever since he unrepentantly lambasted AVGN.  Twitter seems to be the place where people reveal their true colors, eventually."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I really hope it’s not about being a parent or shitting on Trump.  All my favorite comics are going in that direction now and it just feels lazy.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"If y’all haven’t see Big Fan yet go give it a watch. It’s an incredible film and he gave an equally incredible performance. Kevin Corrigan also nailed his role and it offers a fun Michael Rappaport sighting, too. Young Adult with Charlize Theron is good, as well. Another fantastic performance by Oswalt. Both dark films and a bit different, which is nice. 

P. S. I’m so glad he married Natty. I always felt sad that she didn’t end up with Harry or the wolf."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,He stinks
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Saw this live in Charlotte, NC, supposedly when they filmed it.  It’s weird to be literal when I say the world was so different back then."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Netflixis going full community and I’m here for it
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I had a free trial for XM radio and he came on the comedy channel once and did this long 15min set about a death bed or death couch.  It was a horror movie and this object was the killer.  I had to pull over I was laughing so hard.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I’ll def watch this. Glad they put up “Happy” on Netflix too, sucks that there won’t be anymore seasons tho."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"love me some patton oswalt standup.

he gets typecast in movies and tv as 'the short weirdo' because of his looks. dude's actually really funny and has won awards for a reason."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Spenceeeeee!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Wife Killer Patton Oswalt
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Including murdering his wife with pills. “Allegedly”
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Hard pass on this.

Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I’d rather watch Andy Dick... and I hate Andy Dick

Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,He has a beautiful soul. I’ll support anything he does.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Nice!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I think this is the show I saw a while back.  Pretty meh response from the whole crowd. I laughed a bit at the crowd work.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,This guy lost his mind years ago. His shit stinks
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,His last special was a little weak but he’s pretty funny in his acting roles
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[removed]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,!remind me 37 days
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I love that man.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,seriously? I love everything”? He’s constantly ranting about hating the POTUS.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I can't look at that guy for an hour.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"He's a good actor for that one supporting role every show casts him as, but he suuucks at stand up"
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[deleted]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,He has tweets saying that he is a pedo....not slander
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[removed]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Hey look it's remi from Ratatouille
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,But does he love Demon Cop?
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I never thought he was funny but felt for him when he lost his wife.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Hard pass. Never found him funny.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,We need Joey Diaz
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,YES. THANK YOU.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,One of the unfunniest comedians since Seinfeld or Dane Cook. A truly boring man.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Pass
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Patton Oswalt Loves little boys. - sick pedo POS
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Um. Melt, little snowflake."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Shave your legs or kiss me
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I don’t like that guy.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Great... a subpar comedian who has made me laugh 3 times in my entire life, 2 of which were due to mystery science theater... meh."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,he should hang it up already
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,His wife was my childhood dream girl.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"I love Patton so much, especially how he is a part of the illuminati and was complicit in the murder of his wife Michelle McNamara who was getting closer and closer to intimate details in the case of The Golden State Killer."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,[deleted]
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,*slides $20 over* make it April 19
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,The Cuervo Gold!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,This is why I went to the comments before the article.
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Great, so *She-Ra*'s last season drops on the 15th, and then I have this to look forward to as a sort of comedy Neosporin."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,I can’t wait this long!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,My birthday!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"Yeah, his last one was amazing. The feels came out of no where, but I was hooked on every word."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,LITTLE GIRL!!!!
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,"It breaks my heart to watch it, especially now that I'm a father myself. But it's an amazing show i've watched multiple times now.

Every time he posts something on instagram with his daughter and new wife hanging out having fun I think to myself ""they're going to be just fine""."
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Is that the one where the punchline to one of the bits was basically “I should have died and not my wife”?
Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything,Patton Oswalt: Annihilation came out the same week my mom died in 2017. It really helped me out.
The Big Flower Fight,Jean Smart HAS to win that comedy actress award. Her performance in Hacks is far and away the best TV I've watched in a while.
The Big Flower Fight,"TV Winners:

* DRAMA ENSEMBLE - **The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTRESS - **Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTOR - **Jason Bateman, Ozark**
* COMEDY ENSEMBLE - **Abbott Elementary**
* COMEDY ACTRESS - **Jean Smart, Hacks**
* COMEDY ACTOR - **Jeremy Allen White, The Bear**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — FEMALE ACTOR - **Jessica Chastain, George & Tammy**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — MALE ACTOR - **Sam Elliott, 1883**
* STUNT ENSEMBLE - **Stranger Things**"
The Big Flower Fight,The Bear is a Comedy???
The Big Flower Fight,I hope Jeremy Allen White wins the Emmy. He is such a good actor and The Bear is so good
The Big Flower Fight,"How did the cast of Game of Thrones never win Drama Ensemble at the SAG Awards? Forget the writing of S8 (well S7 too), the show had a phenomenal cast."
The Big Flower Fight,"I’ve seen White Lotus. I’ve seen Better Call Saul. 

Rhea Seehorn not even being nominated in favor of Jennifer Coolidge, and Coolidge winning, kind of boggles my mind."
The Big Flower Fight,Redditors seething at yet another BCS snub in favor of Ozark.
The Big Flower Fight,Really enjoyed this season of Abbott Elementary. Glad to see others did as well.
The Big Flower Fight,"I cannot believe Sam Elliot won over Paul Walter Hauser, Evan Peters, Taron Egerton and Steve Carrell in the ""Male Actor in Miniseries or TV Movie"". He was, IMO, the worst choice in the whole category. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the other nominees were far, far better."
The Big Flower Fight,The bear is the most stressful comedy I’ve ever watched.   Wait no i take that back. Space jam
The Big Flower Fight,I can tell by these comments that the Abbott elementary backlash is about to start.
The Big Flower Fight,I still haven't gotten around to *The Bear* but Jeremy Allen White must have been incredible to beat out Bill Hader for *Barry*.
The Big Flower Fight,"In terms of best acting in a Comedy, hands down Abbott Elementary delivered great comedy acting. In terms of the best acting in that category though, it’s Barry without question. It just wasn’t really “comedy” this season 🤷🏼‍♂️

Same could be said for The Bear."
The Big Flower Fight,I didn't know anything about Abbott Elementary until I heard about all their golden globe sweeps and I gave it a go and now it's one of my current fav shows and my main comfort happy place watch.
The Big Flower Fight,"Abbott Elementary is perfectly *enjoyable*, but I'm still very surprised when they *win the big categories especially over the other shows listed."
The Big Flower Fight,I dont get the love for white lotus.  I tried to watch it and it's just a show about shitty hotel guests?  Why not just watch reality tv?
The Big Flower Fight,The White Lotus and Bear were phenomenal
The Big Flower Fight,The awards need to get their shit together when it comes to comedy categories
The Big Flower Fight,"Great to see Abbot winning ! It’s an amazing show and one of the few that I can sit and watch with my parents and we all enjoy together . 
More such shows please… please 🙏"
The Big Flower Fight,"Ugh, Severance deserves better."
The Big Flower Fight,The Bear was phenomenal
The Big Flower Fight,[deleted]
The Big Flower Fight,"The show bear makes you realize what a shitty career a chef is, extremely hard stressful job with little pay"
The Big Flower Fight,As they should.
The Big Flower Fight,"What am I missing with Abbott Elementary?  I watched the first few episodes and they were just, not good at all.  What is the charm I'm missing on this?"
The Big Flower Fight,"Unpopular opinion here:  I watched The Bear and don’t really get what all the hype was about.  I mean I thought it was OK but nothing really above and beyond anything else I’ve seen the past year.  And before anyone says anything, yes I’ve worked in a restaurant before"
The Big Flower Fight,"Why do people give a shit about Hollywood giving Hollywood bullshit awards as one massive circle-jerk?

I don't watch any of them, but the only that would mean anything to me at all would be Viewers' Choice Awards."
The Big Flower Fight,"Sam Elliot's performance in 1883 winning over Paul Walter Hauser's performance in Black Bird is absolutely criminal. Sam Elliot just acted like Sam Elliot, Paul Walter Hauser became a cold-blooded killer."
The Big Flower Fight,Crazy I've never even heard about all three shows
The Big Flower Fight,Now there’s an award for sag?
The Big Flower Fight,"Abbott Elementary is so overrated. It’s ok. If it came out in the 80s or 90s, it wouldn’t even be a blip on the radar."
The Big Flower Fight,"My aging badge of honor is that I have never heard of these shows.  Ahhh, I remember fondly when I cared about TV, and wish I had the time."
The Big Flower Fight,Looks like they rounded up 4 of the ugliest women in the audience and said do your worst smile
The Big Flower Fight,"Really happy for Jessica Chastain, she was phenomenal as Tammy Wynette."
The Big Flower Fight,I haven’t seen White Lotus yet but I have seen the other two shows and they are what I would quantify as “good watchable television” which is a standard that’s getting higher and higher with how much is being shown. I’m going to watch White Lotus.
The Big Flower Fight,I really like Abbott Elementary.
The Big Flower Fight,"She is fantastic, but the show isn’t going to hold up as she is all they have."
The Big Flower Fight,"Wait, The Bear was a comedy? I must have been watching it wrong."
The Big Flower Fight,"Not surprised *Stranger Things* won the Stunt award - it got the Stunt Coordination Emmy last year. Of particular note would be ""Dear Billy"", which included a one continuous shot gun battle and an impressive drop from height."
The Big Flower Fight,That BCS lost to WL is a joke
The Big Flower Fight,All great shows with a lot of variety. I would have gave Zendaya the win over Jennifer or BCS over WL ensemble
The Big Flower Fight,"Jennifer Coolidge won as a dramatic actress? 

I'm so confused"
The Big Flower Fight,Obvious for a drama ensemble. White lotus season 2 was a riot.
The Big Flower Fight,I’m getting orange is the new black flashbacks after reading your comment
The Big Flower Fight,It’s especially odd considering White Lotus was placed as a drama.
The Big Flower Fight,"Yeah, every time I see The Bear listed as a comedy, I kind of do a double take. I guess there's some funny stuff, but even if it's a dark comedy, it's much more of a ***DARK*** (comedy), it seems to me."
The Big Flower Fight,"And the award for best heavy metal album goes to...


...Jethro Tull

SAG awards are kinda like that."
The Big Flower Fight,And the White Lotus in the drama category...
The Big Flower Fight,Dark comedy to me
The Big Flower Fight,C’mon cousin
The Big Flower Fight,I downloaded it having heard nothing except that it was labelled as a “comedy” show with great reviews. Was confused and exhausted as fuck by the end of the first episode. Was expecting a relaxing laugh.
The Big Flower Fight,"Historically, like from the Greeks, comedy just means it’s going to have a happy ending and is the opposite of tragedy"
The Big Flower Fight,"In one episode they accidentally drugged a birthday party full of kids. That’s IASIP-type humor.

Yes, its a comedy."
The Big Flower Fight,"Oh damn. He was good in shameless, and the bear is at 100% on rotten tomatoes. I need to check that out. No Hulu though"
The Big Flower Fight,"HEARD, CHEF"
The Big Flower Fight,Hulu better not fuck up and bring it back for season 2. They already canceled Reboot 😒
The Big Flower Fight,SAG didn't seem to like GOT at any point.
The Big Flower Fight,[deleted]
The Big Flower Fight,"Because many of the top billed actors in GoT were mediocre at best.

Kit Harrington,
Emilia Clarke,
Sophie Turner,
Maisie Williams,
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

They were doing fine in some scene or another maybe; but nothing memorable about their performances overall. Actually with Jon and Sansa it was as wooden acting as it gets all through. The show was a lot of fun but in terms of acting it was meh."
The Big Flower Fight,It’s not an ensemble. composed of multiple PRINCIPLE actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly EQUAL AMOUNTS OF SCREEN TIME.
The Big Flower Fight,"It really does feel weird to me that it’s being pushed so hard as a drama. Both seasons to me feel like 90% comedy with the last episode trying to go full dramatic tilt. 

It would be like trying to push the Righteous Gemstones as a drama or thriller instead of comedy purely because there are a few dramatic elements to it."
The Big Flower Fight,Its beyond parody.
The Big Flower Fight,And Jason Bateman winning for Ozark. SAGs are worse than the Golden Globes
The Big Flower Fight,"Kudos to The White Lotus which has successfully jumped categories and is winning every guild award possible.  I don’t see it losing the Emmy for Best Drama later this year, and I thought the first season was better than the second lol.  Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White have a lot of voters everywhere rooting for them it seems.  HBO will have a hard time choosing which of its series to promote as Best Drama."
The Big Flower Fight,It’s some sort of sick joke
The Big Flower Fight,I like Coolidge but she didn't do anything we haven't seen her do 100 times before so I really don't see why she was even nominated
The Big Flower Fight,"Yeah. I enjoyed White Lotus, but pretty much every other actor in that show was better than Jennifer Coolidge. She was fine, but she doesn't deserve an Emmy."
The Big Flower Fight,I don't get the love for White Lotus. It was bland.
The Big Flower Fight,I swear people around here only pay attention to award shows for validation of their own opinions. Any time something they want to win doesn’t win or get nominated the put on an Olympic level mental gymnastics performance of why instead of just accepting that not everyone thinks the same way as them. It’s sad really.
The Big Flower Fight,[deleted]
The Big Flower Fight,"It's a nice accurate representation of the school systems in black and brown communities. May not be the freshest directing style, but you don't see many comedies actually highlight this stuff."
The Big Flower Fight,"I get that it highlights some big issues, but I just don’t find it funny at all. Lame jokes, writing that is too obvious and set ups that fall flat."
The Big Flower Fight,"I haven’t liked it. It’s fine but not award-winning. Too many mediocre actors and too few surprising, original moments. To each their own though! At least it’s not a formulaic horseshit show like Big Bang Theory or 2.5 Men."
The Big Flower Fight,"I have to agree, and I was a big fan of 1883 but Sam Elliot - played himself - again - the others played and transformed themselves into their characters. All these awards are a scam."
The Big Flower Fight,Understandable. The stakes were high in Space Jam. Anyone who has ever balled out to defeat an evil cadre of basketball playing aliens probably had some flashbacks
The Big Flower Fight,[deleted]
The Big Flower Fight,Start? I feel like it’s been ongoing. Almost every day I see a low effort “DAE think Abbot Elementary is overrated?” post in this sub.
The Big Flower Fight,Network shows and comfort food shows eill always do poorly on the internet.
The Big Flower Fight,"Jeremy Allen White is reallllllly good in the Bear. He crushes a devastating monologue in the final episode of the season. But all season long he does a lot of small stuff so well and a weaker actor would've over acted when he went for subtleties. And when he does explode it feels so much more impactful.

Hader has been incredible, but he has gotten two Emmys for his acting in Barry. Would be a-ok if Jeremy Allen White got it."
The Big Flower Fight,I think half the shows in the comedy categories are way more dramatic than comedy and are lucky they aren’t clocked as such … it’s kind of unfair to have two half jokes an episode and then super serious scenes that allow for range and dramatics the rest of the season and then get called a comedy.  Abbott is one of the only true intentional comedies this season and so I think their wins make complete sense.
The Big Flower Fight,you don't have high quality writing and high end gays on reality tv
The Big Flower Fight,Some of the acting wins were surprises.  Amanda Seyfried and Zendaya were rolling until now.
The Big Flower Fight,And they wonder why ratings are dipping
The Big Flower Fight,"For me, the show is enjoyable but not excellent in any way."
The Big Flower Fight,"I haven’t seen it yet, but I’ve only heard good things about it from people I know. Not everyone is going like the same things though."
The Big Flower Fight,"I quite like Abbott elementary, I think the relationships between characters is awesome and the show is warm and fun. Principal Ava is the best part of the whole thing though lol"
The Big Flower Fight,"Nothing. I mean I think it does get better as the first season goes along, but it’s just parks & rec in a public school, and it’s fine. It’s enjoyable, occasional funny and warm moments, but it’s nothing new or innovative which I don’t believe all tv has to be, but I wouldn’t go giving it awards especially when it’s surrounded by other comedies that are doing all that."
The Big Flower Fight,"Agreed, the constant looks towards the camera was a huge turn off to me"
The Big Flower Fight,"I haven't watched it yet, but we all have different tastes.

The shows I think are mediocre to bad which are incredibly popular? Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad, Scandal, That 70s Show, Seinfeld, Friends...

I could go on and on. It's okay not to like it."
The Big Flower Fight,It drives discussion and gives a reason to reflect back on the year of projects that got realsed. It's a chance to help solidfy the long term appreciation for some of these projects.
The Big Flower Fight,You’re not missing much
The Big Flower Fight,She’s had a really good year.  Only the reigning Oscar winner could beat Amanda Seyfried.
The Big Flower Fight,"Huh, is she leaving the show?"
The Big Flower Fight,The bear as a comedy and white lotus as a drama…..i think its getting fucking obvious that genre-fencing is collapsing
The Big Flower Fight,I binge watched it a while back and don’t remember laughing. I remember a dead family member and lots of yelling.
The Big Flower Fight,"Listen cousin, I'm from that part of Chicago so it was a comedy to me and if you've got a problem with that we can take it outside and work it out. Then we'll come back in this kitchen and do our jobs normal like while everyone else shakes with anxiety and tiptoes around us awkwardly. You got that!

Honestly this is exactly the way my family acts. Scares my husband to death, he's constantly worried he's about to get his ass kicked. He hates going home to Chicago for a visit."
The Big Flower Fight,For anyone who's worked in a kitchen... ya... definitely not a comedy.
The Big Flower Fight,You think the scene with a bunch of kids who accidentally ingest downers and it’s laughed off would imply anything else?
The Big Flower Fight,Dear Billy was the best ST episode ever
The Big Flower Fight,"And again, Odenkirk & Laura Linney don’t win in a final season.  Just absolutely ridiculous. WL was great.  Bateman is great, but comparatively, and since it’s the last chance to do it, absolutely ridiculous, and even more that Rhea Seehorn wasn’t even nominated. 🙄"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Does Noah Hawley sleep?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I'm always down for more Noah Hawley projects, but how much more Noah Hawley is there to give?"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,And I think one of his novels is being adapted for film.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Well, Legion is done after this season. I dont know where Fargo season 4 is at but they had cast Chris Rock a while ago. Dr. Doom seems to be on hold. He has met with Kevin Feige but nothing concrete there. I could see him getting a more out there MCU opportunity in Phase 4 or 5.  I think he's had another show or miniseries in the works too."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"> I dont know where Fargo season 4 is at but they had cast Chris Rock a while ago

I believe they are filming it this winter giving it an April/May 2020 release date like seasons 1 and 3. And they announced him doing Cat's Cradle which might be filmed next year"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,[deleted]
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,🙂💕
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"A lot of of these comments are cancerous.

She's fighting for a better union for actors. But some comments mention she should open her legs, while others focus on the fact she's rich and can afford the 13$/healthcare. They're completing missing the obvious point she's trying to make for those that can't afford it.

Like I said, vile ignorant comments."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I'm shocked SAG isn't 100% behind vaccines people getting sick and shutting down production is bad for everyone in the industry
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Don't make her go Tom Cruise on their asses.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Sharon if I remember correctly was a lawyer. Given the points made are significant to the regular actor ( not the A list), I would support her."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Sharon stone is a literal genius and is an amazing actor. She would be great on the SAG board.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Fully vaccinated set in Georgia?  Good luck with  that.  She would have better luck filming in Vermont or Mass, highest percentage of vaccinated in the U.S."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Many people on this thread have no clue how SAG-AFTRA contributions work and it shows.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,she was $13 short? is she poor now?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I agree with her on all points but the perspective of this article and the number of times she mentions herself is a little jarring.

It's Sharon Stone. She's a fucking millionaire and she's bitching about being 13 dollars short?

 Lady, welcome to the world 99% of people inhabit. Nice to have you back.

Maybe approach this issue with a little less ""Matt and Jolie"" and a little more ""everyday working actors"" to drum up some empathy. The tone of this article reminds me of that sickening Zoom where a bunch of tone-deaf celebrities sang *Imagine* from their mansions.

The entire working world is constantly $13 dollars short, Sharon. It's hard to reconcile the privilege you've lived with over the years may have bumped up against reality and that you're the only one affected.

But sincerely good luck in getting a better deal for the *entire industry*. No doubt, working actors - as well as yourself, need affordable healthcare that currently obviously is so expensive that someone of your means can't swing it."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Karen Stone. 

And I mean that in the most positive sense. Go kill them!"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"SAG president: Sharon, I'm not sure we have room for you on our board.

Sharon: Oh really....(uncrosses legs)"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,She will do anything to stay in the headlines at this point
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I am very familiar with SAG benefits, which are some of the richest health benefits in any available group policy.  Most people have deductibles that are at least $1000 if not higher (mine is 3.5x that), and SAG is $0 or less than $100 on most of their plans.  They also have their own network of doctors.  Most people also have to pay hundreds of dollars a month in premium to cover their spouses and children on the same plan.  SAG has very, very low contribution amounts, if at all.

So cry me a fucking river of your tears, Sharon fucking Stone.  I have no pity for you or anyone else with health benefits that are far superior to that of your fellow Americans."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Its weird, Sharon seems like a great lady, but ever since i saw her in Casino, part of me cant help but hate her. Testament to what a great actress she is honestly"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,[removed]
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Forgot about her……..what kind of movie is she making?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Its weird, Sharon seems like a great lady, but ever since i saw her in Casino, part of me cant help but hate her. Testament to what a great actress she is honestly"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,The funny part is that SAG supported Obamacare but made sure that they were exempt.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Completely agree. As someone who has to work on sets I would love to know everyone is vaccinated, it’s not just good for actors but crew as well. Also a lot of people failed to understand the 13 dollar shortfall. Its similar to 600 healthcare rules where there are required hours you need to make and it means it’s extremely tough for some members to qualify even though they are paying dues. Also we are still in the throes of a pandemic whether people want to accept that or not doesn’t change that fact. I hope she wins because union rules have helped me on crew side before even though I am non union. The ramifications for greater protections helps us all."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I mean it’s bad enough for people to not have any empathy but now they’re actively mad at those who do.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,She should go full Tom Cruise when he blew up at someone not wearing a mask on his set.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,This is Reddit and her most iconic scene may be when she is spreading her legs.  Not defending but I think you may be expecting too much around here.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I don’t like Tom Cruise, but he was 100% right in that specific situation. I didn’t understand the issue when people wrote articles asking, “Is it ok to talk to people like that?”

In certain, decreasingly rare situations these days, of course it is. If the only way idiots will stop endangering people’s health and jobs is a screaming session, go apeshit."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Ah yes, we will move to the beautiful studio lots in Vermont.

That was so easy. The sets are all so lovely and the towns are so accommodating."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,...do... do you think the unvaccinated herbs from the sticks are the same people who work on films in Georgia? lol
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,I believe Georgia has long been a haven for film shooting because of their tax breaks. They wouldn’t risk that entire industry over this.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Good thing they just don't pull random people off the street to work on sets.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"The other interpretation doesn't even make any sense, who could possibly think Sharon Stone means that she could not afford to pay 13 dollars??"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I think it's an earnings thing. Hollywood wasn't operating as much during COVID so they raised premiums and earnings thresholds to cover losses, so anyone who chose not to work during the shutdowns was at a bigger risk of losing their coverage. At least that's what I'm glean from the article."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,That’s not how this works.  That’s not how any of this works.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,[deleted]
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,she's not complaining about the $13. she's saying it's bullshit to lose insurance over something as small as $13 and this really sucks for 99% of actors and not her. she's saying this for the people who aren't rich actors
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"=“ You are rich, you have no right to criticise or call out people and stuff that screw you”"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"> Lady, welcome to the world 99% of people inhabit. 

You realize that SAG-AFTRA is literally a union (and not just one that covers the most successful and wealthy performers), and is therefore fighting for that 99%?"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"I got a different take. I thought she was omitted from the healthcare plan on a technicality because they are deliberately losing older members.. as they are struggling financially.

I'm sure, being a melodramatic, that she is playing up the martyr angle on her stance over the SAG health care and covid vaccination.. but the fact is, if someone like her doesn't, then I can't see anyone else doing it."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Is she complaining about having to foot the $13 difference ?  I haven’t read the article but from your critique it sounds like that to me.  

I can only surmise that whatever coverage she was fighting for far exceeds that $13 notes in the headline.  Privileged people like you said probably pay out of the nose just to see their practitioner."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,she ain't a Karen
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,How is she a karen?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Her entire argument is that if she can be screwed out of insurance at her level over not earning the $13, because it’s not that she didn’t pay enough, she didn’t make enough under the SAG’s policies to qualify for her existing insurance.

She is saying that this is a problem because it will disproportionately impact the people who AREN’T already rich and successful. She’s saying “fuck, glad I am successful, but this really sucks for my fellow union members. We should do something about that to help them no get screwed”"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Exactly she could have done some background work to make that $13

Also I hope she loses that job she doesn’t deserve it"

Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"The contract negotiations between GA and Hollywood mandated jobs for locals, so yes."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"If those working in set reflect the general population's stance, this will be tough"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"only the unions can really control it though, not company management.  i suspect if they're using Georgia for low cost not everyone is going to be union (although i don't know if they are or not)."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,The crew who presumably live in Georgia.  They're somewhat representative of the total population.  I'm sure the union will probably not mandate vaccines.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Sounds like another excellent example of why healthcare coverage shouldn’t be tied to employment.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Yeah, it literally doubled. So now even if you net some solid passive income from acting, you probably wouldn’t qualify unless you did something big recently. So Sharon probably didn’t film anything recently, but was getting residuals, and those even didn’t cover the ludicrous premium hike. I know some actors working right now who can’t even qualify because it’s so high. 


Source: bitter actor who finally qualified for health care, then they raised the premium 2 days later."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"ah got it .. thanks for the explainer.   Wasn't really sure how this all worked and was a little surprised at how little it took to cancel someone's coverage.  I would understand if she was hundreds or thousands short but $13 is chump change to quibble over, especially for such a large union."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,No.  They hiked the eligibility threshold.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Reminds me of one of my favorite lines from a song....""Yes, I recognize the irony that the system I oppose affords me the luxury of biting the hand that feeds, that's exactly why privileged fucks like me should feel obliged to whine and kick and scream, until everyone has everything they need."""
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"SAG requires you to make a certain amount of money from acting every year to keep insurance.  Because of COVID cancelling projects she made only $13 less than what she was required and thus lost insurance.

Her POV in this case is entirely valid."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Why not?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"These ""2020 election was stolen"" idiots are the people who chanted both ""stop the count"" and ""count the votes"" they're beyond reason because they don't even understand how fucking moronoic their views are"
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,Because Michael Keaton is.
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Sure, but if you put something about him in a post on Reddit you are going to see a lot of Batman quotes."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,So what did those crew members end up doing?
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"Was Tom Cruise's shouting reminiscent of the kinds of abuse that we often associate with Hollywood? The dude shouted to bring home how serious he was about maintaining a safe set.


The abuses we see in the workplace and Hoywood are often at odds with people's well being, not in advocacy of it as in this case."
Sleepless Society: Two Pillows & A Lost Soul,"These weren’t rules about using the time clock software or Casual Friday, or about what time Cruise’s lunch would be served to him. These were viral pandemic safety rules. The people who broke them were abusing their coworkers by repeatedly endangering their health and jobs for no reason. They got a scream session because of their abuse. They weren’t chased with a chainsaw."

The Unremarkable Juanquini,Agreed. I hope Paget returns for the movie.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"The gag with the foreign guy texting the Dean was magical.

The Unremarkable Juanquini,"He's up there, waiting for a better daddy, with a bigger hand!"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"And that solves the matter of the giant hand.


Yup, it’s my second favourite season of the show, not a bad episode the whole season and some of the gags paying off in subsequent episodes was great"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"For me, Season 5 & 6 are seriously undervalued by the fans. The show enters this carefree attitude that just rivals the insanity of Season 2 and it's glorious."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,The finale is one of my favorites from any show. Very meta but the emotions feel very real.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"In the commentary, Harmon speaks that the objective was to write as if the show was in its hundredth season or something. It pushes the boundaries of a boundary pushing show.

It feels like Sat. midday programming to me. Something comfortable to keep company during chores in comfortable clothes  you don't mind getting dirty. Something that goes well with the sound of running vacuums.

I am a Harmontown fan, and season 6 feels saturated with the Schrab/Harmon dynamic. You feel their creative dialogue in the dialogue and the visual bits.

Also, I love that Elroy sometimes exists outside of the show that's happening. Stutters the suspension of unbelief masterfully.

Brilliant end cap! Also MATT BERRY!"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I don’t understand this so called dip in season 3.

Yes, I loved 6, but I loved 3 and liked 4."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Having had the entire show on endless repeat in the background for my house the last six months...

* Season 1 is definitely the best. It strikes the best balance between realism and zaniness; Greendale is clearly a crazy place but not a twisted hellscape of madness. 
* Relationships between the cast felt more sincere and the drama wasn't as out there
* Pierce, Abed, Troy, and Britta are at their best. None of them have become memetic, one-note flat characters yet with their worst traits played up so much they became their entire characters. Abed feels more like a character with autism who attempts to communicate through the one thing he understands rather than basically Deadpool. Britta gets to actually be a person instead of a punchline. Pierce has some of the best ""message"" deliveries and strikes a balance between being a crass ass and a generally well-meaning person. And Troy isn't a complete moron yet whose entire character is subsumed by being Abed's sidekick.
* Past Season 1 Shirley becomes worse and worse and to be quite honest she gets almost as bad as Pierce, eventually, it's just that her homophobia and religious bigotry doesn't get played the same way. Some of her lines are flat out idiotic and the show treats them as her having a point (and someone like Britta, usually, as being in the wrong). Like holy shit Shirley just slutshames Britta in response to being called out for her racism against Abed at one point, she's a terrible person.
* This is sad because Yvette Nicole Brown is genuinely one of the funniest people on the cast, her facial expressions fucking murder me. 
* Season 6 is the best season behind 1 and 2, Frankie and Elroy elevate it massively. I really wish they had been on the show since the beginning. (Preferably with Elroy replacing Pierce because... well... we all know the deal with Chevy Chase.)
* The show was really hurt by only having 13 episode seasons after a point.
* I used to defend Season 4 when it was coming out, but in hindsight that's largely because I hated /r/Community and how it was and viewed by myself it's on average fairly bad. Has some good stuff here and there though.
* Also in hindsight, I really question if the entire show wouldn't have been better as four seasons and a movie instead of six. The characters being stuck at Greendale spinning their wheels for another two years after graduation feels weird and depressing.


Thank you for reading this uncalled for rant about a sitcom."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I think conventional is that 2 and 3 are the best, but maybe that is just my perception.

I like 6 more than 5, mostly because Frankie and Elroy are funnier than Mike Erhmentrout and Captain Marvel."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Even when it was bad it was still pretty good.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Season 6 has my favourite joke in the whole show and it's so stupid. When they're doing the episode with the giant hand and Abed keeps trying to flashback, and then they flash forward to the future with Future Abed and Future Frankie having a conversation. Only for Future Britta to appear, just to awkwardly ask what's up. Idk why but it tickles me"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Whenever I'm chatting with friends about someone or something that is ridiculously stupid, I always end up linking the clip of Frankie comforting the Dean about how stupid he is."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Keith David made even The Cape watchable.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Season 3 is considered a dip? I’ve always considered that even with 2 as the best ones.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Elroy mostly fills the niche left by the departure of Pierce, Troy and Shirley. But Frankie manages to stand as an entirely new character and elevates the season because of it. She takes over some of the character traits originally reserved for Jeff (voice of reason, comedic foil to the zany cast) and does so to much greater effect than Jeff ever did. 

I like season 6 a lot and I hope we see Frankie again in the movie."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Massively underated in the Community community as well thanks to Troy leaving the year before. 

Frankie and Elroy absolutely kill so many scenes - I really hope they're both in the movie."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I fucking love Kieth David
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I watched *Community* for the first time over the pandemic, and then I re-watched the whole series not that long ago.

Season 6 *might* be my favorite overall. 

I pink puffy heart love Frankie and Elroy. 

More importantly, they ""solved"" some of the character issues. I think Pierce brought the show down; Season 1/2 Pierce wasn't bad, but they absolutely made him too terribly racist and irredeemable to enjoy all that much after that. They misused Chang; the only seasons I think the character is objectively great and not a drag is 1 and 6. I also don't love Troy as much as the rest of the fans seem to. A lot of Troy was tied up in Abed, and that dynamic got weird and repetitive after a few seasons. And when they did separate them, it was to...offer a poorly-executed pairing with Britta. I did miss Shirley. 

I was also shocked how much I *didn't* hate season 4 the second time I watched it. It wasn't great, and that season's paintball and Dark Timeline stuff was stupid, but otherwise it was pretty decent. I also remember the Chang As Dictator (which I hated) in season 3 being a lot more prominent than it actually was--it's really just the last episode and then a handful of throwaway jokes throughout the season."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,It's honestly probably my favourite season of the show
The Unremarkable Juanquini,The joke that there’s nothing zany or remarkable about Frankie is one of the best in the show.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Ladders!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Totally agree! AND JESUS WEPT! 
lolo"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"
Incredible season of television. I think 5 and 6 are ridiculously under-rated in general, but I’ve been revisiting 6 in particular. The tags are top notch, too. The scene with Matt Besser as the dude who bought the giant watch for the giant hand makes me cry laughing."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Season 3 is the best season I. Do not. Care. What. Others. Think
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I agree. I prefer season 5 just slightly for personal reasons, but I think both 5 and 6 are on par with seasons 1-3. Community is one of the few shows that actually handled losing major cast members really well."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Loved it all.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Agreed - it’s the best season as far as jokes-per-minute go.  

Maybe doesn’t have the heart that the first few seasons had, but the jokes come fast and furious all season."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"1\~=2>3>4>6>5. Community should have ended when Troy left. 6 seasons and a movie is nice, but it should have been 4 seasons and 3 movies."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I think it gets overshadowed by the earlier seasons because of the changes in the main cast. As you say, the lack of Troy and Shirley is pretty sad and changes the whole dynamic of the show. And for me, Jeff just disappears into his own mediocrity in that season, which is kinda poetic. I think they’d have been better off introducing more permanent cast members in season 3 and phased out the existing ones in season 4 and kept the concept of the community college as the main theme and purpose of the show rather than the study group."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"""you stupid child..."""
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I'm on season 4 and having a hard time pushing on.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I watched Community during its run and have rewatched the entire series a few times. 

Season 4 isn’t even really that bad y’all."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Do people think season 3 was a dip in quality. In my mind it's just more of season 2 and in a good way.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I’m glad some people liked it at least. It was pretty terrible I felt but at least it didn’t leave us thinking Community never got a fair chance to keep going
The Unremarkable Juanquini,The more I watch the show the more I like it. There are a couple episodes I don't love but it's not like S3 and S5 where there are extreme highs and lows. It's just steady entertainment and it has a vibe very similar to S4 but it's much funnier. I absolutely love the last three episodes too they ended the series on a very high note.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Whoever decided to put Paget Brewster in Community was inspired.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Season 3 had Remedial Chaos Theory, Digital Estate Planning and Pillows and Blankets.  I don’t know if I can get on board with it not being a peak season."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Season 2 of Community is literally perfect.  Every episode hits hard.  Its a rare thing for a sitcom to have that many god damn bangers in a row.  Superstore's Second season also did it.  I think Office Season 4 or 5 was also that level.  

I think if I were to rate them it would be 2,3,1,6,5"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion for my unpopular opinion, but as a huge Community fan, I could not agree any less.  Season 6 is a chore to watch for me.  It has nothing to do with Brewster or David.  They're fine.  Not great, but fine.  But the writing is incoherent and unfunny.  The pacing is terrible.  The cinematography is weird.  Everyone's timing is off.  The soundtrack is barely there.  It's just... ugh.  I honestly do not understand how someone could think Season 6 is good.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

I mean, to each her own.  If you enjoy Season 6 then have at it.  But I'm definitely not listening to you for advice on TV shows.

**EDIT:** I will say that the one positive I took from season 6 was an introduction to the band *Lord Huron*, as they used their song *Ends of the Earth* in the soundtrack on the finale."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"To me, Community never recovered after season 4. 4 was ok to me but not nearly as good as before, 5 and 6 were shockingly boring and terrible. Still very much looking forward to the movie, can't wait, shame we won't get Chevy back, wish he wasn't such an asshole."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I am almost finished watching the whole thing all the way through for the first time. I have to say I dislike season 6 the most because it seems like the Troy void caused everyone to jump the shark. Seasons 1-4 I was excited to see the next one but season 5 started to get weak and with season 6 I am having trouble paying attention. I have 5 episodes left and I heard the last episode is great so I'm crossing my fingers.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,">If there’s a flaw, it’s the lack of Shirley and Troy and that the series doesn’t really know what to do with Annie and Britta- but that had been a problem since season 3.

It was good but you can't say four core characters weren't used in the same way and it's still a great season. Yes Paget and Keith were good additions, just like Banks in season 5. Yes Jeff, Abed, Chang, and the Dean are still amazing characters. 

But you are without two core characters, granted Troy was already gone. You misuse two core characters. So sure the season is entertaining but it's such a departure that it feels pointless.

That's why I'm really worried about the movie. If Shirley and Troy aren't back then I really don't see the point. They already did Save Greendale. They already did Jeff becoming a professor. Where else can they go? Abed makes a meta film about Greendale after he becomes a successful director in Hollywood?

There were some memorable moments and overall it was a good season. But it could have been so much better."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I think Season 6 has some great parts, but as a whole it just felt *off* to me. In particular, I thought the show started to feel kind of bitter and mean. I think the biggest example of this is Jeff. In Season 6 he becomes an angry alcoholic who lashes out at people, and it never even gets addressed. His arc just ends depressingly as well. >!He started out wanting to leave Greendale, only to end up trapped there as all his friends leave and go on to bigger and better things!<. The whole season had this kind of tone, and I got the sense that the creators just wanted it to be over."

IMO"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Gunna have to disagree with you there. It's too try-hard and is lacking too many of the original characters to be able to pull off the jokes. Definitely fizzled out
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I've never gotten around to community but I'd like to watch it. What is it streaming on?
The Unremarkable Juanquini,JESUS WEPT for season 6 haters and their fucked up brains
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"IMO 1,2, 6,3,5,4 So I agree with you that S6 is not as bad as people make it out to be. I thought Paget Brewster and ~~arbiter~~ Keith David were great additions to the cast. I like them more than some of the OG cast. 

I will say there are 2 episodes that just did not land with me at all in that season."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"It wasn’t the same show after Donald Glover left. Sure, there were moments and episodes. But overall the magic was gone, IMO."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I could not make it through S6. It felt like I was watching on 0.5 speed there was so much dead air. Have rewatched seasons 1-3 a few times but not made it further than episode 4 of S6.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,2 > 1 > 6 = 3 > 5 > 4
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Nah. I love Community a lot, but season 6 is just really, really boring. It's not offensive or bad or anything, but for a comedy series, it is painfully unfunny most of the time."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I am the opposite to this. Both of them, Brewster and David, had one moment where they shined. One moment. Otherwise they felt so out of place it simply bothered me."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I’m still bitter about trying to get S6 on Yahoo TV or whatever they called it.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Eh I haven’t heard season 1 to be held in high regard, it’s too standard - sitcom-y for many fans. 

My order would be 2,3,4,5,1,6, but none being worse than average"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"In my opinion, it was good season 1, better season 2, and perfect by season 3 and 4. I loved the chaos of season 4 and Ken Jeong’s craziness. The show lost it once Donald glover left. Troy and abed were such a big part and it for me."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I get why people stepped off the train on Season 4, but 5 and 6 are just as good as S1 and S3 in my opinion. Season 6 is just back to back incredible episodes and jokes on top of jokes. Even just the premises alone like the episode where they give a degree to a dog is full of incredible moments."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,It was too meta for me :(
The Unremarkable Juanquini,It starts out good with the first six or so episodes and then it tanks again to the level of the previous two seasons.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,The problem with Community is the lack of originality after season 2.5.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"The ""Everybody getting as drunk as they want"" montage is still one of the funniest moments in the show."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Is 6 the Yahoo one? I remember the bad Yahoo player and constant ads ruining my concentration for it. I'd be willing to give it another go on a new platform.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I love season 6 and don’t hate season 4. Burn me now if you want.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"On the whole, season 5 is better than season 1. Season 1 takes several episodes to really find a groove."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Where does one watch Community these days?
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Who the hell doesn't like season 3? That's my favorite season!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,It’s too meta and cynical for me to be honest. I prefer the first few seasons.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,I agree. I always thought the show handled cast turnover really well and season 6 is a good example of that.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"#JESUS WEPT!
^..for ^there ^were ^no ^more ^worlds ^to ^conquer.."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Space Elder Britta is my favorite Britta of them all. The force ghost fist pump gets me every time.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,JESUS WEPT!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Best season imo, Franky being mean to the Dean... so funny"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"""Im addicted to encouraging white people."""
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Paint?... Ball??
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Just here to say that I am watching community for the 1st time (at S6 rn) & I can’t believe I didn’t know about this before!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Season 1 is still the best. 

Season 1 and the pen episode of course."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,JESUS WEPT!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I gave up not long in season 5, I loved Pierce's Will episode, but overall I couldnt make it anymore 

For me some of it may have been I binged it and starting watching after the show was over.  So I had seen all the great stuff recently instead of watching it an episode a week"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,LADDERS!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Frankie is honestly up there with my favorite characters in the show and I'm really sad she only got to be in one season.
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"The wedding episode is one of my favorites of the whole show. Damn right, Season 6 fuckin rules."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I would even argue that season six is the BEST.  The two new characters fit in flawlessly and the Dean is less of a sight gag of physical comedy and a source of more diverse jokes like he should have been from day one.  Shirley was always my least favorite character and just seemed very angrily passive aggressive no matter what the script called for her to do.  I didn't miss her.  Finally, they had taken the Troy and Abed reading each others' minds conceit as far as it could possibly go."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Why the HELL would a plumber be fighting a monkey?!?!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I'm currently on a rewatch at season 5 and I'd say that season 3 is my least favorite. Yes I prefer 4, it's a more grounded and human version of S3 which is too mean spirited and amps up the nonsense to an insufferable degree, though it probably has higher highs. Both contain some episodes I'll skip on further rewatches

Curious about 6"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,The power point bit from this season is one of chang s best lol
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"I consider this season to have some of the best writing but the least amount of jokes. That may rate it lower on some people's list, but it's near the top of mine.

It's incisive, more subtle, and doesn't hold the audiences hand quite as much, not that that is a complaint I would put to the show, but it does so even less in season 6."
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Based. I always say this. Season 6 is streets ahead of all of the other season. It’s almost cringy watching season 1 or 2 after watching season 6 cause they are just so much more childish i guess.
The Unremarkable Juanquini, I like it but Community really wasn’t the same after Glover left
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Now this is a man who knows how to make a post!
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Yeah….no
The Unremarkable Juanquini,"Welcome..




to *ladders*"
The Unremarkable Juanquini,Paget Brewster’s character was one of the best to ever appear on the show.
White Lines,"On episode 6 so far, Boxer is the best part of the show by far.

Everything else is kind of a shit version of the girl with the dragon tattoo."
White Lines,I’m on episode 9 and at this point it’s just hate watching. The writing in episodes 8 and 9 are enough to bash your head into a tree. Zoe is repulsive. Ill take a spin-off with boxer though 🙋🏻‍♀️
White Lines,"The lead actress is the most annoying privileged self deprecating, always causing problems and expecting other people to clean them up, she’s actual scum. Also she has an oedipus complex for her brother it’s weird af. 
I do actually really like the show however and reccomend"
White Lines,"zoe is the most pathetic character ever. period. she keeps saying she’s “investigating her brother’s death” but im pretty sure investigation translates to “cheat on husband, do drugs and have unlimited holiday” in her head. any substantial investigation was done by her dad and his police friend anyway so i don’t know what the fuck she thought she was achieving.

i feel really really sorry for boxer he didn’t deserve any of her shit. she really thought she was doing sumn while confronting him in the last episode. at this point i was just embarrassed for her like, girl shut up with your nonsense theories. marcus, zoe’s husband and daughter and boxer deserved better!!!"
White Lines,"I binged through the entire thing hoping for it to get better and it turned out to be a complete waste of my time. All the characters are extremely unlikable, especially the protagonist. She was whiny and entitled throughout all the episodes, her character arc is just a rewording of white privilege. If you're looking for a time to kill, run this in the background but otherwise it's really not worth your full attention. Inconsistent storytelling aside the camerawork was amazing."
White Lines,"Oh my god like I hate the main protagonist so much. Zoë is a entitled piece of shit. Nothing makes sense she does. Her actions have no reasoning at all. All the other characters were way more interesting than her. 

Leaving her family, fucking around with other dudes, partying and doing anything other than looking for answers for her brother that been dead for 20 years. And I really don’t even care for the dead brother anyway too with all these stupid flashbacks, it’s soooooo dragged out! And she’s soooo obsessed with her brother! It’s weird!! 
And she’s an adult woman, she could’ve made a lot of different choices her entire life! She’s lives in a country where she can make her own choices! Don’t give me that bs with “this is not my life, I have never been this alive” 
Goddam what an unlikable character.


Then only characters I feel bad for is kika having a fucked-up weird ass family and Zoë’s daughter and husband."
White Lines,"I had to stop at episode 3 because the main character sucks a massive bag of dicks. Zoe is such an entitled retarded bitch. She abandons her family and goes stomping around Ibiza throwing around accusations at everyone she meets like she's a fucking queen and everyone needs to bow down to her. And she's gonna steal 7 kilos of coke to force some answers out of her friend? Are you serious!?  If she had even a single brain cell, she would realize how fucking dangerous that is, not only for her but for her friend as well. She really thinks she can just fuck around with drug dealers like that and not get tortured and/or killed? Even when she finds out how she majorly fucked her friend and put his daughter's life in danger, she continues to whine about who killed her douchebag fuckboy of a brother. UGH, what a terribly written character. Boxer's cool tho."
White Lines,I wish I could get my hour back
White Lines,It seems like it was written by a 17 year old
White Lines,"If this didn't have the name money heist attached to it, I wouldn't even have tried it. But hey it's quarantine and there's nothing else to do."
White Lines,"I watched because it was made by the people who made money heist so I gave it a chance it does get better towards the end and the actual reveal of the killer is pretty good. I don’t think it’s worth it though the episodes are way too long, only one character is likeable and so much of the episodes are doing nothing at all to get to the main reveal which is the only reason I was really interested. It also has some mixed messages about Axel and his life. Also the main characters voice and acting at some points is awful."
White Lines,"As I read all these comments about the main character Zoe and how selfish and shitty of a person she is I’d like to make a theory be it true or false. The actress that plays her role was married with two young kids in England in real life, shooting for the movie started in June 2019 in Ibiza. August 2019 two months into being away from her family and kids her and her husband get a sudden divorce with no explanation to the public. So I check out some of the actors Instagram accounts and guess who is all over each other’s comment sections and posting photos of each other. Laura Haddock (Zoe) and.... Nuno Lopes (BOXER)."
White Lines,"can't wait to be called a woman hater for not liking this, main character throws her family aside to try and solve her scum bag brothers murder while having zero skills to do so, constantly puts other people's lives in danger, and..... what is she going to do if she solved it? the police can't do anything..."
White Lines,I watched all 10 episodes over the last 2 nights. I thought the first half was much better than the second half. Overall I enjoyed the show but coming here and reading all the negative comments I can't actually help but agree with how ridiculous and unbelievable the plot is. Felt bad for Zoe's daughter and Boxer.
White Lines,Shite
White Lines,"Holy shit, i have watched 3 episodes and the main actor bimbo makes my blood boil and i'm not sure if i can watch this anymore. I came to Google is it just me and it clearly isn't just me, Terrible acting, super annoying lead and who the fuck ruins a mans life, gets him hurt and steals 7 kilos of coke just cause she's a selfish bitch ""and wanted to know"" something? Seems like men in this show are just disposable trash while women are ""queens who deserve anything"""
White Lines,Just finished episode 1.  Had high hopes but not feeling confident. Will give it a few more. Not feeling the lead actress at all (Zoe).
White Lines,"As far as the ending goes, I don't understand why they didn't leave the body in the pool?  Having them do everything they did after that (trying not to give too much away for those that have not finished it yet) just didnt make sense, so I was disappointed by the ending.  Horrifying, but idiotic."
White Lines,"I agree completely with everything being said about Zoe- awful, whiny, idiotic character, terrible acting..
But surely the worst character in the show (and that is saying something!) was Axel!
I have never seen a bigger douchebag. He actually referred to himself as the “messiah of electronic music”, and the script tried to make out like he was. Zoe said he was ‘the best DJ of his generation’. Crowds of extras followed him as if he was Jesus!
Yet everything he said and did made me sympathise with his killer(s).
He and his friends just walked around shouting “woohoo” and “this is the life”, and apparently in a matter of months they amassed a cult-like following and opened 5 megaclubs..
In reality they would have been a bunch of stoned brits living in a camper van, trying to bum cigarettes outside of Amnesia.
Why is it that every mainstream portrayal of club culture has to imply that taking recreational drugs is a cry for help for self destructive emotional turmoil? Can’t a person just have a good time?
This show was clearly written by people who have never taken drugs. The writing was so abysmal I just can’t articulate a fraction of it.
I watched it to the end out of anger, just to see how implausible they could get with every piece of dialogue, every decision to action, every emotional reaction and every romantic inclination could be. Seriously- as if Kika would ever be with Marcus? She would hesitate to let him weed her garden!"
White Lines,Is the aspect ratio weird for anyone else?  Like the black bar on the bottom of my screen is larger than the black bar on the top of the screen.
White Lines,I legit can't stand any character on this show.
White Lines,I actually loved this show!
White Lines,"I don't think there's 1 likeable character on this show, it's cinematic and the music is alright but everyone is just awful, especially Zoe"
White Lines,"Am I the only one who absolutely cannot stand the bullshit dialogues via FaceTime with her shrink? It literally kills it for me. Every time. 

They should have scrapped that."
White Lines,The acting from the lead actress is so abysmal that I could not continue watching.
White Lines,Can anyone explain how they are able to perform an autopsy on a 20 year old body??? There would be nothing left but they are able to ascertain all sorts of injuries and analyse lung contents. Did I miss something? Seen up to episode 3
White Lines,"On episode 4 now. I’m enjoying it. I don’t think it’s gunna win any oscars but it’s definitely entertaining.

I really wanna go Ibiza now though"
White Lines,Should I give it a shot or nah ?
White Lines,[deleted]
White Lines,"Bad storyline, terrible acting"
White Lines,"For me, white lines is a load of white lies. A washed out version of ibiza thats palatable for the masses with a wannabe The Business vibe. Yet with its aging eastenders/corrie riddled cast, its more like a drawn out story with no jokes and no drama. Id recommend you do some white lines of your own to maintain your focus because its zzzzzzzz.

EDIT: Also, how can zoe be going to raves with her brother as a child 20 years ago when she looks about 25 now?"
White Lines,"I think everyone agrees Zoe’s a total idiot. I think it’s unfair for the show and rest of the writing. It’s hardly without its flaws but rest of the writing has some what sensible elements, like cleaning up the traces, following up money owed etc. 
It would have tied up nicely if they shed some light into her marriage being bad (eg back story of husband cheating or emotionally unavailable, her being depressed isn’t enough, perhaps even throw bipolar into the bag. Her decisions in the show just seemed really ridiculous and out of character. I think her acting isn’t great either)

Kinda just stayed for the lovely cinematic sand sunny scenes. Boxers character and acting is great. Marcus is annoying but not as bad as Zoe. I think rest of the casts and acting is fine."
White Lines,"Dear anybody reading this that watched the full show:  


**The Center Cut** is a podcast where we watch the first and last episode of a TV show (or beginning and end of a movie) and try to figure out what happened in the middle. 

Our next episode (coming out May 27th) is based around White Lines, obviously. 

Where you come in: 

We need your questions! Ask us something we could easily answer if we had seen the entire thing! Please and thank you!

[The Center Cut Web Feed](https://www.thecentercut.libsyn.com)"
White Lines,Did they explain how axels body got on the land of the kingpin? And was it found in ibiza? I thought it was found on the mainland but cant remember back to episode 1.
White Lines,"Imo the ending is a big pile of crap and made me feel like I did not get the satisfaction I was expecting and looking for. I dont know and honestly dont care, if the writers thought that it made the series less predictable or more different from other series by choosing the end that they did, but there’s a reason why succesful shows and movies that involve a lot of drama stick to endings that reward the viewers with a feeling like ‘ justice has been served ‘. If that makes any sense, thats how I feel after watching it. It just left me really infuriarated and feeling like I wasted my time watching."
White Lines,"what's up with series/films hyped because someone from the cast of money heist played there/produced it and then it's incomparable to money heist?

White Lines, Silencio del Pantano - all of them got a lot of bad reviews and most people watched them because they had the ""money heist"" label on them..."
White Lines,"Wow, Conchita Calafat. Is it hot in here, or is it just her. That story line of Oriol and his mom Conchita was pretty wild. She was a total babe though. Yikes, very problematic but for some reason very into it. Shhhhh."
White Lines,[removed]
White Lines,Rang-dang-diggidy-dang-a-dang
White Lines,Much thrashing about the main character but the other british guy who came back from India and is a kind of guru makes me crack laughing in every scene both by acting and character writing. Unbelievable that anyone would pick such a clown for therapy.
White Lines,"Boxer is great. a part from some not good actors, I think the reactions people are having where what the creators intended. It is a different show where you basically hate everyone, they all do dumb shit and are in a spiral of bad decisions.

It is not your regular tv show. Therefore people feel like they should like the lead or the murder victim and end up complaining. She is a person thats psychologically unstable. Not a show of the year. But worth the watch. I was very entertained by the next screw up that would happen. Also the music and the view and landscape is fantastic. Nuno Lopes MVP of this show. I'd give it a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. I'm not a show critic or specialist, but it was entertaining and different. I was tired of all these shows that follow the same rules..."
White Lines,"Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but this feels like something that would be dumped on ITV 2 if it wasn't associated with 'Money Heist'."
White Lines,"3/4 way thru this series , 3 ep left . Really enjoying the way they did this. Between Spanish and English, how the story keeps Evolving"
White Lines,I... I.... i..... actually liked Zoe
White Lines,Boxer was literally the only good thing in this show.  I'd prob give a show a chance just about him.
White Lines,Boxer is the only likable character.
White Lines,Even Boxers character is unbelievable. Will kill 2 drug dealers for a woman he just met. And then let’s her stay with him even though he knows she stole the Coke and shot him in the leg....
White Lines,Haha hate watching. This describes exactly what I’m doing. I’m on episode 7 and hate all the characters and story (lack thereof).
White Lines,"I was shocked there was no ""twist"" that part of the reason Axel was kicked out was because of an incestuous relationship with Zoe-it would explain a lot about how screwed up she is and how hard he self-destructed in Ibiza. Then again with how aggressive this show is with the editing of flashbacks they might have saved that reveal for Season 2."
White Lines,"I came looking for this! Holy shit is Zoe one of the dumbest main characters I have ever seen. Just terrible, laughably terrible. Like Jesus fuck women, get your shit together"
White Lines,"That’s the point! Did she go to Ibiza to find out what happened to Axel, or did she go to Ibiza to live and do exactly what he did. They’re the same person, just in different timelines. Both delusional, living dangerously under the pretence of “la vida loca”.

In Zoe’s FIRST SCENE she shoots Boxer with a harpoon ffs."
White Lines,Well said... And Zoe’s a shitty mom.
White Lines,Rewording of white privilege? More like entitled western woman we have poisoned their minds with feminism - but ok.
White Lines,This is the first comment I see regarding the series on reddit and I’m so glad I read it. I agree 100% Zoe is a white bitch I despise her character
White Lines,Yes!!! This so much! I'm glad Reddit is on the same page.  Zoe is one of the worst main characters I have come across
White Lines,Came here just to see if others felt the same way. You are 100% correct
White Lines,Thanks exactly 💯 came here to see if people were thinking the same
White Lines,"I agreed literally 100% on this, and yeah boxer is so badass (DONT READ ANYMORE THIS COMMENT CUZ OF SPOILER) but when boxer went to Yuris boat and killed the two Romanians was the most badass shit ever"
White Lines,That bad huh?
White Lines,I couldn't even make it that far. The acting and casting is awful. I expected so much more.
White Lines,"I did the same.  Yeah, Money Heist is melodramatic at times and Tokyo makes shit decisions often throughout the show but damn Zoe just takes it to obnoxious levels. Plus, Money Heist has more likeable and charasmatic characters. Boxer was the only one I found interesting on this show."
White Lines,This show should have been done in 6-8 episodes.
White Lines,Juicyy
White Lines,"Haha no way, the real life scandal is much more exciting than the show."
White Lines,Haha that'd be crazy and yet totally believable at the same time
White Lines,Not going to out my source but this is 100% true. Don't know if they're still shagging though.
White Lines,"Someone call MI5, they need to recruit her ASAP! 😂😂"
White Lines,Have you gotten called a woman hater yet?
White Lines,"But wait, she gets to ride new dick and live her best life without regard to anyone else. So there’s that."
White Lines,She's a retarded dumbfuck who should be executed immediately. Couldn't watch the show because of her.
White Lines,[deleted]
White Lines,Finished the show I don’t think the girls are shown as any better TBH all the characters basically come across badly I can’t tell if it’s intentional or not it must be to an extent but I don’t think they know how unlikable they really are
White Lines,"Spoiler alert.............       

Yeah, absolutely. Like... the dude basically drowned on his own anyway, just got given a helping hand. ""Quick I need to hide the body!"". Or... just go ""Hey! Look everyone! The man who just took *all the drugs* and then got in a swimming pool drowned. How sad"". Obviously? I don't buy that character being that stupid.          
I did enjoy how they had to murder him in about 6 different ways before it stuck, though, actually kind of fits with the ""Manc Rasputin' nature of the character."
White Lines,"My memory of this show has faded a bit too much, but to comment on your point with Axel...

I felt like that Axel was meant to be portrayed through Zoe's rose-tinted glasses. As the story went on, Zoe was supposed to see more of Axel's darkness. However, these dark moments are often brushed off and not played dramatically like the rest of the series because Zoe has a hard time comprehending that the adventurous and exciting Axel she knew was capable of these things.

Sorry for responding to this over a month after it was posted, I watched a while ago and just got here now.

PS I can't really comment on your other criticisms, I've neither taken drugs nor attempted to hack it as an Ibiza DJ before, so I don't feel as if I could verifiably take a stance."
White Lines,Seems to be like that for the first episode only. Could be a Netflix error.
White Lines,"Boxer and the daughter from Miami were good! and Zoe's real husband and her Dad did their roles pretty well. I feel you though, Zoe was the most annoying lead character I've ever seen and the name, character, script and acting for Axel Collins was painfully cringe"
White Lines,"They said in the beginning that it had been mummified, I'm no expert, but I think that would preserve parts."
White Lines,how about that tattoo on the skeleton lol
White Lines,"Of course it won’t, it’s a TV show."
White Lines,"Idk why everyone ist bashing it so much, i quite enjoyed it to be honest.
Annoying lead or Not"
White Lines,"\> I really wanna go Ibiza now though

I remember thinking that about Las Vegas, after seeing a couple seasons of that TV show. Then I actually went and the beautiful people and glamour was nowhere near like the show. I have to imagine this is the same..."
White Lines,"Don't do it. Just don't. Unless you watch it ironically, but no one can like it. It will make your blood boil and not in a good way, like a good movie with good actor and script doing the ""bad guy"" role. No one's relatable. Everyone seems out of touch. 
""Oh yeah, we have orgies!"" 
Degenerate show and bad execution."
White Lines,Nah
White Lines,"The reasoning behind Zoe doing that to his men is that she's strong independent woman and that men are disposable. It's just funny how men are treated in today's shows, like they're nothing and women have no accountability, no responsibility but all the freedom. They deserve everything, the take but they aren't expected to give."
White Lines,"Her husband was her ‘sponsor‘ or something, so he basically took advantage of an unstable, suicidal teenager- almost like a psychiatrist sleeping with a patient.
Of course they didn’t explore that in any way in the woeful script.."
White Lines,"I like it more than you. But it also reminds me of an instagram spread. Every thing and every person and every outfit, down to all the women's lip filler is insta-ready. There is a manufactured feeling about it that detracts from its potential."
White Lines,.. She's 34 years of age.
White Lines,"I'm not sure if they deliberately made Zoe an awful person, but it made it tough to follow such a bad protagonist. I quite like Marcus, I grew up in manc and I feel his character is quite close to that."
White Lines,Someone remind me to watch this
White Lines,"They sort of implied it. The body was found on the mainland. Right after the pool scene, the girl quickly mentions to her bf that she has an idea and that Oriel(?) has a speed boat and they can use that."
White Lines,"I hated Money Heist. I actually prefer White Lines but I don't think that's if great quality either, poor writing, poor performances, I'm essentially watching it because of Nuno Lopez, he's great."
White Lines,[removed]
White Lines,Also a shitty wife.
White Lines,No need to reword
White Lines,"Hahah same!! I had to do a double take on some of the comments in this thread because I thought I wrote them LOL I don't know what the writers were trying to achieve with this Zoe character. Create the most obnoxious, stupid, and unlikeable protagonist ever?

My fav characters were the adorable curly dogs high on coke lmaooo"
White Lines,[deleted]
White Lines,"Oh I don't mind spoilers at all since I've already ditched the show, but I might tune into ep 5 and just watch that scene with Boxer. Thanks for the heads up! ;)"
White Lines,"For me it was, I didn’t really like the main character and felt the editing was a bit all over the place."
White Lines,"The main charter was just horrible. I got so mad watching this show at around 3 o'clock in night that i almost woke up my GF, cuz i just couldn't stand the lead. Stopped there. Seems like the drugs, partying and other degeneracy is just there to pull audience - ""Yeah look we have drugs, like in Breaking Bad!"" 

I read an article about the show, it was praising the show because of ""feminism"". It's horrible and only people who watch this shit and think it's good are probably 14."
White Lines,">And apparently is an awesome rally driver because she's from Manchester???

She is also a natural diver.  :)"

>“Here’s the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,” Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

>Van Dien added that though she’s sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon — and on her own terms.

>“I’m happy here, and I’m developing my own projects,” she said. “I’m hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I’m not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.”"
Strangers from Hell,That’s fucked but at least she’s still able to do something lucrative and didn’t have to throw it all away to avoid being Weinsteined
Strangers from Hell,Scumbags are getting too comfortable again as time passes the Weinstein stuff. Time to nip that shit in the bud.
Strangers from Hell,who was she on stranger things?
Strangers from Hell,"This person clearly forgot that her father is Johnny f'n Rico. 

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
Strangers from Hell,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it’s getting really hard to see past it.
Strangers from Hell,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
Strangers from Hell,She should name the projects and producers.
Strangers from Hell,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"
Strangers from Hell,"Was so mesmerizing in the few scenes she had in ST, such a shame there are so many shitty people who take advantage of nice people like Grace.

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
Strangers from Hell,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
Strangers from Hell,Good for her.
Strangers from Hell,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I’m happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don’t usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that’s just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Strangers from Hell,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Strangers from Hell,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
Strangers from Hell,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Strangers from Hell,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Strangers from Hell,Chrissy woke up!!!
Strangers from Hell,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Strangers from Hell,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Strangers from Hell,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Strangers from Hell,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Strangers from Hell,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Strangers from Hell,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Strangers from Hell,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Strangers from Hell,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Strangers from Hell,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Strangers from Hell,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Strangers from Hell,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Strangers from Hell,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Strangers from Hell,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
Strangers from Hell,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Strangers from Hell,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Strangers from Hell,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Strangers from Hell,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Strangers from Hell,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
Strangers from Hell,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Strangers from Hell,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Strangers from Hell,"Understandable, have a great day"
Strangers from Hell,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Strangers from Hell,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Strangers from Hell,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Strangers from Hell,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Strangers from Hell,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Strangers from Hell,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Strangers from Hell,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Strangers from Hell,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
Strangers from Hell,Name them!
Strangers from Hell,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."
Strangers from Hell,Wait… that jawline. I just realized she’s Rico’s daughter.
Strangers from Hell,No idea who this is
Strangers from Hell,Hollywoods gunna Hollywood
Strangers from Hell,"Common Hollywood L 

Wish more actors and actresses were strong enough to call out all the predators

Sadly doing so puts their career and money at risk"
Strangers from Hell,"A producer asked his girlfriend to ask Grace if she would like to have a threesome. 

She decided not to. Then cried about it. Then left 

What a load of overblown hysterics."
Strangers from Hell,"""star"""
Strangers from Hell,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn’t still the case.
Strangers from Hell,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Strangers from Hell,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Strangers from Hell,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Strangers from Hell,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Strangers from Hell,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
Strangers from Hell,"Inaccurate title: ‘Stranger Things’ Star

‘Stranger Things’ Actor more like it - she's in 1 episode, and 2 flashbacks (uncredited)

Regardless - why is this still happening? Did Hollywood ignore the Harvey Weinstein crap"
Strangers from Hell,[removed]
Strangers from Hell,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
Strangers from Hell,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Strangers from Hell,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

Strangers from Hell,Least depraved Hollywood director/producer
Strangers from Hell,Star and Twitch streamer
Strangers from Hell,"*credited with 3 out of the shows 42 episodes*

""Star"""
Strangers from Hell,Totally understand. I wish she would name names. These animals need to be outed.
Strangers from Hell,"I'm a bit confused. Inapptiateness withstanding...is she turning down these roles because those several offers were associated with said producer? If so, I totally get it. But to turn down all work indiscriminately? Idk...sounds like we are missing some info here."
Strangers from Hell,She needs to get her dad to kick some ass.
Strangers from Hell,The number of people defending the dude as just asking her out is pathetic.
Strangers from Hell,Chrissy wake up!!! I don't like this!!! Chrissssssy wake up. I didn't know who she was in Stranger Things from the picture without looking her up. Fyi she is Chrissy from S4. Too bad she has to deal with creep producers but it looks like she has been streaming on Twitch so at least she is enjoy still making content.
Strangers from Hell,Wait til she finds out about the people on twitch too
Strangers from Hell,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Strangers from Hell,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein … you of all people can somehow get away with it …

Good for her honestly. She’s making money and she doesn’t even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you’re mad you’re just jealous because she’s living the dream."
Strangers from Hell,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Strangers from Hell,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Strangers from Hell,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Strangers from Hell,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."
Strangers from Hell,"Not the point of the article, but: Does anyone else not remember her in Stranger Things?"
Strangers from Hell,So who’s the producer? Get the name out and hopefully he’ll never produce anything again
Strangers from Hell,"Apparently if you want to bang women while in a position of power and authority over them, but are dumb and can't become a teacher, you become a sleazy EP."
Strangers from Hell,The two Coreys took a huge hit for talking about what happened to them. They were mocked reviled and blacklisted. All because pedos make money for Hollywood.
Strangers from Hell,"""Stranger things star""

Bit generous, that."
Strangers from Hell,"Hollywood is friggin gross. Always has been always will be, until there’s no more Hollywood."
Strangers from Hell,"Awful through and through.

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It’s arguable she’s laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

This scum bag probably has a reputation for doing it much the same."
Strangers from Hell,"not a star of the series, but sucky situation."
Strangers from Hell,I would be surprise if anyone would hire her after this article.

Strangers from Hell,Welcome to Hollywood
Strangers from Hell,Stranger Things star is a bit of a stretch isn’t it?
Strangers from Hell,"Say they name! Put them on blast. Only way you finna weed all these creeps out, they need to be put on blast. I know it’s difficult and you’re concerned about not being blackballed but we’ve seen people will collectively get together and weed out the bad ones if it’s enough voices. Just get these creeps out."
Strangers from Hell,"""Star"""
Strangers from Hell,"I believe her but if she's not going to make names, but she should name names to get the creep removed."
Strangers from Hell,Who does she play in stranger thing??
Strangers from Hell,Call in Rico’s Roughnecks! (is her dad not Casper Van Dien?)
Learning Time with Timmy,"Conheads, this is OUR season!"
Learning Time with Timmy,The Conheads are not gonna love this
Learning Time with Timmy,"If it is to be said, so be it — so it is."
Learning Time with Timmy,"I am here as a fellow human to acknowledge that ""Succession"" has, you know, ended. ""Succession"" was a show. Also ""Succession"" was a part of the HBO portfolio for 5 years. And when a show ends, it is sad. All shows will end someday. In this case, it is ""Succession"" which has done so. ""Succession"" was alive for 5 years, but no more. Now it is dead. One of the stars of ""Succession"" was Alan Ruck. He was a member of the cast for five years. Now he is calm and reserved."
Learning Time with Timmy,Thats my future president
Learning Time with Timmy,"He’s right. Five is a nightmare. Oh, yes, five will drive you un poco loco, my fine feathered friend."
Learning Time with Timmy,"""Take your coat off!!!"""
Learning Time with Timmy,"""Let my Cameron gooo"""
Learning Time with Timmy,"Succession is well made and I enjoy watching it, but man do I feel terrible about life and humanity afterwards."
Learning Time with Timmy,Imo season 3 already felt drawn out. It felt like an entire season of filler and spinning the same wheels it already had been the first two seasons. I think Logan should've died or been ousted early-mid last season and had this season be wrapping up changing power dynamics that could've started to settle last season
Learning Time with Timmy,At least cable believes in ending something. Meanwhile network TV keeps shit on for a hundred years.
Learning Time with Timmy,"I like this show a lot but I have long since stopped caring (if i ever did?) who gets control of the company. it's fun to watch charismatic actors bicker in their weird lingo but, you know, four seasons is plenty."
Learning Time with Timmy,I’m not one for spin offs but I would watch one about him going through politics.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Love this decision. Since the whole show is built around the idea that Logan will die soon it would be ridiculous to stretch it out longer. Leave us wanting more.

Also, Shiv spinoff, please"
Learning Time with Timmy,But nothing has happened. Very boring drama
Learning Time with Timmy,"Good to see most people involved are saying lets end on a high, seems like a lot of the cast and writers are on the same page.

Unlike r/television folk, who say this could have gone on for 1-2 more seasons after 4. Please, you're the same folk that bashed GOT/Dexter/Billions."
Learning Time with Timmy,Succession seems like an easy show to split off to other characters if there is indeed still some meat on the bone after Season 4.
Learning Time with Timmy,The second episode of season 1 was too drawn out.
Learning Time with Timmy,It's not TV it's overrated shows
Learning Time with Timmy,I would just like to take a moment to remind everyone once again that Connor Roy was interested in politics from a very young age.
Learning Time with Timmy,If there’s no Tom and Greg spin-off we riot
Learning Time with Timmy,I hope the finale takes place at Con's wedding (if they go through with it)
Learning Time with Timmy,Four seasons. So four years that Succession was on TV. You know what else lasts four years? An American President's term. Clearly the show gets a happy ending with him becoming president.
Learning Time with Timmy,Alan Ruck was interested in acting from a very young age
Learning Time with Timmy,This feels like a GPT prompt
Learning Time with Timmy,I would storm the capitol for him.
Learning Time with Timmy,The birthday party episode made me feel emotionally spent for like two days.
Learning Time with Timmy,"I mean tbh, I think its recycled nature is what makes it work at least for me. Each season were somewhat centralized on one of the children and how they get screwed over by their dad. First season was Kendall, then Shiv, then ultimately Roman. I think the repetitive nature helps emphasize the cycle of abuse Logan puts each of his kids into until ultimately they join up together for the 4th. The series just wouldn’t work if Logan wasn’t in the main picture since he’s literally the driving factor of the story."
Learning Time with Timmy,I really enjoyed season 3 but at the end of it I was wondering how much longer they could keep it going. Hope they're going to stick the landing.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Said it in the 3rd episode of S3, this should probably end in s4. Got shredded in the thread, trying to find it.

Glad the show runners are sensible."
Learning Time with Timmy,Yeah Season 3 had some great episodes but overall felt pretty aimless.  There was a lot of trajectory coming out of season 2 and then it just kind of got blunted.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Cries in Dexter, Weeds, Homeland, Shameless, and True Blood."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Exactly. Every single person vying for the crown is essentially horrible. It's easy at times to sympathize with the kids given the tragic upbringing they had - the loveless parents, and the constant carrot-dangling from their father. But in the end, they still choose to be horrible to their family, spouses, kids, etc. They lie, backstab, cheat, mislead, distort, self-aggrandize, belittle, bicker, torture..... It's entertaining, yes, but I keep hoping for at least some sense of paying the piper."
Learning Time with Timmy,I'd love to see a prequel where we get to watch a 4 year old Con become interested in politics.
Learning Time with Timmy,The spinoff we need is a 30 minute comedy of Tom and Greg living together in LA.
Learning Time with Timmy,"There is nothing magical from a storytelling perspective about ""4"" seasons vs 6 or 7. In fact part of GoT's problem in some ways could have been that it wasn't LONGER. They tried to rush seasons worth of events into 2 episodes at a time by the final season."
Learning Time with Timmy,Does it? Most of the characters' identity is tied up with the family's structure. Can't imagine a show with just one of them
Learning Time with Timmy,Are you a sicko
Learning Time with Timmy,I wouldn’t call it overrated one bit. It has me rooting for people who use subordinates as human furniture. That’s HBO.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Minor spoilers in relation to episode titles below 

>!Episode 2 is called The Rehearsal, which I’d presume is the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, if that’s the case I doubt the wedding would be THAT late in the season!<"
Learning Time with Timmy,I'm hoping that Logan will die with at least an episode to spare for the aftermath and I don't think I would want him to be absent from the wedding.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Well, Connor Roy was interested in politics at a very young age."
Learning Time with Timmy,"I don't know why people are so happy it's ending I could watch this for 10 seasons idgaf

needless to say the quality would likely drop but I love the characters and the writing I don't think it would ever get boring."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Well tbf, I think while the recycled nature works for the show thematically, on a plot level it isn’t a slice of life story like Sopranos or Mad Men or various sitcoms. It is more built around something people want resolved, the succession crisis. So while I agree this show should not be Breaking Bad type of progression and unrecyclable, I don’t think it really can go the length of the former two shows with the same type of wheel spinning.

Feels like the showrunner recognizes this as well and decided the next season is the last. And frankly that gives me a lot of confidence that this season will be very strong because they can’t reset the status quo from the fantastic season 3 ending."
Learning Time with Timmy,"""What's wrong son, are you afraid of pussy?"""
Learning Time with Timmy,The show runners listened to you!
Learning Time with Timmy,"The closest thing to that was Kendall realizing his utterly broken and alone he was near the finale of Season 3. He finally tells Logan he can’t do their life and pleads with him just to give him money to leave everything, and Logan just keeps toying with him"
Learning Time with Timmy,that's the identity of the show the family structure. the characters themselves can be put in any number of situations and still be the same character.
Learning Time with Timmy,I’m riveted watching it. It’s so well done. But there isn’t a single character I root for.
Learning Time with Timmy,Plot twist: Nathan Fielder cameo
Learning Time with Timmy,Oh interesting. Thanks for that info!
Learning Time with Timmy,If he conks it’ll be mid season I reckon. They really haven’t showed many clips of him in the lead up to the season
Learning Time with Timmy,"I'm not happy it's ending, i'm just okay with it."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Oh yeah, and admittedly, it was heartbreaking seeing Kendall break down finally in front of his siblings, but within moments they are back to being cutthroat and scheming and Kendall is back in “Bro” mode."
Learning Time with Timmy,I root for Roman.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Give me a meta episode, or even an SNL skit, where they're rehearsing with Nathan Fielder to bring down Logan."
Learning Time with Timmy,"The entire show so far has been Logan Roy rehearsing how to have a better relationship with his kids. After this episode we meet the real family, and somehow their relationship with Logan is even worse."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Oh yes, Kendall despite all his pain and breakdown, is still an asshole. He’s just an incredibly insecure one. They’ve implied that since they said he locked Roman in a dog cage and fed him cake inside when they were kids"
Learning Time with Timmy,"""Every time you interact with your father, Mr. Roy, you're going to speak quietly and in gibberish. If you all commit to this - you will make your father think he is going insane."""
Learning Time with Timmy,"Exactly, but remember Roman had asked him to do it. The insecurity runs throughout all of them. The constant battles between each that daddy really trusts them, daddy loves them…. All because of how Logan pits them against each other. And they all know that’s how he is. They all know he does it intentionally, but they keep clamoring for his attention, his approval, his grace."
Learning Time with Timmy,"None of these articles about streaming offer anything new or solutions. They just keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Streamers make too much stuff, need to focus more, and don't work to connect with their audience or build a culture. The answer is always ""less stuff of a higher quality"". But that would involve getting decent talent and putting restraint on them, something Netflix is having a hard time doing."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Streaming isn't too big, it's too fragmented. 

The problem isn't too much it's that the major players are scrambling to create new libraries to entice customer acquisition rather than creating works with substance. 

Disney has an excellent catalog from decades of creations as does HBO, but people don't know what to watch not because of the sheer volume of content but rather that you need 6 different services to even watch everything. 

The elephant in the room that is Netflix HAD everything under the sun early on and was putting out hit after hit from their Netflix originals, but when the competition caught up they shifted focus from substance to volume to entice new subscribers. The problem is is that they already had saturated the market and need(ed) to focus on retention. Instead they jacked their prices up. Instead of continuing fan favorite shows they drown them in a tub to pay elite talents for one off movies or shows that nobody can get invested in. Hundred million for Seinfeld. Hundred million for Ryan Reynolds. 50 million for a Chris Hemsworth movie. They did this at the critical juncture of needing retention VS acquisition and its sacrificing that retention to do so."
Learning Time with Timmy,"This might sound stupid and backwards...but I would watch my streaming services a lot more if I could just pick a bunch of series and then they created a ""TV Station"" playlist for me from them - just start playing one episode of each series in sequential order, then go to the next series. Does such a thing exist?"
Learning Time with Timmy,"People should stop specifically browsing on streaming services for things to watch, and use middle-men rating platforms like IMDB, or trakt.tv (or Letterboxd for movies) or many others to filter out low rated content. Almost every time someone complains that a movie or TV series they started on Netflix is trash, you can look it up and find that it has a terrible rating on IMDB and others. This is not a concidence.

Yes, there's an element of subjectivity here - but you're just more likely to enjoy something rated say 7.5 or over than between 5 and 6.5.

Streaming services are not going to naturally filter their content by highly rated to low rated."
Learning Time with Timmy,"we've cut the pie so razor thin that no one culturally connects with movies/tv anymore. watercooler talk is not longer ""can you believe what happened on ER this week?"" into ""have you seen Water Farts on WB+?""  ""oh no! i'll have to catch that, i was binging the 3rd season of Crime Babies on Peacock"".  We don't have these moments where everyone is consuming the same shows and enjoying the same content anymore.  ""appointment television"" and the Friends and Seinfeld finales feel like they're a millennium ago, in entertainment terms.  Everytime i meet up with friends and we try to talk about shows or movies its just us tennis balling show titles back and forth... :/"
Learning Time with Timmy,"My personal take is the issue is marketing. Many streamers are too focused on social media and reaction (see the music world's current Tiktok crisis) versus building fandoms or PR campaigns, and that with the crowded landscape it becomes noise.   


Shows are premiering with limited publicity or silo fanbases (Reddit not knowing about Yellowstone until all the Yellowstone spin-offs started showing up, that show taps into its audience successfully), and as such there is no curation or ability to build relationships to support smaller, underseen shows and create champions in communities or in the press (with exception of The OA or two etc).  


Netflix has tried to make Queue work, but not the investment to make it work and become a destination for latest information. There are only so many memes and UX modifications for other streamers to use, when it's most important that people to encounter content, why they choose to watch something, and creating efficient advocacy. This is hard work, so that's why IP is king at this moment."
Learning Time with Timmy,This is why HBO is killing it this year.
Learning Time with Timmy,We don't want more stuff. We want *better* stuff. I'd rather decide between two good shows than 10 shit ones.
Learning Time with Timmy,"One feature that I've always wanted is to be able to filter out either content that I've already seen, or content that I marked as having no interest in.

I heard that the streaming companies don't want to do this because they fear that you'll realize just how little ""good"" content they actually have."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Huh? Definitely not overloaded with content. I actually don't think there is enough solid content.

The issue is an overload of services. We want to see all the great content, but in order to do that we'd have to subscribe to a dozen services. And then even then, we have to sift through a majority of bad, filler content."
Learning Time with Timmy,"This is just another of the many Netflix hit pieces that Hollywood has been shoving down our throats in an attempt to make Netflix die by making it seem worse than it actually is.

Wired.com is owned by Condé Nast(a news/media org), which itself is owned by Advance Publications(another news/media organization), which is owned by the Newhouse family of which the Newhouse family also has a over [20% shareholding in Warner Bros. Discovery](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nasdaq/wbd/ownership) which of course owns a number of Netflix competitive services(HBO Max, Discovery+) as well as partnerships with numerous other competitive services(Hulu, Disney+, etc...) and of course is a member of the [big 4 news/media companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership#United_States) which own almost all news/media in the nation.

Netflix has had to deal with an almost never ending onslaught of attacks by the big 4 news/media mega corporations because they are seen as a threat to their stranglehold over the entertainment industry. That's why even though Netflix has been doing great for years, the moment there is a tiny dip in productivity or stock price all of the news/media will immediately start posting stories about how Netflix is dying or is bad and should be dropped by customers. It's actually quite amazing that Netflix has held on this long and even more amazing that none of the big 4 have been investigated for their obvious illegal collusion's and anti-competitive practices."
Learning Time with Timmy,"HBO has a better strategy, just the right amount to keep people interested and attatched. The Sopranos, Succession, Euphoria, GoT, Six Feet Under and a couple more notable ones, and thats it"
Learning Time with Timmy,"Articles like these are weird. Who wants to pay the same for less content? This reads like an advertisement from a media executive that wants you to pay the same for less shows so their end of year bonus will be a lot higher. Either that or the author is one of those privileged TV critics whinging that there is too much TV because they are a lazy bastard and have no interest in actually having to watch the shows they get paid to review. 

None of those things are an issue for consumers. Too many shows? Cut a few services. You actually save some money. Not good for critics clicks or executive bonuses but I’m not inclined to give a shit about either of those things. 

I remember the era of few channels/choices. It was no Golden Age!"
Learning Time with Timmy,It's overloaded with content because 95% and more is simply garbage. Take out all the shit nobody should ever look at in their life and there isnt even enough content for a year worth of weekends.
Learning Time with Timmy,"They’re problem was creating tons of content and ending it after 2 seasons to create more content and that’s not how you build long term viewers. It’s why I enjoy HBO, lengthy well-written seasons or short, complete mini-series."
Learning Time with Timmy,I wish they would make 1 great Netflix movie instead of 3 mediocre ones.
Learning Time with Timmy,"Funny you never heard about people having too much choice at Blockbuster and Hollywood video back in the 80s and 90s! 
While I agree given how easy it is to access everything it can seem overwhelming but people have to remember there’s always been too much content. There’s always been the dollar bin at Walmart/KY/Best Buy to pick through full of choices that you’ve never heard about were vaguely remember seeing a trailer for only for the movie to get a direct DVD/VHS release. The issue isn’t at the end of the day there’s too much stuff to watch the issue is these streaming services still don’t have a good interface to help the users select what they want. Look at Netflix the OG/official standard of streaming services and the way that they lay out all of the content. You have the big popular shit centered for you to look at only for the user to have to select an arrow that’s partially obscured on the right hand side of the screen to select more films in that category. Disney+ HBO max Peacock all of these apps have to give you contact one way or the other I mean how else are you going to scroll through things? The issue is these companies that on the streaming services can monitor what people watch/select to waste of time with more now so than ever versus going out to a video store and renting/walking through the aisle deciding what to pick."
Learning Time with Timmy,"I'm at the point I'm about to cancel everything. My normal viewing now is YouTube, and a handful of channels on subjects I enjoy, and I'm grandfathered in with my old Play Music subscription for no ads."
Learning Time with Timmy,"I dissgree.

I am not overloaded with content what so ever. It's just most of the content is a bit shit. Most movies and series I've watched and enjoyed recently simply have not been available on these streaming services."
Learning Time with Timmy,The article says they’re overloaded with content but every time I start up Netflix I feel like I can’t find anything I want to watch lol
Learning Time with Timmy,"I miss when Netflix had everything. Things like Spotify and Netflix only replaced piracy because of sheer convenience - but streaming isn't convenient any more. It is a pain in the ass trying to find out which service a program is on, if it's on any, and if it's even available in my country.

The variety of content isn't an issue for me - it's all the competitors fighting for a piece of the my payslip."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Netflix pretty ,much sucks, I dont get the appeal, their ""new releases"" as usually all 30 year old B films nobody would ever want to watch.   Every once in a while they get a series right, but beyond that it's garbage."
Learning Time with Timmy,"The one thing I hear from a lot of people is “I don’t want to start watching something and get invested in a show that is going to get cancelled.” 

Maybe the solution is making a commitment to a show for the first three seasons. A promise to the creators and the audience.  Give these things the time they need to develop their stride.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see subscriber retention numbers go up as a result."
Learning Time with Timmy,There are a lot of problems with streaming but too much content is absolutely not one of them.
Learning Time with Timmy,Just stop cancelling good shows and when an actor ask for a 1000000% increase in salary just say publicly it's why you had to cancel.
Learning Time with Timmy,"It’s the old case of so much to watch, but so little worth watching.

I used to watch TV, but it’s all pretty much garbage now, so instead I just listen to music, and random YouTube videos related to my hobbies.

TV streaming services are deadmen walking if they don’t improve the quality of their shows fast."
Learning Time with Timmy,"The issue isn't the amount of content, rather the amount of trash content. Netflix is now 90% filler, from trash studios and foreign TV networks. Occasionally you come across gems like The 3% or The Dark, but most of it just sucks and is a way for Netflix to imply value by filling the proverbial shelves."
Learning Time with Timmy,"It's especially pronounced with Netflix, which is like one of those shops that sells everything without really being good at any of it but you'll occasionally stumble across something good while going down an aisle.

I just finished watching We Own This City and it occurred to me how Netflix would never do anything like that. 

The algorithm won't allow it."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Wired has been missing the mark for a few years, it seems like they have the same Silicon Valley brain rot as the rest of the streaming giants and their corporate partners. 

The Streamers are extremely good at pumping out content, and absolutely horrible at gathering an audience around their content. I could get into a whole thing about Long Tail Theory and Digital Media, I could complain that the executives are working off a decades-old model of how demographics interact with media, I could point to the sad and pitiful attempts of these streaming companies to engage with online communities, but that won't change anything. The only way to do that is to unsubscribe. 

Instead, you should subscribe to Dropout.tv, its independent, funny, and they aren't paying me to say this."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Ngl, though this may seem to be the issue, the bigger issue imo is discoverability. Rarely has Netflix actually recommended something good for me. I usually find it if my own accord. They would be a lot better if they had good tools to help you sift through the crap you don’t like."
Learning Time with Timmy,"It's not too much content that is the problem, but too few with artistic and creative merit"
Learning Time with Timmy,"Gonna be honest I just watch youtube now, too much shit to dig through on the streaming sites back in the day I could find new gems now they pump up their catalog with shitty B/C movies and shows. Think the last thing I watched was Love Death and Robots and Arcane"
Learning Time with Timmy,I've never felt the problem was too much programming. It is too much bad programming. Streaming isn't the problem. It's reality TV.
Learning Time with Timmy,"The interesting thing is the steamers are generally trying to follow HBO’s footsteps and make *good* “television” for the most part. 

Sure there’s trash too but honestly compared to the things that end up on TV we’re hating on the streamers here? Half the junk being complained about is stuff made for TV living a second life on streaming.

What they are learning, in my opinion, is that blowing hundreds of millions on individual pieces of content doesn’t necessarily mean it will be good. And *that’s* the hard lesson here.

And when we talk about streamers, aside from Netflix all the others are in the TV business already(except Apple). I guess the real point they are trying to make is that without the schedule of Traditional TV people don’t know what to watch and the infinite selection is causing paralysis.

Just my 2c."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Who here is ""overloaded"" with content?   Please, speak up if you ""just have sooo many shows to watch""."
Learning Time with Timmy,This sounds like a bored journalist who couldn't decide what to watch on netflix so decided to write a whole ass article about it
Learning Time with Timmy,"Has anyone complaining about this ever considered just...not watching so much TV? Jesus christ, nobody is forcing you to watching everything under the sun. Find some shows you like, watch them, and move on. All this complaining about ""too much content"" is stupid and speaks to a lack of self control. It's not the streaming services fault that you give in to your every compulsion."
Learning Time with Timmy,"Bullshit. Quality content is needed. 

When Netflix released Squid games the entire world was watching… because it was actually good.  Shock horror."
Learning Time with Timmy,"They are all doing better than ever? Record subscriber count and record profits.

Hell, Netflix had their most profitable quarter and they didn't lose any subscribers. Some moron executive just chose to exclude russian subscribers turning their growth into a decrease. And as they didn't show growth compared to their lost quarter they lost half their value..."
Learning Time with Timmy,"When I envisioned aka carte cable in the nineties, this is 180 degrees opposite of what I was dreaming about."
True: Terrific Tales,Sober History?
True: Terrific Tales,"Andy and Jim reunited!

The trailer actually looks pretty good. I'll definitely watch it when Peacock fails and someone else picks it up."
True: Terrific Tales,"The Australian original was a lot of fun, be interested to check this out"
True: Terrific Tales,"Ed Helms needs a 'Ted Lasso'-like project. I always thought Jason Sudeikis was boring casting until Ted Lasso (I guess he showed range in Colossal, but still).


Ed Helms needs a role like that because he really seems like a one trick pony and his performances are real bores."
True: Terrific Tales,"This show is impossible to watch. It breaks into the storyteller from the reenactment every few seconds so it never finds it's pace. I could only watch about 10 minutes before I yelled ""what the fuck is this?!"""
True: Terrific Tales,Egg* Helms
True: Terrific Tales,I actually interviewed to be on this show. Guess this confirms they didn't pick my story.
True: Terrific Tales,"Oh look, Drunk History but worse."
True: Terrific Tales,Must be nice
True: Terrific Tales,"The Yasmin story was unbearable, I couldn’t stand her!!!"
True: Terrific Tales,"Loved *True Story with Hamish & Andy*, hope this half as decent."
True: Terrific Tales,"Agreed, it does get better when the story gets 3/4 of the way through but honestly its way over produced. Id much rather hear an uninterrupted version on joe rogan podcast instead of this."
True: Terrific Tales,"Oh man, this means we won't get the Elizabethan showdown."
True: Terrific Tales,"So FYI, HBOMax has a competiting project based on the same tru crime story led by Elizabeth Olsen and it’s already filming (Love and Death)

Moss dropping (considering she was also producing) probably means that she gave up and feels like the race is lost as their production is nowhere near starts🤷🏾‍♂️ also while I like Jessica Biel she’s currently not on the same level as a Elizabeth Moss or Elizabeth Oslen so it’s kind of a downgrade from a image point of view. Still checking out when it premiers the story seems really interesting."
True: Terrific Tales,"So a cult member is being replaced with an anti-vaxxer.

Not much of an upgrade."
True: Terrific Tales,Beil is doing a great job in this portrayal. She was pretty damn good in The Sinner too. 10/10 would recommend. It's a fascinating story.
True: Terrific Tales,UN-JESSICA-BEAL-IEVABLE
True: Terrific Tales,I won't be watching this and supporting Biel who is antivax
True: Terrific Tales,great ass
True: Terrific Tales,Biel was a great in *The Sinner* though story ended up being a little cheesier than I was expecting.
True: Terrific Tales,"That's a bummer and definitely not a good sign as you explained. Gotta be honest and admit that I'm not really as hyped anymore and that I'll first check Love And Death and then Candy, if I watch it at all."
True: Terrific Tales,"On the flip side, I don't touch anything that Moss does with her gross scientology connections."
True: Terrific Tales,Moss dropping is good for Olsen because she isn't on the same level as Moss. On the other hand Biel can be good as much as Olsen like she showed in The Sinner.
True: Terrific Tales,It’s always amusing to see these competing projects in the news. Like I noticed there’s been virtually no new updates about “Francis and the Godfather” (which also has Elisabeth Miss involved) once “The Offer” miniseries was announced and started filming.
True: Terrific Tales,"Anti-vaxxer activist, so like a step worse than just anti-vaxxer"
True: Terrific Tales,They also occasionally act.
True: Terrific Tales,Biel is antivaxx?
True: Terrific Tales,Imagine actually being this petty.
True: Terrific Tales,Good luck finding anything to watch that doesn’t have someone involved with something unsavory.
True: Terrific Tales,"Jessica Biel is anti-vax, so she's not great as well"
True: Terrific Tales,"On the flip flip side, Biel is an anti-vaxx activist. So this show seems doomed lol"
True: Terrific Tales,"lol, so what media CAN you watch? Anyone who works in Hollywood is religious in some way. And mostly Christian. And we all know all the blatant abuse Christians are behind. Scientology does not even come close."
True: Terrific Tales,You are really underrating Elizabeth Olsen.
True: Terrific Tales,"I'm not quite sure if they are in the same level acting wise, but based on popularity Elizabeth Olsen is on the same level or higher than Moss.Olsen has been in the biggest movies in the world (avengers), one of the biggest shows of 2021 (Wanda vision) and is apart of the Olsen family. I could already tell which one is going to be the biggest show,even when Moss was in the lead role.Especially with David E. Kelley's involvement."
True: Terrific Tales,"Jesus, that's despicable. And I have autism too, so for me it's like she's saying people like me shouldn't exist, or that she'd rather risk her kids dying than be like me. It's why I despise Jenny McCarthy too, since she's the one who really started putting that shit out there in a big way.

Is Justin Timberlake (Biel's husband) anti-vax too? That'd be really, really disappointing."
True: Terrific Tales,And an [activist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/2019/06/jessica-biel-anti-vaxx-california-robert-f-kennedy.html) about it too
True: Terrific Tales,I do actively avoid things with people that are horrible. Do you still watch Kevin Spacey films? Once I know I avoid.
True: Terrific Tales,"You mean Catholics. Catholic Church has most of the pedophile accusations. Christianity itself is a general term. 

But the honest answer is I don't know that most of them are religious or not, nor do I know their dark secrets.

As long as I don't know I can enjoy their work. Once something comes out I can not. Such as Kevin Spacey."
True: Terrific Tales,Not really. Olsen is talented but Moss is better than Olsen. She has been giving amazing performances for a long time. She won 2 Golden Globe and got almost a dozen emmy nominations and two win.
True: Terrific Tales,"I didn't say anthing about popularity. Popularity or being in biggest films, shows doesn't mean quality. Zoe Saldana was in even more big films but that doesn't make her better than Moss or Olsen."
True: Terrific Tales,"Yeah, because there are a lot of other people involved in his films/shows that aren’t dirt bags."
True: Terrific Tales,"In the name of Jesus, Christianity in a MUCH broader sense has abused the greater parts of the world for 1700+ years, please.

Agreed on Spacey. I hate the fact I can never enjoy Usual Suspects or Seven the same way again."
True: Terrific Tales,"I don't hate Moss and she is good in many things but she is a classic over actor.  I mean Handmaid's Tale is a great example of this.  It seems like Moss' good acting often boils down to crying and making anguish noises well.

I also find her delivery a little flat sometimes, but just my opinion."
True: Terrific Tales,What have you watched Olsen in? I like Moss and I know her accolades but just because she has them that doesn't make her a better actress. And to say Biel is on Olsen's level is downright untrue.
True: Terrific Tales,[deleted]
True: Terrific Tales,"I can't watch him. Sure other people were involved, but that doesn't change the face. If someone behind the scenes was a dirt bag it would be easy to ignore but not when a main cast member is the problem."
True: Terrific Tales,I haven't seen Handmaid's Tale but she was great in Mad Men. I still think its her most iconic role. I do think she is slightly better than Olsen.
True: Terrific Tales,"I would suggest seeing Moss’ other works. The writing in Handmaid’s Tale from season 2 onwards isn’t putting Moss’ acting talents to good use at all.

With her film work however like The Invisible Man and Her Smell, she is a powerhouse."
True: Terrific Tales,I saw Olsen's best performances and Moss has her accolades thanks to the her talent which makes her better. And I said that Biel can be good as much as her according to her performance in The Sinner which is totally true.
True: Terrific Tales,There is no issue in my original comment and that isn't the whole sentence. You cut the most important part of my sentence.
True: Terrific Tales,Do you watch anything Weinstein touched?
True: Terrific Tales,"Doubling down on more awards = better actor and can't name an Olsen performance. Ok, now we know not to take you seriously."
True: Terrific Tales,"Yes because again, he is behind the scenes and I can separate that. Not so much when a main cast member does something and their face is right there."
True: Terrific Tales,Your last two replies confirmed that you have a problem with reading comprehension. Her accolades are the result of her talent that makes her better. And except her first film I saw Olsen's whole filmography and two shows she leaded but I don't see point of writing all of them to satisfy a fanboy who has no argument which shows that there is no need to take you seriously.
True: Terrific Tales,Seems like sort of weak principles then. As long as the face of the product is fine it doesn't matter where the money is going?
True: Terrific Tales,"If you read back to what you originally replied to I had clearly said that. I won't ignore the work and art people worked hard for if I can. It's easy to separate the ""money guy"" (which is all the Weinstain Brothers are in the end) from the movie. Not so for the star actor."
True: Terrific Tales,"Either take a moral stand or don't, but don't half ass it."
True: Terrific Tales,"Under the Dome went on forever.
It was a pretty big book, but it could've easily been told in one season of a show."
True: Terrific Tales,"Bloodlines… A perfect single season, take off the tag at the end and it’s done."
True: Terrific Tales,"Wayward Pines. It was written and shot as a miniseries, and adapted the entire trilogy it was based on. Fox sat on it, believing it would flop, and when it didn't, they rushed a second season into existence in only 9 months, despite none of the actors or writers being locked down to return, resulting in a pointless season 2 that feels like a direct to video sequel"
True: Terrific Tales,The Terror
True: Terrific Tales,"I have to agree with Squid Game. It feels the story was perfect to fit one season. The surprise element is now lost. However, I also think I'll have to actually watch Season 2 to confirm this impression. Maybe they'll come up with a different, interesting story."
True: Terrific Tales,13 Reasons Why
True: Terrific Tales,The Flight Attendant was very unnecessary
True: Terrific Tales,Heroes. 1st season is fucking gold. Everything else is garbage
True: Terrific Tales,"Russian Doll. Don't get me wrong, I \*liked\* season 2. I just didn't think it was necessary."
True: Terrific Tales,"The Handmaid's Tale is a 300 page book that they finished adapting at the end of season one, and then just... kept going, to increasingly diminishing returns."
True: Terrific Tales,Designated Survivor didn't even need a second episode. Would have worked better as a movie or TV movie.
True: Terrific Tales,Altered Carbon
True: Terrific Tales,"Prison Break. I mean, the question of how they get away while on the run is a relevant one, but (1) they've already broken out of prison and (2) except for some arcs, what we got was stupid as fuck, where the first season was really good"
True: Terrific Tales,"Big Little Lies. I thought the ending to season 1 was perfect just the way it was.

Edit: Sorry, I guess I didn't read much past the question and saw that OP already suggested this one. I agree."
True: Terrific Tales,"Westworld.  First season reveal was the perfect level of head fuckery, really should have been a one and done deal."
True: Terrific Tales,"Bad Sisters 

Not sure how they’ll pull this off unless it’s a prequel, >!they’ll be missing the amazing Claes Bang as JP!<"
True: Terrific Tales,Once Upon A Time
True: Terrific Tales,Heroes
True: Terrific Tales,West world.  A slight different ending but just a epic first season
True: Terrific Tales,"I completely agree with Squid Game.

People have this weird thing where they constantly want more, even if having more isn't really what's best.  Sometimes, it's OK to be hesitant with a story's natural conclusion.

For years, Lois Lowery refused to write a sequel to The Giver. She preferred the readers to decide what happened in the end. It was a brilliant ending that challenged young readers to use their imaginations, but readers kept pestering her until she eventually conceded to their demands. The result was fine, but not at all what I had envisioned.

Squid Game's ending had a similar set-up with our hero and a child poised for the ambiguous happy ending that could have been very satisfying, but dashed it to bits in the last moment. While I'm sure it will have strong viewership in its next season, I'm genuinely uninterested. I don't need more of the same, nor do I need some crazy twist."
True: Terrific Tales,I am glad that the HBO Watchmen series ended after one season. It was a great followup  and yet standalone story (better than comic sequels) and ended at fine stopping point. I don't need to see any more
True: Terrific Tales,"Jessica Jones’ first season was an incredible, personal story about how Kilgrave had wrecked havoc on Jessica’s life. She finally came to terms with her trauma and overcame it, leaving the show feeling wrapped up.

But then it had two more seasons. I felt that Season 2 really struggled to justify why I was still following this character, so I didn’t bother with S3."
True: Terrific Tales,The Handmaid's Tale
True: Terrific Tales,The End of the F***ing World.
True: Terrific Tales,Bloodline
True: Terrific Tales,"Gonna say Sneaky Pete. The storyline in season 1 was a neat little arc. Once it got away from Marius's brother and his past criminal dealings and leaned entirely into the family he was pretending to be a member of, it just fell apart."
True: Terrific Tales,"13 Reasons Why. For every single reason. The big ones being the book’s story was fulfilled in the first season, and then it became sad riverdale."
True: Terrific Tales,"Quantico

I thought S1 was just brilliant television.  I was hooked and satisfied at the end and didn’t know how they could possibly follow it up.  

I think they did do a good job in S2 with the follow up.  But it didn’t capture the magic that S1 had.  

S3 was so bad that it ruined the show in my opinion.  

So long story short- Quantico could have been a truly special series had they let S1 be the show.  But trying to drag it out ruined any value the show had."
True: Terrific Tales,"Your Honor. 

s1 ended perfectly, with all the characters getting their resolution for the most part from the events that took place. When me and my wife saw s2 as a thing we just shrugged and asked “why?”"
True: Terrific Tales,Wayward pines
True: Terrific Tales,The Watcher. What the hell else is there to mine from that concept? First one wasn’t even very good at all
True: Terrific Tales,"I feel like ‘You’ falls into this category. It absolutely didn’t need a 2nd season, and although the 2nd season was good it could have held up as a standalone series."
True: Terrific Tales,"The Morning Show. Season 1 was an incredible ride where all events and storylines led to a brilliant climax. Characters were compelling, tension was high, and the payoff was huge.

Season 2 took some hard left turns. The writers changed >!the entire personality of the main love interest (Cory) from cunning, morally grey and confident to entirely unconfident, stereotypical good guy.!< They also gave Mitch a brilliant redemption arc just to >!have him commit suicide immediately after, and use his death as relatively dull character development for everyone else.!< It also didn't help that the >!entire season was rewritten to include the pandemic, meaning we were re-living a very predictable set of events!< which was not very interesting to watch, and made me cringe a bit throughout. The ending was >!anti-climactic, with a focus on characters that weren't nearly as compelling!<. Edit: almost forgot, the ending of >!Alex losing her mind on haphazard rants on home livestream broadcasts!< didn't really make sense for her character. Maybe I missed something... Idk.

a bit of a salty rant, I suppose. I'm still mad that >!they took an entire season to show Mitch how to be a decent human and then immediately killed him in a moment of depression/hopelessness right after the most hopeful moment he had in months. cheap out to his character, imo.!<"
True: Terrific Tales,Prison break
True: Terrific Tales,I loved The Bear and am afraid S2 will only damage what could have easily stood on its own as a one-season story arc.
True: Terrific Tales,I agree with you with Squid Game. I think it told an excellent cohesive story that doesn’t require any further explanation. I also thought the same for Alice in Borderland but I’m actually loving season 2 a lot.
True: Terrific Tales,"Altered carbon. 

The first season of the show and the book were great. The second book was... Not and it's evident in the show."
True: Terrific Tales,I don't think Big Little Lies Season 2 was that bad. It was unnecessary but still enjoyable.
True: Terrific Tales,Goliath. Great season 1 and a really boring season 2
True: Terrific Tales,"13 Reasons Why.

The first season ended fairly conclusively. There really wasn’t much more story to tell."

Trial By Media,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Trial By Media,"Is outer banks that good, didn't see much buzz here"
Trial By Media,"Neat. Thanks for this.

Space Force's stats are quite impressive for a show that only debuted a week ago."
Trial By Media,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.
Trial By Media,I’m surprised Ozark is that high

Trial By Media,Interesting to see containment show up.
Trial By Media,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Trial By Media,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Trial By Media,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Trial By Media,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Trial By Media,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Trial By Media,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Trial By Media,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Trial By Media,How about movies??
Trial By Media,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Trial By Media,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Trial By Media,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Trial By Media,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Trial By Media,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Trial By Media,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Trial By Media,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Trial By Media,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Trial By Media,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Trial By Media,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Trial By Media,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Trial By Media,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Trial By Media,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Trial By Media,[deleted]
Trial By Media,Pandemic boost
Trial By Media,He write it at the end of his post.
Trial By Media,Last 100 days
Trial By Media,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Trial By Media,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Trial By Media,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Trial By Media,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Trial By Media,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Trial By Media,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

I use this which considers all 3 to be exclusive international distribution deals.


Thank you for that other correction"
Trial By Media,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Trial By Media,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Trial By Media,That's why I thought you should know...
Trial By Media,[deleted]
Trial By Media,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."
Trial By Media,"Was kinda odd place to put it anyway.

Had to scroll all the way down to read what they meant then scroll up again.. :p"
Trial By Media,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Trial By Media,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Trial By Media,[deleted]
Trial By Media,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Trial By Media,Well yeah.  Basically anyone with any interest is going to watch both.  (And those with especially strong opinions about which is better will have to watch both to effectively craft their arguments as to which show is superior).
Trial By Media,"There’s a competition? What, are they both airing at the same time on different channels? 😂 or is it 2022 and we can stream both whenever we want to? Oh good, I was hoping it was the latter."
Trial By Media,"It isn’t a competition, since both can win, but they will obviously draw comparisons between each other."
Trial By Media,Wheel of Time crying in the corner
Trial By Media,Wait until they find out I have the LoTR books right next to the GoT books on my bookshelf.
Trial By Media,Dumb. It's not like Deep Impact and Armageddon releasing within weeks of each other.
Trial By Media,The fact that two fantasy series with such rich and familiar lore are being made at the same time is something to be celebrated.
Trial By Media,"I thought it was just a fun rivalry. I like it, it’s something that makes watching both even more fun."
Trial By Media,"Media uses media to generate interest about media, says media."
Trial By Media,2 fantasy tales dropped at the same time. Feels like it's pretty damn obvious that the two will compete.
Trial By Media,I mean its a pretty obvious and natural comparison. The media is irrelevant. Probably helps both shows anyway
Trial By Media,"Both different enough that I'll happily watch both.  This isn't like watching NCIS followed by NCIS: Los Angeles.

Different worlds, different politics, different focuses.  It's a good time to be a fantasy fan honestly."
Trial By Media,What? Two of the biggest fantasy IPs releasing new shows within 2 weeks of each other. People are naturally going to compare and put them head-to-head. The media had little to do with it.
Trial By Media,My TV will only turn on for one hour a week and I'm so conflicted
Trial By Media,I'll take No Shit for $2000 alex
Trial By Media,"Makes sense. I know to the casual ""it's both fantasy"". But they are very different properties. LOTR is more magical, morality driven, and based on different types of races and high concepts. ASOIAF is more human drama based, has a degree of realpolitik cynicism, and the magical stuff is really periphery and often not acknowledged (compared to the world that literally as Wizards, magical rings, elves, the equivalent of angels, balrogs, talking dragons, dwarves, etc). 

They shouldn't really be something you can compare one to one."
Trial By Media,I declare a Trial By Combat.
Trial By Media,I hate that shit so much.  It's the same with video games where people have to stan for one game over the other.  Like you can't just enjoy both?
Trial By Media,"Producer “The media is manufacturing headlines”

Media: “Quick! Release a story with that in the headline!!!”"
Trial By Media,"PS vs Xbox Mac vs PC,Marvel vs DC,Intel vs AMD - its just the same ol nerd tribalism and flame wars as always."
Trial By Media,"Of course, why can’t you just watch both? 
And wouldn’t one get you excited for the other? Only one episode a week"
Trial By Media,"It’s so dumb. Like why do we have to “choose one or the other”?

I’d rather enjoy everything as long as it’s good!"
Trial By Media,Manufactured by the media? HBO clearly chose to release close to LOTR.
Trial By Media,"Funny how these calls of there being no competition are only coming from Amazon.

Meanwhile HBO cleary chose to release in the same time window as RoP."
Trial By Media,"I'm looking forward to ROP, and HOTD has already come out with an amazing first episode, so hopefully, we get two amazing shows running side by side. HOPEFULLY. Lots of people are dubious of the potential of ROP, based upon the marketing nightmare over the past few months, but fingers crossed the show is good."
Trial By Media,Didn’t realize it was a competition
Trial By Media,"I could see this being a competition if this was in the age of ""time-slot television"", but since both programs are streamable, there is no competition for viewers. You either watch it or you don't."
Trial By Media,LOTR doesn’t have brutal gore and taboo sexual meat touching so it isn’t for me
Trial By Media,"The real winner here is Cobra Kai

**NO MERCY!!**"
Trial By Media,It's amazing we're getting two high-profile fantasy shows at the same time. It doesn't have to be one or the other. I'm watching both.
Trial By Media,I’m just upset the dwarf doesn’t have a fuckin beard
Trial By Media,"This isn’t like the old days of television, it’s not like we have to choose one or another with the multitude of ways we have to watch and rewatch shows. There is space for both, and if people like them, they’re going to watch them."
Trial By Media,I have a feeling most people who watch one are watching the other too
Trial By Media,Naturally there will be some competition between both shows. But fans of high fantasy get 2 shows at the same time from well respected sources so we win either way.
Trial By Media,"Breaking news: The entertainment industry is competitive just like any other. Wow, who would have imagined?"
Trial By Media,There's a competition?
Trial By Media,"I don’t give a fuck about either of them so it checks out. People who like fantasy are going to watch both. People who don’t, won’t watch either."
Trial By Media,Or most may just watch both for fun and move on
Trial By Media,Producers now doing the football coach thing and blaming the media for everything
Trial By Media,"what a coincidence, idgaf about either one lol"
Trial By Media,Competition is good if it makes both products better.
Trial By Media,Because Highlander is coming and there can be only one.
Trial By Media,One’s to watch with the Fam the other is to watch it when the kids are asleep
Trial By Media,"No shit... That's how media and promotion work!!

Although, I will only be watching 'Rings of power' as I got bored of GoT after so long, and not been interested in picking it up again...."
Trial By Media,"That, and they’ve released two sword and sorcery fantasy shows at just about the same time and they’re 100% competing for people’s interest."
Trial By Media,Not just the media. People on here have tried to make it a thing.
Trial By Media,"if one doesnt have to win, then there is no competition. this is idiotic. they could be similar, that doesnt mean they have the same audience. even if they have, they are not in a race. stop making same ass reviews about these two and move on."
Trial By Media,Rings of what?
Trial By Media,Imma watch both and be happy for both.
Trial By Media,Both these shows are marketing themselves as victims of racism and sexism and it’s too cynical of a move for me to validate by giving them a view.
Trial By Media,I’m looking forward to both. I kinda would prefer one then the other but I’m not going to say no to two high budget fantasy shows.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"This was a great video. 

FOR ME TO POOP ON!"
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I have no idea how I started watching these a few weeks ago, but I can't stop. And I don't want to.

Every 'series' has it's own feel and editing quirks, and I am in total agreement that it is a 'universe' of content - the cast/staff at BA constantly flit in and out of each other's videos; their throwaway comments reveal aspects of their lives and relationships over time; and their energy invites you into their world.

My wife and I have started cooking BA best recipes, and we've learnt so many new techniques or reasons for cooking in certain ways. 

But, we don't watch because it's a cooking channel; we watch because it's fucking amazing!"

Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,This was a great read.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Delta state was the shit!
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,It was on both actually
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Interesting. It’s insane how many shows I would normally have been all over, that now fly past my radar. All part of cutting cable I suppose.

Thanks for posting this! I’ll watch E01 now."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I might give this a go. Knowing it's entering its final season straight up means it won't be a sunk investment with no closure. 4 seasons feels good for a complex time travel story. 
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,12 monkeys was made into a tv show...?
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"God I can't wait for this. This show is so fucking good... 

For clarity- I started watching it on a whim because I was out of TV. Had no expectations. And I was hooked really quickly. Quality TV. "
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Damn this review had some high praise. If they actually manage to pull everything together and tie off all the open threads, this has the potential to be absolutely incredible. I’m very hyped."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Where can I catch up on the seasons?
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Damn, I completely forgot that 12 Monkeys is airing this month. Kinda sad that s4 will be the last one but I'm glad this show exists, one of my favourite. "
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Glad to hear it, expected nothing less. "
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,One of my favourite shows the last few years.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I really like the way they're putting them on a few at a time, wish more shows would do that"
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"I just watched the first episode, it’s pretty good! It’s been a while since I’ve seen the movie and the writing is making it feel fresh."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"12 Monkeys is by far the best time travel show ever! I did not stutter!!  EVER! And one of the big reveals, apparently was developed from the beginning.  Amazing show.  If you are not watching it now, what are you waiting for."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I really had no idea this show was still on. We watched the first season and some of season two and then it just seemed to disappear.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Same here

Didn't even know it existed"
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"It’s 100% worth it. It’s such a rewarding show to watch, as it was so meticulously pre-planned that everything has an eventual payoff. It’s mindblowing that a time travel show that thrives on having dozens of interweaving time loops manages to have near zero plot holes."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Compex does not even begin to cut it.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Yeah a really good tv show
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"It diverges very significantly from the movie, so it's definitely more than just a long remake. I recommend it,."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"You should see the rench short from the early 60s that 12 Monkeys was based on. Le Jetté, I believe it's called, about a guy who remembers seeing a man die on a jetty while on holiday as a child with his mother and then he winds up becoming that man who was shot dead. Might still be on Youtube but it's only ten minutes long."
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Hulu in the US

Edit: and to anyone with Hulu in the US, if you haven’t seen it, watch it "
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"It's on Netflix in the UK, might also be there in the US?"
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,It's on Amazon Prime in Canada.

Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,It's insane how far ahead everything was plotted. Just rewatched his first meeting with Jennifer Goines in the asylum. She's warbling on about liking 'primary' colours seasons before that became a thing.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,This post has sold me on trying it out. Fear Agent is probably the only other long running time travel story I can think of where everything made sense and was coherent at the end.
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Thanks for selling it to me :)
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Sweet
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,for one season and quickly turned to runny crap for Season 2
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Thanks!!
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Thanks!
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,Thanks 
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,I have Hulu
Chico Bon Bon: Monkey with a Tool Belt,"Seriously. Every year I’ve rewatched the previous seasons and it just makes me enjoy the show more each time. They set up so many clues and breadcrumbs that build on each other in crazy and interesting ways. Everything is important. Their actions cause repercussions that they may not realize for much later but was totally planned.  

It’s really cool when that first meeting was revisited in season 3 and later when you see Jennifer again you see a little of how her mind works and just how crazy that is. I really love this show "

But seriously, you’re misreading a lot of this. 

The archetype of the squabbling married couple is so prevalent because it is so damn relatable. Marriage is hard. There are disagreements, misunderstandings, and lies on a very regular basis. 

That’s why comedy writers use them. They’re telling everyone at home, “Look, it’s normal to want to teach your nosy wife a lesson about respecting your privacy by setting a trap for her. But, it’s such a trivial thing that you’ll be laughing about it before you know it, and if you aren’t, then your marriage has much bigger problems.”

Writers take an extremely common and relatable situation, and then stretch it to it’s most logically absurd end to highlight the silliness of it. 

And in that way, it all becomes a big inside joke for all the couples who have been in a similar situation."

They have an argument then, get on with life.  

That's how marriage works, and they always talk about their issues and, in the end, Tim does the right thing."

Valeria,I loved it ! Couldn’t get enough of these characters who don’t seem to have their lives together yet are trying. Very entertaining. It reminded me of GIRLS.

Valeria,"Hey FYI  - the French show ""The Bureau"" is by FAR the best espionage/spy/thriller TV show out there. Makes shows like Homeland look amateurish. I would highly recommend it."
Valeria,I'm glad to see that *Dead to Me* made the list.
Valeria,Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.

Valeria,"Wow, ""Hollywood"" so high. Too be fair the first episodes were interesting but then it turned to a cringey cheesefest if there ever was one."
Valeria,"Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it’s such a good show."
Valeria,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
Valeria,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
Valeria,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
Valeria,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
Valeria,Never heard of Money Heist
Valeria,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
Valeria,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
Valeria,"Well now I’m intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
Valeria,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
Valeria,Dark is on there for Germany.

Valeria,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
Valeria,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
Valeria,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
Valeria,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
Valeria,It’s by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it’s great. Ultra realistic
Valeria,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
Valeria,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
Valeria,What movie? There is only the animated series.
Valeria,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
Valeria,"Do it, you won’t regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I’ve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can’t compare right now."
Valeria,I just hope Pablo makes it out ok at the end
Valeria,"I'm about halfway through the second episode, and so far it has been extremely strong. I honestly have no complains. Imagine Goodfellas, Cocaine Cowboys, and Blow, all fused together. All the actors are doing a great job.
 



edit: the cinematography and camerawork are also impressive, I'm not sure what the budget was for Narcos, but it looks very good.

&nbsp;

edit2:

I've finished all 10 episodes, and noticed my comment was the top voted, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on Season 1.

&nbsp;



Narcos has a rich and fluent narrative, the dialogue and the acting make this crime drama extremely immersive and engrossing. I don't feel like I'm even watching a TV show at times, and that's largely thanks to Wagner Moura's lead portrayal of Escobar, a larger-than-life crime lord that while responsible for thousands of innocent deaths, still held the hearts of many people. 

Additionally, the writing, and the way multiple stories are intertwined and weaved together in Narcos is quite good. From Escobar, to the DEA, to the CIA, and even the Cali Cartel, there is so much going on, but it works. 

My complaints are that at times, the time-jumps seem odd and a bit jarring. It starts in the late 70's, and ends in the early 90's, however, due to pacing, the change between many years feels confusing and is not fluent. Also, the Red Viper's character Peña, is underutilized, more focus should've been spent on him, in my opinion, and less than Murphy, who has a very predictable arc. 

"
Valeria,The pilot was amazing. I love how they intermingled real footage from the 80s.
Valeria,"Really enjoyed the first episode.  The Brazilian Wagner Moura is doing a fantastic job as Pablo Escobar.   I love that the characters are speaking their native language instead of English all the time.  Lastly, Steve's voice over story telling seems to flow very well. Not sure if its going to continue every episode but I liked it a lot. "
Valeria,"Probably one of the best things we've seen in a very long time.
Only other show that came close to having me this hooked was LOST.
I started watching around 8am and was done around 8:30 pm with the whole season.
10/10

"
Valeria,5 Episodes in. And I've already become hooked. Wagner Moura has been exceptional as Pablo Escobar portraying his charisma and ruthlessness. I can really see him being nominated for an Emmy in the future.
Valeria,Wagner Moura is finally getting the attention that he deserve. His perfomance in Elite Squad was perfect.
Valeria,"Just finished it. Comparison to Goodfellas were spot on, not as great, but really good. Similar style from the narration to the shots. I would also compare it to City of God.

Spanish being my native languague I noticed the 'wrong' accents and you could really tell Wagner Moura is from Brazil, but he still killed it and had an amazing perfomance. Also as much as I love Luis Guzman since we come from the same place, his character is the one that felt most out of place.

I know the chopped the story, but it was a great show. 9/10 and would love to see more. The only thing that I'm wondering is that they went through most of Escobar's story and I really can't see why they didn't add 2 more episodes and finish it. Season 2 will have a change of pace if they told like 10 years of story( not really sure) in season 1, but have like 1 year left for season 2, unless the change it up after the first episodes.

Loved it."
Valeria,"I had high hopes for this show and it has actually exceeded my exectations. Holy fuck, this show is good."
Valeria,"Without any spoilers, how much of this is true, and how much is made up for the show?"
Valeria,Im glad that i can already see a lot of influence from the Elite Squad Movies with the voiceover and freeze frame in the first few minutes. Jeez im excited for this.
Valeria,"it has oberyn martell. what else do you need?

pedro pascal is the sexy monster."
Valeria,Probably my new favorite netflix series. 
Valeria,Are the episodes each 30 mins or an hour long?
Valeria,Four episodes in and my goodness am I impressed! Really well developed and the story is unfolding smoothly. Amazing cinematography and cut scenes which not only add a striking visual effect but progress the series nicely as well. Solid acting on what looks like a big budget series. Love seeing all the influences playing a role in the creating of a series I am very excited to be a part of. 
Valeria,Let's be honest this show is way better than the current season of True Detective. I don't know how this thing got a score of only 74% it's pretty epic. Wagner Moura does an amazing Pablo.
Valeria,My weekend is planned...been waiting for this for awhile.  
Valeria,The narrators voice sounds like someone whose voice I recognize but neither myself nor my wife can place it. Any ideas 
Valeria,"I just finished the first episode and so far so good. I want to re-watch the first episode, thats how much i liked it. "
Valeria,"And there goes a weekend of good intentions. Thank you Netflix. Since yesterday I have watched the first six episodes (I am in Europe, so for once I might be ahead of you US guys).

This is good. I spend my youth in the 80s and still vaguely remember the headlines of the time, so this quite some journey back in time. 

Ever since Goodfellas I love this type of storytelling. A ""minor"" character who is part of the action but not the driving factor, retells his story in a broader context aided by voice-overs. My only point of contention is unfortunately the DEA guy doing the story telling. I find him a bit bland (he definitely is no Henry Hill/Ray Liotta), but the rest of the ensemble is very good. The story is intriguing and although I know how it will end I am drawn into the story. 

Also, for an US production I am pleasantly surprised that it does not show the Columbians as some sort of idiots and seems to give them due. 

As I don't speak any Spanish it makes for concentrated watching as I have to read the subtitles for most of the dialogue. Which is nice.

It's 9 pm here now - so I give it one or two more episodes for today. 

"
Valeria,Excellent show. Another classic one from Netflix!
Valeria,"As a Colombian who experienced these dark times in person, i can say it is pretty accurate. I do hate, however, that Pablo is played by brazilian actor. his accent is horrible! although he is a good actor i cant help it to be mad at this fact.. i finished it in 2 days. it is that good."
Valeria,Could I bother a Spanish speaker for the title/translation of the song Pablo sings at the bar when first meeting La Cucaracha. Thanks in advance.
Valeria,"I'm hooked, already on the third ep"
Valeria,"just finished watching the first episode, so far i really like how its going. The only thing that sort of messes me up is wagners spanish, although i commend him for speaking it well, he struggles a bit with long sentences and certain words. Netflix is on a fucking roll though with these great shows"
Valeria,"It is an incredibly refreshing show. Well shot and acted, after awhile you don't even notice you've been reading subtitles. I'm really looking forward to this Netflix series. 9/10!"
Valeria,Is there any way to turn off the Spanish subtitles? 
Valeria,Watched the first episode and really enjoyed it. The part of Pablo Escobar is portrayed much better than when Vincent Chase portrayed him.
Valeria,"are there plans for more seasons of Narcos? I hope so because it covered 90% of pablos story then was seemingly cut short. Should of had another two episodes to finish up Pablo, unless there are plans for another season then disregard."
Valeria,"Just finished the show! Man was it worth the watch!

Acting is great, the story is great, and the music is great too. Reminds me of ecstasy of gold from the good the bad and the ugly. 

Definitely recommend it!"
Valeria,"7 episodes in, read some background history in between episodes.

Man... Escobar makes El Chapo a model of sanity."
Valeria,As a Hispanic I really appreciate that they have them talk good fluent Spanish instead of English with accents. 
Valeria,"Man I do not like voice over narration that much. However so far it seems pretty interesting.

EDIT: usually I don't like Voice over, but it really works here at least in the pilot."
Valeria,"I really enjoyed it and ended up watching the entire season in a single day.

By episode 8 or 9 you can really tell they're just setting up the Cali cartel for season 2. This kind of makes the last episode a bit anti-climatic, but that means we get more Wagner Moura so it is hard to knock the show for not killing off Escobar in the season finale."
Valeria,"This is a fantastic show.  Having heard and seen the real Murphy and Pena in [The True Story of Killing Pablo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sGD5PFRmI), I'm required to stretch my poetic imagination a bit, but the whole Escobar story is so epic I could watch this series all day long.  Great tie-in with Clancy's ""Clear and Present Danger"" as well.  I love this stuff."
Valeria,"Just started to watch this . Boyd Holbrook as Steve Murphy is also a narrator, doing absolutely terrible job, with the fake drool. What a crappy crappy job. 

EDIT. Actually I got over his narration, the series is great: 

- Pablo Escobar is not glamorized
- Latin American law enforcement is not shown like complete idiots like they are shown in vast majority of American media. They were shown here as ruthless and quite effective partners. 
- The most famous actors are Guzman and Pascal (his fame was only GoT), which i liked as well. 
- Liked the pace, epic narration
- Alas, because of the heavy use of subtitles, I have to devote quite some foreground time to this

I like how now you can find major characters in the series on LinkedIn :-)

Happens to this new Simon's series. 

EDIT. ""This cat is DEA"". Love the attitude. "
Valeria,Wagner Moura is a terrific actor but as a spanish speaker it is very distracting the portuguese accent he has. Dont understand why they didnt choose a spanish speaker.
Valeria,[deleted]
Valeria,Just starting the first episode. Are there no subtitles for the Spanish parts or is it just not working for me? 
Valeria,Hearing Rodrigo Amarante sing the intro song really made me smile...This is gonna be good. 
Valeria,Just watched the first episode and it was better than I expected it would be. It really got a Goodfellas vibe going in the first episode.
Valeria,"Fucking hell, I'm already hooked since the pilot. "
Valeria,"Finished Episode 1, really enjoyed it! The directing, acting, and story we're solid. I thought the writing was a little hit-or-miss at times, with the narration relying on some old cliches. But so far, they've done a good job of balancing the tone of the series."
Valeria,so far its fucking excellent
Valeria,Just finished the season. I thought it was really well crafted and it really is great to see Wagner Moura getting international attention (he was great in the Elite Squad movies). Looking forward to next season.
Valeria,Just finished the first season and wow ! All I can say 
Valeria,This show sucked me in right away. I love how the tale doesn't grow stale at all and keeps moving forward.  
Valeria,What a well put together show and incredible experience. The only comparison I can think of in terms of getting sucked in right away is House of Cards Season 1.
Valeria,"Upto the third episode and I'm meant to be studying.

Definitely my new favourite show!"
Valeria,"I just finished it. I really enjoyed it. I didn't like the murphy stuff as much, but everything else was great."
Valeria,Holy shit this is an amazing series! Can't wait for the inevitable season 2!
Valeria,"Such an amazing show! Near the end when Steve pulls his gun out on that taxi dude...Really shows his metamorphosis through the season. ""This IS home""."
Valeria,This show SO GOOD that I'm willing to actually wait to watch each episode with my husband. 
Valeria,"6 episodes in, and it hasn't flagged in the least.  Quality show! "
Valeria,"Great series and great cast.
Even Pablo Escobar himself could not have portrayed him this well in a TV Show! The actor has such a cold look every time before he gets violent.

- The Palace of Justice Siege in Episode 4 was a Major event. This had so much potential for action. I wouldve like to seen a whole episode devoted to this.

- Also, Escobar spent far more time with his family than portrayed in the movie, yet I can understand the producers not focusing as much on this due to lack of info."
Valeria,"I think Grantland described the show the best saying it feels like a cross between a  jazzed up  Ken Burns Documentary and a Scorsese film, the show comes off like a Wikipedia entry"
Valeria,"The cat is DEA. Mark my words, it will get justice- Pena"
Valeria,"Incredible show! Finished watching it today and was pleasantly surprised for it's top-notch acting, cinematography, music, etc. Hope Netflix does more like kind of shows in the future. "
Valeria,"What a strong pilot! Don't know how many times I said ""damnnnnn!""

I like the into, it reminds me of True Blood's intro."
Valeria,Too many Mexicans not playing Mexicans. As an American I have problem with Mexicans playing Colombians.
Valeria,got a question why is a brazilian playing a colombian even though they don't speak the same language. its like having american actor playing an arab while speaking arabic for all his dialogues. 
Valeria,"Saw the first episode, I'm getting some major marco polo vibes."
The Eddy,"Kinda weird to say it's from Chazelle when he only directed the first 2 episodes and isn't the showrunner/creator.

Guess it's like saying House of Cards from Fincher or Succession from McKay."
The Eddy,Holy shit had no idea joanna kulig was in this. im sold. if you haven't seen [cold war](https://youtu.be/8ImvkXgGVWw) go do so now
The Eddy,This looks really beautiful. I'm guessing it was shot on 16mm?
The Eddy,"I got really excited for moment, but I guess the live action Ed, Edd, & Eddy movie isn't happening"
The Eddy,"I'll probably check this out, but I can't see Andre Holland (the apparent lead role in this) without thinking of The Knick.  

Algie!"
The Eddy,Im interested in anything directed by Chazelle but he is not involved in it completely and studio are probably overselling his name. Anyway the trailer looks interesting and Im definetely going to watch it.
The Eddy,"Netflix has a lot of musical shows and films, they're really trying to make it work. None of them have really been successful though."
The Eddy,That was a really cool trailer. Man...I should watch more Netflix shows.
The Eddy,I can't guarantee that I'll watch it but honestly looks really interesting.
The Eddy,"Loved Whiplash, thought LLLand was fun, but this doesn't look interesting."
The Eddy,Christ this looks shit
The Eddy,"It is how Netflix is marketing it.
Anyway directing the first two episodes is still a big deal, sets the tone and the look of the whole show. Especially since we're talking about a limited 8 episodes series."
The Eddy,Or Lost by JJ Abrams.
The Eddy,"The bully/rackeeter is played by Alexis Manenti, co-writer and also actor in Les Misérables, French nominated movie at the Academy Awards this year. He seems good to play assholes."
The Eddy,If only :(
The Eddy,"They always take the big names and attach them even if their involvement is skin deep. See how the twilight zone reboot branded itself as something Jordan Peele created and directed, when he was really just a producer and the host."
The Eddy,France is trying to make Netflix invest 25% of its profit in France into French productions. I wonder if Netflix is just checking the block with this series.
The Eddy,"Man, I'm still sad about The Get Down"
The Eddy,"I believe Damien came up with the idea for the show, which is probably why he's being billed so highly, even though Jack Thorne is the showrunner/creator"
The Eddy,"In fairness, he’s actually directing a couple episodes, including the pilot. Tends to be if they have a hand in the pilot, that’s the style the rest of the show will try to maintain. For example, Scorsese directed the boardwalk empire pilot and they worked off the style of that, along with weekly meetings with him and the creator for input on the show."
The Eddy,"If it gets me Hook Up Plan season 3 I'll take it.

They're having a big Broadway adaptation this year (Prom, fresh off winning some Tony's) but The Get Down, Been So Long, Soundtrack, etc. never really got traction. Even Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, super low rated on TV, was apparently more popular than any musical project they tried."
The Eddy,Yeah. Should have been at least another season.
The Eddy,I feel less interested in this now...
The Eddy,"> Jack Thorne

oh. the dude who turned his dark materials into a massive bore. love it."
The Eddy,"Don't write him off, Thorne has some very good stuff under his belt. The Fades, This is England, National Treasure (not the Nic Cage film) to name but a few."
The Eddy,You forgot his best work: Harry Potter and The Cursed Child.
The Eddy,"Not seen it, but there's a film out this year..."
The Eddy,"Wow I love this show. It’s really sad and kind of shocking, but very real writing with great actors. It starts to pick up in the second episode. The pacing and feel of the series as a whole kind of reminds me of the Wire."
The Eddy,"I'm 35 minutes in and it seems like a great show, but I don't know if I'll be able to continue because the camera work is so shaky and sporadic. It's almost like it was shot on a phone zoomed in all the way the whole time. I know it's for effect, but it doesn't cut it for me. Is the whole thing shot in the same style?"
The Eddy,Popped up in my recommendations. It's a slow burner... obviously not for everyone. Like a mix between Whiplash and Treme. I find it kinda refreshing.
The Eddy,"In episode 4, there is this spanish song that jude starts singing when he meets habiba and omar, whats that song ?"
The Eddy,Shame Chazelle is not writing it. No idea if I’ll watch it or not. Trailer and reviews are not super good.
The Eddy,This series seems to have zero buzz...
The Eddy,The first episode was meh. The daughter is annoying asf
The Eddy,polish lead is hottttt
The Eddy,"Check this out guys, an interview with the show's creator: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOYZt4Cy0b8&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR0MX7EBeGXp1peQ0u0UyWo8cN-vBP222A9FyaKxrIRQpgYeTsyGjo89GqU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOYZt4Cy0b8&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR0MX7EBeGXp1peQ0u0UyWo8cN-vBP222A9FyaKxrIRQpgYeTsyGjo89GqU)"
The Eddy,"Save yourself the time and watch Ed, Edd n Eddy instead, far more interesting"
The Eddy,Jesus that trailer was shakeycam horseshit from start to finish.
The Eddy,I don’t know who at Netflix thought we wanted or needed this snoozefest.
The Eddy,"No, Chazelle does the first two, and that’s kind of kind of his style, it tones down on that front when other directors take over and take a more conventional go at it."
The Eddy,"Jack Thorne is a great writer. This is England 86,88,90. Written for Skins and Shameless. He wrote the stage play for Harry Potter and Cursed Child (and winter multiple awards for it). He wrote Wonder, a great little movie. Glue was a great TV show he created and wrote.

Anyway, he’s more than up for the task. Chazelle would have been great too - maybe even better. 

I still kinda hate that Chazelle won best director for that slop La La Land, over Barry Jenkins and Moonlight, which won best picture. 

And Whiplash was kinda absurd. Very entertaining but was just a bit silly.

As for the Eddy.... it’s one of the weirdest shows I’ve watched.... I’m not a fan of jazz, so I had no clue as to whether what they were playing was supposed to be good or not. And if it was supposed to be good, was it? It kinda threw me off. So I didn’t really connect with that part....

But the episodes that focused on the specific characters, Jude, Katarina, and Sim were really great. I think this is the type of stuff Jack Thorne does best: digging into a character we thought we knew but really, like most of us, no one is truly aware of what we’re each going through, in the past, struggling with in the present, hopes for the future. Thorne is brilliant at capturing that.

Those were the best parts of the Eddy. At other times it’s just not believable and very weird...."
The Eddy,I felt the same. I'm glad I watched the episode after because I became more invested.
The Eddy,she gets way worse in the second episode
The Eddy,"I like that she’s top-heavy and thick like I am. It’s nice to see a romantic lead that isn’t conventionally thin. 

Tl;dr: dem titties tho"
The Eddy,"Did you think so?

The daughter who is supposed to be 16 on the show but actually 21 in real life is hooottttttttt!"
The Eddy,"Well perhaps this show isn't made for hardcore FIFA players and MCU/Star Wars fanboys. There's no problem with enjoying that I enjoy it too, but I like many other people actually enjoy and wanted a show from an oscar-winning director.

 So why don't you just go on with your life and stop acting like you represent the entire population of earth.  Just because you don't like, want or need something does not mean everybody else also shouldn't."
The Eddy,I'll keep watching then. Thanks!
The Eddy,"Well, i saw This Is England the movie, and that was great. Still would of preferred Damien."
The Eddy,I concur. She is incredibly well endowed. Hope to see her in more English language roles. My ex's friend is a big fan of hee Cold War appearance.
The Eddy,"Maybe it's because of my fascination with Polish girls

You're def right, she is gorgeous too."
The Eddy,Hahaha! Perfect.
The Eddy,">The Eddy is a musical drama set in contemporary multicultural Paris revolving around a club, its owner, the house band, and the chaotic city that surrounds them. The eight-episode series will be shot in France and feature dialogue in French, English and Arabic for premiere exclusively to Netflix members worldwide.  
  
>Holland will play Elliot Udo, who was a celebrated jazz pianist in New York, but now is in Paris, part-owner of a failing jazz club, hiding from everyone. He has an on-again off-again relationship with his lead singer, but is emotionally stunted. When his fifteen-year-old daughter shows up suddenly, he has to face his weakness and learn to grow up."
The Eddy,"aw sweet, Algernon is awesome"
The Eddy,Damien Chazelle? I'm in!
The Eddy,So far I’ve seen Andre Holland on 2 horror anthology seasons that had a cool premise with terrible endings. Any other projects of his y’all recommend?
The Eddy,"Exciting news. Loved him in Moonlight, The Knick, and High Flying Bird!"
The Eddy,"Isn't Damien also doing an Apple TV show?

&#x200B;

I kinda hope he goes back to film, but if these TV studios are throwing money at him, I can understand doing a few series."
The Eddy,"After seeing him in the Knick, I watch anything he does."
The Eddy,I’m guessing Chazelle has a jazz background?
The Eddy,Yeah I don’t need to anything besides the headline to know I’m in!
The Eddy,I think Holland has been putting out great performances. This seems like a role that could make him a big name.
The Eddy,"Well, they already cast Tahar Rahim (*A Prophet*, *The Looming Tower*). Now we need a white guy as a third co-star. Like JK Simmons (I think he is kinda free without *Counterpart*) or Ryan Gosling who were in two Chazelle's movies."
The Eddy,I'm in. 
The Eddy,Love it.
The Eddy,"Multilingual, nice. "
The Eddy,Wow someone else has seen The Knick!
The Eddy,"Same, I'll watch anything he makes right now."
The Eddy,"The Knick. He's great in it, and the first season is thrilling. It's a visual feast. Soderbergh served as director, cinematographer and editor on it. [Here's essentially the opening scene of the series](https://youtu.be/Oa3aQJk-Y9k).

The second season loses momentum, imo. It's decent, but you could only watch S1 and be perfectly happy. "
The Eddy,"Not TV show, but Moonlight has got to be a testament of his acting. He only shows up in the third act and nails all the tension building the screenplay requires. 

Already mentioned, but he's amazing in The Knick as well."
The Eddy,High Flying Bird was pretty good if you're up for a sports movie with no sports in it.
The Eddy,"Moonlight, though very briefly. "
The Eddy,Jesus the last episode of Castle Rock was abysmal. Completely destroyed what was otherwise a decent show.
The Eddy,"First place I ever saw him was The Knick and I knew he’d become the next big thing after it. 

Literally no one saw The Knick besides like me and 5 other people but it’s one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. It’s absolutely beyond realistic looking and grisly since it’s a medical drama (initially) about the guys who perfected the C-section, with a lot of trial and error. 

I typically don’t like medical/surgery shows but The Knick was just magical beyond belief. "
The Eddy,Great in the knick
The Eddy,He tried his hand as a jazz drummer.
The Eddy,"I wonder if Tahar Rahim is still even involved, because neither Deadline, Variety nor Hollywood Reporter mentioned him during Andre Holland's announcement, because Rahim was mentioned to be ""in talks"", so I hope Holland didn't take over his part, because I bet we'd all love a diverse ensemble.

(For your point on the white guy, I want Vincent Cassel to be in this so bad.)"
The Eddy,There's dozens of us! Dozens!!
The Eddy,"The Knick is one the most underrated shows I’ve seen! It really should be up there with the greats, but I think only having two season hurt it greatly. 

Everyone I’ve shown it too is hooked immediately, but it’s such a sad tale it hard to rewatch! "
The Eddy,It's one of the best shows I've seen. Do you know of any other shows like it?
The Eddy,I hate watching sports so this could be the sports movie for me
The Eddy,"Actually *I, Tonya* was pretty sick"
The Eddy,"Agree 100%. I knew the ending would make or break that series for me, and good God did it break it. It's Dexter-finale levels of bad for me. Nothing about the ending makes any sense in that nothing in the series pointed to the decision being made in the end. So many useless sub plots. "
The Eddy,"Could you possibly sum it up for me? I believe I only had the last or last two episodes left, but have no interest in watching them based on the response. "
The Eddy,"The Knick is one the most underrated shows I’ve seen! It really should be up there with the greats, but I think only having two season hurt it greatly. 

Everyone I’ve shown it too is hooked immediately, but it’s such a sad tale it hard to rewatch! "
The Eddy,"I think it's a good thing it had a proper conclusion.

I prefer short runs to shows that drag on for too long.

It was only two seasons long but they were packed with content."
The Eddy,"I've never seen anything like it. But if you like the cinematography in The Knick, you should check out Hannibal. Visually they're the two most beautifully shot shows imo."
The Eddy,"From wiki: (note, I just read this and got angry all over again)

>The Kid reveals to Molly that he is Henry Deaver, the biological son of Ruth and Pastor Matthew from an alternate reality. In a flashback in the Kid's universe, Ruth followed through on leaving her troubled husband in 1991, taking her child and fleeing to Boston. After they left, the Pastor was not murdered by 12-year-old Molly, but did find 12-year-old black Henry who went missing in 1991 in his reality. In 2018, this Pastor Deaver commits suicide, and grown white Henry finds the adopted Henry in a cage in the basement. White adult Henry and his Molly talk to adopted Henry, who insists the voices are calling him to the woods. When Molly touches his hand, she sees the first 12 years of the Molly and Henry of his reality. Molly and white Henry take adopted Henry to the woods near Castle Lake, where they see people from centuries of multiple realities. Molly is accidentally killed, adopted Henry returns to his reality, and white Henry follows him, becoming the Kid.

>Molly explains to Henry what she has learned from The Kid regarding their intersecting lives and realities. Henry and The Kid are arrested as suspects in the flurry of deaths. In jail, The Kid tells Henry that bad follows him because he is an anomaly to this reality, and that they must go together to Castle Lake before the sounds, signifying the realities are touching, disappear. More strange deaths occur, leading to some Shawshank inmates slaughtering civilians and officers at the Castle Rock jail. Henry and The Kid escape in the confusion, with The Kid forcing Henry, at gunpoint, to Castle Lake. Henry starts to remember his experience with his father in 1991, including the fact that he pushed Preacher Deaver off a cliff for planning to kill his mother, Ruth. Henry overpowers The Kid. One year later, Henry is living in Castle Rock as a property lawyer, Molly is a successful real estate agent in the Florida Keys and The Kid is imprisoned in the now-abandoned Shawshank. In a mid-credits scene, Jackie talks to Dean Merrill about the book she is writing and her plans to travel west to research her family history."
The Eddy,This leaves out the part where the kid briefly has a demon/ zombie face for 2 frames
The Eddy,"Looks gorgeously shot, as long as it’s at least half as good as La La Land I’ll probably enjoy it."
The Eddy,"Damien Chazelle, say no more...I'm in."
The Eddy,"Not gonna lie, thought this was the Netflix revival of Ed, Edd and Eddy."
The Eddy,Finally!
The Eddy,"I'm here for Joanna Kulig's voice. You go, girl!"
The Eddy,Chazelle won me over with La La Land. I always have interest now whenever I hear he’s got a new project on the go.
The Eddy,I honestly believe that cartoon series is literally impossible to be made live action lol
The Eddy,"Finished the whole thing in a couple days. Absolutely loved it but the first episode was hard to watch for me too, I found it a little bit boring tbh. That being said, from the second episode it's a ride."
The Eddy,Im like the only person who loved it. It's a slow burn. I think everyone just gives up too soon.
The Eddy,I really loved it. I could live in that world forever.
The Eddy,I am in the same exact boat as you! I only watched the first episode and just couldn’t get into it.
The Eddy,I'd much prefer it if it dropped the organised crime angle and just focused on the band members and the music.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"She's so fucking good in Fringe. Liv can seem quite wooden at first, especially when she's opposite a man who regularly has emotional outbursts over sweets... until you start picking up on the fact she's just guarded in her expressions, and there's a million tiny ways she shows huge emotions"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Also, John Noble in Fringe should have gotten emmy noms or awards, he is seriously fantastic.  Awards ignoring a great performance just because its a sci-fi show"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"also 'the newsreader' for something more recent. basically follows her as a nightly news anchor in 1986 that covers a really interesting few months where we have halley's comet, the challenger disaster, important update on ""the dingo stole my baby"" case, bombing of a police station in australia, and chernobyl."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,or Mindhunter. She's great in it and the show itself is so enjoyable and well crafted.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Brilliant series, one of John Noble's best roles. fun fact, there is an observer in every episode of Fringe, sometimes milling about in the background or,.. well.. observing."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I’m rewatching s1 right now! Been meaning to do a full rewatch of the series, so what better time to start"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,My cat is named Olivia Dunham
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,[removed]
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was SOOOOOO good.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Loved her in Mindhunters
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I'd say her best performance is from The Newsreader. The rent was due.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Also, Mindhunter on Netflix."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I like the fringe so much I bought the whole DVD set
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Funny enough, I started S1 today"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Literally watching it right now. S1E6
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,She was amazing in Fringe.  Need more of her.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe is great. The last season is blatantly tacked on and imho, not very good."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Loved that series, but it got a little TOO weird towards the end."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I could never get through like season 4. Does it get better? Season 1 was one of the best seasons of television ever made, I just felt like they never knew where they were going after that."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I still can't believe that people tuned out. Such a great show but the decline in ratings influenced story changes, a move to Fridays which was considered a death sentence to any tv show, time jumps that later became a plot point. To be fair, that was a pretty genius move by the writers. The fact everyone wrote the show off at s3 but it held on for 2 more seasons is further proof of what a great show it was. It was originally intended to last longer than it did. For the time it did some pretty out of place things. For those who have yet to see it, it has multiple dimensions, multiple timelines, alternate realities, a giant conspiracy that spans the whole of 5 seasons, and multiple endings."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Whaaaat? I was a die-hard X-Files fan and you’re setting the expectations pretty high. I’ll give you that it ended poorly — both times, during the regular series and the reboot. 

But season 1-6 of The X-Files was insanely good. And Gillian Anderson was phenomenal from start to finish."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Xfiles did it first and did it better. X-files did go on too long and ended poorly, that's for sure."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was amazing. Walter!
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Great in Mindhunter aswell
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I absolutely loved Fringe -- even bought the boxset during Amazon's prime day sales. Anna Torv was amazing. I loved her and Kirk Acevedo being partners. And when she had to play her alternate self. I miss the show immensely.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is fantastic.100% recommended.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is my all time favorite show. It was nice seeing Torv in LoU.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"X files on acid in the 70s
Who cares about the science, we've got new vfx to play with!"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"The whole cast in fringe is amazing, John Noble steals every scene he is in. It's also a LOT better than X-Files"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Please refresh, y memory. Didn't fringe have kind of a disappointing last few episodes?"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is flawless. The only reason I’m considering watching the Last of Us is Anna Torv.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,The first half of season 4 is some of the best TV I've seen.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,She’s better in Mindhunter
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"i had never seen her before, and she was instantly the most believable actor on Last of Us"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is amazing after the first season which was a bad x files clone. Credit to the writers for realizing it and trying something new and much better.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fuck. I thought it was Carrie Coon!!
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Loved Fringe, but it is nowhere near as good as X-Files."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I liked fringe, but the science was too awful to rate the show."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"*SLIGHTLY* higher?

SLIGHTLY?!

You take that word back!  Take it back now!

I jest with that, but seriously X-Files has nothing to compare to John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Not by a long shot."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I was thrilled to see she was in this new show, but very disappointed  with how that all turned out"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"One of the best shows ever, imo."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe was really good.

I rewatched it all a few years ago and it still holds up."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Oh Fringe! I almost forgot about that show. Not sure how - I absolutely loved it. No one talks about it.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Dang now I have to watch it if it’s better than the x files
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Second!
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I wish it was on Crave in Canada where we get most HBO shows.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I remember back in the day how many people was like ""flashforward if the new X-Files"" or ""the event is the new X-Files"" and both got cancelled after one season, in the meantime fringe was doing their own ""I'm the new X-Files"" in the corner.

I loved that show, I didn't like season two monster of the week episodes that much, but season three was awesome."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was great
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I thought Fringe was great in the early seasons but gradually became worse as it progressed and the world got larger.   

Torv is a great actor though and did amazing playing two different characters in the show."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Really? Interesting. I thought Fringe was x-files but with modern garbage TV tropes and boring characters but to each their own I guess. You watched Warehouse 13 OP? I think you might like it, it's like Fringe but a different vehicle to tell the stories"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I was so excited for Fringe until I saw the male actor, yes the one also from Dawson's creek (never watched) I don't know if I'm the only person that this happens to but I feel a totally unjustified hatred towards the guy, can't stand his face, ruined Fringe for me"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe definitely stuck the landing compared to a lot of shows.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe is the GOAT, though they kinda cheated us on the ending"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I watched the first couple of episodes and thought it was atrocious compared the The X-Files
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I saw the first  season and for me it lacks something. Its not dark or mystical enough and a bit too much cabel tv-tv. Does the tone change? What I love about xfiles season 1-5 is that you can really feel the surroundings. The rain, the forest, the fog. Fringe is more like xfiles 5-9. Very much studio feeling."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I keep seeing Fringe recommended, and I love X-Files, but I did not enjoy Fringe.  It seemed too predictable and formulaic.  However, I did not watch further than a few episodes into season 2 before dropping it.  I don't know if my opinion would improve later in the series."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files, This discussion really making me want to Fringe 😩😩
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"The X-Files will always be iconic, and many of its episodes are some of the greatest in the history of television. Its experiments with the idea of a serialized mythology offered pretty mixed results at times, but the few shows were ever in their element as The X-Files doing some of those classic monster of the week episodes. Shows that followed, especially during that 2004-2010 period, like Lost and Battlestar Galactica, owed much to the X-Files. 

And none more so than Fringe, obviously. 

I think Fringe is a perfect example of taking a familiar concept or premise, and not being too preoccupied with “filing the serial numbers off,” so to speak. It’s totally just The X-Files, BUT the difference is that Fringe has a clear idea about the kind of mythology it wants to explore from the outset; the writers found a genuinely clever way to use the monster of the week format to build towards a larger goal, and Fringe’s mythology is truly one of the best in tv. 

But probably the *biggest* reason Fringe stands above X-Files, is *John motherfucking Noble*. Genuinely, Walter Bishop is the secret sauce of Fringe and one of the most charming and beautifully realized characters in all television. It’s actually pretty remarkable how many great characters came right out the gate after 2004; we talk about the “golden age of television” now (and have for years at this point) but a lot of these network television series walked so these prestige tv programs could run. They had messier endings, but still left a huge mark."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is not good.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe is just the Bluebloods version of X-Files, and it's also trash. Seriously weak acting performances from both Torv and Jackson. Skip Intro's episode on spooky cop shows is the best deep dive into why X-Files is the superior content, when comparing the two shows."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Don't fall for it. She was terrible in ""Fringe"".

The series itself is a terrible pseudoscience/police procedural with its only redeeming quality being a parallel universe long arc that was explored much, much better in ""Counterpart""."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was better than the majority of X-Files which fell off pretty hard after the first couple seasons.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Hard agree on the better than X files .
I think some individual episodes of x files are some of the best sci Fi tv ever ,but as an over all series Fringe has the better story , character development,and consistency"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe was so much better than XFiles, all the interpersonal relationships flowed so much more naturally than the ""made for fandom"" sexual tension between Mulder and Scully.

Plus Fringe kept on track with it's original premise, unlike Xfiles that started off as a really cool show about unsolved cases of strange phenomena  only to get stuck on ""They're Out There"" alien-hybrid conspiracies.

I think Fringe didnt get the attention it deserved because viewers were burned out and bored of XFiles and assumed Fringe was going to be just another copy-cat show."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Only thing better than Fringe was Eureka!
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is leagues above TXF. It had a consistent overall mythology and story arc that ended on it's own terms in an amazing way.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Spoiler….. she dies in episode two 🤦‍♂️
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,She's also great in an Australian TV series called The Newsreader
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"ya, Fringe was really effing good. if you like sci fi schlock and havent seen it, get on it. its one of the greats."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Literally what I started on Monday lol
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Welp, it's been a few years.  Time for another Fringe rewatch."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Mmmmm Anna Torv as a redhead.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,HBOMAX Europe as well! Just started another rewatch.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I completely didn’t realize it was her until someone pointed it out to me
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Didn’t even realise that was the actress from Fringe
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,This statement compares to: true
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I've only watched the first episode but I really enjoyed her performance and I can't wait to see where the rest of the season takes her character
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I watched an episode of Fringe before watching TLOU and it took me a bit to realize why Tess looked so familiar. Funny how that happens sometimes.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe had it's moments but some of the seasons were weak, if you power through it - the last season was great imo."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,She also had a great part in Mindhunter (great show).
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I've watched first season but didn't enjoy it much does it get better?
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I got halfway through the first season. I want to get into it and finish it , but I had trouble getting through the monster of the week episodes."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Haven't watched the last of us show yet (loved the game), but I actually recently started watching Fringe funnily enough. I'm about halfway through the first season, and I'm enjoying it. Glad to see Anna torv getting more exposure."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I just finished watching her in the Australian show ""Secret City"" and I loved her performance in it. I found it on Netflix and there are two seasons."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was fucking amazing and she was definitely great in it. I'm glad to see that she's getting some recognition.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I couldn't figure out who she was I. This show, I thought she was Donna from the 70s show.

The crazy thing is I loved fringe up until the last season when they had to wrap it up. At least there was closer to the show and it didn't just end."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Well this is awkward...
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe was amazing
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"It makes me feel old that Fringe is a TIL subject since that’s where I know her from the most since she’s the protagonist, She’s also on that Netflix show where they interview serial killers."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Thank you.  I was trying to figure out where I remembered her from.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"That ending still gives me goosebumps.

>!🌷!<"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I stopped watching Fringe on the last episode of the last season. I think Joshua Jackson as Peter was the past holding bastion of good things about a show that had so badly Flanderised itself that I just didn't care about the outcome. Felt like the show found all of the fan favourite traits and wrote the show to be only those traits.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"As a fan since the original airings, I love how this show is having a small resurgence of popularity due to Anna Torv in The Last of Us."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Fringe was great, and if you're like me  and care about this sort of thing, it has an ending, no cancelled forever cliffhanger 😁"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"always wanted to check it out, it's available on NowTV, I just have to find the time"
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"I loved fringe and we just rewatched it. But I can’t watch Last Of Us.  Maybe I’m missing something ,but this whole zombie apocalypse thing is just not what I need right now to take my mind off the hell that is our actual reality."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,Fringe is amazing!  Anna Torv is also in Mindhunter.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,"Holy shit, I knew she reminded me of someone. I just had the same thing happen watching The Sopranos and Bokeem Woodbine was on an episode. Looked him up to confirm I saw him in the Halo TV series not long ago."
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,She’s pretty good in ‘The Newsreader’ TV Series. The show overall is a Meh.
Hangar 1: The UFO Files,I really don't know what happened in Season 5 where they writing literally went haywired. It really reminds me of crappy writing of Westworld season 4.
Hoarders,“I just transfer it to a smaller bucket and then dump it in the front yard.”
Hoarders,"I tried, OP. Calling it quits before the ten minute mark. That lady is profoundly insane and I hope she is/was able to recover."
Hoarders,"So apparently what I assume is the episode is [on Youtube on A&E's verified Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTK9SThUo90).

Enjoy?"
Hoarders,Holy shit I’ve seen that one
Hoarders,"that the one with the cat they find.. under the couch..

all dried out.."
Hoarders,The first 4 min made me gag. What in the actual fuck.
Hoarders,So I’m not feeling well and saw this and decided I would watch it. I’m honestly barely maintaining eye contact with the tv and I feel sick and I’m not even to the first break. I don’t know if I can do the whole thing. The feces jugs and toilet/bucket really was enough. I just started the next lady.
Hoarders,"I watched a 3-minute clip. I ... 

If you choose, please let me know the resolution. Any change in her outlook?"
Hoarders,What is Hoarders?
Hoarders,Is this the piled up adult diapers and dead cats?
Hoarders,does this have any happy ending? like cleaned up house and therapied lady in the end?
Hoarders,thats the part where i gagged and needed to close my eyes immediately. horific.
Hoarders,"Too bad, US only :("
Hoarders,"Nope, watched 30 seconds and backing the fuck out of that one."
Hoarders,I'm going to need therapy
Hoarders,I’m out.
Hoarders,"I found a mouse dried out under my board games that was incredibly rank once uncovered, a cat under the couch not noticeable means the nominal stink in that house is off the charts."
Hoarders,10 times worse than that's not an exaggeration
Hoarders,It gets so much better
Hoarders,"You have to see it through, I'm here for you. I have been where you are."
Hoarders,"You need to see this through and watch it till the end. Please, do this for me"
Hoarders,I don't want to ruin it for you but I swear to God you have never seen anything like it. You have never imagined anything like it. Touch basis with me after you check it out
Hoarders,"Negative. It is something much worse oh, you probably think I'm exaggerating but I shite you not. It makes that episode look like a nice clean room at the Holiday Inn."
Hoarders,The family ends up trying to sell the house and Dr. Zasio determined she was not capable of living alone.
Hoarders,Please tell me this ends with her in an institution. She threw her feces in the front yard.
Hoarders,"> The episode had a happy ending however, as Shanna was given therapy and a new home with regular check ups. The hoarder was helped and is now happy"
Hoarders,[*Touch base](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/touch-base/)
Hoarders,But is it a reality show.
Hoarders,🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hoarders,Her feces is in many other places besides her front yard.
Hoarders,She wanted to eat food contaminated with fecal matter as one last high. Those are her words.
Hoarders,Hoarders is a show about people with mental disabilities that causes them to collect things which can include trash for various reasons. The show is about helping them overcome the issues and clean their environment
Hoarders,"I hate the chokehold Sky has on HBO content in Ireland & the UK.

they actively remove shows like Succession, if you wanted to start before the new season good luck you because they got rid of season 1.

I was doing a rewatch of the sopranos recently & every 2 minutes there was a commercial break. 
I will actively seek out the legal ways to watch shows before I go the other route, & places like sky are guiding me towards downloading everything illegally."
Hoarders,"Discovery+ had obviously been a massive bomb. I’ve been getting it free from Sky for 2 years already. Now Sky *and* BT Sport are giving me the full Discovery+Eurosport package free with my regular subscriptions. 

I’m not complaining about getting something for nothing but it is a pretty clear sign nobody was actually willing to pay a dime for this service."
Hoarders,They've been offering it for well over a year. They also offer Peacock and Paramount+ for free.
Hoarders,They been offering 12 month subscriptions for free for at least a year. Only really worth it for access to Eurosport+ is big into things like tennis for mulit Court coverage
Hoarders,I just got this through Sky. Is there anything of quality on Discovery+?. It all seems like low quality garbage.
Hoarders,I mean Eurosport is pretty good for the tennis.
Hoarders,"Worst thing is sky play everything at a faster frame rate, which makes every American show higher pitched than it should be. They make it sound like absolute trash"
Hoarders,I still have access for Succession S1 on Sky in the UK. I would rather have HBO Max here though.
Hoarders,I think HBO/WB's deal with Sky ends in around 2025. I think their plan is to bring HBO Max to the UK and have it as a separate service.
Hoarders,"Wait, don't they have the new Sky Showtime service where they combine Peacock&Paramount+&Showtime content too?"
Hoarders,You are really missing out on *Naked Hillbilly Hoarders: Chattanooga*
Hoarders,"I love it for documentaries like Trump Unprecedented (some of the footage was used during the Jan 6 insurrection hearings) and the shit exposing Hillsong, Armie Hammer's family, etc.

Shark Week content is great, too, but I've always loved great whites."
Hoarders,It is strange reality trash and nothing else on the Discovery channels. You get the odd bit of sport like the Australian Open tennis and some snooker airing on Eurosport. That is about it.
Hoarders,"What, seriously?"
Hoarders,This is the thing that's gets to me. Helium voices everywhere.
Hoarders,WB seems very interested in just cutting costs and making as much money as possible so I could see them continuing the Sky deal. I hope I’m wrong though.
Hoarders,Not in the UK. I think that’s for some European countries.
Hoarders,"I've never heard of that service.

Showtime's stuff is on Paramount+."
Hoarders,"Yep. I think european shows are shot at a different frame rate, so Sky’s method of adjusting to this is to speed up American shows. It’s horrible."
Hoarders,"It's a new service launched by Comcast in Europe, in some territories where you can't have access to Paramount+/Showtime/Peacock."
Hoarders,"After I watched Our Flag Means Death, I quit my job and found a new one cause I realized I wasn't happy there. Granted, it wasn't a HUGE change-- just moved from one area of law to another area of law-- but Stede Bonnet leaving his old life because he wasn't content made me realise that I wasn't content either."

Hoarders,"Halt and Catch Fire, every time. 

The main character is a quirky-girl elite programmer and serial entrepreneur who *crushes* technical and business challenges left and right while struggling with the everyday realities of life in and out of that corporate hotseat.

(Okay, so that's not *exactly* the story, but Cameron Howe is still my hero. <3)"
Hoarders,"The Good Place, but particularly seasons 3 and 4 (but definitely start from the beginning)"
Hoarders,"Ted Lasso! Very wholesome and uplifting and motivating since the lead is thrown into an impossible situation, and he rolls with it with amazing class."
Hoarders,Mr Robot!  Brilliant show that motivated me in many ways.
Hoarders,Hoarders
Hoarders,WWE Raw
Hoarders,"Probably not what you’re looking for, but Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations and Parts Unknown really inspired me to get out of my comfort zone and see the world"
Hoarders,"Its been a rough year for me medically and I have found myself Doctor Who and Star Trek a lot. Both have themes of finding hope even when things get dark. They are on Crave in Canada. 

Also I loved Dead End Paranormal Park on Netflix is a really sweet cartoon about a haunted theme park."
Hoarders,"I'm not sure if this is quite what you mean but I watched After Life a few months after my mom died while depressed and it was oddly cathartic. Made me remember our time here is limited so we should try to do as much good as possible while we can. 

""If you want to be an angel you've got to do it when you're alive. Be good. Do good things."""
Hoarders,"Jupiters Legacy

the writing is so bad it made me think anybody could be a writer. So I downloaded Final Draft and started writing a script."
Hoarders,I've watched some cooking shows that motivated me to try cooking in a new way or with new ingredients. Thinking mostly of Ina Garten I guess.
Hoarders,Police 10/7. They show pictures of criminals and people wanted for questioning. After I appeared on that my life totally changed.
Hoarders,Abstract. It’s a docu series on Netflix with each episode focusing on a person in art and or design. They go in depth on what steps they took to be successful and really go into the love they have for their work.
Hoarders,"episode 7 of the 1998 series *Fantasy Island*

I felt like it was speaking directly to me"
Hoarders,Mob Psycho 100 on Crunchyroll - specifically the S2E8 episode where he runs a marathon
Hoarders,"America’s Got Talent can be found on NBC, Peacock and YouTube. It’s largely a show about people from disadvantaged backgrounds living their dreams by showing off their incredible abilities."
Hoarders,Band of Brothers
Hoarders,"ultimately, Star Trek up until Voyager is an endless motivational speech with some real lessons to be found. NuTrek is a pile of shit - with a caveat, SNW; good, but so very bland - so the only knowledge you could get from that is how to avoid such drivel"
Hoarders,"Code Geass, if you're a grandiose manic type."
Hoarders,The title song to Parks & Rec is great for the treadmill.
Hoarders,"I agree, it's so effective!"
Hoarders,Is Hoarders the one with the scary music? I always get it and Hoarding: Buried Alive confused. I just like the one with the scary music. 
Hoarders,"I agree!

I watch Hoarders & My 600 [lb. Life](https://lb.Life) to make me feel better about my life lol!"
Hoarders,LOVE this show! I hope they get renewed and Matt Paxton is hilarious. He should have his own show.
Hoarders,Makes me Glad I never had to be on the show when I worked at got junk
Hoarders,Yes. I've watched every single episode that comes on. It's amazing. 
Hoarders,Linda was the queen of this season. Too bad they did such a short season though
Hoarders,Whoa that most recent episode was a kick to the chest. Poor Sandy never got to see her clean house. :(
Hoarders,That shit's *still* fucking on?
Hoarders,"Me too, except that I could be a potential contender for Hoarders someday. One time I gave away several hundred books and you couldn't even tell. There's more in storage lol"
Hoarders,I think it was out of season for a few years but is on a new season now.
Hoarders,I cannot watch that show. It breaks my heart. But it is good to see at the end the positive changes they make!
Hoarders,It was a good episode.  Carol was horrible.  I liked the main ending to the episode especially in relation to the car but the text ending was very sad.
Hoarders,Interesting. I can watch hoarders but I can't watch intervention it's 1000000000X worse and more sad than hoarders.
Hoarders,See now intervention I can? I don’t and I don’t really like to but I could watch that over hoarders I think. I have some family who have addiction issues so maybe I’m a little more in the mind set to watch that show? Not sure.
Hoarders,That he's on an unscripted show means people care about him though. 
Hoarders,"My view on this show has pretty dramatically shifted. The organizers tend to treat these people like assholes even though they mention repeatedly that they're mentally ill. Some of the things they do are just absurd, like that guy spending the night in the one woman's house. I forget the episode but the hoarder yelled something like ""You wanted drama well here it is!"" Yea, these people can be really abrasive but I can't help but wonder how much of it is the producers finding something and intentionally throwing it out or whatever."
Hoarders,"well clearly the writers have you hooked. I guess their job worked. Remember, nothing is real in reality TV except in the name. "
Hoarders,Oh. Why?
Hoarders,You can tell this was getting the most drama out of an episode. Any other reasonable person would've had Sandra arrested the moment she wasn't cooperating. But they gave her chance after chance when she had a decade to do right.
Hoarders,Yeah that's why I dont care for reality too much. Hoarders is entertaining at least. Makes me feel good about myself when I realize I'm not surrounded by jugs full of piss and fecal matter 
Hoarders,Piss jugs are the way of the crazy hoarder and the way of the road.
Hoarders,the piss is usually just colored water and the fecal matter is usually chocolate ice cream
Hoarders,Delicious
Hoarders,"I've known hoarders who order things, even expensive things, which quickly get buried under the pile of everything in their house and are forgotten. Also a lot of hoarders have an online shopping problem. It's completely possible that Patricia really did order this equipment and just bury it in her house without ever opening the box."
Hoarders,"She made it sound like she found them while driving around looking for curb treasures, though"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Holy crap, don’t just throw a pic of Norm Abrams up on my feed like that. I thought he died. Awesome about the the shows on YouTube though… thanks!"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I used to watch this guy every Saturday morning on PBS.  It was fascinating.  He would say ""I was out a garage sale the other day and saw this really nice cabinet.  So im gonna make it."" and about 45min later he had a cabinet that could easily sold for a few grand."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Remember this, there is no more important safety rule than to wear these: safety glasses!"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Good stuff  thanks.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Norm Abrams is an American treasure.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I always loved how the humble workshop held like $1m worth of tools.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I carried a 1st generation Tivo loaded with nothing but New Yankee episodes saved on it for years and years. Loved that show.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Norm!
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Norm rules. I loved this show when I was young. It's funny, I had a collection of porn magazines but was more embarrassed that I had a bunch of interior design and furniture building magazines."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,This will make my dad very happy
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,NORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Seriously. Just two weeks ago, I discovered Townsends on YouTube and it feels like the yankee workshop, but in the kitchen (it’s different, but hits the same for me). That led me to looking up norm, and much to my surprise he’s not dead."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,There's a 24/7 *This Old House* channel on Pluto TV if you need your fix.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I read an interview about him once. Guy watched him work. He really is as good as they show. Most of that was one take. He'd think about it, measure, draw, and then cut."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Honestly a great idea. I wish I had the whole series on DVD.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,It’s been my binge this past few weeks. I have noticed a lot of repeat though.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Yea my wife and I were crushing through it, but it seems to be the same 6-8 houses."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Confirmed. Once it gets to the hurricane Katrina episodes I'm out. There's a ton of community work, which I can appreciate, but there's far less focus on the process and tools, which is the only reason I watch."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"So pumped this is coming back and has gotten good reviews. I'm amazed it even made it to the second season, barely anyone knew about it because it was on Starz. I think the series finale got like 74k viewers..."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,[deleted]
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Premiere on February 24th for those who didn’t read.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,This is such a RDD
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"With Party Down coming back, I don't feel as silly to still hope for a new Happy Endings season someday (not a zoom episode, not a table read, a bonafide season)

I loved this gem! I'm so happy it's back!"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Wait! There was an Oral History of Party Down that existed like 9 years ago and it was AWESOME. And then for whatever reason it got scrubbed from the internet. Is this the same one?? Ahh

edit: i don't think it's the same."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I cannot explain how excited I am for this. Such a brilliant show, but it had too much talent to stay together. Poor ratings plus better individual offers broke it up in my opinion. I am disappointed that Kaplan didn’t return."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Which brings up the question. If it’s on starz again does it go to a streamer too?
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Let’s not forget stormy daniels
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,A Ron Donald Don’t?
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Omg I didn’t realized I needed this so bad. That would be ah-mah-zing.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I just hope someone, _anyone_, shows it in the UK, because the only way to watch the original was to sail the high seas."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Starz is part of Disney+ here in Canada, so I'm assuming it's going to end up there.

Edit: Actually looks like it's going to be on Crave. First two season are up there and they are advertising the new one."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"It'll be on Lionsgate Plus, which you need to get as an add on to Amazon Prime video. Available at the same time as the US."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,">Starz is part of Disney+ here in Canada

is it really Starz with a Z or is it Star+? In Latin America Star+ is the one affiliated with Disney

Starz has now changed the name in LatAm to Lionsgate Plus to avoid confusion"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"It's Star+, I was mistaken. Thanks for clarification! I just remembered watching Pam+Tommy and Welcome to Chippendales on ""Star"" through Disney and got confused."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"haha it's cool, it happens! I also confused it a lot because some of Hulu's original programming was on Starz here in LatAm instead of Star+, like The Girl from Plainville and The Act"

Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,National Treasure isn’t even from the 90s.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"My only problem thusfar is the friend that records everything.
Stop making evidence!"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Press X to doubt
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I love seeing headlines titled like this, they're so obvious with how densely packed they are with nonsense.

""It is possible one of the best films this year!  Packed with the funniest youth humor possible!  I cried butterfly tears!  Some actors name!""

Also, they make me look up something I didn't know existed.  How about that?  The show is getting panned from all sides.  I mean wow, critics and audiences really hate this BOMBASTIC GOODHEARTED MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT! (articles first line lol)"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Actually its just daft.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,This is a steaming pile of dog shit and should be avoided
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"[44% with critics, 32% with audience.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/national_treasure_edge_of_history/s01)

I get that even shills have to pay rent, but *come on*."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Actually it sucks ass
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Who can beat the 28 minutes I wasted watching this
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Couldn’t make it past 7 minutes.  Disney, wake the fuck up/"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"This show is fucking garbage. Saw my father enjoying it since he watches everything, but holy, it's so bad."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Terrible.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Not even trying to conceal the shilling
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,This show is legit dogshit
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Daft Fun.    
Now that is the word I was looking for.    
To describe my current taste in movies."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"As big of a fan of the movie's I am not touching this show, ever."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,There is so much wrong with this headline I don't even know where to begin...
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Well we now know who OP is a shill for....
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Lost me at “youth-focused”
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Worst acting I've ever seen. Didn't make it 5 minutes.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,It’s a pretty okay show. Not great. Not the steaming pile of shit this sub purports it to be. Honestly the worst aspect is how aggressively they are aiming this show at Gen Z when it’s thirty something millennials who would have nostalgia for National Treasure.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,The happiest three star review of my life
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"No Nic Cage, doesn’t count. Fuck this show."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Why does the person who wrote this article look like she's about to cry?
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Lmao, it's not as good as this article is making it out to be, but it's also not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It's just fine. Bit cringe with how they try inject gen z humor in certain parts to cater to a younger audience, and the tone is lacking compared to the movies, but it's watchable."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Haven't started it but... Youth focused? Is it another ""kids save the day"" remake?"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Any one attached to this show should be embarrassed for themselves. It’s fucking horrible, I watched two episodes and it was one of the worst written and acted shows I’ve ever seen."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,How much did they get payed to write this poop? I guess they are getting desperate as no-one is watching it
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I see it a big hit with the fans on Rotten Tomatoes at a rousing 37 percent. I guess it’s better than She-Hulk and Willow
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Turned it off after 20 minutes. The writing was so bad
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,counterpoint: it’s bad
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Hold up, is there really an albino monk assassin in this show? Now they're ripping off the problematic parts of The DaVinci Code too?"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I’ve been hearing the exact opposite
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"“Freemasons, albino monk assassins, Harvey Keitel … this youth-focused spin-off of Jerry Bruckheimer’s adventure movie franchise is loads of daft fun”

I read that in the voice of Stefon."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"So this is an ad, got it."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Sounds like a bad Stefan sketch.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"This is nothing like the fun of the first movies. Zero charisma. Even that funny little sidekick guy made the movies magic. This just more of Disney cheaply cashing in on the ip it owns.   Ahh this point with star wars and marvel basically ruined it's time to start boycotting Disney plus.

If they know we will eat this shit and keep paying our subscription fee. They will keep making shit.  RIP starwars, marvel"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Both the series and this article were written for the Young Adult demographics.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"The problem they have is this. These sort so of movies have very little to no political messages in them. The problem is that screenplay writers now I think are physically incapable of *not* shoehorning in some political message that derails the episode or plot, or is just in your face and patronizing. 

So they’ll ruin it with some form of modern politics."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I read that in Stefan’s voice
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,There was an article on the front page 2 days ago calling it the worst tv show ever made.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Inb4 Reddit cries about how this show ruined their lives and this author is full of shit lol
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,[deleted]
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Where can you watch it in UK?
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,National Treasure sucked. Bring back something in the air of The Goonies and I’m in
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,If you love the first and second movies you’ll be at home in this series. It’s basically the same thing but in a tv form.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"If it's anything like the movies it's just daft, no fun."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,So here for it. This needs to be told from a woman of struggle- and recognized as a part of this white santuario of immigrants that some white folk know as the US
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I watched the first episode. That was enough for me.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,You had me at albino monk assassins.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Uh , hello advertising"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Suuuure. When people actually watch it, the consensus will probably be that it's another crappy Disney+ show."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"It's a fun show... biggest issue for me is that they've tried to split Riley's character over Oren & Tessa.... and it's not worked. 

&#x200B;

If the show was Jess & Brainwave Jr with one other person, it would flow a lot better i think."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"I remember when the Guardian was a good outlet, it was circa 1996 when it started spiralling downward"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Not every reboot beeds to star the entire Burger Kind Kids Club from 1993.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,I guess they didnt learn from what happened with the irregulars.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Fuck off
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"This is SOOOOO not National Treasure like. It feels like an ABC After School Special.
#AnotherDisneyFail"
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,This show was destined to flop simply due to not making a 3rd movie with Nicolas Cage.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"It's like when people call stuff from the early 90s ""so 80s."""
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Neither is the Da Vinci Code which the albino monk assassin is from.
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"Sure, but the title doesn’t say it was either."
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,Is he making HD video evidence of a criminal fucking conspiracy?
Asobi Asobase: Workshop Of Fun,"My problem (and I wholeheartedly love how kitschy national treasure is) is her one friend is the woooorst. The guy who gets kidnapped because hes lured with shoes, ruins their escape room, and tells secrets instantly. Why are they friends with him?!"

RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Good on Rupaul passing his rival Milton Berle as TV's top transvestite
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,The Spanish version is some of the best of the whole show. The judging panel are so good without trying to just imitate the original

RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Presumably with a ridiculousness lead in & followed by ridiculousness.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"I am excited by this, not because I think it's a great thing for Drag Race, or because I think MTV is long for this world as a cable network (or that cable itself is going to be a thing for much longer either)

But because this means The Challenge can now start mining Drag Race cast for contestants and holy SHIT do I need this collision of worlds as badly as possible."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,MTV is owned by Paramount. Sounds like just an internal shuffle.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Logo to VH1 to Paramount to MTV.

Girl. Lay down some roots."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,They all belong to the same parent company. All this does is increase accessibility and shuffle traffic and advertisers.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Considering how many emmys it has won, how the hell are they on like yearly contracts at this point. I swear if Hbo Max didnt have the worst new chairman right now they would buy it up and get tons of new subscribers"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Remember when MTV was about music?

Pepperidge Farms doesn't either."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,How will this impact ridiculousness re runs?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Literally, how do I watch this show without going to the gay bar? Now that I've missed the first episodes, I'm already behind. I shouldn't need cable to access it or pay a ridiculous amount per month."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,*Chanel West Coast Laughing ensues*
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Hey now, sometimes we get a new episode of The Challenge!"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Maybe a drag version of ridiculousness?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Imagine the scenes if some rookie from Drag Race eliminates Fessy in a Hall Brawl or Pole Wrestling match. It would be glorious.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Paramount is for the spinoff not the main show.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Because emmys dont make money and nobody is watching this show
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Not to come at you or anything, but do you even know what Drag Race is? It's like at least 45% music lol it's closer to being related to music than most of their programming for the past 20 years."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,This! It’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to now get live cable streaming for $70 a month just to enjoy the show. The amount of switching and paying for other streaming services is to much. Just put the show on Paramount+!
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Eh huh huh huh huh
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,My reality tv fandom exists squarely in this intersection
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I would love to watch that!!!
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"People are watching it, but no shows get renewed for more than 2 seasons at a time anymore."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,If you can call that music………nvm you mean probably mean the lip sync and not pauls ”music”
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"FYI, I found it on Amazon Prime for purchase! It's only like $15-$20 for the whole season! Untucked is a separate charge, but still better than paying for a cable streaming subscription."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,music is music. it doesn’t have to cater specifically to to you. and miss paul has some bangers
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Taika is on a roll, baby"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Twoooooo Minogues?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,The season is premiering in a week so it’s weird they’re announcing like the judges haven’t already filmed it
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,How exciting!! Season starts may 1st can’t wait to watch
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Taika Waititi doesn't need to do this, the Minogues will take any publicity they can get because they're pathetic but Taika is above this crap."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,[deleted]
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Considering Kylie Minogue - the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time - has just had another number one album, I don't think she needs the publicity. She has a successful 30-year pop career under her belt. Dannii, on the other hand, could do with the exposure."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Absolute nonsense. Anyone who’s anyone has judged on Drag Race. Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Jeff Goldblum, Miley Cyrus. And Kylie is incredibly famous and successful. She doesn’t ‘need’ to do anything, the people that judge on this show absolutely love it."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Literal Oscar winners like Taika have guest judged. Even an EGOT one.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,They're guest hosting a TV show not signing onto a mortgage. You're probably taking this more seriously than any of them.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Hey

Hey

Danni is a treasure and has been since young talent time"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Plus maybe they actually want to be on the show?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,it’s gonna get over saturated
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,So...people doing drag who aren't actually drag queens?  That doesn't sound so great to me.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"It kinda already is. The show went from once every 12ish months to multiple iterations happening twice (or more) a year. And that ridiculous infomercial of a ""christmas special"" they did last year. smh"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Done and done.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,It already is and it’s a shame.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,In the early days of Drag Race there was a short-lived series called *Drag U*. It was basically Drag Race queens putting normal folk in drag and teaching them to be fierce hunty etc. It's exactly that.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Ive never watched that show.  But thanks Reddit for showing me such an amazing part of it.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I didn't even know that she did a performance on that show.

RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Ah, how sad. I only watch the British version on the BBC iplayer so I don't know the people mentioned here. Thanks."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,All of the main seasons are on uk Netflix
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"You have a lot to catch up on, legit one of the best shows on right now."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,My wife loves that show!  I don’t really know anything about it but “This ain’t Ru Paul’s Best Friends Race” is one the funniest lines I’ve ever heard in a reality show and now it’s said in my house at least once a week.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,You streaming it? My wife loves it but cant find it on Hulu or netflix
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Season 5 of this show is probably the best season of any reality tv show I've ever seen. It's incredible television.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Got high with my cousin one day and watched the first episode of whichever season it was that Bianca del Rio won. 'Ru Paul' was a name I was aware of, vaguely, but I'd never watched... But I got hooked that day. Binged three seasons in days.

And about them making art  - I guess you could say the same of other shows, but at least drag is really suited to a visual medium like TV. It's easier to see if someone's comedy chops or frock is good than it is with a cake. And the drag queens are more or less bound to have entertaining personalities. "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,It is easily one of my favorite shows there is. Vanjie is absolutely killing it this season and I am loving every second. 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Love the show! Even if there is fuckery that goes on in the recent seasons, I continue to enjoy it!"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Do you believe in milk and cookies?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,This would be extremely popular if able to stream in the US.  
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,">what separates this show from other reality television shows is that the people are creating art

It's not the only show that does this.  That's why I like to watch Top Chef & Project Runway.  I can't cook for shit & am pretty unfashionable, but I love watching talented creative people get challenged & turn simple ingredients into something amazing."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"If you want another art based reality show, Face Off is pretty great. It's a competition between make-up/prosthetic artists. All the episodes are streaming on Syfy  

https://www.syfy.com/faceoff "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I'm pretty sure there is a dedicated sub to this show that is very active and all fanatics like you are. Sounds like you should prob check it out . Share your joy. 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"If this season got you hooked, season 4 will change your life.  There used to be seasons where all the queens were memorable and didn't all look like they learned drag from the same YouTube tutorial. "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Isnt ru paul a transphobe?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Unfortunately I think only a couple seasons are available on Amazon Prime. I watch the new season by Chrome casting with the VH1 app.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"If you’re outside of the US it should be be on Netflix. If you’re in the US, it’s notoriously hard to find :( iTunes has all the seasons but they are pricey. A lot of the episodes of Untucked are on YouTube though"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,All the seasons and current untucked is on my Netflix. 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,With All Stars Season 2 coming in at a close second... since it was basically Season 5 Part 2
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Hello, Hello, Hello, Christine!"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"I only catch Graham’s shows clips when they’re shared on here, but that talk show has the best, most genuine interactions with their guests."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,MUST FIND A WAY TO WATCH THIS
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Can't put into words how glad I am David Walliams hasn't sidled his way in...
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,Why the fuck is it on BBC3 and not terrestrial television? 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,*emits Father Noel Furlong shriek*
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I’d much rather Noel fielding be a part of this than bake off...he can be their resident santino for the first few seasons.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Please God, no! Save us! "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I’m hoping VH1 airs it in the US.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,You just did 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,I thought they got rid of BBC 3 and made it an iPlayer thing?
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"They did, which is why it's so strange that the BBC would pay for a hit show like this and shove it on the online service."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"It’s weird. But it’s a show for young people, young people like to stream and the BBC want to compete with Netflix in that regard so it does kind of make sense."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Well they haven't really had a ""hit"" show on BBC3 since moving it online to my knowledge. This could be a thing to try and get people to go on it more."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"I dunno, my wife (30+) loves this kind of program. 

I imagine a lot of the reality viewers like her will want to watch. "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,To be fair it's not been an online platform for very long. Still think it was a strange decision.
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,It will probably air late night on BBC 1 too. Most BBC 3 shows do. 
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"What's with The LOGO network nowadays? I thought they were supposed to be the LGBT network, but whenever I pass by it on my guide, it's more like a random rerun network, like a TV Land 2."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Does this mean anything for the quality of the show as far as the budget, prizes etc? "
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"Now, there is officially no reason to watch Logo. I mean, unless I need a fix of Betwitched or Roseanne or Green Acres or whatever other old sitcom they choose to run."
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,"i hate the stupid ass lingo surrounding this show, but im gonna watch the fuck out of this like i always do"
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,[deleted]
RuPauls Secret Celebrity Drag Race,It's hard to establish quality programming for niche network. LOGO also competes with the Bravo network for the Gay demographic.
Perfect World,"Longer - *Freaks and Geeks*, *Firefly*, *Party Down*, *Wonderfalls* had a nice ending to it, but I've read some really interesting things about where they wanted to take that show, and I would have liked just one more season of *Pushing Daises*, *Veronica Mars*, *Deadwood*, and *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles*.

Shorter - *How I Met Your Mother*, *The Office (US)*, *Smallville*, *Dexter*, *Homicide: Life on the Street*.  I love *Lost* (even the finale!), but a lot of the problems with seasons 2 and 3 stemmed from the producers not knowing how long the show would run and just treading water.  So not shorter in the sense of ending sooner in the run, but in the sense of less episodes with no stupid filler to prolong things.

Perfect Lengths - *Chuck*, *The Wire*, *The Office (UK)*, *Life on Mars*, *30 Rock*, *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, seems like *Breaking Bad* is shaping up to be perfect.  I know it's not popular, and I'm excited for the return, but I think *Arrested Development* had a pretty perfect run."
Perfect World,Terminator the Sarah Conner Chronicles. At least one more season coulda rounded off the series nicely.
Perfect World,Rome needed another season.  Instead it got cancelled part way through season two and ended up having a rushed ending.
Perfect World,"Lie To Me - really had potential, needed more.

"
Perfect World,"Longer: Justice League Unlimited

Shorter: Heroes, whenever I rewatch with people, I stop it after season 1."
Perfect World,"Longer:

* Firefly
* Pushing Daisies
* Better Off Ted
* Wonderfalls
* Lone Gunman
* Freaky Links

Shorter:

* Heroes
* Scrubs
* That ’70s Show
* Two 1/2 Men
* Law & Order: SUV
* Any show with the word Reality in the title"
Perfect World,the correct answer to this is lost compacted into 3 to 4 seasons.  get rid of the cruft and tighten up that storyline.
Perfect World,"24 should've ended on Day 7 with Jack dying in that hospital bed, he seemed so at peace"
Perfect World,"I'll go with the tired answer of The Office (US). If they shut it down after the 3rd season, I would have easily considered it my favorite show ever and one of the best ever in terms of first-to-last-episode perfection.

As for the other, I'm not usually a fan of wishing shows went on longer. I don't like when shows go on and on and things change and get fucked up and they lose the magic. So, I will always prefer fewer episodes of perfection as opposed to a show producing 3 times as many episodes as it should have made and running it in shit-circles. But if I had to answer, I would've liked to see one more season of Freaks and Geeks."
Perfect World,"firefly, terminator :sarah connors  chronicle, stargate SGU , Flight of the Conchords ,Rubicon should ahe more seasons.

smallville, scrubs , lost were too long , or a least , their last season was mostly disapointing ."
Perfect World,"I wish every show would have 3-5 seasons with 10-12 episodes each.  Whether the show would continue on for multiple seasons would be predetermined after midseason 1 so that the writing quality wouldn't drop.  Some shows could go on a bit longer, but they rarely improve in quality after 5 seasons.  The quality of the show would be based on the netflix views, dvd sales, ratings, critical acclaim, online discussion, dvr recordings, and other attention instead of just ratings.  

With that being said:

Shorter:  HIMYM, The O.C., Heroes, That 70's Show, American Idol (should have ended after season 1), Dexter, Prison Break

The same:  Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under

Longer:  Pushing Daisies, Firefly, Dark Angel"
Perfect World,"Shorter: 24, HIMYM, Lost, Prison Break, Scrubs, Weeds

Longer: Better Off Ted, Firefly, Flight of the Conchords, Kings, Party Down, Reaper, Running Wilde"
Perfect World,Party Down was way too short.  
Perfect World,"More *Veronica Mars* and *Firefly*.

*Heroes* should have ended after the first season or they should have changed out the characters (as was the original plan).

"
Perfect World,"Heroes - Cut off at the end of season 1
Firefly - Given the full first season, but no more than that
Pushing Daisies - 3-4 seasons to have a solid ending
How I Met Your Mother - 3-4 seasons

Overall, TV shows just really don't need to be longer than 4 seasons."
Perfect World,"I would have killed Weeds when they moved out of Agrestic. I forget which season that was.

"
Perfect World,[deleted]
Perfect World,"Cut off Sooner:
Lost,
Smallville,
Sopranos,
ER,
Law & Order: CI


Go on Longer:
Terriers,
Angel,
Firefly,
John from Cincinatti,
Survivors (UK)"
Perfect World,"Longer - Firefly, Awake, Dollhouse, Endgame, Arrested Development, Sherlock

Shorter - Big Bang Theory should have stopped after three, although I still love HIMYM I think the run should have been shortened to maybe six seasons, The Office after Carrell left, also would have shortened the run of Lost, Heroes, CSI, Bones

Right - Friends, Chuck (even though I *loved* the show, I think it ended right on time), Eureka (though I would have given the last season a full run), Breaking Bad (but I'm sad for it to end), Third Watch, Scrubs (because season 9 didn't exist... it didn't), Jekyll"
Perfect World,I think Weeds should be added to your shorter list.
Perfect World,That last cliffhanger had sooooo much potential!
Perfect World,"Jack Bauer can't die though, that's the only problem.  He is a pure paragon, the epitome of America ('Murica, if you will) and the lengths we will go to in order to retain our power.  The ending from season 8 seemed fitting, with Jack going MIA in the United States, wanted by the US Government for crimes he committed for the US Government."
Perfect World,Not after season 4? I'd say season 4 was just as good as season 3 and the show only took a nosedive in season 5 (from the very first episode actually).
Perfect World,"yup the office through season 3 was quality.  barring a few episodes here and there in the second half of season 3, it *could* have gone down as an all time great."
Perfect World,I'm with you for another season of Freaks And Geeks.
Perfect World,"I get your point but there are a lot of shows that get cancelled before they even get to finish their intended story. I'm guessing you've never been in the situation of following a show from the beginning, that had a lot of potential, but had to be wrapped up in 2 or 3 episodes because it got cancelled after 1 season. feelsbadman.jpg. Try firefly."
Perfect World,"The last season of *Scrubs* was great.  The spin-off in the med school (I refuse to acknowledge it as a *Scrubs* season) was no where near as good, but actually had some good stuff at the end of the season when the old characters weren't shoehorned in as much."
Perfect World,"Agreed on Heroes, but the third season of VM was not very good, and even season 2 paled in comparison to the perfection of the first season."
Perfect World,Yes!! Terrible shows. Although Terra Nova was a bit meh to me. I really enjoyed Alcatraz though.
Perfect World,"Finally... someone else shares my love of Terriers.
"
Perfect World,The first couple seasons were great. Celia was my favorite character.
Perfect World,"I agree, forgot that one.  I almost made it until the end, couldn't finish season 7.

That also reminds me I should have put *The United States of Tara* in the perfect length list.  Three seasons of goodness with a well done ending even though they didn't know for sure it was ending."
Perfect World,"Season 4 still had good stuff and kept mostly true to the characters (ie, Kevin Malone was still kinda the big quiet guy that had also won a World Series of Poker bracelet, not a functioning half-tard). But season 3 had a fair ending for most of the characters. It serves as a good ending to the series if you could ignore the following several seasons so it's always the cutoff point I bring up for the series.

Not to say there were good moments in subsequent seasons, but the end of the third is a good cutoff point because of how it ended with Jim and Pam, Michael returning to the office, and Ryan moving on. We don't get some other things resolved with Dwight for instance, but who cares. It could have been fun that way.


EDIT: Also, whenever Michael Scott drove his car into a pond because the GPS told him to merge right or something."
Perfect World,I never understand why a few mediocre seasons of a show completely negate a majority of really strong content for some people.
Perfect World,"Well, yeah. It was always going to happen. I'd still have watched and enjoyed S4 though."
Perfect World,I agree the first season was by far the best.
Perfect World,[deleted]
Perfect World,"I don't get it.  Jericho.......a show that was above average at best, gets millions of people to champion it coming back.  Sending peanuts to the Studio's offices in protest.  


Terriers, which was nothing short of brilliant got no such thing.

  "
Perfect World,"i have a really hard time explaining it myself.  the best i can do is that there's an expectation set from great work, and when something doesn't live up to it, it's just disappointing.  it feels like in totality it would have been better if the misses never happened at all, even though we all know they don't negate the positives.  just kinda want to see a great piece of work from beginning to end."
Perfect World,"It doesn't completely negate the strong content. The first three seasons are sooooo very good and that will not change. The later meh-to-bad seasons simply mean I always have to qualify what I mean when I say ""The US Office is a great show."""
Perfect World,"For me the bad seasons don't ruin the good ones provided that either they have mostly standalone episodes or that the story arcs are limited to one season at a time.

Generally though, I have come to hate bad sequels or works featured in the same franchise because the fanboys *can't stop talking about them*. The perfect example is of course Star Wars (rant incoming): it's bad enough that so many comedies use a 30+ year old trilogy for cheap jokes it's even worse listening to fans who can't stop circlejerking over how bad the prequels were and how they completely invalidated everything that was good in this world instead of actually trying to enjoy new films and tv series."
Perfect World,Grimm! Love that show! Dont see a lot of Grimm fans here!
Perfect World,It might be related to the awful title. 
Perfect World,[deleted]
Perfect World,I'm surprised not many people watch it tbh. It's a great show that is very underrated.
Perfect World,Not perfect for him.
Perfect World,HuffPo is cancerous.
Perfect World,You don't think? Gilmore Girls is and was a good show. He still would've broken out into the star he is today.
Perfect World,Aho young warrior!
Perfect World,"I started calling people shit-ass because of this show. 

Aho young warrior."
Perfect World,Skoden!
Perfect World,Every single character in Reservation Dogs no matter how minor could easily carry their own series.
Perfect World,"Stath Lets Flats for more Nadja lol

But yeah, I really liked the show. I didn't have Hulu for a long time but this was always on my list of stuff to watch when I got it... then they had the Black Friday sale for 12 months for $2 a month... so I just recently started watching."
Perfect World,"I love it! Season 2 was my favourite season of TV from last year. Pretty much every episode had me on the verge of crying, and also laughing hard. Mabel and Offerings are two 10/10 episodes of tv. The show is constantly surprising and incredibly unique, such a great cast, and the characters are treated with an incredible amount of care. Can’t wait for season three!"
Perfect World,It’s fantastic
Perfect World,I'll have to give this show a look......I'm close to finishing up WWDITS right now and just watched Flight of the Conchords last month.  I seem to enjoy just about anything Taika Waititi is involved with.
Perfect World,It’s such a great show! Season 2 blew me away every single episode. The episode where Willie Jack went to see Hokti especially tore my heart up in the best way!
Perfect World,"Season one, hunting episode - it has a flashback of the character who took his own life chatting to his uncle. There isn't a line that makes it explicit how unwell he is, but his sadness just radiates from the scene. I think think about it to this day. Special show."
Perfect World,">I've been on a Taika binge (and anything including actors from WWDITS

But have you seen [**Stath Lets Flats**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GMVFbNKBM)? ;) It stars Natasia Demetriou (Nadja) alongside her brother (who is the main character, Stath), plus Al Roberts, who guest stars in an episode of WWDITS as Guillermo's boyfriend who is cloned and eventually falls in love with himself. Similar energy as Flight of the Conchords but with more unlikeable characters. Sort of like FOTC meets The Office."
Perfect World,"Jojo Rabbit might be my favorite piece of media from Taika, immediately followed by Reservation Dogs."
Perfect World,This is the most snubbed show I have ever seen in terms of awards. It has yet to win a single award for its second season
Perfect World,"I really tried to like this show, especially being such a big fan of Waititi's work. I'm not sure what I'm missing, since so much of it it ""should"" work. All the pieces are there for it to mean something, but I dunno. What is it you all get that makes it such a good show? Welcome any and all perspectives!"
Perfect World,"It's a great one. 

I found it incredibly accessible and emotional. Rooting for all of those kids. Such great characters. 

Personally, I didn't like the title. Thought it was a restaurant competition reality show when I first heard the name. But hey, what's a title?"
Perfect World,At first I thought you spelled “Reservoir Dogs” wrong…
Perfect World,About time you shit ass
Perfect World,"I enjoyed it, but I found it mid"
Perfect World,Why can’t you believe it?
Perfect World,"Thought this was the Tarantino movie Reservoir dogs, it made the text really confusing until understood id ""corrected"" the spelling to a whole other thing."
Perfect World,Anyone have similar shows to suggest?   Betty on HBO was somewhat similar (not as stellar though)
Perfect World,Yes it's a great show can't wait for the next season.
Perfect World,"The episode where bear gets the construction job with the cranberry juice tik Tok guy made me bawl my eyes out.

Such a good show. Hilarious, heartfelt, unique, excellent music, Bobby Lee. It's got it all."
Perfect World,Happy to hear your review. I have very similar taste to you and have been keeping this one on hold for a rainy day.
Perfect World,"The guy that plays the spirit guide also has some skits on a YT channel.

https://youtu.be/xJ89HBfaLs4

Edit: Another one- https://youtu.be/wRc0aTK0YoY"
Perfect World,Shit ass.
Perfect World,This guy had me in a laughing fit every time he was on screen. His comedic timing is something else.
Perfect World,Low key my fav character
Perfect World,Studis!
Perfect World,I'd watch paint dry if Willie Jack did the commentary.
Perfect World,"Seriously. That episode with all the ""Aunties"" going to that convention. That's a show with like 5 seasons right there."
Perfect World,Desperately need a Spirit Guide show that's him just bothering a new person every week for 30 minutes before they accidentally learn a lesson.
Perfect World,">verge of crying

Cheese in the group home."
Perfect World,"> Can’t wait for season three!

I hope season 3 is just as good as the first two. The season 2 finale really felt like a great place to leave the show, entirely. I always worry when shows push past a great season finale."
Perfect World,It was bittersweet watching both the Reservation Dogs and TLOU finale back to back last night. Always a great feeling experiencing such great shows/movies but then you're left with waiting on more/knowing you can't watch it for the first time again.
Perfect World,"When you finish res dogs, check out Our Flag Means Death!"
Perfect World,"On the other hand, we probably should also acknowledge that the co-creator and showrunner of *Reservation Dogs* is **Sterlin Harjo**, and that [he deserves the lions' share of the praise](https://variety.com/2023/tv/markets-festivals/reservation-dogs-sterlin-harjo-showrunner-award-scad-tvfest-1235500955/) here. While Waititi's name is undoubtedly what got FX to open up their checkbooks, and he co-created and works on the show, Harjo's the one guiding the ship: just look at [the writing and directing credits for the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_Dogs#Season_1_(2021))."
Perfect World,"So going forwards, you know not to worry about what does and doesn't get an award. Just enjoy what you like."
Perfect World,It isn't really his show.  His co-producer Harjo is really the showrunner here.  Waititi is more in support. And that is a good decision because Harjo is from Oklahoma and you can tell the show actually understands the culture it is depicting. I love how they censor owl eyes.
Perfect World,"I love the show, but I can’t slam through the episodes like I can other shows. I think the show requires earnest attention and can’t be absorbed passively. That’s how it is for me, but I’m sure others are happy to binge it. It will make you crack up, but it’s not trying to make you laugh every minute."
Perfect World,"> I really tried to like this show, especially being such a big fan of Waititi's work

I went into it thinking it was going to be a lot more like Waititi's other stuff. Res Dogs is not. There's a lot less comedy and a lot more heavy drama aspects to it. And it's definitely less silly than something like Our Flag Means Death or What We Do in the Shadows.

> What is it you all get that makes it such a good show?

For me, the two things I like most about it are:

1. Native culture. I know almost nothing about Native American culture or Res life and I really enjoy learning about other cultures or ways of life via fictional TV/movies (hopefully it was at least semi-accurate). My wife and I made fry bread tacos the other night and it was a great way to connect with the show more.
2. The characters feel pretty real. The show doesn't have me sitting on the edge of my seat with intense action or drama, but I do feel like I can connect with the characters a lot because they and their situations are all pretty relatable.

All that said, it's not my *favorite* show, but I did really enjoy it."
Perfect World,"The fact that it's based on truths even if a lil embellished at parts. If you live on the Rez or have ever visited a friend, you can tell this show is 100% up front and real with it"
Perfect World,I'd also like to know. I watched the first ~half of the first season and was bored to tears. It was so different than all the hype I'd been hearing that I honestly thought I'd watched the wrong show or something. Dunno.
Perfect World,"yeah as a fan of Waititi's stuff, I have no clue why so many people are into this show. Everything happening in the show feels inconsequential or cliche. I want to like it, since it deals with Natives but Idk."
Perfect World,"Odd, i feel like pretty much everyone would confuse the title with Reservation Dogs not some reality restaurant show."
Perfect World,You weren't the only one.
Perfect World,I really loved Somebody Somewhere
Perfect World,Ramy !
Perfect World,You might like Blindspotting (Starz) (2021)
Perfect World,"More commonly spelled ""Stoodis"". \[grin\]

Cracked me the hell up that *Rutherford Falls* (which [shared writers, cast, and a director with *Reservation Dogs*](https://www.imdb.com/search/name/?roles=tt13623580,tt11058054)*,* because the Indigenous talent pool Hollywood knows is *that* small) [had episodes titled ""Skoden"" and ""Stoodis.""](https://www.epguides.com/RutherfordFalls/)"
Perfect World,Imagine a light-hearted X-Files/True Detective show about Officer Big's search for Bigfoot and other mystical creatures.
Perfect World,The dance scene in their heads then flashing to what it really looked like was absolutely hilarious.
Reckoning,That must be terrifying honestly. Coogan is probably one of the most talented impersonators perhaps ever - imagine meeting him dressed up as your abuser.
Reckoning,The BBC can go fuck themselves. They protected him for decades and facilitated in the destruction of children.
Reckoning,"The audacity of the BBC to make this programme when they were his biggest protectors. It is unspoken that Jimmy Savile was barred from the BBC Scotland, instead of doing something about it, they all just swept it under the carpet and will now profit from it."
Reckoning,"“Hoodwinked a nation”.  No he didn’t, he and other presenters were aided and abetted by many others including staff at the BBC, and members of the police.  PR-washing at its best."
Reckoning,"Jimmy makes for an easy 'bogeyman' taking the focus away from others who were complicit in abuse, and covering up abuse, at the time.

Though I do believe too much is made of the King's past 'friendship' with him. The fact remains, Jimmy did a crazy amount for charity. It excuses nothing (maybe in his own twisted mind, it somehow did), but it explains why there was ever any royal connection. Very few have done more for charitable causes than Charles himself. I'll never believe there was any more to it than that."
Reckoning,"Reminder that Jimmy Savile was an unofficial advisor and confidant of then Prince Charles

>""Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that.

The Royal Family was close to Savile, there is ZERO possibility they were unaware of the allegations.   

Prince Andrew was close with Jeff Epstein, Prince Charles was close with Jimmy Savile, it isn't too tough to figure out why Epstein and Savile basically got away with their crimes"
Reckoning,"There’s no way anybody gets that close to the Royal Family and Prime Ministers without being thoroughly investigated, so MI5 must either be the most inept intelligence service on the planet, or they knew exactly what he was up to, did nothing and helped cover up."
Reckoning,"Omg I did not know this was in the works!

Interested in how this turns out 

Really enjoyed the BBC's Early Days of Doctor Who television movie; this is, of course, a horse of a much different color"
Reckoning,It's been shelved for the time being. Even the BBC can't be that naive?
Reckoning,"If anyone needs eye bleach after this, check out the dueling Michael Cain impressions between Coogan and Rob Brydon in “The Trip.”"
Reckoning,"This wouldn't have been the first time a comedian has dressed up like Saville and put on the voice. Way back before the news broke to the public, Saville was often the subject for mimicry, mostly in earnest too."
Reckoning,The BBC enabled and abetted him.  They helped him molest children.
Reckoning,"I mean, how many people who did that are still at the BBC now? It's not a living being, it's an organization."
Reckoning,"And the crown.  He was one of Chuckle's best friends.

And it's oh so convenient that they've moved the show to after the coronation."
Reckoning,"It’s like being the person who threw gasoline on a burning house, then coming back when the house had burnt down and talking about how terrible the whole thing was."
Reckoning,"This is the truth *right there* not only that, any Brits that grew up in the 70's are righfully shook up about it as he was everywhere in their childhoods and just hearing his voice and seeing pictures of him from that time is unnerving.

And to top it off, they take our money in the form of mandated subscription through the TV license, then spend it on a fucking TV show so we can get horrified about it all over again, while making sure they dont look too badly out of it?"
Reckoning,That's what I can't believe! How on Earth will they address this?
Reckoning,"The UK’s power structures have been uniquely influenced and shaped by child abuse, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the systems built end up protecting the abusers."
Reckoning,"This is what this ‘drama’ is designed to do. Minimize the BBC’s culpability and part in anything. Minimize the Royal Family’s culpability and part in anything. Play up the notion that ‘no one could’ve known’ and ‘mistakes were made’, while ultimately laying all blame squarely on Savile.

Meanwhile the BBC will laud this thing praising the acting and ‘Coogan’s spine chilling performance’, throw a BAFTA at this whitewashing of reality when it comes time and they’ll have their fake version of events firmly implanted in the UK’s mind."
Reckoning,"Blows my mind. Shows you how pathetic the BBC is. Guy was literally groping girls on TOTP LIVE on air. They all knew and did nothing.

At least come forward with a proper public apology before making a show. Or even invest a substantial amount of money into charities against child abuse. If it wasn't already free, I'd recommend everyone to pirate this."
Reckoning,How many people currently at the BBC would have been around for any of that? Let alone in power?
Reckoning,This is like if O.J. Simpson did a television special where he goes looking for the real killers
Reckoning,Their cover up was disgusting but maybe its a move of atonement?
Reckoning,"Yeah, that was my first thought as well.

First they profit from him and cover up his abuses, then they profit from a show about his crimes and how they were covered up.

I wonder if the show will explicitly show BBC's involvement.

Edit:My brain is fried today and my writing was ugly as fuck."
Reckoning,Also Maggie Thatcher.
Reckoning,The man was seen as trusted enough by the British public that British Rail used him for TV adverts.
Reckoning,"I think the problem for Charlies is that he is connected not just to this guy, but to his brother Andrew and Epstein. Now, granted, if you actually look into it, he didn't visit Epstein really without Andrew and his visits pretty quickly fell off as time went on, but these are still connections he is never going to quite be able to shake."
Reckoning,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/friendship-with-prince-charles-made-paedophile-bishop-peter-ball-impregnable
Reckoning,That's what I was thinking after viewing the doc. There's NO WAY this guy's secret life could have been contained without outside help covering it up. And like you say esp with ther Royal Family it would seem.
Reckoning,"MI5 allowed a confessed Soviet double agent to take an immunity deal, end up in charge of the royal art collection and get a knighthood."
Reckoning,"Everyone of any significance in the British Establishment who came into frequent contact with Savile would have been briefed on the allegations, and the likelihood that MI5 believed them to be true."
Reckoning,"dude, read the room 😂"
Reckoning,It says in the article that you're commenting on that it's not been shelved and looking like a summer premiere.
Reckoning,Has anyone actually watched more of the show than that clip? lol
Reckoning,"""Yeah, it probably goes 'Hi My Name Is Michael Cain'"""
Reckoning,You say that as if the BBC isn't one of the most incestuous media organizations filled with nepotistic legacy hires on earth.
Reckoning,[removed]
Reckoning,"Soooo, like every US movie about Vietnam?"
Reckoning,It's not though is it. Most the people working at the BBC wouldn't have been there in the 70s to early/mid 90s where he was regularly working
Reckoning,"Nothing will happen if you simply stop paying for the TV licence, as so many other people have done"
Reckoning,How dare drama tackle heavy subjects. It should keep to its lane and do marvel lunchbox commercials.
Reckoning,"Hey! I remember him clearly as a child all through the 80’s, thank you very much."
Reckoning,Just look at the culture of elite British boarding schools and universities. [Ritualized sexual abuse and humilliation](https://nypost.com/2015/09/21/david-cameron-put-private-part-in-dead-pigs-mouth-book/) is a stable of English aristocratic culture.
Reckoning,"Not free. TV licence required to watch, unlike the coronation which I as a non-licence holder can watch without threat of prosecution. Savile made me abandon the BBC, and later all UK broadcast TV since the weaponisation if racism, immigration, and anti-semitism."
Reckoning,"There was an apology. What else are you going to blame them for, your crap memory?"
Reckoning,">*They all knew*

Yeah? Who, exactly? Name names"
Reckoning,Reminds me of a guy who was on TV when I was a kid here in Canada. I think the show was called Just Like Mom or something similar and the host’s name was Fergie Olver. Many times he coerced or tricked 10-12 year old girls into kissing him live on air. Totally revolting and he’s never faced any backlash for it.
Reckoning,Vanishingly small.
Reckoning,"There's a Norm MacDonald joke in there somewhere, I can feel it."
Reckoning,Atonement is a funny word for exploitation and greed.
Reckoning,They don’t profit from the show at all.
Reckoning,And the royal family.
Reckoning,I’ve always been partial to the [James Bond improvisation](https://youtu.be/XTEL976wc_I) where Rob starts off by playing the Roger Moore role but instantly realizes that Steve does a phenomenal Moore voice so they switch it up
Reckoning,"It’s a movie with a sequel, and I watched both! This is just an extremely fun clip of two masters who have a history in real life squabbling and being excellent at what they do, and that you need basically no plot and info to understand."
Reckoning,"Okay, and if someone's uncle covered for a pedophile that means they will too?"
Reckoning,[removed]
Reckoning,You know the pig story isn't actually true though. That was just put out there by Lord Ashcroft. It's a perfect case of the whole make up something so salacious that even to deny would be embarrassing.
Reckoning,"For a start, here's a couple of names from [the Dame Janet Smith Review Report](http://downloads.bbci.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/dame_janet_smith_review/savile/jimmy_savile_investigation.pdf):

* Ted Beston, Radio 1 producer — he not only knew, but on at least one occasion ""was willing to act as a provider of a young woman for Savile""
* Canon Colin Semper, producer in the religious broadcasting department 
* Douglas Muggeridge, Former Controller of Radio 1 and Radio 2

There's also George Entwistle, Director-General of the BBC in 2012, who shut down the Newsnight investigation into Savile."
Reckoning,[removed]
Reckoning,"I think I saw a compilation video of this a while back. Terrible but Savile was a different kind of beast. He sexually molested children in their hospital beds (yes, really). The information is all out there, just Google it if you're brave enough. He got off on the savagery. Pure unadulterated evil."
Reckoning,"The BBC is a public company, how can it be greed?"
Reckoning,How so?
Reckoning,The Royal family has been aiding and embedding a child predator for decades.
Reckoning,Are you trying to correct that commenter by saying it’s a movie? Or do you know that it’s actually a 6 episode show cut down to a movie… and there have been 4 series of the show.
Reckoning,"That’s literally all 20,000 people who work at the BBC at any one time."
Reckoning,">*After two and a half years working on this review, I have found no evidence  that any BBC employee above producer level could stand accused of complicity in Savile’s crimes in connection with his work for the BBC*

Reckoning,"By *'picking apart'*, you mean asking for straightforward, factual information"
Reckoning,"Their executives make almost a quarter of a million dollars a year, even public companies have greed. Hell look at Non-Profits such as the American Cancer Fund, a non-profit organization who’s head takes a yearly salary of over $200,000"
Reckoning,The show is made by ITV Studios. The BBC commissions it and pays a proportion of the budget.
Reckoning,"*abetting, but yes."
Reckoning,"Including those in their own family.  Mountbatten, Andrew then Saville, and this cleric https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/friendship-with-prince-charles-made-paedophile-bishop-peter-ball-impregnable"
Reckoning,I did not know! Thanks!
Reckoning,"Oh, are we moving the goalposts now? Name names who are 1. above producer level, 2a. could stand accused of complicity in Savile’s crimes, 2b. in connection with his work for the BBC?"
Reckoning,"The producer Smith mentions in that quote is Ted Beston, the producer of a radio show where Savile toured the UK in a caravan, accompanied only by Beston   


Smith quotes contemporary sources describing Beston as Savile's friend and sharing a similar lewd sense of humour"
Reckoning,"JAQing off in bad faith, the classic"
Reckoning,"no, by ‘picking apart’ they (and anyone with half a brain) mean(s) that at the end of the day, you’re openly defending a fucking pedophile, mate. jesus fucking christ."
Reckoning,"Nonprofit CEOs bring in a shit-ton more money than they take out. I’ve worked in nonprofit for 30 years, and every *good* CEO or Executive Director I’ve known - for organizations big and small - work 24/7. 

In addition to programmatic and fiscal oversight, about 50% of their job is fundraising. The good ones bring in BIG donors and funders, both through personal connections and their ability to schmooze. 

All that to say $200K is a modest salary for that position in a national agency. They’re bringing in millions - hundreds of millions a year, and it’s a tough job on top of that. 

Source: Was a terrible E.D. for 3 years, would never want to do it again for any amount of money, and live/work in fundraising in NYC."
Reckoning,BBC executives work at one of the biggest broadcasters in the world. Their pay is chicken feed compared to the private sector.
Reckoning,"So? BBC will air it and most likely sell it to international markets after that, which is how they make a significant part of their income. 

Plus, having shows that capture people's interest obviously benefits a studio that needs public funding to exist. And they have commercials, of course.

This idea that publicly founded networks make no money is just weird, no idea why people keep repeating it here in the comments.

Networks need shows to keep people watching and justify their existence. This show will likely attract a big audience, hence it will bring profit to the show."
Reckoning,I was a wheee bit stoned when writing that. ;)
Reckoning,Such hits include “what makes you think Jordan Peterson is conservative?” And “is there anything wrong with wanting a small government?”
Reckoning,"I understand that there are plenty of good non-profits, for sure. My wife has a degree in Non-Profit Management and has worked for some great Non-Profits."
Reckoning,"The BBC doesn’t own it, ITV Studios does. They will handle foreign sales and ancillary streaming and home video. The BBC does not have commercial revenue."
Reckoning,"> The new regime at WBD is actively considering launching some free streaming channels outside the HBO Max paywall. Those channels would feature older content from the HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. libraries. 

So I'm guessing that's where a lot of the non-wrote-off stuff yanked from HBO Max that isn't sold to another streamer like Amazon will end up."

Reckoning,That could make sense. Have a free tier that has all the stuff that you know isn’t actually selling the service but people would go to if it was free and then they can think it’s dumb to not just get the full service since they already go on it
Reckoning,They actually explicitly said that at recent conferences
Reckoning,"He says that now, but wait until he finds out that Morbius is on Netflix."
Reckoning,Weird coming from him because I don't think anyone has hurt cinema more than this guy.
Reckoning,"I think ultimately most streaming services will succeed and it's cable that will implode. IIRC there's still over 70 million people subscribed to cable that can still transition fully to streaming. 

I think it's very shortsighted to assume billions of people will all watch only Disney, Amazon, AppleTV, and Netflix and exclude everything else. You don't need hundreds of millions of subscribers to succeed - a streamer can easily run some cheaper niche content and still be profitable."
Reckoning,"This is probably more in line with whatever business venture he runs/launches next than it is with reality. Radio is still around, so I'm not sure why broadcast would disappear. I mean, maybe they will both go away in 30 years, but if you can't pinpoint how and why and a general time frame, then it's not a prediction."
Reckoning,"If you follow the margins of the whole chain from production to the audience there is one piece still  to get squeezed: big names actors. They can do for 5M what they do for 10M. This same thing is happening right now with European soccer. Youth is not interested in spending 90 minutes watching a game and paying 120$ for your team shirt. and the numbers start to not add up. and those ceos scrambling to see where they can get money soon will have to face the untouchable salary of stars, because them is on where the value have ended. Entertainment industry can get a lot cheaper we stop treating the main characters as gods."
Reckoning,it will be investors that don't receive the return on investment & don't see constant subscriber growth that will kill good streaming.
Reckoning,A bit rich coming from this clown.
Reckoning,"He single handedly ruined Disney's streaming strategy. When Disney could have focused on all sorts of content on a streaming service under a different name, he was the one who forced the family friendly pill down everyone's throat."
Reckoning,"Of course the movie industry never goes back.  50+ bucks or close to it to go see a movie after all the costs included, that movie will have to be special. Not paying that unless it has Tom Cruise dangling by a helicopter level antics in it. And it'll need to get good reviews."
Reckoning,Doom and gloom.
Reckoning,"I can see cable still surviving but it will probably never be as big as it was under the Boomer generation. A lot of like cal content with streaming being the more national focus in a few years. You are already starting to see this with football and other sports keeping streaming rights to a few and only airing local and/or really big games live on cable, along with streaming. But someone will always be streaming while cable gets smaller."
Reckoning,"And in other news the sky is blue..

Anyone can tell you that streaming is going to collapse,  we have way to many and a finite nu,ber of hours in a day.

And what a shock people arent going to the movies anymore.
Is it the insane prices at the theatres? or could it be the absolutely horrible movies they have been making.
I know i want to spend $100 bucks to go to a theatre to see a horrible movie while 27 idiots play on their phones and talk around me."
Reckoning,Oh my god I literally just saw that it was. Fucking yikes.

Almost Happy,"I was just watching the Curb Your Enthusiam clip where she goes to Sammi's wedding in Larry's place to read his speech. And honestly even the way she delivered his speech for him till she gets cut off did remind me a bit of Larry.

Almost Happy,Ah-mah-zing!
Almost Happy,Would love to know her experience on gone girl
Almost Happy,Year of penny! suck it
Almost Happy,Who?
Almost Happy,"I think that is dead on. It's the kind of comedy show I prefer to watch alone or with people who get it because it's funny to me. But I've seen it on in the lunchroom at work with a mixed crowd of people and half them were like wtf is this it's not funny change the channel. Some people just don't get it or vibe with it which is totally fine different strokes for different folks. But I prefer to watch alone then since I like it and think it's hilarious. Or you get a ton of people that are like what show? I've never seen that show? 

Similar to Don't Trust The Bitch in Apartment 23. People either have no clue what I'm talking about or they are oh hell yeah I've watched that show."
Almost Happy,"I’m actually in the middle. Watched it once during a slow point in my life. I felt it was fine. I didn’t think it was bad, but didn’t think it stood out amongst its comedy competition. I was always entertained but never really laughed."

Almost Happy,Ditto
Almost Happy,such a clumsy bitch!
Almost Happy,Soooooo good.
Almost Happy,The name is literally in the title.
Almost Happy,Apt 23 is so underrated.

Almost Happy,"Well, she was on SNL, so hardly a nobody.  And I wonder if you see the irony in you of all people calling someone a nobody."
Almost Happy,Oh I know my place. I don’t pretend to be famous. That’s the difference fuck face.
Almost Happy,She's not pretending though.  You're trying to insult a famous person by calling them something you are.

Three seasons, each brilliant in their own way. Never a scene that isn't gripping and a blast to watch, the dialogue is incredible, characters that are ridiculously memorable and fun to spend time with, a setting that feels so real and disgusting.

Personal take, Community. Feel like it's viewership is at an all time high after Netflix and Covid, and while other shows have tried to emulate it, nothing has ever come close. Hard to call it a masterpiece with the gas leak year, but I'm going to do it anyways."
Almost Happy,The Venture Brothers

It hasn't turned out though. The finale is next week. I agree that it has been excellent, but until they stick the landing I will reserve judgement."
Almost Happy,Freaks and geeks. It is so much better than all other teen shows. And it was unique in so many ways. That they focused on young teens was a intresting touch ( at leadt for the geeks). Every other teen show except malcom in the middle focus on 18 year olds played by 23 year old actors.  It really could have gone on for 3-4 seasons and not feeling forced considering the age of the geeks.

Almost Happy,"The only correct answer here is Hannibal

Honorable mentions that would have been great had they ended a lot sooner

Heroes- the writers strike unfortunately killed this one.  It was one of the very few shows that was actually perfect for its first season. Then a steady decline from season 2 on.  Nerfing Peter in season 3 was the wrong move and hurt his character. 


The Flash CW- this one was amazing from the first season to most of the way into season 3. My biggest gripes were: how they seemed to repeat the same plot lines just with a different speedster villain.  And Iris... oh my gosh. She was great the first few seasons.  But they couldn't escape their formula they used.  Depower Barry. OHNOEZ guys!! Iris is in crisis.  Or Iris is mad at Barry or Iris needs rescued AGAIN.  It got so tired so quick


Arrow CW... this one was consistently good almost throughout the entire run of the series.  It was brilliant  with the exception of Felicity. They killed off original Laurel and shoehorned the actor who played Felicity into all of the roles Laurel should have been in."

Hollywood,"This guy has the strangest resume ever.  Wrote a bunch of those parody movies, the 2 ok-ish sequels to The Hangover and a shitty Melissa McCarthy movie to all of a sudden is churning out stuff like Chernobyl and TLOU."
Hollywood,"From the article:

> Craig Mazin was ready for a change.

> About a decade ago, Mazin had carved out a solid career as a comedy screenwriter. Though his credits were hardly going to win over critics — “Scary Movie 3” and “Scary Movie 4” as well as the second and third installments of the “Hangover” trilogy, among them — the calls from Hollywood executives kept coming. It was a steady and lucrative job.

> Still, there was something missing.

> “A lot of what I would be offered was stuff where they’re like, ‘Who can fix this thing?’” Mazin recalled in an interview late last month. “Or ‘Can somebody get it from a C-plus to a B-minus?’”

> Eventually he decided that “I’m better than the work I’m being offered,” he said.

> That was the first crucial step in what would become a remarkable midcareer ascent. Over the last four years, Mazin, 51, has spawned two hit HBO series and transformed himself from a comedy screenwriter into one of the hottest showrunners in premium scripted television."
Hollywood,"He's got to have a blank check and a golden ticket now, right? After helming an almost universely acclaimed prestige mini-series and then adapting a video game into a huge weekly watercooler show? 

As much as I love the Last of Us and am really excited to see Part 2 adapted, I'm almost more excited to see what he chooses to do next"
Hollywood,This is a just desserts for the poor guy who had to be Ted Cruz’s roommate in college.
Hollywood,Btw I highly recommend the Scriptnotes podcast Mazin hosts with John August for anyone interested in screenwriting.
Hollywood,"I read Mazin is a big fan of Mass Effect, so get this dude to adapt ME asap!"
Hollywood,All I want to say is that Craig Mazin is great because he’d hop onto the r/ChernobylTV post episode discussion threads and chat for a bit with Redditors and just give his appreciation for all the love and support. Solid dude.
Hollywood,"I know I'm stating the obvious, but he's got a fantastic eye  at conveying story telling through subtle details. I love checking out the HBO weekly podcast on the show after an episode airs mostly because of him as he goes into great detail( alongside Neil) on the decision making behind all the pivotal scenes  of each episode and gives you a stronger appreciation for how seriously they're treating the project and that nothing was included ""by accident"". His passion for the source material is infectious."
Hollywood,thinking about rewatching Chernobyl cause Last of Us is so good
Hollywood,"Besides being a puff piece that just rehashes old stuff, the most interesting thing is that the budget is around 150 million dollars for the first season of TLoU. That is more than I expected they would give the show, I guess."
Hollywood,"""Who would have thought that not butchering the source material of what you are adapting would prove successful"" - Hollywood probably"
Hollywood,"Netflix may have more money, but HBO spends their money on great content, love this show and can’t wait for more from Mazin!"
Hollywood,Can we also take a moment to mention how he fucking crushed being the believably horrible Lou in Mythic Quest?
Hollywood,Craig if you ever read this. Please do Mass Effect. You’re the only one who can do it right. It would be the greatest story ever told on television
Hollywood,Scary Movie 3 is still a masterpiece. I will die on this hill
Hollywood,People have asked me what I think about the production and I always tell them the same thing: it’s definitely a Mazin.
Hollywood,"Mazin pros: His writing.

Mazin cons: Not realizing he didn't pay 10% agents fee.  Not protecting his assistants in pay issues."
Hollywood,NY Times Photographer: We just need a quick cover shot for the article. Just stand against this wall and put your hands up like you just touched raw chicken and are gonna wash your hands.
Hollywood,He’s such a good success story. Man did a lot of shitty Melissa McCarthy movies to get paid them just pumps out one of the best tv shows with Chernobyl then follows it up with the last of us.
Hollywood,Listen to his podcast.. he seems kinda annoying.
Hollywood,"In the time it takes you to read the article, he'll have been offered the shot at making a Star Wars movie, which will then inevitably be cancelled before you even make it to the comments section."
Hollywood,"Everyone rightfully praises Mazin for TLOU and Chernobyl, but he also wrote one of the single best TV episodes I’ve ever seen (Mythic Quest, Backstory, S02E06). He is extremely talented, and is probably one of the best working writers at this very moment."
Hollywood,“Craig Mazin’s A-Mazin Hollywood Ascent” was right there. Be better NY Times.
Hollywood,Episode 3 of the show proves he can come up with original material that’s on par with what Druckmann created for the game and I think that’s really cool.
Hollywood,TIL the director of last of us did Chernobyl
Hollywood,"Since Mazin is a frequent Reddit user, hi, Craig!"
Hollywood,Crazy he wrote Scary Movie which have single handedly ruined my enjoyment of Scream in a good way 🤣
Hollywood,Can’t help but always say Craig Mazin with a Liverpool accent in my head 😅
Hollywood,Not a good guy unfortunately. But he has a great publicist who asks the NYTimes to do these pieces for him.
Hollywood,"I dunno, I think most of it was written for him"
Hollywood,Would LOVE to see him and Jordan Peele work together..that’d be INSANE.
Hollywood,It's a good show...but great?  No
Hollywood,The Last of Us is the most boring zombie and/or dystopic piece of entertainment I’ve ever seen.
Hollywood,Really? Because it looks like a step down from Chernobyl to me.
Hollywood,That picture looks like he doesn’t know what to do with his hands
Hollywood,Can he do the Witcher next :(
Hollywood,"After listening to him for years on ScriptNotes I was not going to miss the premiere of Chernobyl.  And I'm glad I didn't, and I'm glad he has found projects that highlight his talent."
Hollywood,"I remember the episode on the Scriptnotes podcast when Chernobyl got greenlit. He said it was something important to him and what he always wanted to do. Proud of you, “Sexy Craig.”"
Hollywood,"I read an article somewhere and he said that he did these movies because... paycheck.  The guy needed to make a living, and this was a way to do it, get contacts in the Hollywood system and eventually get enough experience that people would listen when he pitched something.

Mission accomplished."
Hollywood,Have you ever listened to his SCRIPTNOTES podcast?  You can tell from multiple discussions on that show that writers (and specifically him) are often servicing someone else’s framework and visions while working to earn a living. It’s a quite interesting listen if you’re interested in screenwriting at all.
Hollywood,"Also, Ted Cruz’s freshman year college roommate and nemesis"
Hollywood,He actually works as a script doctor and has helped several movies where he was uncredited. All those movies you mentioned were just for paycheck
Hollywood,[Here's his AMA response to that](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChernobylTV/comments/cc76ib/ama_with_showcreator_craig_mazin/etmaw2r/)
Hollywood,"A paycheck is a paycheck. It’s like Noah Hawley going from writing a handful of episodes of Bones to somehow being the guy behind Fargo and Legion. Very rarely is a really talented writer getting exactly what they want to the screen on those early projects and they’ve still gotta make a living. Compare that to actors who star in a bunch of stinkers or strange early roles that get forgotten or become a fun punchline as soon as they hit it big. 

I think we’re a bit more judgmental with writers because we forget how much studio interference is involved in most scripts."
Hollywood,Don't worry I'm sure the Borderlands movie he wrote that has been stuck in post-production hell for an eternity will muddy the waters even further.
Hollywood,"He also famously rescued the original GOT pilot.

https://www.nme.com/news/tv/screenwriter-says-original-game-of-thrones-pilot-w-884904"
Hollywood,"I hope he keeps succeeding, if only because he had the misfortune of rooming with Ted Cruz at college and constantly heckles him on social media."
Hollywood,"People seem to understand, but not accept, that Hollywood is likely the hardest industry in the world to break into, and that you’re gonna be a janitor for a long time before they let you even close to the junior sales floor."
Hollywood,"I never really realized who he was other than from his face. I had recently watched Mythic Quest and listened to The Watch podcast late breakdown of Chernobyl they did prior to TLOU. 

The name Mazin stuck in my head because I remembered it from the credits of Mythic. Was completely shocked when I realized that he was the guy that had done Chernobyl and TLOU."
Hollywood,"You cannot - ever - judge a screenwriter by an assignment script. Unless you've read one of their spec scripts, all you're seeing is their attempt to make the best of a likely bad situation, filtered through several more complete different variables."
Hollywood,Senseless was pretty great though
Hollywood,& he was college roommates w Ted Cruz
Hollywood,"Say what you will about the Hangover sequels, they both had some pretty clever visual storytelling. They’re the gold standard of unnecessary cash-grab sequels."
Hollywood,Reminds me of Peter Jackson when he started doing LOTR
Hollywood,A lot of people in Hollywood have that kind of résumé. A bunch of stuff on the résumé to get the experience and then they get a chance to prove themselves.
Hollywood,"I've watched several comedies that Mazin has written, and I think they're awful. I consider Hangover 2 and 3 to be textbook examples of what not to do with sequels.

Meanwhile, The Last of Us is almost impeccable television. I haven't seen Chernobyl, but I read nothing but positive things about it.

This dude found his secret sauce around 2018-2019. Whatever it was, it's working."
Hollywood,"So far all his original stories have been garbage.

His current hot streak is because he is adapting stories that he doesn’t have to make up. He was able to research Chernobyl to death. And The Last of Us was plotted out ahead of time for him by the games.

I love Last of Us. But I’m reserving putting Craig Mazin on a pedestal until he writes something original and good."
Hollywood,To pimp a butterfly.
Hollywood,"I get what you mean, but I don’t think it’s as strange as you would think for a writer. As others have said, for many writers, the first thing you have to do is make a living."
Hollywood,"You should check out Scriptnotes, the podcast he hosts with fellow screenwriter John August. They had Patton Oswalt as a guest last week, and they basically shot the breeze about working earlier rooms where they were brought in to polish turd scripts, and basically said no matter how much they tried, some scripts (and even movies that were already shot) were beyond saving without completely throwing everything out. The studios would be like, “Well, we already spent all this money on this, so we’re not gonna start over.”"
Hollywood,Screenwriters write scripts lol. They dont really control or influence final output 99% of the time. Unless its some renowned director with some passion project.
Hollywood,He also wrote one of the best episodes of Mythic Quest to date.
Hollywood,"And let’s not forget he went to Princeton from a humble background, where he was freshman roommates with Ted Cruz. That is proof of struggling to the top."
Hollywood,"It's addressed in the article. Hollywood only sees you for what you've done, not what you can do.  I'm sure he was pigeonholed for years.  He's incredibly lucky he got Chernobyl."
Hollywood,This is why I rarely blame the writer for a movie. Or at least define their quality by them. Hah
Hollywood,"Thanks OP, subscription walls on this stuff are dumb"
Hollywood,"It'll be a minute, since he's committed to at least two more seasons, with likely multi-year gaps between each."
Hollywood,"Listening to the podcast about TLoU, in episode 1 it pretty much sounds like he already had a blank check to do whatever he felt like after Chernobyl.

Craig Mazin is amazing in that podcast in explaining his thoughts and decisions. Same with the Chernobyl one."
Hollywood,"He needs to strike while the iron is hot.  All it takes is one bad season or bomb, and all the goodwill disappears in a moment.  Get that bag."
Hollywood,"Hope he sticks with HBO and premium TV, whatever he ends up doing. I think he could easily be the next David Simon"
Hollywood,"This is the blank check project. By all accounts HBO was not seeking out a TLOU show, Craig brought it to them and they wanted to work with Craig on something he was passionate about"
Hollywood,I hear it’s Metroid Prime
Hollywood,He wrote the Borderlands movie...very interested to see his version of a video game adaption that's the polar opposite of TLOU.
Hollywood,HBO needs to lock him up to a deal if they haven’t already. They did a piece on Casey Bloys who is the head of HBO and they seem to already have a solid relationship.
Hollywood,"Wait what?

Edit: just looked it up I thought it was an inside joke. 

What a cruel origin story."
Hollywood,I had never heard this before! This dude has the craziest story arc. One day he will write a script about his own life and people will say it’s too unbelievable.
Hollywood,I read Cruz as Bundy and was very confused.
Hollywood,Didn't know this was a thing.  Thanks I've got something new to binge!
Hollywood,"Wow, there are *a lot* of episodes. Should I start current and go back? Or start at the beginning? Cherry pick episodes maybe?"
Hollywood,It's the gold standard for aspiring screenwriters and it is genuinely fantastic.
Hollywood,I started listening to this after watching Chernobyl. I stopped listening to this after Mazin’s “how dare you criticize D&D for how GoT ended” speech.
Hollywood,"Craig Mazin isn’t involved, but *Andor* has some *Chernobyl* alums - the production designer, and also Stellan Skarsgård, Robert Emms, and Alex Ferns."
Hollywood,"3.6 roentgen. Not great, not terrible."
Hollywood,"I’ve never seen it, planning on starting it when TLoU ends."
Hollywood,I just started a rewatch because of TLOU. Forgot how much the first episode is framed as a horror film. It's so fucking good.
Hollywood,That’s exactly what I’m going to do to fill my time between the Last of Us finale and Succession season 4 premiere
Hollywood,"I know that House of Dragon had 200 million for its first season while Westworld cost 160 million for its last season. Do we know how much did the previous seasons of Euphoria, White Lotus and Succession cost?"
Hollywood,"Where’d the money go? Not on the screen, that’s for sure"
Hollywood,"It’s never that straightforward. Adaptation is an art and a skill itself. Sticking slavishly to the source material could get you The Godfather, making radical changes could get you Bladerunner or John Carpenter’s The Thing. It’s not about “change as little as possible”, it’s understanding what can change, what has to change, what can remain and what has to remain. It fails so often precisely because its a complicated problem with no simple solution."
Hollywood,"""Going forward should we maybe try to stick to the source material more?"" 

""No that's just crazy talk"" - Basically any studio that's not HBO."
Hollywood,"I wonder if part of the problem isn’t that we aren’t letting these creators make original works anymore so they feel compelled to try and put their own “improvements” on these adaptations since it’s the only stuff getting made and they’ll never get another opportunity.

I’m not excusing it, because it’s been mostly hot garbage, just wondering.

Like that recent Netflix Resident Evil show felt like someone took a zombie apocalypse script they wrote and just changed all the names of everything from stuff they got off the RE wiki."
Hollywood,"To be fair though, no other games have source material as strong as TLOU. Lots of them would make pretty lackluster movies/shows even if they were directly adapted."
Hollywood,"HBO have the advantage of being on the prestige tv industry for longer as well. So they have built a fantastic production pipeline and the legacy to lure talented artists in, like Craig."
Hollywood,"Netflix's chief of TV (Bela Begaria) does not care about critical acclaim, she's said as much. She also doesn't get why critically acclaimed hits like Queens Gambit are popular as it was greenlit before her tenure"
Hollywood,Love the episode he co-wrote!
Hollywood,Killed it as the living embodiment of ACKSHUALLY
Hollywood,"I definitely wish he’d let Neil and Troy talk more. Mazin seems super nice and is great at breaking down the episodes, but damn… he talks so much that Troy can barely ask any questions and Neil can’t answer any."
Hollywood,He likes to hear his own voice for sure. I can picture Druckman just staring waiting for his turn to speak
Hollywood,He’s insufferable on that podcast.
Hollywood,"Holy shit, of COURSE he wrote that! It all makes sense now"
Into the Night,Oh FUCK yes!!!  Was wondering when this was coming out.  Thanks!!
Into the Night,Cool! Loved the first season!
Into the Night,Forgot about this totally but I actually enjoyed the 1st one.
Into the Night,I thought that they didn't film second season yet because of pandemic. I loved the first season. Interaction of characters from different countries was fun. There is a common NeTfLix BaD circlejerk but Netflix has been making many good shows that go under people's radar.
Into the Night,Finally a date! Feels like it’s been forever.
Into the Night,"Ooooooooooh my god YES.

Had no hope for a second season but I was still hoping for it deep down."
Into the Night,Absolutely loved the first one but I feel like I won't like this season based on the trailer. Kinda like TWD when they introduced the Governor. Still going to watch it though.
Into the Night,Really liked S1. Curious how the writers deal with that finale to season 1 though lmao
Into the Night,"oh good, I was worried this was going to end up in the netflix garbage pile of one and done, god why are they producing so much garbage?"
Into the Night,This show is pretty mediocre but it's definitely entertaining
Into the Night,Finally!
Into the Night,2nd season was wildly disappointing.
Into the Night,"I'm part of the circlejerk but I loved this.

In general the European netflix stuff are better than the American ones in my experience."
Into the Night,It's possible Netflix only picks up the better quality productions so we only see the best from there.
Into the Night,"I really enjoyed the first season, curious how it will continue without being more of the same. I haven't read the book but apparently that get very weird and sci-fi-y, which the series hasn't been so far."
Into the Night,I loved the first season. They did a good job with a modest budget and kept the show entertaining.
Into the Night,"I watched the first season in like two days since its such fast paced Tv, but man its annoying having such big gaps between seasons in streaming services. I basically feel like I have to watch it again as I remember nothing. 

In future I may hold off on watching shows until a month before the final season is released that way I can binge with it all fresh in my memory."
Into the Night,"Highly recommend the first season for being a real entertaining binge despite being a little trashy. Maybe trashy isn't the right word, it's like a real good airport novel with a cheap premise that you can't stop reading.  
  
It felt pretty complete too, so even if season 2 doesn't get good reviews, just stick with s1 only then."
Into the Night,YAAS! I'm so excited for this. I loved the first season and loved it. Great storytelling and acting!
Into the Night,"This show was sooo fucking stupid but I enjoyed it for what it was. Not as good as Black Summer, imo, for your low budget, fast pace horror, but enjoyable enough."
Into the Night,Love the premise and thought they did well with it but less personal drama the better
Into the Night,"The acting was so bad in season 1, I can't believe they renewed it. Sylvie is truly the worst, I hope she took some acting lessons"
Into the Night,Nice. I enjoyed the first season. It’ll be interesting to see where they try to take the premise from here and if they can keep it interesting.
Into the Night,The book basically has a plot very similar to a videogame called Soma. The planes that survived are basically a b plot sort of unrelated to the main story. If the book was Lord of the rings the show would be the hobbit.
Into the Night,I really enjoyed S1 of Black Summer but couldn't get into S2.
Into the Night,">The book basically has a plot very similar to a videogame called Soma.

When you say this, this could mean a couple of things.  Do you mean the intial premise of the game and its setting or do you mean the philosophical concepts it grasps with and defines more clearly later in the game?  (trying not to spoil in case people reading havent palyed the game)  Also I havent seen the show but am looking for things to watch, hence why Im asking.


Edit:  nevermind i binged the first season"
Into the Night,"..... BOTH! Seriously, it's basically a  surface world SOMA like story. It has a lot of cool elements to it, which is probably why they didn't even need to adapt it directly and just took one of the plot hooks from the book (the planes). 

Also adapting the book directly would be about as expensive as adapting SOMA to tv (although the live action shorts we got were pretty damn good).

Edit * brain uploading, what it means to be alive, scanning memories of dead people, holding out hope that theres still a chance a dead Earth can be saved in some way, avoiding homicidal robot/brain scanned humans, are the main premises of the book. 

The book's characters are more software VS hardware however, while in SOMA the characters are more hardware than software."
Into the Night,"I just finished and it was so worth the time, the SUSPENSE!!! it was so good, glad I randomly clicked on that today. now i’ll be working on convincing all my friends to watch that show."
Into the Night,This is shlocky and ridiculous in the best way.
Into the Night,"This series was amazing, hoping they make another one . A bit random or did anyone elses heart break on the episode where they were explaining I think riks backstory (the old guy who is freinds with the Italian at the start); like Idk why but my heart just broke cause he sounded so eager and happy and it's clear it manipulation and like, my heart just broke for him there.

Also another point, how did that thing in the bag at the hospital survive, like does anyone have an explanation?"
Into the Night,"when they landed in brussels again and Sylvia was like ""ok, we have 2 and a half hours until sunrise. we need to get food, take them to the hospital, check out NATO, etc"" I realized this show would work so fucking well as a videogame"
Into the Night,"I agree they did a good job on the suspense, but I wish the characters were a bit more likable. Just like in Dutch series, they always are in a permanent state of nastiness. No jokes, always shouting and causing needless conflicts with each other for no reason. Apparently every human being put in a stressful situation acts like an ass."
Into the Night,"Reminded me very much of the Langoliers, I’d say a lot it taken from it. I too binged it all in one go."
Into the Night,Id be trying to get the plane to the arctic if it’s the right time of year for 24 hour darkness. There are researchers there and supplies.
Into the Night,"I think people hating the show is expecting too much. It's an entertaining and suspenseful thriller. It definitely isn't boring but it isn't the smartest show either. For you to enjoy the show, you have to take it as it is.

True enough it has its tropes, plotholes and unrealistic motivations but it definitely has good traits too, which makes it worth watching. For one, the pace is almost excellent. There's barely a dull moment. The show also establishes enough connection to some of its characters despite having a run time of barely 4 hours.

Sylvie was really great, and also the NATO guy, just hoped they gave more background on why he's such an ass/arse (a convincing one at that)"
Into the Night,I'm at episode 4. Havnt stopped other than the toilet breaks. Fast paced. Very good show!
Into the Night,"Can someone tell me, without getting into too many spoilers, whether it is completely about the plane and people on it? In the book this is supposedly based on, the plot of a plane running from the sun is a very minor plot thread, so I'm very curious how much of the source material it retains."
Into the Night,Seems like they made a series about SCP-001 (When The Day Breaks)
Into the Night,"I really hope they can continue the story

But I don't think it will be able to match the ""pace"" of 1-6, especially since it involved a plane against time zones

I wonder ultimately how this huge problem could resolve.  We are talking about the sun here.  Maybe some kind of vaccine?"
Into the Night,A lot of political points been made here. Like the brits all being characterised as absolute dicks.
Into the Night,Loved it. I started the first episode and couldn't stop watching until I finished the whole season. Hoping they make a second one. 😩
Into the Night,"Ok, despite some pretty questionable science *suspension of disbelief* i loved this show, built tension fantastically.

My one complaint is the timeline. Because, I'm sorry, we followed them on leapfrog to leapfrog. They went around the world once. Brussels>Scotland>Canada>Alaska>Brussels before doubling back to Bulgaria.

If they stayed out of the sun the entire time, that means the whole thing happened within a 24 hour period.

Yet it's not presented that way at all, at the end the soldier even states they've been ""running from the sun for a week""

PRETTY big oversight if you ask me.

And given how often they were sweating over whether their fuel would even get the to the next airport even, i doubt they were  doing a loop of the planet between each pit stop."
Into the Night,"So did Sylvie basically kill Terenzio  ?

I don't understand if he had a chance to live if the others arrived a little quicker

Or basically she left him to die for leaving  Ayaz  to die

End of the day even though Terenzio was an azzhole, he was part of the process to save these people lives

I guess if there are any fans of his,  they would feel jipped

I don't think he survived the sunlight, but who  the heck knows  (the way this series is going)."
Into the Night,"I see it's based on a book The Old Axolotl, but when I read what the book is about, the show and the book are two different unrelated things.   


Is there a plane flying west in the book at all? Or were they just inspired by the ""sun killing people"" and came up with a completely new story but had to give credit to the writer?  


I don't really see the show playing out according to what's in the book, so I guess they just took one small idea and have to give the credit for legal reasons or whatever."
Into the Night,I really liked this. All these people....and none too cliched
Into the Night,"Langoliers meets Lost. I enjoyed it thoroughly, although critically...it's cliché in every way."
Into the Night,My husband and I love it! We just finished it a few minutes ago and we're impressed with how fast paced it was and the short length of each episode. Hopefully there will be a season 2.
Into the Night,"I always get frustrated when I see how little people know about Iceland when they are making films that happen in Iceland or around Icelandic people. Like in the first episode of this show they fly to what they call Reykjavik airport, which is what Keflavik airport is called in the International airport discussions, but in reality there are two airports you can use to land most commercial flights. The airplane they use in this show is small enough to land in either Keflavik or Reykjavik and you would most likely be able to land it also in Akureyri and Egilsstadir. Akureyri and Egilsstadir is only about 45 to 60 minutes from Reykjavik, so there were plenty of options, but as usual they make these show without doing proper research. I think they need to spend just a little bit more money to get the facts right. I think the same must be the case for many other countries. I have noticed some faults in some of their work in other European countries and in other areas also. Please do your research and then write the plot around that. I´m only on the first episode. It does look promising though besides the faults."
Into the Night,They didn’t explain how there was a possum in the backpack after the sun killed everything
Into the Night,"I'm almost finished with episode 5.

I really like the show, but I think there are some big problems that I kept noticing...

1. The timing. The show doesn't really give us much information on the timescale, and going from the Aelutians to Brussels in what feels like only a minute is weird. Not to mention that everything crazy happens at the same time, like there'll be some downtime and then ***LITERALLY EVERYTHING HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE***. Some call it suspense, I call it bad timing
2. The computers. Now, granted, they may explain this in the last 5 minutes of episode 5 or episode 6, but if this massive burst of ionizing radiation hits the earth due to the sun's polarity, and it changes the mollecular structure of a bunch of shit (granted, they say it affects carbon based shit, BUT) all it takes is a half-decent magnet to completely scramble HDDs. There is NO way *any* of those computers could still work.
3. Wouldn't the radiation bounce all the way around the planet because of the greenhouse effect? Instead of just hitting the parts in daylight.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but these flaws kept eating at me as I watched."
Into the Night,"I have this strange feeling the whole thing is a metaphor for the EU. A plane on a journey to nowhere. A world in disorder. Radical climate change. Internal anarchy and demands for ""democracy"". The xenophobic fear of brown ""others"" (the Turk, the Muslim). Crime and smuggling across borders (the emeralds in the kid's stomach, the rapes and murders in Afghanistan). Italian populist. Dutch populist. A technocratic leadership (the French pilot). British bad guy(s) being booted off the plane (Brexit). I wonder why there isn't a German among the crew."
Into the Night,[deleted]
Into the Night,"Okay but, Terenzio 😭 He's my favorite character."
Into the Night,"This was awful.

Poor acting
Poor writing
Beyond unrealistic

I like sci Fi, I like end of the world, shit I like Snowpiercer, I like b movies...there is nothing likeable here."
Into the Night,"Did anyone notice that an Airbus 320 ( the plane in the film) can't fly at 1000mph?

So it's impossible to run from the sun more than 11h maybe...Complete nonsense. ..."
Into the Night,"The most thrilling new show I've seen in a while. Really fascinating concept, and as others have mentioned a little bit of a LOST vibe in terms of the characters and how they interact with each other. Only problem is it's on Netflix, who absolutely love cancelling shows before giving them a proper run. 0 idea if we will get a Season 2, and even if we do, will be a long time waiting possibly.  


Such a promising show, such a shame that only 6 episodes long...:("
Into the Night,"It was a fun show. Definitely some elements of Lost, especially with the way the first season ended. I enjoyed it a lot, pretty damn good. It was fun and the tension at the end of episode 6 was great.  Watched ot all in one. Deserves a second season."
Into the Night,"One of the best series that I think Netflix has produced. The beginning was just pure excitement, I had goose bumps and then looked through the whole masterpiece in one piece. I liked the development of the characters best - how you could get to know everyone. Matthieu and Ayaz were just great. You could really just watch the whole time. The whole series really conveyed a mood. Hats off to the director, actors and of course screenwriters."
Into the Night,"I'm finding it really bad, the script is awful, the acting is terrible, I want to like it, the premise is interesting but the dialogue is so janky and the characters are one dimensional/idiotic.
Love the kid who walks onto the plane and just says ""I am going to Moscow to have my surgery."" Sits down.
What?"
Into the Night,"Good show overall. 

Some stupid plot holes. Like the ending... Terenzio didn't need to stand there. Just wedge the rock he found into the gate. I've done that before to keep a gate open. It won't pulverize the rock.

Also, if Terenzio is dead, Sylvie needs to go down for murder. Terenzio had every right to slap Ayaz after Ayaz put hands on him. If his sentence is death for trying to abandon someone who started a fight with him, she deserves worse for actual murder.

I hope I'm wrong, but my gut says she will get a pussy pass. So lame."
Into the Night,[deleted]
Into the Night,"Started this yesterday, and 3 episodes in I'm really liking the concept but the melodrama is a bit meh. Will stick with it though."
Into the Night,Will there be episode 7?
Into the Night,"Great weekend watch! I went in expecting nothing and was pleasantly surprised. I do speak French, but even if I didn't, i don't get how anyone could watch dubs. I tried it for a minute and it totally takes you out of the show."
Into the Night,DO you guys think that this kind of story would happen one day? Like the sun killing u and stuff?
Into the Night,does season 1 end on a cliffhanger?  i'm debating on whether to watch it or not. i am a bit tired of shows/seasons ending on cliffhangers that never get resolved (due to a show being cancelled or whatever).
Into the Night,"An excellent, fast paced series. Somewhat old-school, like the Langoliers except far, far better paced. Some hiccups with the scientific/timing continuity, but overall excellent.

The biggest question I have is just the time. The soldier at the end said they had been running for a week, while it seemed from my keeping track that they flew around the world once, avoiding sunrise essentially for one rotation of the earth... i.e. one day. 

Small thing, but kinda weird to screw up."
Into the Night,"Just finished watching this. Thought it was a lot of fun as long as you don't overthink the plot or character motivations. 

It came across as a cartoon sketch of EU sensibilities to the point it was comical. Every character is some godawful stereotype or anti-stereotype. America was destroyed without a second thought within minutes of the first episode and every single [spoiler](#s ""Brit was either a murderer or a rapist. Every one. Like even the one they showed in the Turk's brothel."")

Not an award winning show but great for what I imagine was a very tight budget and a aimed at a much pickier EU audience."
Into the Night,"They did my man Ayaz dirty

Edit: oh wait THANK GOD!!!!"
Into the Night,"Why (after they flew over Keflavic airport in Iceland didn't they head north and land in Isafuda.(wrong spelling) 

Long enough runway and it'd be empty."
Into the Night,"I really loved the series mainly due to its fast paced nature. They still left a lot of things uncovered, which I assume would be covered in next season. But I do have a feeling, the coming seasons won't be as fast paced as this."
Into the Night,Sylvie is a fucking bitch
Into the Night,What is the object the Russian mom wanted to bring while getting out of the plane despite the counter indication in the last episode ?
Into the Night,What message did Gabrielle sent to Ines?
Into the Night,I think sylvie must die
Into the Night,"Good show, dubbing could be better, can’t wait for more"
Into the Night,"I posted this into another thread.  I am still watching but I was looking for an insight that might convince me to finish.  I do love the soundtrack, though.

Im about 4 episodes in. I gotta say, I really want to like this show.  Haven't been this excited for a airplane-based thriller drama since The Langoliers.

But there is just soooooo many plot and character mistakes.   Almost every single passenger puts their immediate emotional needs before prospects of survival.  They even make an airport stop and took the time to have a pointless ""trial"" of sorts.  Every freaking time someone should shut down there emotions for just a few minutes to ensure survivability of everyone they don't and they explode endangering everyone in the moment. Except when it comes to the fact that the entire world is dead, they seem to forget that quite often.

And every passenger either has huge baggage or dies off fairly quickly and nonchalantly.  It's like Lost but stuck in a plane instead of crashing a plane.  They even do the flashback, pre-disaster clips of each character.  And there is just no point to it.

But where it really lacks is the survival element.  Fuel is magically no problem, but no one is a fueler, fuel trucks are apparently readily available and full even though they have as little as twenty minutes between landing and take off.  The medical emergencies are kinda dumb and too frequent.  There is something about irradiated food, but they just blow passed it, even after taking the time foreshadow the problem.

Every airplane trope is used and not much is original.  The breach in the window and air mask gag, inexperienced pilot landing plane, landing gear problems, turbulence intensity that makes no sense, applause after a rough landing, magically known timelines for every problem, I am just waiting for them to have a fuel leak.

Hahahaha. It turns out the fuel is ""organic"" because it's carbon-based.  Must be susceptible to the same radiation that makes fruit taste like nothing and thus makes the fuel not work.  So fucking stupid.

I'm not going to make it to the end of this series.  Everytime I get a little excited or endeared, the pay off is just so unsatisfying."
Into the Night,"The one dimensional characters, terrible script, and unexplored overarching theme made this so difficult to watch. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Into the Night,"It's really not a good show. So basic, really no character developments at all, some pretty hilariously bad moments I found myself laughing out of load. Corny ending each episode...""into the night"" 🙄"
Into the Night,Is it actually good like Lost? Because the description literally says it’s another Lost but I don’t want to be disappointed.
Into the Night,"why did they not land at a place the sun hadn't risen yet?
Areas like the far north or south that have extended periods of dark."
Into the Night,"I was in the same boat! Randomly clicked it on yesterday and binged the whole thing in one evening. It was a little silly at times, but for the most part has a great LOST vibe to it"
Into the Night,"Now, the renewal depends on how many watches it..."
Into the Night,"Absolutely my view too. In the so bad it's good category, some of it literally made me laugh when it obviously was not trying to. But I'm really enjoying it!"
Into the Night,Yeah i think that's the most generous way to put it. Pretty accurate summary.
Into the Night,">how did that thing in the bag at the hospital survive, like does anyone have an explanation?


I felt like they deliberately focussed on that but left it ambiguous, maybe an explanation in season 2?"
Into the Night,Yeah I felt bad for Rik... he seemed like a self important rich guy until you see his back story living with his mom in an apartment chatting to a lady online in his room getting ghosted...
Into the Night,"Yep, one of the loop hole I am wondering, they showed a dead bird but the rodent is alive."
Into the Night,"I also want to mention the cosmonaut, and how that didn't really get explained?

I did really enjoy the series, but there were some points where the writing seemed to slip."
Into the Night,Could be another set of survivors that came by during the night on the same day. Or ones that are living in an underground/underwater shelter and came up.

Into the Night,"Looked like a possum. Based on the subsequent ""he doesn't lie"" scene it should have gone somewhere in this season and it just didn't."
Into the Night,Oh my spot on mate. Thats a solid idea.
Into the Night,I don't get it. How would it work as a video game? What would the gameplay be?
Into the Night,It's clear they didn't have to wait for the bags to be offloaded.
Into the Night,"> I wish the characters were a bit more likable. Just like in Dutch series, they always are in a permanent state of nastiness. No jokes, always shouting and causing needless conflicts with each other for no reason.

Thank you. I actually created a thread about European shows having shitty characters and got downvoted to death, but I'm glad I'm not the only who thinks this."
Into the Night,"Having never seen a Dutch series thank you for mentioning this. This is something I noticed and just couldn't understand why they kept arguing! Constantly, over perceived slights!"
Into the Night,which Dutch series do you recommend?
Into the Night,Especially when they start complaining about the food
Into the Night,"A big part of the reason why I ate this series up, I watched The Langoliers as a kid when it was first broadcast and I've loved post-apocalyptic survival stories ever since. This was right up my alley."
Oh Yuck,This looks really generic
Oh Yuck,Wonder how the one with Greta Gerwig would have gone down.
Oh Yuck,"Oh my, this is going to sink. Not one joke was even remotely funny"
Oh Yuck,I would've actually preferred a laugh track in this trailer.
Oh Yuck,"To be honest, I will give this a chance, Happy Endings trailer was bland and it ended up to be one of my favorite sitcoms in past couple years.

Sitcom like this need like 3-4 episodes to see if their chemistry are working or not."
Oh Yuck,"So there's no laugh track, but it's still filmed in a multi-cam style. That's kinda weird."
Oh Yuck,I think my biggest issue is that everyone looks like models when how I met your mother felt like a real down to earth friends group for the most part.
Oh Yuck,"It’s got potential I guess, but it already looks a little too much like the original. I like the idea of keeping the same bar scene but even the characters are more or less the same tropes. And someone else said it already, but having 100% models as your cast just sucks the reality out of the sitcom. But who knows, it might be funny."
Oh Yuck,Wouldn’t be surprised if this is Cancelled after one season
Oh Yuck,"Ok, just tell me which character is dead."
Oh Yuck,"It seems too much like those kids shows that come on disney+. Ott reactions, bland jokes and an unlikely multi-cultural yet devoid of personality characters.

I'll watch it cause I did like himym series as whole. The jokes used to land.

I'm not very optimistic for this though"
Oh Yuck,"Oh man, this is gonna crash and burn so hard.

You can't just do the same show again 15 years later and call it a day. None of the trailer characters seemed to have the charm of Barney, who frankly kept HIMYM alive past Season 1."
Oh Yuck,"Man, that was bad

Not a single slightly funny joke on almost 2 minuts"
Oh Yuck,"Oh, yuck."
Oh Yuck,Kim Cattrall??
Oh Yuck,"Duff is not a good actress. 

Francia Raisa (Adrian from Secret Life of The American Teenager) should have been the lead"
Oh Yuck,"While I didn't think this was particularly funny, I still have a soft spot for Hilary Duff from the Lizzie Maguire days so I'll probably give this a try if it drops on Disney+ here."
Oh Yuck,"I don't see any standouts here at all.  The original was literally carried by NPH and Jason Segel.  There is none of that here at all.  You can't really capture lighting in a bottle, and you definitely can't do it if you don't actually spend money on the cast. I don't know who any of these people are besides Hillary Duff."
Oh Yuck,"I'll watch it for Piz, but that's it."
Oh Yuck,"Im just going to imagine that this is the Lizzie Maguire reboot that got canned ;,("
Oh Yuck,Looking forward to it!
Oh Yuck,Kind of surprising that they showed the narrator instead of being off screen like Bob Saget.
Oh Yuck,I wonder if this show will try for its own catchphrase.
Oh Yuck,I’m gonna stick with Letterkenny
Oh Yuck,I think I puked a bit.
Oh Yuck,"Chris Lowell, you deserve better than this. Glow getting cancelled still hurts."
Oh Yuck,I figure 7/10 episodes air before it's cancelled and the remaining only come out after streaming.
Oh Yuck,Looks like Kim Cattrall  will be available for the new sex and city
Oh Yuck,Cancel it already
Oh Yuck,"HIMYM has not aged well, and this looks way to similar in tone lol. i can deal with the familiar tropes (the annoyingly in love couple, the best friend who is clearly into Lizzie), but was hoping for better writing. ill give a few episodes a shot, but this trailer doesnt strike much confidence"
Oh Yuck,Where is the creativity? Sequels and prequels. You know this is television because Hillary Duff could wear a trash bag taking her trash down to the road in the morning and fifteen dudes would ask her out.
Oh Yuck,[removed]
Oh Yuck,"So is that supposed to be the mother version of HIMYM? Because they could have at least chosen the same actress or someone resembling her. Also, include elements of her (the yellow umbrella, her music...). Set it in the correct time period (Snapchat, Tinder and such didn't exist when HIMYM was happening). Also cast non-model actors (HIMYM had hot people but they still looked normal)

Also, I don't know if the show is truly terrible but this was definitively an awful trailer.

EDIT : So they clearly say it's 2022 after a rewatch so it's not linked to HIMYM at all except the name/concept. What is that?"
Oh Yuck,"""We can still make bad choices for a few more years.""

\-- The writers of HIMYM c season 3, which is why I won't be watching this one."
Oh Yuck,A woke version of How I Met Your Mother... awesome..
Oh Yuck,"How I Met Your Mother was only a success because the cast elevated the material.

It's VERY telling that The Goodwin Games bombed because it had a less talented essemble."
Oh Yuck,"The lighting and sets look bad/cheap, and the cast looks like an improv group. Wizards of Waverly Place had this kind of production value, but with a more charismatic cast.

I wonder if this is actually just the vehicle that Hillary Duff wanted Lizzie Maguire: Sex in the City to be."
Oh Yuck,I was holding out hope but now the hope is diminishing that this will even be decent
Oh Yuck,"The whole cast looks like porn actors. And not the ones engaging in some artsy amateur porn. They all look like big studio porn actors where the guys are full of amphetamins and other performance enhancing drugs and the girls filled with silicone from butt to lips.



One thing that was nice with How i met your mother was the cast looked normal and relatable. Were they attractive? Sure, but not all the time and not in a model surreal way."
Oh Yuck,It does.
Oh Yuck,Thank god it didn’t. Gerwig stuck on a sitcom instead of making great movies sounds like a horrible timeline.
Oh Yuck,i quite liked that pilot tbh. this trailer is alright but we'll see.
Oh Yuck,"It gave me ""Horace and Pete"" vibes but I do recall that HIMYM was written like a single-camera comedy and they wanted to keep that approach."
Oh Yuck,I don't think they will start audience screenings until the season is wrapped.
Oh Yuck,"Aside from the best friend guy and maybe Hillary, everyone else looks like they'd be the hook ups or would date a main character for a few episodes."
Oh Yuck,The HIMYM cast looked like the pretty people you would expect in a tv cast too. It's definitely too soon to judge if this group feels like a real friend group considering that the trailer is a lot of short snippets.
Oh Yuck,Yeah hard to believe she can't find someone lol
Oh Yuck,"It's a woke melennial casting. One of each color and good looking. No normies or next door types.

Because every group of personal friends is a multitude of ethnicities and genders and woke, but make sure the white male is incompetent."
Oh Yuck,It's just kinda sad how these production companies just go down the checklist there days when assembling the cast. The final product always feels soulless.
Oh Yuck,Right? Did no one learn from That 80s Show
Oh Yuck,Understatement of the year.
Oh Yuck,She was ok in younger
Oh Yuck,She’s really terrible. And a bad singer too. I don’t understand her career at all.
Oh Yuck,It's on Hulu.
Oh Yuck,You're forgetting the biggest character of all though. \*spins around\* New York City.
Oh Yuck,Not aged well? How so? I fucking hate that phrase.
Oh Yuck,[deleted]
Oh Yuck,Is not like himym was really original
Oh Yuck,"I don't think finding someone to sleep with is her problem. It's finding ""the one"" like in the original show (it's not like Ted had any problems finding girls to sleep with, he had a lot of very hot girlfriends and one-night stand across the years)"
Oh Yuck,I didn't even realize that was her. lmao
Oh Yuck,"so do us blacks not live in NYC? last i checked, it was a very diverse city, that is the last thing to complain about in this trailer"
Oh Yuck,"In theory, a slightly meta comedic love story told from the perspective of an unreliable narrator is a fun idea that shouldn't be limited to just the existence of HIMYM.

At one point in time CBS wanted to use this formula to create another show, but it fell through, and so now Hulu is using the formula to try to create another show. And since the creators of the original show are producers on this (though not the main creators of this), they're using the same director, some of the same settings, and have hinted that they want to include certain elements/characters from HIMYM in their story, it is being made as a HIMYM reimagining/reboot that takes place in the same universe as the original."
Oh Yuck,"It’s just a reboot, not sure what’s so perplexing about that."
Oh Yuck,Have you seen the last season of the show. They show it from the perspective of Tracy in one episode
Oh Yuck,what does woke mean?
Oh Yuck,You snowflakes are so annoying jfc
Oh Yuck,"It looks exactly as cheap as How I Met Your Mother, except without talented and established actors"
Oh Yuck,"Cast looks like porn studio actors, at least improv group actors would be relatable, but here, yikes..."
Oh Yuck,"They all seem to have one personality, be happy. I'm not gonna give the pilot a try since this show will just be cancelled soon"
Oh Yuck,"Well 

>They all look like big studio porn actors where the guys are full of amphetamins and other performance enhancing drugs

That's what they think are ""average"" city guys. And of course they're doctors, band members and marine biologists."
Oh Yuck,"> The HIMYM cast looked like the pretty people you would expect in a tv cast too

Nah, not really. None of the 5 are any great beauty and I'd outright say Ted and Marshall looked like average people.

Honestly only Robin/Cobie Smulders looked really pretty out of them."
Oh Yuck,"Yeah it is. They don't take into consideration how the cast interact with each other.

We gotta have one black one asian/latino one gay one loud mouth and one quiet one

I'd love to know the casting process on the great shows of the past"
Oh Yuck,"In fairness, the Golden God was in that, but he hadn't even begun to peak."
Oh Yuck,"well good for Hulu, wont last long. Be shocked if it makes a second season."
Oh Yuck,The “not like other girls” trope with female characters like Lily and Robin springs to mind.
Oh Yuck,"its a show from the mid 00s and feels like it. the whole character of barney would not fly today as he was back in 2005

the lizzie and josh version feels like that , without the raunch, so not a good sign imo"
Oh Yuck,There was a lot of casual transphobia in that show
Oh Yuck,It wouldn’t. You can insult your audience or potential audience with that line of creativity.
Oh Yuck,No I have no problem with it. My problem is they will be shoe horned in to appease. If they are done well then fine but I highly doubt it
Oh Yuck,No I have no problem with it. My problem is they will be shoe horned in to appease. If they are done well then fine but I highly doubt it
Oh Yuck,"Yeah I said this when the announcement first dropped. HIMYM had a lot of specific features that could be used as a formula to guarantee modest success in a reboot, like the masses of running gags, a Barney character that constantly defines the structural underpinnings of dating and sex,  and the narration by a future version of the main character. The ability to drop characters/places/events from the original is just a bonus (and a dangerous crutch to rely on early).

This _could_ be a good show. It certainly doesn’t look like it, because every character seemed the odd combination of too-good looking, not funny, fake, and having the high energy of an improv group. While I feel like I could see myself being friends with every character in HIMYM, I just don’t see any of these new characters being someone I could enjoy spending time with."
Oh Yuck,I guess it means showing women and people of color.
Oh Yuck,Anything that's more than white straight men.
Oh Yuck,"She says sorry in the first episode for suggesting that having sex with dozens of Tinder dates is not 100% OK. I'm not kidding. She says that she had 87 Tinder dates that year (87!) and that she didn't had sex with all of them but that THERE'S NOTHING WRONG with having sex with all.

Woke to the infinite degree.

Vomitive."
Oh Yuck,This is a group that takes and gets their Prozac in bulk
Oh Yuck,Neil Patrick Harris is a beautiful man and Alyson Hannigan is radiant.
Oh Yuck,"> The “not like other girls” trope

What does that mean, exactly?"
Oh Yuck,Don't know why you are being downvoted. Lying and tricking women to have sex with you does not go well on TV today lol.
Oh Yuck,Many guys nowadays still talk like Barney and mostly act like him. They just don’t do it around women to give the facade that they are better
Oh Yuck,"Would not fly today? That character is still dating everywhere. Do we have to make tv shows  that are not real? I think its aged pretty well. The only thing that didn't age well is the finale, but thats only because it was suppose to be the finale after season two or three and with the show dragging and forcing new storylines, it didn't work."
Oh Yuck,I mean this looks awful bit HIMYM still hold up. It is a sad state of affairs if Barney would not fly today. However I think you are wrong.
Oh Yuck,Oh fuck off.
Oh Yuck,what?
Oh Yuck,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NXSsNKAXL._SX450_.jpg

if you saw this guy on the street and he wasn't famous you wouldn't turn your head"
Oh Yuck,"They're portrayed as ""cool"" at the expense of making fun of other women, like ""name that skank"" and ""woo girls"". Basucally the seperation of dumb women it's ok to lie to for sex and the women you can respect, ie Lily and Robin and the mother."
Oh Yuck,Having personalities outside of whatever man they're with.
Oh Yuck,"No, not in the same number that they used to would have, and the, “not around women” part is because it’s no longer socially accepted behavior"
Oh Yuck,"most of his arcs in the early seasons involves how to trick women into sleeping with him lol. thats like, his entire character- Suits, His mystery super job, and his pick up artist like moves for women."
Oh Yuck,You asked
Oh Yuck,"As you read.

She says to her Tinder date (a black man that she is stalking to an airport) that she had 87 Tinder dates in one year. That  she didn't had sex with all of them. But that having sex with 87 tinder dates is nothing to be ashamed off.

Nuke it from space."
The Victims Game,Looks nice. Will be adding this to my list.
The Victims Game,"I don’t necessarily agree that a movie/book whatever shouldn’t be made because it tells a painful story. But if the resultant media feels pointless or exploitative, people are going to complain about it.

Why are they pretending they had noble intentions for it? That makes it so much worse. Why not just acknowledge that the story felt very cinematic and you had the budget to tell it long-form? You can’t have it both ways."
The Victims Game,Remember 10 years ago when every time he would ask an artist if he could use their music on Glee and they said no he would scream “fuck the Kings of Leon” at the nearest Hollywood journalist? Nice to see he hasn’t matured a bit and still can’t take rejection
The Victims Game,"He also talks about wanting to pay for a memorial to honor the victims.

But it would end up being an attraction where people take artsy Instagram photos, specially for creeps who glorify serial killers."
The Victims Game,Because I'm sure the families want to be reminded of what happened to their children over and over again.
The Victims Game,"Their silence was the response, Ryan."
The Victims Game,"Why should they? Why should they respond to the millionth attempt to exploit one of the worst things that has ever happened to them for profit? Why should they respond to someone creating a film about the brutal rape and murder of their child, their brother, their friend, from the *murderers point of view.* What can they say to the next overzealous director who has no sympathy for them and is just reaching out for public perception? But thank god we can now see the 30th conventionally attractive white man play someone has brutally assaulted, murdered, dismembered, and then bragged about killing someone you *knew,* someone that you *love.* And watch as people around the internet fawn over you child’s pain, say that they “weren’t even scared by it.” That some people are *fucking rooting* for this monster and your brother to have *ended up together.* And when you ask these directors and studios to stop, beg them to let you be, to stop tearing open this wound of grief, they come back with this bullshit of having spoken to families, that they “care.” Fuck this guy."
The Victims Game,have there not been like 18 Dahmer movies already?
The Victims Game,Ryan Murphy is the National Enquirer of scripted television
The Victims Game,"soooo ... turns the families and friends who lost a loved one to a serial killer were maybe not thrlled about reliving the trauma for the benefit of a purient netflix series?

what a shock."
The Victims Game,"""Heeeey, Ryan Murphy here, Glee, AHS. Yeah, so we've got a really exciting project with Netflix that exploits the pain and suffering of your loved ones for some real B grade entertainment. Maybe you'd be into helping us make it gruesomely detailed. Tell me, did your 14 brother have any hopes or dreams that were snuffed out with him, or was he just into being sex canniballed?"
The Victims Game,Because they were horrified you wanted to turn their worst nightmare into entertainment
The Victims Game,"Murphy:

>”It’s something that we researched for a very long time, and we, over the course of the three, three and a half years when we were really writing it, working on it, we reached out to 20, around 20 of the victims’ families and friends trying to get input, trying to talk to people and not a single person responded to us in that process. So we relied very, very heavily on our incredible group of researchers who… I don’t even know how they found a lot of this stuff. But it was just like a night and day effort to us trying to uncover the truth of these people.”

>”Something that we talked a lot in the making of it is we weren’t so much interested in Jeffrey Dahmer, the person, but what made him the monster that he became. We talked a lot about that… and we talked about it all the time. It’s really about white privilege. It’s about systemic racism. It’s about homophobia.”"
The Victims Game,"""Hey, im a complete stranger, but do you remember how your kid was tortured, murdered, raped and eaten by a serial killer all those years ago? Lets talk about that. His corpse was used as a sex toy i believe ...hello? Hello!?""

He is trying to profit off the tragedy of people who lost their family members. They obviously dont want anything to do with that or to be reminded of it.   
Wtf did this guy expect, they dont owe him an explanation or response."
The Victims Game,"The victims’ families weren’t required to do anything. Perhaps they didn’t trust Murphy’s intentions or they just didn’t want to be involved. That was their prerogative, and no one else’s. And while I have watched documentaries about Dahmer, I wasn’t into watching a whole dramatic series about him. That just hits different."
The Victims Game,"Maybe...JUST maybe the friends and family of the victims had no interest in dredging up some incredibly painful memories just so someone can earn a buck off it, I don't know just a thought."
The Victims Game,You're profiting off the murder of people they loved. They owe you nothing you piece of shit.
The Victims Game,"well, no shit that no one responded...  imagine having to relive this over and over again because some people have nothing else to watch on TV."
The Victims Game,Updated headline: murder victims’ families would rather try to heal and move on than be exploited by Hollywood exec
The Victims Game,Why would they?
The Victims Game,I wonder how many “didn’t respond” by telling him to fuck off.
The Victims Game,"The same Ryan Murphy that made a speculative fiction “Anne Frank, secret survivor” who ends up in an asylum in American Horror Story? I find that hard to believe. He’s usually so tactful."
The Victims Game,"What a psycho. Acting like he’s the first one trying to reach out to the victims families. These people were murdered 50 years ago. Lots of people have reached out to these families in the past 50 years. Does he not realize that all of theses families have been hounded by people like him ever since their loved one was brutally tortured and murdered, and that every time someone reaches out to them it’s a reminder of that trauma, the families being re-traumatized every time. That these victims were people, that had lives, and are now mostly remembered as being the victims of Jeffery Dahmer, and not the actual people and lives that they had before their murders. Come on. Everyone wants to use the families, no one wants to pay them. No one wants to tell their stories. They all want to worship And tell the story of the psychopath that killed them."
The Victims Game,"He made a show about a thing that happened that everyone knows happened including the names of the victims. Do victims or their families get right of refusal or something by law? I actually know someone whose family member was murdered by the killer portrayed in The Good Nurse. Their complaint starts with the way the killer is portrayed, then they talk about trauma, then they talk about how they should get money from the film. Yeah, that last one is the key."
The Victims Game,"TBC I haven't watched this show but, can someone explain to me: morally speaking, whats the difference between the Dahmer series and the show Mindhunter (wich i have seen and reddit loves). Or any of the other serial killer focused media that people eat up on a daily basis? Murder podcasts, true crime, TV series etc. All of a sudden People seem to think this series is going too far. Why?"
The Victims Game,Yeah why would you want to rehash a horrific family tragedy with some tv show runner.
The Victims Game,Yeah duh they want to stop being reminded of their trauma
The Victims Game,"No shit, leave them the fuck alone"
The Victims Game,This guy's a dick
The Victims Game,Unpopular opinion: I thought this series told us a lot about the victims and was respectful and kind. They showed more of the victims' point of view than other Dahmer things I've seen or read.
The Victims Game,Kinda funny seeing everyone be against this series in this thread when its been like the most streamed thing this year. So either some people are lying or the small pocket of people who didn’t watch it have made their way into this post.
The Victims Game,"I am getting hugely sick of all the people commenting about what they THINK this show is about when they didn’t actually watch it. Whether or not you think it should have been made is one thing, but don’t pretend that you know the content if you didn’t watch it. It does not glorify Dahmer. It doesn’t make him sexy or attractive. It doesnt make the viewer sympathize with him. You sympathize with the victims, their family’s, Glenda and everyone that tried to stop him. It fills you with rage against the racism, homophobia and inept police that allowed him to continue his crimes. It highlights the injustice. It’s heart-breaking for a purpose."
The Victims Game,"I mean the fact that they didn't respond should tell him all he needs to know. I'm sure many of the family members of the victims are still plenty pissed off because, like John Wayne Gacy, the police kinda didn't care about the people Dahmer was killing. Transients, often gay prostitutes, who they assumed just passed on through or were victims of their own lifestyles."
The Victims Game,"Of course not, Dick. You were contacting them to see how they would feel about you making a movie of the most insanely devastating thing to ever happen to them. Contacting them to see if they wanted to partake in you paying homage to the fckn psycho that destroyed their lives for a buck…are you surprised they didn’t respond? FFS!

FOR YEARS THEY DIDN’T RESPOND. That should’ve been your first clue.
This story did not need to be retold. 

The morbid curiosity and glorification of fiends is something I’ll never understand."
The Victims Game,Perhaps that was enough reason not to do that shit?
The Victims Game,Gee I wonder why???
The Victims Game,"Wait, the same Ryan Murphy who created GLEE a toxic workplace with many people hating him?"
The Victims Game,Ryan Murphy just stays Ryan Murphying. Gross.
The Victims Game,"""For some reason, these people didn't want to talk to us about the tv show we're making with a focus on the guy who murdered their loved ones. Weird.""

Also thank God someone finally pointed out that white privilege was behind Dahmer's murders. Here I was, the fool, thinking he was a crazy person. Now I can rest soundly knowing he was just a white male oppressor."
The Victims Game,Ryan are you saying silence equals consent?
The Victims Game,"I still have no idea why this movie is causing such a fuss.

This isn’t the first bio-project about a serial killer. It’s not even the first project focused on Dahmer.

He was properly shown as a fucking monster rather than some kind of romantic portrayal that tried to humanize him.

It also properly showed that no one at the time gave a flying fuck about dark skinned gay men, and it was a total failure of the police that let him operate for so long."
The Victims Game,"Because they have the right to not respond to this kind of traumatic fucked up thing that is being glorified onscreen, Ryan. Have you ever thought about that?"
The Victims Game,"Hot take: I don’t think people really care that much about this show, I think a lot of this is fake outrage for people to virtue signal about. Some people started rallying against this show now everyone dogpiles on it because it’s a safe and acceptable opinion to act upset about it and show how morally superior you all are.

I call bullshit. Can anyone tell me how this show is substantially different than any of the other hundreds of true crime related content out there? Oh is this show glitzy and sexy and doesn’t wag it’s finger at the criminal enough for your liking? Nobody cares, people consume this stuff not to learn “oh my gosh these people were some real bad apples!” They consume it because it’s interesting and exciting and taboo and weird. 

But yeah whatever keep the circlejerk alive yah hypocrites."
The Victims Game,"I don't necessarily think you need the opinions of the victims to tell stories like these. I definitely think you need to be careful and respectful to the victims and the truth of what happens, but I think it's okay to tell that story 30 years later in a drama form. It was very hard to watch in some scenes, but I think that's the point they were trying to get across because this shouldn't be something easy to swallow.

I understand that there's some fictional pieces to this story that made it easier to digest, but I don't think it's any worse than something like Chernobyl which also saw a lot of innocent lives taken. Some of those victims and their families are alive today."
The Victims Game,So Weird that the victim’s families don’t want to revisit that horrific trauma? just so your entertainment can be more accurate.
The Victims Game,"They don’t have to respond, a person can still make their series, they could still not like it."
The Victims Game,"Their kids were cannibalized, of course they didn’t want to talk to you."
The Victims Game,"People who went through an EXTREMELY traumatic experience dont respond to, well known dickhead, about said  traumtic experience. Dickhead is only one shocked."
The Victims Game,"As someone who watched it and thought it was well done, it really did feel unnecessary and maybe even dangerous. If 20 of the victims families want nothing to do with the project maybe that’s a sign that you shouldn’t do the project lol"
The Victims Game,What a fucking ghoul.
The Victims Game,I always hate to see shows like this become number 1 on trending in netflix
The Victims Game,Why the hell would they or should they?
The Victims Game,Imagine that
The Victims Game,So i said fuck em anyway!
The Victims Game,Fucking moron
The Victims Game,"Well no shit buddy, they’re tired."
The Victims Game,I think...think *was* the response
The Victims Game,"Judging from the viewership and the Nielsen ratings this series is getting it shows people all over the world wanted to know more about Dahmer and his crimes. A ton of you here are acting like ignorant asses and that the only ones watching are young female Americans. Sorry to the families of these victims but if they answered verbally or in writing at the producers requests for accurate feedback then they could see a more reliable story of truth about the victims. If those family members didn't make a spectacle of themselves for the public to see at the hearings, then they wouldn't see themselves 40 years later acting like nutcases. That's what sticks in their craw. It's not about their loved one that was killed. It's the families not liking their own behavior reflected for the whole world to see. Ryan had nothing to do with that scene; he just re-enacted it almost verbatim. They're not ""retraumatized"" about the family member who died. They're straight out embarrassed to see how they were played in the show. Most of you siding with the families are obsessed with coddling them and exaggerating their responses to make you feel like you're doing something for them. They don't even know you. Why do they care how you react to this show?! You think they spend any time on Reddit or Twitter reading all this obsessive virtue signaling on their behalf! Your attention on them is just as invasive and insulting as those who like Dahmer. Leave them alone and keep them out of your mouths!"
The Victims Game,Probably a good reason as to why
The Victims Game,Oh you mean they don’t want to dredge up crazy traumatic experiences ever few years when somebody wants to do a show?
The Victims Game,"I enjoyed Dahmer, the show….I thought it was an interesting story (and I assumed it was dramatized) and one that should be told.

We talk about how mental health should be brought to the forefront and then we’re afraid to talk about some of the most uncomfortable stories about mental health.

If you thought the show glorified Dahmer, we’ll have to agree to disagree on that (though I’m happy to discuss)….in my opinion, the show DID humanize him and I think that’s what makes people uncomfortable.

I don’t think Jeffrey was a “good guy”, obviously, but I think he was damaged and swept under the rug because people didn’t know what to do with him.

I don’t know Ryan Murphy and I can’t speak about his antics, cause this is the first I’m hearing (unless he’s the guy that’s feuding or feuded with H3H3, then I know a little bit), but stories are not necessarily “owned” by anyone.

I doubt he donated any of the money he made to the families, but that would have been the correct move, in my opinion.

Just one man’s thoughts, and I wouldn’t necessarily argue that I’m correct, just how I interpret the situation"
The Victims Game,"Take a hint? 

Dahmer was such a bullshit, offensive show. Ends with the message that we shouldn't glamourise serial killers, having just spent 10 hours glamourising and trying to make us empathise with a serial killer."
The Victims Game,"How about leaving them the fuck alone and moving on creatively. Seriously, how many times can Dahmers “story” be told? It’s old hat."
The Victims Game,"An informative documentary would be one thing, but these shows are just murder-mystery cash grabs. It’s not meant to be educational, because that would be boring and wouldn’t bring in the audience numbers they want out of it."
The Victims Game,"So the  family members who lost a loved one and were traumatized by a serial murderer that was enabled by the ineptitude of local Milwaukee police, didn’t want to speak with an exploitative film troll that wanted to use their grief as a profit center?   


Weird"
The Victims Game,Maybe he should have taken the cue right there
The Victims Game,"It’s ironic: so many people are hopping on the bandwagon of bashing the true crime genre as being exploitative.  But this Dahmer series is actually the worst example they could use.  

It’s well researched, humanizes the victims, and focuses on the social injustices that allowed Dahmer to thrive."
The Victims Game,"I liked the series, I don’t think it’s “glorifying” Dahmer, it’s most of all a tale of undiagnosed mental illness, a dysfunctional family, systemic racism and many other issues in police, penitentiary system, and society overall, and the tale of the difficulties the gay community had to endure even without Dahmer trying to kill them. The strength and inner/outer beauty of people like Tony Hughes, made an example between many, need to be remembered, he alongside the others can’t be only described as “murder victim”, guy was a wonderful person and the world lost a valuable human being with him. I wouldn’t have known his story otherwise, probably.

That said, many people are angry that the victim relatives weren’t involved, and the point made here is that he asked them for involvement, but obviously they wouldn’t want to live it all again so they refused.

That story and the people that we lost shouldn’t be forgotten, the only thing that saddens me is the idea of the relatives accidentally crossing dahmer’s face on posters.

To end this consideration, a memorial site should be built, I agree with that POV."
The Victims Game,"So you took that as a ""go ahead""?"
The Victims Game,It's almost as if that's a sign he shouldn't have made the show?
The Victims Game,"Huh, so the victims families *didn't* want to participate in a cash grab documentary about the absolute monster who destroyed their lives and killed their loved ones?

Shocking..."
The Victims Game,Why the fuck would they?!
The Victims Game,“Hey we want to make ANOTHER movie/doc/series about the guy that killed and ate your son. Would love to chat” Damn wonder why no one responded
The Victims Game,"Let’s never make another tv show or
movie about something that happened in real life cause someone might get offended"
The Victims Game,"Why tf would they? Make a tv show about a horrible killer and make lots of money from it, fine, but don’t expect the victim’s families to want anything to do with you."
The Victims Game,Maybe that was a VERY SUBTLE SIGN that they didn't want a show to be made...
The Victims Game,Hi I'm Joe Holywood and I want to profit on your pain.  Again.  What?  Not interested?  Jeez...
The Victims Game,Talk about not taking a hint.
The Victims Game,Wait until they do a school shooting series.
The Victims Game,"“We never heard back from any of them”
RM: “welp, guess we’re good then!”"
The Victims Game,Bruh.
The Victims Game,The ''True Crime'' boom that televisual content creators are going through is a blight on society.
The Victims Game,So you took it as a yes scumbag?
The Victims Game,"take the hint then, assshole"
The Victims Game,Probably should have taken the hint when none of them returned his calls.
The Victims Game,Yea no shit
The Victims Game,Huh… I wonder why… it’s almost like families don’t want to relive the most traumatizing experiences of their lives…
The Victims Game,"so that means okay, go ahead? yeah, that makes sense.."
The Victims Game,Because it's tasteless and horrible.
The Victims Game,What a dolt
The Victims Game,What a scumbag. I feel bad for the families.
The Victims Game,"Gee, I wonder why."
The Victims Game,"""Hey, do you mind being in my show that I'm producing to make a shitload of money off of your family's misery? No? How dare you!"" - Ryan Murphy, probably"
The Victims Game,Not surprised *at all.*  It might’ve been different if it were a documentary instead of a hollywood series which glorifies the killer of their family/friends.
The Victims Game,"It didn't need to be made. I know I'll get downvoted for this, but as a Black person born and raised in Milwaukee with a gay family member and friends on the “LGBTQ+ spectrum,” its exhausting. This city continues with cultivate injustices for us and this completely reopened wounds for us here (and I'm sure elsewhere!)."
The Victims Game,"It’s almost like the victims/family of the victims don’t want their nightmarish tragedy’s turned into Friday-night popcorn sellers.

Who fucking knew?"
The Victims Game,What did he expect from people whose grief and trauma he intended to monetize? What an insensitive asshole.
The Victims Game,"Yeah, let's talk to some guy exploiting our dead loved ones for profit."
The Victims Game,"No shit, because they dont want to relive this for sick entertainment purposes."
The Victims Game,"Yes, reach out to the families of the victims for input 🙄. A Friend of The Family had input from the victims themselves, who got to heal from the horror of that story. Dahmer’s victims’ families have been through enough, leave them alone and let them have peace."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I love this show so much but good god non watchers must be sick of the constant articles posted here lol
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,">When Rogue One became mired in reshoots, Lucasfilm tapped the Oscar-nominated writer-director Tony Gilroy, of Michael Clayton and the Bourne franchise fame, to salvage it. Gilroy was reportedly the one to point out that the most obvious and satisfying way to end the picture was by killing everyone. 

love this guy."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,The daily threads on this show are just endless
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut, Kinda makes me wish that Obi and bobba fett shows had different showrunners and writers. Shit even better directors
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Deep cut lol Rogue One made a billion dollars and is constantly jerked by r/starwars.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"The season finale will be out on Wednesday, so get ready for another round of these articles and then to not hear much about the show until 2024."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,one week left for andor posting everybody lol
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Babe there’s ANOTHER ANDOR POST FUCK
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I don't think you know what ""deep cut"" means."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Just ne-name this sub r/Andor
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,If I had a dollar for every post on this subreddit about Andor I could retire.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I've seen more puff pieces about Andor than episodes.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Does it change after the first couple of episodes? I wasn’t into it.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"As far as Star Wars shows go, I think there is one big reason why people love this one and The Mandalorian but hated Obiwan and Book of Boba Fett. Even though Andor was an existing character, we really had no expectations about what he SHOULD be. The shows were free to just make their stories.  With Obiwan and Boba Fett, they had to compete with all of our made up expectations of how it SHOULD go.  Tough to compete with that."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Just got around to watching the show (just finished the 3rd episode) and have enjoyed it so far (although I feel like the first two episodes could’ve been a single episode) but the main thing that has been bugging me about it is how hard it is to simply tell what the hell people are *saying* half the time.  It feels like it’s more of an audio balance issue than anything, although it doesn’t help when just about every single character has a different accent and Diego Luna himself can be quite mumble-y at times.  I hate using the subtitles but have had to rewind and turn them on multiple times in every episode so far"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Tomorrow's paid article on r/Television 

""Why people are having more and better sex thanks to watching Andor."""
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Andor is the best thing Disney put out there since end game. What a great show. Hope they try more stuff like this.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Yet in reality they are struggling to get viewers. I made it 4 episodes in before being bored to death and turning it off.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"“Disney’s previous experiments with live-action Star Wars TV, from The Mandalorian to Obi-Wan Kenobi, have often felt like watching lifelong fans play with their action figures in a sandpit…. [S]ome of their biggest moments have come from weaving in beloved characters and Easter eggs while tiptoeing around the established canon of a galaxy far, far away.

Gilroy, on the other hand, seems to care little about what came before him. Instead, he has focused on human drama, visually stunning set pieces and watertight writing. The result adds a weight of history to Cassian’s final destination — and gives Star Wars its first piece of universally excellent television.”

- absofuckinglutely nailed why i love this show and im disappointed with the others. Do more of this Lucasfilm PLEASE"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Oh look, another Andor post."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Crazy what happens when you hire a showrunner who knows what the hell they’re doing. Not exactly rocket science.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"*WoW Boss Voice*

ENOUGH"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,The way this show is being shoved down my throat I am convinced it’s slightly above average and people are eating it up cause it has the Star Wars label
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,When you derail a franchise so bad people just aren't convinced there are others that genuinely like something with said franchise and convince themselves that they're bots.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I wanted to love this show, but Star Wars/Marvel fatigue definitely kept me from it. Hopefully one day I feel like going back, because I’ve heard lots of good things."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"So I didn't watch anything after TRoS, Can I still watch this? Is it really HBO quality or a !ot of post are just astroturfing"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I didn’t like it at first but I’m really into it now.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Andor: How r/television and r/entertainment became *the* premier place for corporate astroturfing
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Okay this has to be clear astroturfing by Disney right? Is the show really THAT good? Good enough to warranty 2-3 articles a day about how good it is?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"These articles constantly telling us how Important something is are getting absurd. Rings of Power, She-Hulk, now this. Sheer desperation from the studios and compliant media outlets (and I say as someone excited to binge Andor once it’s finished)."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"If all this buzz was actually originated from the fans, it would be fine.

But at this point is hard to believe this is not a paid bot service.

Nearly half of the posts are in the lines ""of why nobody is watching the best SW show ever!""

If nobody is watching who is posting this much? And why there're way more post about Andor than actual TV hits like HoD or even Yellowstone.

It's great if you like. It's even better that is good. But this kind of push advertising is annoying."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Finally getting around to watching it. First 3 episodes are pretty, pretty, eh pretty good"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Even if you don't like Star Wars & the like I think this show is worth at least a shot. It's a surprisingly tense, well-written 'action' drama. Feels more like 'prestige' fare with a Star Wars coat of paint than some of the CGI kid stuff. Plus Stellan Skarsgård & Andy Serkis get real juicy roles which I'm always happy to see"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"So many andor articles it’s almost spammy at this point, Andorcare anymore."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"It's Star Wars but no aliens have any pivotal roles.

It's dragged out for what little story there is to it. I don't get the hype."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I hope Disney are learning. This is their best live action show. Sure Mandalorian was fun, but it's far too repetitive."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Probably because it had the least IP to work with.  So far Mon Mothma is the only character crossover from any of the movies except from Rouge One. 

It’s also well written, which you can’t really say is true of any of the other D+ shows, including Marvel.  Mando kind of gets away with it by having as little dialogue as possible, especially early on."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Andor is a really great series. It’s a shame it’s not getting more fan love.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,[deleted]
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Almost seems like new original stories about lesser known characters are more 8nteresting. More of this plz disney. Also, tell marvel they could be doing better"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,The scenes with the Dhani made me laugh so damn hard
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Does it have anything to do with astroturfing social media?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I am happy that andor is getting so much coverage. Astroturfing? When Jhonny Depp was astroturfing for his trail, no one cared, but when a good show is being astro turfed you notice?"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Andor is the best Star Wars show because it is the least Star Wars show.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I refuse to watch this show until it’s cancelled or the finish out every single season
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"We get it, Andor is the greatest thing since sliced bread!"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,It's a fine show but the astroturfing is outta control
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Please, stop with the fuckin Andor posts. I'm not gonna watch it and they are all the same shit."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I’d rate this as one of the best first seasons of any TV show.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t like the show.  I love Star Wars but it’s just to slow for me.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I feel like this show should have just been called ""Luthen"" and primarily focused on him. And it would have been the better for it. 

Andor isn't bad as a character, but he's the least interesting between him, Luthen, and Mon Mothma."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Look, another Andor thread. Marketing bots are busy"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"So sick of these articles. Like fuck, in glad you're enjoying it, but stop fucking sharing articles about it every hour on the hour."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Stop telling me how great this show is. All Star Wars stuff on Disney+ has been ass. Is there a scenario where we get new Star Wars content where I DONT know the outcome?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Glad that it's getting the recognition it deserves. I'm so pumped for the finale on Wednesday.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Show suuuuuuucked
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Andor is NOT a deep cut
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Yeah, it super super good.  You don't even need to know / care about space wizards or kid cartoon shows to get it."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I had trouble getting into it, I didn’t make it past the first episode. Not sure why, just didn’t grab me."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I'll go ahead and say it.  It's good because there are no Jedi or Sith in it.
  
This allowed plots that are more complex because when you have impossibly powerful characters writing a believe story becomes that much harder."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,It's still just shootouts and chases.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"At this point I haven't seen Andor and never will. Kinda sick of how much people are trying to force this on me. 

Fuck the Mouse"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I watched the first 2 episodes and it did nothing for me. Should I keep watching
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Easily the best live Star Wars tv show
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Disney must have invested a shit ton in astroturfing and for journalists to cover this right now to get as much coverage/mentions as it does, but you know what?

I don't even mind it. Excellent show, I hope we'll get more of it! Excited for the finale and I don't usually fuck with Star Wars all that much.

I fuck with this, **heavy**."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I'm so sick of hearing about this show and franchise in particular.

It only exists now to drain money from easily swayed people."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I really want to know what people like about this show. It has a few interesting details but I am so bored watching every episode. Cassian Andor is not an interesting or compelling character and neither are any of the other characters they spend so much time on without ever really developing. I hope the second season picks up the pace.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,The best imo
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Underwhelmed. I wish it got better.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"It’s great. 

But is this the tenth article in sub about andor??"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Is this a joke?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Okay honestly I'm not trying to be edgy or whatever. Is it *actually that good?*  
  
I tried to watch it a few weeks ago and found the first episode to be kinda boring and just haven't gone back. I'm honestly not that interested in seeing people who aren't Jedi do much of anything. But I'm also super done with anything having to do with the fucking Skywalkers."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"People need to watch this show. It’s probably the best science fiction show right now, the vibe is perfect, and no silly kid stuff. It’s adult Star Wars done exceptionally well with incredibly memorable dialogue to boot."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,She is this show good or bad? This is the first that I’ve heard it to be good. So which is it?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Every fucking day with this show. Stop shilling, Disney! No one cares!"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,It’s a solid show but I seriously don’t get the undying love for it lol I enjoyed kenobi more tbh. It’s still a solid show though just a little too slow burn for my liking.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Peacemaker is better.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Maybe even the century.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,The more I hear about this show the less I want to see it. It’s fucking spam mail at this point.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"It's not a good show ( I could barely get through the pilot.) The other shows are just that much worse that they make this one look that much better.

The bar disney set is so low that they're desperate for anything to go viral. They're trying too hard with Andor and it's coming off as cringe worthy.

Bob Igor is expected to come in an save the titanic from sinking...cleaning up the mess Kathleen Kennedy made.

Disney needs to stop catering to the woke minority. It's why they're in the situation in the first place."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I watched the first episode and was bored to tears. Not just that, Cassian was extremely unsympathetic as a main character. I understand it 'gets good' after three episodes but honestly, the same with videogames and books, if I have to spend a couple of hours first not enjoying myself I'll just as soon not bother.

And for all of Obi Wans faults, at least it wasn't boring. Hilarious and dumb at times? Sure. But not boring."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I watched the first two episodes for free on Hulu last night, and it wasn't good. I don't get why again the made the main character a Mexican like they did with The Mandalorian."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,wont lure me into disney+ sub. non jedi stuff is no star wars to me. just stop it
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Man, after l the nonstop ""something something toxic fans"" of She Hulk articles that completely put me off from ever wanting to watch it, I'm starting to have a Deja Vue with these ""something something best TV series of the year that no one watched"" articles. I want to watch this when I have the time but these shitty copy paste (paid) articles aren't helping.

Can we just delete the reposts of these crappy articles please?"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Everything else kinda sucked.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I still can't tell whether this show is good or not, I definitely got more into its second half as things progressed but it was a bit of a slog to begin with. The most bizarre thing about it is how pointless the title character is, Cassian Andor does almost nothing, apart from convenient figurative and/or literal escaping out of a side door and surviving to the next act of the show. Everything just happens around him. It's like there is obvious importance simmering below but they are not going to give you any of it because they aren't sure just how many seasons they'll be able to milk out of it yet.

There is also some terrible acting from bit-part characters, thankfully most die or become side stepped with less screen time as the season went on.

I've only really stuck with it because I had no other show on the go."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"It’s a good show, but it’s not a deep cut. It’s a character from a movie designed to create characters for a tv show."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,I still believe Rogue One is one of the top 3-4 SW movies And I’ll die on that hill
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"This reminds me of the guns of navarone.  Nothing much happens during the first third of the film, but when it does start to roll forwards and get exciting LO AND BEHOLD! You’re actually invested in the characters.  Andy Serkis deserves a special mention too. That guy can act!"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"Cassian Cassian Cassian Cassian, ANDOOOOOOR. 

MON, ^^^Mon ^^^Mothma"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Hey guys have you heard of a little show called ANDOR made by the indie studio Disney?
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"It's basically a meme now. 

""Oh this is the Andor article today"""
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,It just comes across as desperate. Like Disney is paying these writers to try and pump up the viewership numbers.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"As someone who also loves this show...

[MORE](https://media.tenor.com/0engAwwUVF4AAAAC/more-kylo-ren.gif)"
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,It's the same headline every time as well. How many times does this article need to be written and subsequently posted here? The insights provided in the numerous articles are rarely worth as much as the paper they are printed on.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,There are so many articles that they managed to turn me off from the show. I am sick of hearing about it at this point.
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,We are
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"To be fair, whenever there’s a show that I love that I feel isn’t being talked about enough, I’ll try to get as many people on board watching it as possible for two reasons:

1.	So I have more people to talk about it with.
2.	To increase the chances (no matter how small the increase may be) of the show getting renewed for another season.

I certainly did the same thing for Severance at the beginning of the year until it was renewed. Though I’m fairly certain Andor was always guaranteed at least two seasons."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,"I’m a pretty big Star Wars fan and I haven’t seen it or really intend to, but it’s honestly nice to have some positivity in the fandom. 

 So often it’s disheartening to hear so much negativity about things you really enjoy, and since the show has aired, a lot of that has decreased. (That’s not to say that there isn’t a place for negativity or criticism, but it does wear thin when it’s nearly constant) 

I admit sometimes I catch myself rolling my eyes when yet another new article comes out declaring it “the best thing in the franchise!!” But then I remind myself, that that simply means people are having fun, and that’s not a bad thing. 

In short: Yes it can be annoying, but it’s also a breath of fresh air against the internet’s frequent negativity."
The Forest of Love: Deep Cut,Lmao I came here to say this. I don't watch the show and have no interest in watching it and the constant posts make me wanna watch it even less
Trick Shinsaku Special,You could switch it to sort by old and it will show the oldest first. As you watch you can just go past where you got to last time.
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I don't think it's possible. Even asking questions can be rough. ""Liking show, seeing something happening in season 2 I'm not liking. Does it make the show not worth watching? Only seen up to episode x, please don't spoil with specifics."" 

You know you'll be getting spoilers out the ying-yang after that. It's human nature. 

While you're at it, don't even try reading show wikis. I did that trying to keep track of a character I didn't remember, spoilers everywhere. Some sites used to do generic and spoiler listings, like if a character is dead, they won't tell you unless you read the spoilers. That's not so prevalent now. You look up the character, first thing you see is alive/deceased. "

Trick Shinsaku Special,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

Trick Shinsaku Special,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Trick Shinsaku Special,Severance show
Trick Shinsaku Special,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Trick Shinsaku Special,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Trick Shinsaku Special,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Trick Shinsaku Special,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Trick Shinsaku Special,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

Trick Shinsaku Special,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Trick Shinsaku Special,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Trick Shinsaku Special,Yellowjackets?
Trick Shinsaku Special,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Trick Shinsaku Special,Why?
Trick Shinsaku Special,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Trick Shinsaku Special,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Trick Shinsaku Special,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Trick Shinsaku Special,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list.

Trick Shinsaku Special,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Trick Shinsaku Special,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."

Trick Shinsaku Special,"TL;DR

My thoughts on the “nostalgia argument” as you call it, is it’s a genetic fallacy. You try to explain how and why someone has a position instead of addressing the position on its own merits. Instead of saying “you like x because you watched it when you were little” you should just say why you think it’s bad when viewed with a critical lens."

Trick Shinsaku Special,"I'll tell something I experienced about Super Mario Bros. 3. It's a 2D platformer that is widely hailed as a masterpiece, one of the greatest 2D platformers ever made. I said to a person online that I consider it a truly great game. He immediately attacked me, saying ""you're blind by nostalgia, take off your rose-tinted glasses"". I have no nostalgia for Mario 3, played it for the first time a few years ago, I told him so, and he went back in his criticism. But if I hadn't, he was basically going to call me out on my love for the game! Actually, he had already called me out for loving the game, and he assumed that I was nostalgic for it! But even if had very strong nostalgia for it, he would still be wrong in criticizing my high praise for the game! Even if I was nostalgic towards it, nostalgia shouldn't suddenly make my judgment and love towards it less valid and less well-thought. As if I have no critical sense, as if I don't understand and deeply scrutinize what I love, and I know why I love it, why it deserves MY love and praise! This is why I think that people who say things such as ""it's not as good as you think"" and ""you just have nostalgia goggles"" are assholes.

My Moochy Boyfriend,">Yeah, yeah, the time knife, we've all seen it."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Guys, I have so many shows to get caught up on. Don’t tempt me to throw that all away for a Good Place rewatch."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Anyone else cry a lot when they see the last episode of this show or is it just me?
My Moochy Boyfriend," ""Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend please"""
My Moochy Boyfriend,Damn it now I’m gonna have to watch the Good Place again
My Moochy Boyfriend,"What it is, what it is."
My Moochy Boyfriend,This is such a good show
My Moochy Boyfriend,I saw the TIME KNIFE?!
My Moochy Boyfriend,Do it! It’s a serious breeze.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Time is all just a Jeremy Berimy anyway. You'll be back to watching it eventually on the next go around.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"It’s just a well written show that had a really great ending, so to answer your question, yes."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"SOBBING! Red eyes, snot streaming down, *the works.*

It is one of the most beautiful pieces of television ever created. Start to finish."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Fun fact: 24 was the last network TV show to win an Emmy for best drama.
My Moochy Boyfriend,People shitting on Kim Bauer in season 2 were some of the earliest memes on the internet.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Damn it chloe!
My Moochy Boyfriend,I've literally got the 3rd episode of season 3 paused on my TV right now. Fucking love this show.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Jack Bauer Power Hour for life!
My Moochy Boyfriend,"24 was the reason why I was hooked to tv shows. My favorites are season4 and 5.
I 'm jealous of OP because OP has a lot of episodes to watch!"
My Moochy Boyfriend,RIP Gregory Itzin (you'll get there and it'll be worth it)
My Moochy Boyfriend,By season 4 it’s just a naked string of expository conversations reiterating the outcome of the previous two expository conversations. Sometimes you have the same conversation twice in the same scene. It’s marvellous.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"""Im gonna need a hacksaw"", Jack Bauer, gentleman and poet laureate"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Back in the day with Penn Gillette (of magic duo Penn & Teller) had a daily radio show, he mentioned something about blocking off an entire day to watch a season of “24l in real time. Meaning — starting when the show started (if it was the first season he would begin at 12 midnight) and take breaks for 6 minutes every hour to keep in line with the timing of the show. Not sure if this was serious or not, or if he had completed it or not, but it’s always stuck with me as a unique show watching experience. 

R.I.P. Edgar Stiles’s “mutha” in season 4…"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Some of the B plots were hacky, especially Kim's though his wife's amnesia plot in the first season ticked me off but I've always loved this show having watched it when it aired back in the day."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Season 2: Kim running
My Moochy Boyfriend,Every season there is a mole in the CTU and every time they act surprised. Also afair the first season is the only time we see Jack Bauer eat a meal.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I've only recently started watching as well, just finishing up S3 at the minute. I think I may be in love with Tony Almeida"
My Moochy Boyfriend,She's just getting started lol. He always has to put saving the country on hold to go bail her stupid ass out
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Honestly, spending millions do dollars to have Kiefer Sutherland scream 'Where is the bomb?!' and torture people was some of the best television ever made."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"If if jack bauer took a gun and two bullets into a room with hitler, Stalin and nina Myers, he’d shoot Nina Myers twice"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Always loved the music in the show too, really made the show. Best scene was when Jack was interrogating a bad guy by threatening to shoot his leg then just turns and shoots his wifes leg instead."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"If you like the show, wait til you see [the musical](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYCR4TAuEg)

My favorite scene was when CTU lost contact with Jack and then they get a report about someone on a subway kicking a terrorist out the back door before he could set off a suicide bomb and they are like ""that's gotta  be Jack"""
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Probably the best action/thriller tv series ever produced and Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer with fire and fury. He's The Hero for sure, but he's not flawless and Jack does some pretty questionable stuff during the show. He's a tormented character pushed into extreme situations.

While the show is somewhat repetitive, I think it holds pretty well throughout the entire run. Even the latter seasons deliver some bad ass and truly effective tv entertainment, season 6 arguably being the worst but still watchable."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"My friends and I were really into this show when it started.  I used to wear a ""WWJBD?"" bracelet that confused a lot of people.  Our band even inserted the 24 ""beeps"" into one of our songs."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"This was the first show I truly binged when I was like 10. It was sooooo much fun. The insanity of everything made it all the more addictive. Shit, I might watch it now."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"unfortunately she doesn't get better.

but fortunately after season 3 she's just a side character and pretty much gets written out of the show except for a few appearances here and there.


anytime i rewatch the series i just fast forward through any scene with her in it, she is just completely irrelevant to the overall story."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"She’s a teenager who occasionally makes poor decisions and cares about people and her decisions are often based on protecting someone or something and not having a father being actively involved in her upbringing and day-to-day can make things a little more difficult.

Also, she’s often in extremely high pressure situations where almost any decisions she makes can potentially impact another life (or potentially millions) and is constantly on the move running from terrorists or psychopaths, so I think she may just deserve a pass on some poor judgment calls, don’t you think?"
My Moochy Boyfriend,“SON OF A BITCH!!!”
My Moochy Boyfriend,I like 24 but I can’t watch it. It was a show conceived in an era where you had to have 20+ episodes and some of the things that happen just to string the show along for another three episodes and end up being meaningless is just too much.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Oh man. By season 3 I just wanted her to DIE.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I like each season for its own reason. That last one. ""What are you going to do arrest me?"" ""Drops out of an 8 story window"""
My Moochy Boyfriend,Just remember this word for the future.......COUGAR.
My Moochy Boyfriend,I love 24 too! I recommend often on Reddit.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I did like how it actually let the stakes escalate later on — remembered that this was a television series, and so things could happen that wouldn’t normally on a national scale — à la the *Jack Ryan* films."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"The thing that I find amusing about this show is that it takes place within a 15 year period or so from first season to last and within that time there are 10 different presidents thanks to multiple assassinations, presidents being removed from office or resigning. 

Not to mention, for all the terrorist attacks that CTU prevented, tens of thousands are still dead in the show thanks to a suitcase nuke being detonated on American soil, nerve gas attacks, planes being blown out of the sky etc..."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"When I was way-into cycling (bikes, not motorcycles) I was doing 200+ miles per week (it was nice to have zero body fat). In the winter, we'd all have our bikes on those ""trainer"" things, so you can get some miles indoors. But it's boring as all hell.

I found that sticking a ""24"" DVD in would increase my pace fantastically though. 100% recommend, you'll start pedaling *very* fast."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I'm sorry, who are you?"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Season 2 of 24 is legit.  It starts to tapper off afterwards though.

Also, watch out for that bobcat!"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"everytime i rewatch season 2 i fast foward threw the kim bauer stuff lol.  wait till shes briefly encounters a mountain lion later in season 2 ROFL.  its so bad me and my bro use it like Darmok in star trek next gen ""kim bauer with the mountain lion"""
My Moochy Boyfriend,To be fair Kim is an inexperienced teenager thrust into an insane thriller plot (mountain lions! Johnny Drama!). But there are multiple characters on that show who should know better but make categorically dumber decisions than she does.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I remember the 24 hype that convinced me to watch it after that first season. It was going okay, but then a character got amnesia and I realized it was just a soap opera for men. Sometimes entertaining, but pretty fucking stupid. Only gets worse from there too."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Around season 4-5 youll get bored though. I remember thinking tihs was the best tv show ever then its just the same thing over and over. It gets so repetitive.
My Moochy Boyfriend,I remember it was so much fun to wait and watch the new episode live w everyone else in the country… everyone talked about it the next day at work…
My Moochy Boyfriend,I think season5 won an Emmy. That was 16 years ago...?
My Moochy Boyfriend,"You're quite right. *This is Us* was the last nominated in 2021 - three nominations in total. Not counting *Downton Abbey* (PBS, but an import from the UK), the one before was *The Good Wife*."
My Moochy Boyfriend,I thought it was Lost?
My Moochy Boyfriend,Wow nice fact
My Moochy Boyfriend,And part of the fun of the show too
My Moochy Boyfriend,I can't wait to see my girl Chloe. Such a badass.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Yah! Yah! Get out of here, Snail!!"
My Moochy Boyfriend,Damnit Chase!
My Moochy Boyfriend,Season 3 is the best season by far too.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Kyle Singer!
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I'm going to enjoy being able to binge it. 

I think season 5 was the one where >!Jack was kidnapped, right?!< or that may have been season 4. It was a great season. Can't wait to get to it."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"When I saw this post I don't think I heard about this when it happened last year. Damn, sad to hear he really was great on the show. They really had so many great guest actors and series regulars over the years."
My Moochy Boyfriend,LOVE IT
My Moochy Boyfriend,"""Shut up, stupid!"" - Jack in season 3"
My Moochy Boyfriend,“Time to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty”
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Just kinda stumbled upon this. In the same vein - I once watched both the John Wayne and Jeff Bridges versions of ""True Grit"", jumping back and forth kinda scene by scene. It was rewarding and the remake is nicely faithful to the original. I came away preferring the remake. I liked the dialogue better in the remake. A fun excercise."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Yeah when she got amnesia is was so stupid and really hard to believe it. Both her and Kim were in some unbelievable situations, which really makes you roll your eyes."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Honestly, it made sense as a concussion for me — I once woke up and couldn’t remember my name for a solid two hours — genuinely scary stuff."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"The amnesia plotline in S1 - nobody had even *attempted* to write a fully serial network show before, and the 24 writers room had a general outline for the whole season.

But turns out they got through their 24 episodes worth of plot by about the midway point. They had to throw together *any* semblance of a story, keeping in mind actor contracts, essentially on the fly. I'm pretty sure the writers/show runners said at one point they just wanted her to be knocked out for a few hours, but that wouldn't fly, so they had to come up with something else."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Tony is great but Chloe is the absolute best.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"season five, Peter Weller as the mid-boss. Superb!"
My Moochy Boyfriend,Yeah I can't wait to get to later seasons without her. I totally get that writing characters can be difficult but she does stupid things that make no sense. It's wild.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I did say that I like seeing characters making mistakes, it makes the character human. The mistakes she makes are kinda too out of character."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Yeah she got too much hate. Of all the 24 subplots they had to throw in at least hers were entertaining nonsense. I much rather her than Driscolls daughter or Morris’s drinking
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I get that, I just like that it actually covers a whole day. It was pretty cool for the time."
My Moochy Boyfriend,There weren’t enough filler episodes that it ever became a drag.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Some of the characters and side-plots are basically subordinate to the whole ""24 hours"" concept with lot of filler stuff just to keep certain characters busy."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Its definitely not for everyone but I enjoy it when the show does not take itself seriously. 

24 is basically the analog of Harrison Ford action movies on TV. It’s fun but not comedic, with drama meant to add to the ridicule. Turn your brain off and it’ll be a good time. It isn’t meant to be viewed as anything more than what it presents."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Part of the fun of the show (for me) is when it leans into being over the top with some corny action movie kills, tropes, and one-liners. This short 22 second video is a decade plus old spoiler but I still think about it as the show in a nutshell: ridiculous, cheesy, a little corny with its tropes, while still playing it completely straight and kind of bad ass. 
It's a tough mix to juggle but it hit a sweet spot for me. https://youtu.be/wHGlVsHyiuw  
Plus the show did have some great arcs and villains (and I thought Keifer was great in the role, alternating from concerned whisper to threatening whisper to violently angry bark at the blink of an eye)."
My Moochy Boyfriend,"The show is pretty good but Kim and her mother in the first season were really rough to get through. If you can ignore those two, the first season is good. The following seasons are good too, minus the Kim moments."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Even great shows have bad subplots. Breaking bad had hanks wife a kleptomaniac ..They didn’t take up too much time anyway….
My Moochy Boyfriend,"But season 5 was maybe the best. 

It really went off the rails in season 6."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Everything unfortunately runs its course.
My Moochy Boyfriend,Season 4 was a mess but it was entertaining. Season 5 was probably its best season. Season 6 after episode 4 was a mess. Season 7/8/9 weren’t bad at all just a lot of recycled twists.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I remember doing this with a friend in school every week, definitely had its charm."
My Moochy Boyfriend,If anything has to be peak network tv I’m glad it’s 24 Season 5
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Which one is five?

My favorite season was the one with James Badge Dale, maybe three?"
My Moochy Boyfriend,Lost won the year before 24
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Ooh, exciting! I believe this is my first rewatch since it aired, so I don't remember much. It's definitely popping off faster than season 2 did for me."
My Moochy Boyfriend,Have you seen it all before?
My Moochy Boyfriend,If you need to open a socket there is nobody better
My Moochy Boyfriend,At least she is good looking. You’ll miss her in season 4 when you are stuck with Erin Driscoll
My Moochy Boyfriend,"I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I guess I’m just more forgiving because she’s in highly pressurized situations and doesn’t have the life experience and wisdom to make calmly rational decisions and you could even say Jack makes poor decisions that maybe don’t always seem out of character but can seem incredibly dumb given his experience and position of seniority at CTU. Maybe not to the same degree as Kimberly Bauer, but there are at least a few moments where I question his decision making.

Like, why is he not better at reading people given his position at a covert government agency that protects future and current presidents and foils terrorist plots when he first meets the fake Alan York? I’m not saying when I first saw the fake Alan York I instantly knew he was one of the bad guys, but I knew well before Jack was tricked and fooled by the act. I was just really paying attention to body language and facial expressions and also experience of watching many shows you can tell when a character we have just met who is not one of the main cast is so overly nice and no noticeable flaws (especially if it’s a man) that, no, they’re definitely one of the villains and it’s going to be revealed later, but maybe Jack was too close to the situation and distracted by other important things that he was fooled relatively easily?"
My Moochy Boyfriend,"It's cool for this time, still one of the best premises for a thriller show and they manage to keep it going for the whole time"
My Moochy Boyfriend,It’s still cool. It’s such a great concept. It also is a testament to the team that they were able to do a 24 episode season 8 times and kee them entertaining and shows now you get 8 episodes a season and they come back 2 years later.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Pretty sure that any time they wanted 1-3 more episodes, they would just pick the actor who did something rude or gross at the craft services table, and make their character a traitor"
My Moochy Boyfriend,7 and 8 were good they just did a lot of recycling….if you watch them on a binge it’s definitely not as bad. Season 8 16-24 was one of its best runs.
My Moochy Boyfriend,"Season 5 was by far the best, Sean Astin’s guest role was so memorable I still think about it from time to time"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,2023 is the Rise Of The Gamer
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,We definitely don't.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,I think needle drops are the reason this’ll never happen
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"TLDR

OP wants to feel good about pirating media."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Just carry on pirating, if they don’t offer you a legal way, fuck em."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,don't what?
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,wdym
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I literally suggested an a hypothetical steam service that would allow people to digitally acquire media they cannot acquire currently, or allow people to legally buy it to keep it. An alternative to the streaming model which leaves massive gaps."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Need an international streaming service.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Shows that use existing songs have to clear them in every country they sell the show in
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"It’s called iTunes. You are never going to get everything you’ve ever wanted in one place, which everyone has pointed out. You’ve over and over used this as an excuse to talk about piracy."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,This wouldn't be a streaming service. It'd be a storefront like Steam
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,I mean Netflix manages global releases fairly easily (it's almost everywhere). There's a clear outdated mindset going on with rights here that otherwise makes it absurd.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,">It’s called iTunes. You are never going to get everything you’ve ever wanted in one place

Steam has mostly everything. If it doesn't, it's likely on another storefront or is digitally buyable independently. iTunes has a small fraction of TV shows.

>which everyone has pointed out. You’ve over and over used this as an excuse to talk about piracy.

Suggesting the TV industry work towards setting up a storefront where most TV shows are buyable is somehow justifying piracy? I'm encouraging them to adopt a solution that should help mitigate piracy by removing the 'excuses' for it."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,[removed]
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Yes you figured it out and they didn’t.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Netflix for sure manages it for their originals (which is 100% by design). But as any VPN ad will tell you, there’s tons of non-original content on the platform that’s available in certain countries and not others."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Holy fuck I give up. The literal definition of entitlement.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Well, yes, but I meant to suggest as something that would help the industry like how Steam helped video games."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,There are already tons of shows that release globally on day 1. It is already clearly possible.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Sure, but that's not due to music rights - but due to the fact that there are other contracts on other streaming platforms for the show in other countries. Babylon Berlin, my main OP example, is carried by Sky in Europe. Netflix has the rights in USA and some other territories."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Do you actually object to the idea as suggested in my post? A storefront for TV shows that has a comparable scope of content to that of Steam?
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,https://youtu.be/TRTkCHE1sS4
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Listen I have no doubt that’s a factor. But my go-to example to for how big a role music rights play is Beavis and Butthead, which to this day *still* has segments you can’t watch legally in the US (let alone other countries) because of music rights are so expensive."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,It’s called iTunes. We’ve covered this.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Yes. Unironically. Why should releases be staggered in this day and age?

Some tv shows literally never release legally in some countries"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I honestly don't think this is a music rights thing in this particular context. Certainly not in BB's case. 

I am just amazed the industry doesn't see how this drives piracy"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,iTunes is not remotely comparable to Steam in scope here.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"It’s all contractual. Music rights, first look contracts, syndication deals, supply and demand, etc…"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"For all I know it’s changed now that streaming and home media are so universal, but I’m fairly certain shows used to only clear music rights for broadcast only. Any other format and the rights had to be re-negotiated. ([this ancient techdirt article](https://www.techdirt.com/2011/08/02/new-beavis-butt-head-to-contain-less-music-because-mtv-mtv-says-its-too-expensive-to-license-music/) talks a little about it)"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Ok well good luck negotiating media rights with every content provider ever invented so that you can get what you want when you want it. I’m sure you’ll make it happen.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,[removed]
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Yeah I don't know how much of a *modern problem* it is. But you're certainly right historically.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I assume many European companies would be glad to have a way to offer the world their content since currently it's completely unavailable

Pretty sure it's ironically a non-issue for Korea, by the way - who realise the financial and soft power of culture. There are multiple internationally accessible Korean streaming services."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,[removed]
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Just let it go. 

This isn't gonna happen because everyone knows negotiating media rights is a nightmare even with unlimited money otherwise Amazon/Apple would have done it."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,[removed]
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I didn't say it would happen, just that it should for many reasons."

Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Watch it. I put it off for so long because I liked BB so much I thought it was gonna be a  stupid spin off. I was so wrong. Watch it.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,It’s a show you have to pay attention to. It’s not a show where you’re on your phone 70% of the time and can pick up from watching a fraction of each episode.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Yes. It's even better than Breaking Bad and changes how you view and understand Saul Goodman in BB in a truly great way.

BCS is a near-perfect show. Everyone who has watched Breaking Bad should 100% make the time for Better Call Saul."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,If you loved BB you'll also love BCS.  Don't think twice.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"10000% yes.  I just binged the entire thing and am now rewatching BB and it’s a great Segway.  BCS is in my top 5 now.  Tons of BB tie ins also, even super early on"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I'm binge-watching it now, am up to Season 5. It's solid! I also haven't watched Breaking Bad at all, so I'm sure there are some cross-references that I'm missing.

IIRC there was a cliffhanger between Seasons 1 & 2. Can't recall many after that, but such is binge-watching.

Lawyer here, and I find BCS has a lot of accurate things to say about the practice."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"It is a fantastic show. Not sure you deserve it, what with all of your hangups and whatnot."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I LOVED Saul on Breaking Bad and was very excited for Better Call Saul. Like everyone says, it's a great show, but be forewarned that it is very slow (IMO). I dropped it at various times because it was too slow for me, and each time I want to get back into it, I have to restart from the very beginning to follow the plot."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Yes although the show is a slow burn. If you find the first couple seasons a little boring, hang in there."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,watch IT! currently finishing up s4 and it’s one of my all time fav shows so far
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,I did the same thing. I thought it was a cheesy spin off and I ended up liking it even more than Breaking Bad. I just loved the characters so much.
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"what did you like about BB? The bang bang narcos stuff or the slower paced scenes? BCS has almost zero of the former, and a ton more of the latter"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,In my opinion it's just as good as BB
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Absolutely. I love that show
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"BCS is sort of an origin story for many of the supporting characters in Breaking Bad apart from Saul/Jimmy. It shows how people like Gus Fring, Hector Salamanca, Mike Ehrmentraut, etc ended up where they are when we first see them in BB. 

I’m sure BCS is enjoyable enough without having the BB context, but ultimately it does assume the viewer knows who these characters are and what happens to them in BB and is a much richer experience if you have that knowledge coming in."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,There were so many feet shots lol
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"I didn't think the show was bad necessarily, but Jennifer was so damn unlikable the entire show.  As Bruce said, he is the one person who knows what she is going through, and she just insults him constantly.  

I also found it a bit ridiculous after having powers for like 5 minutes, her and him were evenly matched."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Loki was good. Otherwise the Disney mcu stuff has been crap. 

The Netflix marvel stuff was great. Bring that back :("
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Basically a reboot of the fox classic single female lawyer
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,I can't wait for her to break the 4th wall in the Avengers movies she is a comedy genius like the tiktok guy who points at things
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Terrible.

As a character, Jennifer Walters is absolutely insufferable."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,Captain America Fu——🍑
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Honestly the more D+ Marvel shows I see, the more I miss the Netflix Marvel shows (well besides Iron Fist). 
The first season of Jessica Jones, most of Luke Cage and Daredevil are legitimately great TV shows. The D+ shows feel so shallow in comparison. The only one that kind of comes close in terms of quality is Loki in my opinion."
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"hm, it felt so random. like random scenes put together and cut down from about at least an hour long episode? 

so odd. Even the editing? We are in the cave, dealing with how in the hell can she change back? Only for a cut later she being changed back without any explanation?

Or Hulk being pushed away by a car.. or that girl braking into the court room at the end, and Jen not wanting to change, but instead of at least asking what is going on and who the girl is and then having no choice.. she just says ""i dont want to"", her colleague says ""you should"" and then she just does? It feels like she did in fact want to be seen by everyone then.. hm

dunno, so odd. I like the vfx on her (I know people dislike it) but this episode was so odd to me. Like random scenes for promotional material put together. hm"
Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Missing MCU Scenes

""You don't feel like someone else's hand is on the wheel?""

Legal V Ex-lawyer Shoko Takanashi,"Not surprising for an MCU show but there are some rough edges like the last fight against Jameela Jamil being beyond janky and the Jen vs Bruce tussle not feeling like it happened organically, but this was a lot of fun.

Also the post credits scene might be the best in the entire franchise."

Jen's origin is completely meaningless to the point where even people who wanted to push a feminist narrative would be disappointed. (Should have studied and analyzed Michelle Pfeiffer's transformation into Cat Woman.) In addition, her character is erratic. She sea-saws back and forth from Girl Boss to people-pleasing mouse.

There are a few possible avenues they could take to save the show: The follies of over-confidence, untreated PTSD getting out of hand (though ep. 2 probably shot that to pieces,) could have been the struggling independent pitted against big law firms (which ep. 2 definitely shot to pieces, but they could always yank the rug out from under her,) something, anything normal where her powers are completely useless to resolve that situation unless it means being tempted into misusing them.

But right now? If it's supposed to be a comedy? When does the funny happen?

Absolutely not. Same goes for the Spider-Man spin-off shows in the works for MGM+. 

These shows might not be $20 million per episode big budget like the Marvel shows, Stranger Things, The Yellowstone spin-offs, Rings of Power, The Morning Show, Masters of the Air, Citadel, or The Last of Us and House of the Dragon but they are absolutely big budget shows."

Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Drama is definitely in the golden age. As a huge comedy fan, sitcoms are mostly shit, unfortunately."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Man this show had such an epic first episode. Then just kinda fizzled out...

Also can't believe it wasn't a limited series. Didn't know it had the possibility of getting renewed when I started watching it, and just assumed it was going to be a one-and-done. I think it had the potential to be way better if it told the whole story in one piece. Still a decent show though, and I'm sure I'll be watching the second season. 

And he's right; A lot of TV shows these days are film-quality in production, acting, cinematography etc. It's gotta be the absolute golden age for TV right now."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,The show is awesome. John Lithgow is phenomenal.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Yeah but, this show is horrible."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,they could even make it more exciting with a bigger budget. i prefer series over watching a movie lately. they have more time to tell a story.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,In a lot of ways it's better.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Limited series are such a good sweet spot for me. You can get really quality actors because they don’t feel tied down for multiple seaaon and they can tell a complete, well developed story."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,I’d argue a lot of it is better. Not many studios are making movies like Heat or the Godfather these days.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,The Old Man isn't
Arakawa Under the Bridge,This is easily the peak era for scripted original content really.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Rarely have I been so disappointed by a television show. The first 2 episodes were great. I raved about it to my friends. And then it just tanked. I found it barely watchable. And the way it ended? I will not be tuning in for season 2.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Nothing beats a good movie.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,">TV is just as good as film nowadays

I guess maybe the best TV is as good as film.  But there is still a lot of weak TV.  Especially on broadcast networks.

I loved Quantum Leap as a kid, so I was excited for the reboot.  I finally watched the first episode last night, and was kind of disappointed.  The acting from many of the main characters was uneven.  The special effects were pretty bad.  There was a scene with the characters driving in a car, and the background looked worse than a Seinfeld episode.

Why do the broadcast networks struggle so much these days?  I imagine Quantum Leap has a big budget.  They can't get the special effects right?  

And I'm not saying this because I'm a hater. 
 In theory I still like broadcast TV, so I want it to succeed."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Old Man was a good show but it could have cut two entire episodes. It was slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"TV has the major advantage over films these days. Theaters are mostly dead and streaming is the new medium. That's where TV thrives.

Being able to tell a proper story over 8 to 10 hours vs castrating it to 2 makes TV content my preference."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Great show! I was not expecting it to end on a cliffhanger though. Figured this was a one season deal since it starred Bridges.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"> 'TV is just as good as film nowadays'

I disagree.  TV is better than film."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Any worthwhile story should be able to draw very similar reactions from an audience regardless of format or length. One is not better than the other, they both have advantages. TV has the benefit of being able to leisurely explore different characters and storylines while movies are forced to leave behind some characters and stories because they don't fit in with the very specific overall plot. You could argue that movies are dead and everything should be episodic but that's a horribly shortsighted opinion because a lot of highly praised tv shows don't have a clue what they're doing heading into the writers room for next season. That, and the majority of writers these days are basically factory workers building the same basic competent formulaic script for each show like they're on an assembly line.

Writing is the difference maker here. A great writer can deliver a two-hour movie that immerses you in a story that doesn't feel rushed with complex fully developed characters.

It's funny how the rise in love for episodic storytelling coincides with the fall of interpersonal relationships in an increasingly digital life."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Drama yes. Action and comedy no.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"What I find the most amazing is the quality of photography and practical effects, thinking of course of “The Old Men”, but there are others too of course. 

This level of quality was normally available only in film/movies."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Why doesn’t his tongue fit in his mouth anymore? Made it tough to watch tbh.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,I still prefer a good 2 hours movie than a good long TV series...
Arakawa Under the Bridge,I think television is the far superior story telling medium.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Just as good? More like far better. Movies, due to their extremely short runtime, hardly ever have the character development, world building, and nuance found in elite tv shows."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Maybe film is as bad as TV nowadays.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,We are living through a golden age for TV shows.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"**Translation:**

The *paycheck* for TV is just as good as the *paycheck* for film nowadays."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,I would argue that some television is *much* better than the majority of movies being made these days.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Thank you HBO for starting this golden age.

Arakawa Under the Bridge,I hate that FX streams on Hulu....
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I would argue that television is the top tier of visual media now, and movies are second best.

If you develop a popular book into a movie , you get 90 - 120 minutes to tell the story.  If you do a TV series, you've got 6 hours minimum, no real upper limit at all.

If we're being honest, tomorrow if you heard that your favorite book was being developed into a movie, you think ""this is probably going to suck"". But if you hear it's being developed into a TV series you think ""this is going to be awesome!"""
Arakawa Under the Bridge,TV is where acting careers go to die.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Yeah? Well, you know that's just, like, your opinion man."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,He ain’t wrong
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Yeah, TV shows are starting to just get movie level budgets per minute of filming. We're in the golden age of TV shows right now and movie only actors are really missing their chance to flex their skill."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I’ve wondered that since the quality of a lot of TV shows have gone up, would it be viable to show them in theaters?"
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"After reading this, it occurred to me that, imo, television has surpassed cinema in recent years. There’s been more good shows than good movies. 

Compare The Sopranos to The Many Saints of Newark."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"It’s better. There’s more of it. 

I defiantly grew up in an era where film actors were never on tv or in commercials. The way we consume media demands reoccurring relevance if people want to be famous and rich today. In the past, make a couple movies in a few year time period, get chased by paparazzi. Now gotta be on full time."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,I don't agree. TV is superior to film imo.
Arakawa Under the Bridge," A lot of times, it's better.  I sometimes wonder which classic movies I love would have made better TV series than movie.  Almost anything over 3 hours.  Even some of my favs, like Terminator 2 could have launched the series idea 30 years ago.  Lord of the Rings.  Matrix.  Really a lot of great movies might benefit from this treatment.  More scifi/action/adventure than comedy I think.  


And then the reverse often doesn't work.  Like Bluey is 7 minutes long, and really brilliant.  It doesn't need to be a 90 minute movie.  Just make another season.  Like turning a comic strip into a book."

Arakawa Under the Bridge,That’s a reference to how bad film has gotten. TV is still just the space between mayonnaise commercials.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I’d argue it’s far better than film, nowadays."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Part of the reason TV saw such a boom was because studios abandoned more artful, lower budget genre stories in favor of mass marketable franchises with established audiences.

This drive talent to TV where the content wars demanded a ton of content and storytellers could thrive on the lower budgets they needed for their projects."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"Makes sense, fewer and fewer people are actually going to movies. It's now about streaming. Single shot movies won't keep the stream subscription alive as long as multi-series shows.

So better to put the investment into shows."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Can someone explain to me what John Cane character is running / hiding from??? I’ve watched 2 episodes so far and don’t get it.  There was some explanation in episode 2 but it didn’t make sense.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"First few episodes are truly incredible. 

The later half lacked the intrigue and danger that first hooked me. It focused on a lot of unanswered questions, but that's not intriguing."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Superb show.
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I've been saying this for years. TV is a much better long term investment for my entertainment. Movies can be great, and can create universes with sequels, etc, but TV allows for real long term world building. You can be involved in the characters for years instead of hours. You can also take more natural breaks, which is nice, especially when movies keep getting longer. I'd rather spend two hours watching a couple of episodes than one movie, in most cases."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I mostly agree, but I also think Bridges describes the all-too-common problem with many TV shows: they drag out. Even 10 episode miniseries often feel unneccessary long to tell their story, with filler episodes and irrelevant side plots. Then you have the majority of shows that span several seasons, where the writers clearly didn’t plan the direction of the plot from the beginning. Too many shows simply collapses, just look at what Netflix’ been up to. Movies tend to be well though out, and while truly great films are far and between, as a viewer you can mostly be confident that your investment in time will be rewarded with some kind of conclusion.

So yeah, TV has the potensial to be superior to film in many ways, but how many showrunners really utilize that potential?

What I really want to see, actually, are more miniseries telling tight, focused stories over 4-6 episodes.

Chernobyl got it just right."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Translated “cash baby. Big TV cash piles”
Arakawa Under the Bridge,">""The only difference really is that across a full series, you get a chance to learn more about the characters. You don’t have to rush and tell the story too quickly. You can stretch it out and go more in-depth. It’s almost more like a novel.""

I couldn't agree more. The only big issue remaining is the lack of committing to hiring high quality writers and writing episode and season lengths that fit the narrative/story and not to fit some pre-assigned requirement (4x minutes, 10-13 episodes). So many promising shows start off high quality but then lose their way and lose themselves with bad writing and filler when had they cut the episode count down they would have been able to avoid filler and tightened the story up. 

I can't help but think almost every story movie ever watched that has really intrigued me would be better as a mini series or regular series. At their best TV can do everything film can do (production value) but with the additional time telling the story it can dive deeper, evolve characters more and reveal more complexity to the story. 

Only when TV is written poorly do I wish they had just made a movie out of it. It's all about how much story the writer(s) have. Sure, 'The Expanse' could have been two movie trilogies that who knows could have been lauded as the next Star Wars/Star Trek of sci-fi but because they had amazing writers (including the novel authors) they could tell sooooooooooooooooooooooo much more of the story and instead of being in that world with those characters in that story for 12 hours in two trilogies we got 47+ hours from the TV series. In order to make it a movie series you have to omit so many characters, sub plots, complexities to the main plot arc, details and so on. I imagine we'll see that with Dune, as the first movie was great but lost meaningful story arcs for time and it will likely get worse as the upcoming movies are based on even more complex book stories. 

So for me, if I was a man in charge in Hollywood, I would have a really hard time creatively when writers brought me great ideas and asked if this should be a movie(s) or TV series. Really the only reasons I'd pick movie(s) sometimes is that's where the profit is, sometimes certain stories just fit best in the 1.5-3 hours format and the movie industry is much less saturated than the TV industry. So much more competition on TV. You can make a great show and get lost in the crowd but if you put out a great movie with solid public appeal (not something niche) than you've got a good shot to make a respectable profit."

I think that Community (imo, one of the last great TV comedies) exemplified this shift well."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,Reboot has been really good so far. Check it out if you haven't
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"I think the sharp rise of dramatic shows in the past decade or so like Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad etc etc made Comedy a much less desirable place to be for an actor. Aside from Veep has any comedy really been equally lauded in that time? Succession, technically?"
Arakawa Under the Bridge,[deleted]
Arakawa Under the Bridge,"The traditional sitcom (be it multi or single cam) is on life support, unfortunately. Too many talented funny people want to go the Atlanta/Barry route of doing serious half-hour shows that are occasionally funny. Which is fine, I love those shows, but we definitely need more of an effort from Hollywood to give us the next great Seinfeld/Office/Parks/Community style sitcom.

Abbott Elementary is great and is a huge success for ABC so hopefully that makes the networks/streamers want to make more shows like that. I really like Ghosts on CBS as well."
Arakawa Under the Bridge,The best comedies are ones that also have some drama. I always fall back in love with Scrubs.

Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,Cody please stop spamming your fan fiction everywhere.  Especially when you angrily claim the stuff you say is supported by the show itself.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"You sound a bit like a schizophrenic seeking patterns in things to the extreme. 

Either that or someone deeply procrastinating doing their work to finish the PhD in which case enjoy your ABD degree likely in 20 years."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,His name is Cody Holder and his family is very worried about him.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"Nice, typical Reddit comment attempting to troll away from the main content of the post. Thanks for your ‘contribution’ (boring)."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,Really?
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"The fact that you don’t see how manic and schizophrenic this post and details reads is disturbing. And mental illness and math degrees do go hand in hand. Apparently even the WW sub has deleted your posts for going from fandom to obsessive.  You literally created a sub for this stuff where you are the only one posting many of these long essays. Really, you could have two PHDs with this level of effort on actual things."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,Yeah he revealed his name on Reddit which wasn’t very smart of him (and then confirmed it was his name which was even dumber).  He also admitted to not sleeping for literally days before writing that garbage manifesto of his.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"Man, I’m sorry but I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already and I’m working with many people about it already. If your issue is concern for me, please, you don’t have to worry. I’m just highly enthusiastic about decoding this puzzle that was built for us, the audience. It’s like our own personal maze to navigate here. Along the way we get lost as we fall down the rabbit hole. At the end we find the real story and the tree of life, take from that what you will. 

The narrator of WestWorld is literally schizophrenic. Perhaps that’s what you are picking up on, the story itself is madness and it’s about descents into madness, at least part of it. 

Anyway, I’m here to discuss the details of the show and not my personal life."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"He created multiple subs to post this nonsensical trash... AND he posts using THREE accounts at least.  And sometimes his accounts talk to and compliment each other.  It is truly a sad state of affairs.

As for the mania - here is the type of ""logic"" you get from him.  The show is set in 2058 on Earth.  Last season coordinates from an AI monitoring system occasionally would show up in the show.  So Cody here thinks hey, Google Maps in 2020 will give me clues about a fictional 2058.  That's already a leap.  But then what does he do?  He goes to the coordinates, then wanders around and around on Street View or Satellite view, and then is MILES off from the coordinates and comes up with a finding.  

But his findings are insanity:  

\- He saw a city bike rental kiosk (4 miles off from show coordinates) sponsored by Ford the car company and thought it was an amazing finding because a dude in the show is named Ford.  

\- He found a train musuem in Africa and a bus station in Indonesia and this lead him to conclude a company in the show has an OCEAN TRAIN that travels 50,000 miles through the ocean in 2058.

\- He zoomed out and saw a face in a field (more like a vaguely egg shaped silhouette) decided it was a specific character's face, then wondered if there was some conspiracy with HBO paying farmers to draw stuff in fields.  Because some random field looked like an oval / egg.

It seems the ring does seem perhaps to be a time line of the year of the show as he says. I just can’t see what he is saying about those “divergences”. 

The searching google maps is the part that indicates a bit of mania here, but that’s mostly just sad. I was hoping to figure out some cool story about the “parallel realities” that was hidden in the story. But it’s really not convincing other than some stairs that change color."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"It’s more that it is a “hobby” that is obviously occupying you for more than the hours most people are awake. Putting off the dissertation work, it seems."

People ""harassing"" you kept asking for evidence, kept asking you to explain yourself, and you got mad and would end up blocking people.

And you can't get Doxxed when you stupidly revealed your name to everyone and then rather than try to claim it was an alias admitted to everyone it was your name.  Like that's really really dumb dude.  But of course now you are claiming otherwise.  Your dishonesty is astounding."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"Like I get it, there COULD be some clues, some meaning, in the AI Graphical Interface Circle in the show.  Fine.  But that's the last reasonable thing Cody argued and then went off the deep end.  

He thinks there is time travel in Season 3, people living entire lives as other characters, he thinks a phone app in the show is a physical place in the Middle East for some reason, he thinks one character in the show is actually Teddy when the show itself and the cast and showrunners have explicitly said otherwise publicly a hundred times.  He thinks the splatter on the floor from an injured robot is a secret map, he thinks an AI from the show is talking to him through the music of the show.

He's just a bundle of illogical nonsense and is quite obviously not thinking clearly."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"It’s true that I’m putting off my dissertation work (I mention this in the introduction of my atlas post). Again, this is a personal detail and IMO (not yours) its irrelevant to the current state of the project. The questioning of mental health and motivations was an early phase of the project that I’ve now moved past. If one aims to discredit the project, I suppose taking a personal angle on why I’m pursuing this hobby makes sense. It might make more sense though, in my view, to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory. One could start with the premise that the coordinates provided in the show are relevant to the story, and go from there. Perhaps one would take an entirely different path than I have. Anyway,   Hopefully my hobby doesn’t interfere too much with your Reddit experience."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"Don’t get me wrong. I’m with you. I’m just here cause WW.  I actually though when watching it that some of the androids were brought back in different bodies.  I am kinda slow in that show though, so I guess I was wrong in that."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,">to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory.

The show is set on Earth, the coordinates in the show are from the fictional 2058 year Earth the show is set in.  Boom, a bazillion times more compelling than your horseshit."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,A LOT of people thought that was a possibility at first.  But then the show revealed what occurred.  And everyone but Cody accepts the show (and show runner and cast interviews).  He apparently knows better than everyone who made the show smh.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,I was actually enjoying season 1 right up until Hanna started sneaking out to go to teenager parties or some shit. Everything that was cool/interesting about the show just came to a grinding halt. Stopped watching and never went back.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"I made it to epi 6 and wanted to take a sledge hammer to the TV in frustration over how soul-robbingly bad the writing was. thank you, OP, for clarifying that nothing improves in the last 2 episodes of the season. f this show. not going to bother w/ season 3 either"
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"My favorite part was Sandy acting like she was in some Cult buying into a cover story that she had to know was fake, but seemingly didn't seem to know it was fake."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"Season 1 had it's moments yes, but it became boring and silly. Season 2 is just hilariously bad."
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,Haha yes this show is sadly very terrible.
Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona,"I can fanwank that by saying the UTRAX trainees had no sense of identity at all, so they willingly glommed on to the first one they were given.

Unfortunately, they doesn't work to explain Clara, and it *definitely* doesn't explain Hanna. They really dropped the ball in the writing department by having Hanna ever consider buying into the program. I was really hoping it was going to be revealed that she was playing a long con, but no dice – it seems like the writers really wanted us to swallow the idea that Hanna would actually willingly succumb.

All that said, season #2, esp. the second half, was largely a ""reimagining"" of the TV series *La Femme Nikita*, and if you're going to ""steal"" from something, steal from something good.

So, I think in the end I was less disappointed with season #2 than I was with season #1 (which compares really *unfavorably* to the movie, except for one fight scene in a train station which topped the film), and I'm actually curious to see where they'd take this in season #3. I actually think Hanna vs. Sandy & Jules could be mildly interesting."
Extracurricular,what is the definition of is?
Extracurricular,"I'm avoiding this Korean show like the plague, posts like this pushing it is why."
Extracurricular,[deleted]
Extracurricular,why tho?
Extracurricular,"Really? I actually don't know.

I just watched the movie and I have many dejavu of Breaking Bad, so I thought I want to share this post and discussed it with you guys."
Extracurricular,"I'd love to see a season focused on ""The French Connection"" and a follow up past that in a following season to the Frank Lucas era.

We have a whole other ""drug"" war from the 60s and 70s to explore.

Also do we know enough about Tse Chi Lop to explore ""The Asian El Chapo"" ?"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroZeroZero

ZeroZeroZero is an Italian crime drama television series created by Stefano Sollima, Leonardo Fasoli and Mauricio Katz for Sky Atlantic, Canal+ and Amazon Prime Video."
Extracurricular,Would be good to see one based on the golden triangle and the pacific trade.
Extracurricular,Narcos: Canadian Dairy Cartel
Extracurricular,"Narcos: High School

A high school student makes crystal meth and sells it at school. A special team of police officers who look like teenagers go undercover."
Extracurricular,I'd like to see a season set during the Vietnam war when heroine was being smuggled into the country in solder's coffins.
Extracurricular,"This month **Narcos-Saints** premiered on Netflix. It's a korean show about a Korean drug boss in the South American country Suriname.

It's loosely based on real events of the life of real drug boss Jo Bong Haeng. Jo is said to have created a channel of drug smuggling and supply in the 1990s while he was in Suriname. He was arrested in 2009 in a joint investigation by South Korea, Brazil and the United States."
Extracurricular,The blonde American actor from season 1 of Narcos being in Netflix’s The Sandman made me realize I never finished this show! And now I plan on going back and watching
Extracurricular,"As a Brazilian, I would like to see a show focused on São Paulo in the 1990s and early 2000s. That's when the largest Brazilian criminal organization was founded.

HBO did a great documentary about this. It was released a few months ago on HBO Max Latin America. (edit: it was released in the US as *PCC, Secret Power*)"
Extracurricular,"A story about this guy would be awesome
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khun_Sa"
Extracurricular,What I'd like to see is what was actually going on in the CIA during this time.
Extracurricular,"triads or Yakuza, need me some Asian trafficking"
Extracurricular,Frank Larry Matthews (aka Black Ceaser). I'm a bit amazed theres never been a big production about him. He was bigger than Frank Lucas.
Extracurricular,A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling. The show glossed over the entire thing
Extracurricular,"I've heard Sacred Games is like an Indian Narcos, and even though it's not based on a true story you could possibly enjoy that if what they say is true."
Extracurricular,I came here to recommend ZeroZeroZero too. Such an amazing show.
Extracurricular,"No meth, but Extracurricular is about a teen prostitution broker."
Extracurricular,"We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice

“Deputy Chief Hardy-21 Jump Street”"
Extracurricular,"> Netflix’s The Sandman

Ohhh that's where i know him from"
Extracurricular,">	The blonde American actor 


Put some god damn respect [Boyd Holbrook’s](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm2933542/?ref_=m_ttfcd_cl2) name. He’s earned it."
Extracurricular,It would be funny if they cast a Colombian to play a Brazilian main character.
Extracurricular,">A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling.

Do you want to see him snuggle with his wife or with his mistress?"
Extracurricular,Yea it was just hinted at the first episode. Kind of like a prequel of sorts I guess
Extracurricular,"The Mexican parts were awesome, the USA/Italian parts were lacking in comparison. But a really good overall"
Extracurricular,"Colombian*

*sigh*"
Extracurricular,Preferably with El Cuddlio
Extracurricular,"No, I was referring to an inhabitant of the city in South Carolina :-)

A proud city with a history of public drunkenness, gambling and poor sanitation (this is actually true, the city put it on their website)."
Extracurricular,"Everyone points to Squid Game as some breakthrough, but Netflix already had the strongest library of Korean TV content in the US for awhile. Their international productions and rights acquisitions is I think one of Netflix's most underappreciated features."
Extracurricular,It’s crazy how quickly Korea has blossomed into a media giant on the world stage. Both on the music front (Kpop) and the movie/tv scene. Korean media has really managed to push through to the the mainstream general public.
Extracurricular,"It's genuinely a good thing that Netflix made foreign shows known. If Netflix did not distribute Squid Game, I'm pretty sure the general public would never have seen it or have any interest in watching shows that are not North American or European. All good to them, they took a risk and it paid off greatly."
Extracurricular,This is great - I would love to more Japanese content as well…
Extracurricular,"All of us are dead, Money Heist Korea, Glitch, Somebody, Black Knight, Accidental Narco were already on my watchlist but the rest sounds interesting too."
Extracurricular,"That’s fantastic, I’d also like more Indonesian action movies please Netflix 😀"
Extracurricular,"Happy about this, but I hope Netflix considering investing more in other Asian countries too. The Taiwanese section is decent but could always be bigger, Japanese section is really thin, and I've already run through the best Thai shows."
Extracurricular,"Just hope they are the quality of Squid Game, Kingdom, Alive, etc and NOT The Silent Sea - that series was hot garbage"
Extracurricular,I don’t usually watch foreign shows and movies but I really enjoyed squid games so I’m kind of excited for this. I’d like more options. There’s a Japanese reality show I watch that I like a lot too lol
Extracurricular,I hope they make more zombie stuff
Extracurricular,Go Asia!
Extracurricular,i wish netflix would let us screen out shows that are not in our chosen language. they dont tell you. you have to start watching the stupid trailer to find out. its really annoying.
Extracurricular,"Having witnessed firsthand the garbage childrens shows that come from Korea, I sincerely hope these new shows aim for the quality of Squid Game."
Extracurricular,"I love, love korean movies but so far the shows on Netflix has left me mostly cold.

""Squid Game"": Struggling to find the interest to continue with episode 3.

""My Name"": Decent but way too long, I bowed out after 6.

""Hellbound"": Just ... bad from episode 1.

""Silent Sea"": Same as 'My Name' - way to long.

""Sweet Home"": Well, I did finish this one. Not bad."
Extracurricular,"what were they in prison for????

how does Netflix have the ability to pardon????"
Extracurricular,Meh
Extracurricular,Aaaaand oversaturation in 3-2-1.
Extracurricular,"Yeah, they also have a ton of spanish language content, from original movies and shows to back catalogue telenovelas and old movies.

 It's almost like Netflix wants to be the late 2000s/early 2010s Netflix in non English markets."
Extracurricular,Not in just US. Their Korean content is more than enough for many people from different countries to sub Netflix. Netflix was smart to go into making originals from different countries. Like you said some people discovered Korean shows with SG but Netflix has been making Korean shows for years.
Extracurricular,"Aye!  It gives them a steady stream of new things while also supporting productions that would have little chance making it to Western screens.

Everybody gets profit and attention!"
Extracurricular,"It's also a feature that helps them immensely, well, internationally. Most countries get local content (which sometimes explodes globally like Lupin, Money Heist or Squid Game) which other services don't do (when they're even present globally).  

That's one of their big advantage in the so-called streaming wars"
Extracurricular,"I want the oldboy trilogy, and the Host on Canadian netflix and I will be sooooo happy."
Extracurricular,Any good recs for other Korean shows? Loved Squig Game and Sweethome.
Extracurricular,"Dude, Kingdom is one of the best shows on Netflix it got me into watching the Korean content on Netflix"
Extracurricular,Dark was amazing and I only learned of it because I’m teaching myself German. Netflix has gone down in quality over the years in American productions but their international stuff is good. Great for people learning languages compared to other streaming services.
Extracurricular,"Well the South Korean government really believes in cultural export as a form of geopolitics and dedicates a lot of resources to it. It's called Hallyu ""Korean wave"" and the government has poured billions into it for the past decade."
Extracurricular,Doubt most non english speaking content would have seen much views. At least for danish content in the past it seemed like majority of the content would be remade as a US show rather than the original
Extracurricular,Money Heist is such a nice sandbox of a concept that with good planning you can churn nice storytelling (the one from Spain wasn't a Netflix original at the beginning...they didn't plan such huge appeal so they had to do weird stuff to expand the story)
Extracurricular,"I've read an article that Netflix higher-ups in the US isn't even aware of Squid Game until it blows up worldwide. These shows are greenlit by the Korean regional executives. 

As for the Silent Sea, I think the visuals and the cast are great, it just lacks some depth in terms of storytelling.

Do check out Hellbound, My Name, D.P. and Move to Heaven, all good Korean shows released last year."
Extracurricular,I thought The Silent Sea was decent.  I had no problem following the plot and would kind of like to see where they would go next with it.  Like would they end up flooding the earth to the point that it would have ended up a big ball of ice well up into the stratosphere... or could they have found a way to use the water in a more controlled way.
Extracurricular,[deleted]
Extracurricular,Knowing how Netflix likes to go into a frenzy and forget about quality when they are on a bender I do not have much hope. Hopefully the talent in Korea sticks to their guns.
Extracurricular,"Kingdom S3: Back to the Kingdom

Extracurricular,There’s a zombie show coming next Friday
Extracurricular,"I often find that Korean shows drag a bit too much. They're often 60 mins an episode when they could be 45.

That's why I like Korean movies better. I'll copy past some recommendations I posted elsewhere itt

Action: Steel rain, Train to Busan, 

Drama: House of Hummingbird, Innocent Witness, Drug King, any Bong Joon Ho film"
Extracurricular,What? That's like saying Netflix is oversaturated with shows in English. Korean is a language not a genre
Extracurricular,"I personally like Argon, Kingdom, It's Okay To Not Be Okay, Lovestruck in the City, and Romance is Bonus Book. Out of those I'd recommend Kingdom for you."
Extracurricular,I like Extracurricular
Extracurricular,"Dont sleep on Korean cinema either. Here's some recommendations

Action: Steel rain, Train to Busan, 

Drama: House of Hummingbird, Innocent Witness, Drug King, any Bong Joon Ho film"
Extracurricular,"Prison Playbook, Move To Heaven, Reply series (1988, 94, 97), Hotel Del Luna."
Extracurricular,"I’ve said for a little while now that the complete lack of Chinese media penetration into western markets is a huge blunder on their end. People will be tend to be far less antagonistic towards a country if they’re actively listening to their music or watching their movies. It truly is soft power.

With how large and wealthy China is (and the massive amount of expats they have) there’s no reason why their media should be non-existent in the west when Korean and Japanese media is so prominent."
Extracurricular,"The ""Korean Wave"" is not a national project. The South Korean government uses money only for the revitalize the domestic Kpop market for the past decade(And officially began supporting the Korean Wave in June 2020).

Foreign companies (Like Netflix) are still investing much more money into Korean Contents."
Extracurricular,Loved chestnut man though. Idk if it was a big hit
Extracurricular,"I forgot to mention Hellbound - I thought it was good. Neat premise but nothing too special, but good. 

I'll check it the others"
Extracurricular,Just literally the writing was soooo bad. Nothing made sense. No continuity. Just pure trash
Extracurricular,Hell yes
Extracurricular,"K-dramas are absolutely their own genre and have been a prioritzied cultural export from the south Korean government for a long time. First to countries in the region and in later years the west. 

Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of Korean film and television and have been for a long time. My comment was flippant, but I feel like the massive growth in series production worldwide while in some respects good, also devalues the medium. To put it frankly there is a lot of dogshit and just passable shows within the already 500 that are produced every year. Adding 25 different shows regardless of nationality just adds to an already oversaturated market."
Extracurricular,"I actually have watched Kingdom, and loved it too. Ill check out the others. Thanks!"
Extracurricular,"> People will be tend to be far less antagonistic towards a country if they’re actively listening to their music or watching their movies. It truly is soft power.

I mean, Hollywood, brands and media are a big part of why the USA has become so powerful in the second half of the 20th century. American culture being exported everywhere."
Extracurricular,"And they had it to a certain degree with Hong Kong, but the HK film industry was falling apart just as Korea's was seeing massive new investment after the runaway success of *Shiri*. Which happened right as the HK handover took place. Then China proceeded to push mainland media rather than attempt to rescue HK."
Extracurricular,[removed]
Extracurricular,A few of the Chinese movies that Netflix do bring over like Yin-Yang Master and Nezha are pretty good when compared to your average Netflix original movie. They just need to have more of them. I have no idea about their tv shows though.
Extracurricular,"Chinese dramas have some popularity in the West, at least among women and teenage girls, although obviously not as much as K-dramas. [The Untamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untamed_(TV_series)) is the probably the most popular one in the West.  It's in the Boys' Love (BL) category (same-sex relationship rebranded as ""bromance"") which the government has started censoring. A quick search on Tumblr turns up lots of [fan art](https://www.tumblr.com/search/the%20untamed). There's even a sub: r/CDrama

Other popular titles are A Love So Beautiful, Word of Honor, Nirvana In Fire, Ashes in Love, Ruyi's Royal Love, Eternal Love. A lot of these are available on Netflix. I've also watched some Chinese dramas on Viki and there are lots of viewer comments in English, Spanish, etc.

**EDIT**: China excels more in historical dramas which might be harder for non-Chinese viewers to get into and also a lot of them have 30 to 50 episodes, unlike K-dramas which typically only have 16 episodes."
Extracurricular,"Well, there is a reason - internal censorship,"
Extracurricular,">  People will be tend to be far less antagonistic towards a country if they’re actively listening to their music or watching their movies

exhibit A: the US"
Extracurricular,Have you watched the Kingdom movie?
Extracurricular,"Not really?  By 1950 the USA was a massive chunk of the world's economy well over 50%. You literally could not avoid doing business with the USA unless you were part of the Warsaw Pact.  If you wanted a machine that built the machines that built cars, boats, fixtures etc you essentially only had one nation to buy from. The US dominance came from being that sole supplier of everything for decades. The reason why US movies and TV took off was because there wasn't many nations making films, radio programs, and TV shows  to export because so much of the focus was on rebuilding after WWII."
Extracurricular,Decent art might focus on things the party does not want to encourage.
Extracurricular,"> Chinese politics makes chinese soft power through media an impossibility


Not really.

Americans and Europeans even post WW2 were butchering and murdering innocent women and children all over the planet and yet Hollywood and Western cultural products were still selling/dominating/having a market.

It's about money and scale. A country that is rich gets by just fine in selling itself and its products (real or non-tangible) regardless of what its politics are. It may not sell in a rival peer but that doesn't matter since the West is ~12% of the planet by people.

Chinese media/entertainment production is behind peers because the peers have matured and saturated to a very high-quality level hence it takes longer to break through (this is analogous to breaking in a globally dominant sport for countries that are late to the development on that sport) and secondly because that is not a priority item for the Chinese State or Govt.

Korea had Public/State level help in early stages after which they became good and no longer needed it (K-wave didn't start last year with Squid Games, it's decades old)."
Extracurricular,Oh I did not know there was a movie!
Extracurricular,"Economy maybe but power is larger than just the economy. It's currently impossible to do without China on any economic stuff too and yet, the country doesn't have a positive impression overseas. The US had one mostly because of its culture being spread notably by Hollywood, its brands and all that (also in a fight against communism of course)"
Extracurricular,Asheen of the North or something like that? I am sure you will find it. It is a prequel but also directly connected to the end of season 2. Have fun watching.
Extracurricular,At that time there really wasn't many other options.
Extracurricular,"Uh yeah there were local cinema industries in most countries that mostly got destroyed over time notably because of American competition. Also, not speaking of only movies there, culture is larger than that"
Extracurricular,"There was little to no films being produced after the war in most of Europe and tvs were essentially non-existent for most people until the 1960s.  

American competition isnt what destroyed these cinemas it was war. It took decades for Europe to come back from WWII"
Extracurricular,Just give me another season of Kingdom and I'll be happy.
Extracurricular,[deleted]
Extracurricular,I wish netflix still had Train to busan (as well as the 2nd) available in canada. but I'd settle for another season of Kingdom!
Summertime,"rights for shows are sold by region... wait... i feel like i said that wrong. lol. but yea, disney+ can't have a worldwide release for X-show because another streaming service/network holds the rights to X-show in another region. 

And yea Netflix have the same issue for some shows, but they are usually good at snatching up shows for worldwide releases."
Summertime,"I have found that with some of these they go to Hulu instead. One example is the Running Man Korean variety show spin off and it went to Hulu eventually, but there was also a large delay before it did."
Summertime,I'll see a new Kdrama coming out and I'll get excited for it but then I'll see its Disney+ which means there will be no legal way to watch it. I still watch them but  I'd prefer to do it through a streaming service than a somewhat sketchy website. Recently there was Bloody Heart and Big Mouth which were really good but only on Disney+. I'm not going to complain too much though since watching Kdramas has never been easier with Netflix and Viki. When I got into them like 10+ years ago it was mostly all sketchy websites with maybe a few showing up on Netflix or Hulu.
Summertime,The obvious explanation is that they only bought the rights for certain regions/countries because they didn't think that there'd be enough return to justify it elsewhere.
Summertime,"Hulu has a bunch of anime, including simulcast. The plan is for Disney to buy Comcast out of Hulu in I believe 2024

I *think* they are keeping Disney+ as the Kids/Star Wars/Marvel service and very thing else will go to Hulu, including the anime"
Summertime,"I think there are probably more behind the scene shenanigans more than anything. Proclaiming that it's not popular enough, for a service that always needs more content, is just incredibly stupid when you look at whats going on. The fact k-pop is massive is a wonderful example. So it's either behind the scenes crap or Disney has no idea how to market it to the west, when the way to do it just toss it out there."
Summertime,"As an Australian D+ user and anime fan, it's been incredibly wild to have access to all their current anime pick-ups (Black Rock Shooter Dawn Fall, Summer Time Rendering and as of last week, Tatami Time Machine Blues) while most of the world doesn't.

Even their roll-out plans continue to puzzle me, Black Rock Shooter Dawn Fall has finished (both airing in Japan and the delayed simulcast we got) for awhile now and almost every episode is dubbed (in several foreign languages) with multiple subtitle tracks by now (in fact only the final episode lacks an English dub as of this post)

Similarly Summer Time Rendering has been gradually rolling in various foreign language dubs and subs on random episodes but still no sign whatsoever of them bringing it to more countries.

If they were gonna fumble the ball this hard, they should've stuck to making anime of their own IPs (like Star Wars Visions and the upcoming Twisted Wonderland) rather than just trying take a bite out of the seasonal anime pie."
Summertime,"Its simple, they dont buy them because there is no audience for them. The only way to watch most asian shows is with fan made subtitles on ""morally grey"" platforms"
Summertime,"I don’t think there's much of an international audience; there's certainly more awareness today than 20 years ago, but it's still an incredibly narrow niche. that brings the question as to why did they buy them in the first place, and the answer is who the hell knows"
Summertime,"The value of this stuff in the western world is probably less than zero to Disney, all it does is clog up Hulu/D+ services with irrelevant content."
Summertime,"> disney+ can't have a worldwide release for X-show because another streaming service/network holds the rights to X-show in another region

The problem is there is no such thing for these shows. That why I said it seems they have exclusive overseas streaming right. It's not like if it's not available on disney+ on your region outside the home country, it will suddenly be on netflix or other streaming service. It's simply unavailable.  

Obviously it's my guess, but I didn't find any exception to this. Usually, the shows are available on local tv or streaming service in their home country, and only on disney+ overseas, if it's available."
Summertime,Until this whole bullshit stops we all should be sailing the mighty seas.  Fuck them.
Summertime,"> Running Man Korean

That doesn't seem to be Disney+ thing. At least mydramalist didn't list disney+ as one of the streamers. Perhaps only on disney+ korea?

https://colaski.github.io/global-streaming-search/ didn't show it's on disney+ anywhere."
Summertime,"If it's so obvious, why aren't the shows available on other streaming services? On netflix for example. Again, it's not random obscure shows. They are shows people want to watch. Big names are attached to it, sequel of fan favorite, that kind of thing."
Summertime,"I think they are already somewhat doing it, with both disney+ and star/hotstar being available in many countries."
Summertime,"America was always at the center-piece of everything pop-culture, they made it. But something changed: fast Internet. Now the entire world discovered the massive cultural output of Japan via pirating and a dedicated niche fanbase which stopped being niche like seven years ago translating kanji as fast as possible. And where is product, there is consumers. 

This is unprecendented in history for the story of entertainment being distributed worldwide, because the demand is coming from outside for the inside, instead of America distributing their culture around the world, from inside to outside. Disney and other american companies are simply unprepared for it."
Summertime,Is this why people were worried about Disney getting the rights to the new bleach adaptation?
Summertime,[deleted]
Summertime,there's definitely value for anime and k-drama in the u.s. what u talkin' bout...
Summertime,Just look to Netflix to know that's not true at all.
Summertime,"It's possible that somebody else has those rights in those countries but doesn't use them, or even that Disney doesn't think it's worth it to buy them for every country but only for some of them."
Summertime,"Nope, I'm talking about the spinoff which I couldn't think of off the top of my head. It's called Outrun. It's now on Hulu, but for months it wasn't on either in the US, but in other countries it was on Disney +"
Summertime,"Because Netflix doesn't think it's worth the money either.

They're all looking at basically the same data.  The fact that none of the big streamers are interested in picking it up is a big hint as to what the data shows."
Summertime,[deleted]
Summertime,"Yeah but they had that before they bought Fox so I don’t know if they are gonna do a giant Disney+ with Fox stuff and adult programming or two separate services

I think they’re gonna do2 services in the US"
Summertime,"Japan has been exporting it's cultural identity for 50 years.  And it really tuned up 20-30 years ago

Really it's Korean and Indian exports that are seeing a wider spread thanks to the internet and streaming services looking for easy content"
Summertime,"Pretty much yeah. Though in Bleach's case, [the new anime has been licensed by Viz Media](https://twitter.com/TheOASG/status/1472258515989315593) (who also has the prior anime series, films and manga) and they [announced it will be simulcasting from October 10](https://twitter.com/VIZMedia/status/1568902215049560067) though they haven't specified where just yet."
Summertime,"Anime ownership is mostly Sony, there is wild amounts made and Sony basically has rights to almost everything thats being produced in japan. Aniplex is just one vehicle. Its really baffling how much is made in japan.

Yup I know these pretty well, I'm not a fan but did a lot of work on the business side of it. Anime ecosystem really is its own little beast, and in the west very little of it trickles out, so western anime fans often have a super skewed perception of the business of it since they see only their little sliver of the world and how it is presented in the west."
Summertime,[removed]
Summertime,"Yeah, in the end we can only speculate. But it's the current fact that these shows are not available outside disney+ overseas."
Summertime,"Oops, my bad."
Summertime,"And if they showed up later in other regions, what's your explanation then? Like the two shows I mentioned in the OP. 

How do you excuse the release gap, even though Netflix could do it just fine with their Asian shows, movies, and anime?"
Summertime,"His claim: Disney+ only bought rights for certain regions.  
My point: Why don't Netflix and other services bought rights for the other regions then?  

That doesn't happen. Because disney plus actually has the rights for all regions. That was my guess.

Imo, this is all just speculations about how things work behind the scene.  

Basically, Netflix is able to release the shows worldwide simultaneously. Disney+ can't."
Summertime,"Dude, I gather you have never heard of Squid Game? I’ll enlighten you. It was one of the biggest Streaming TV shows in the US in 2021!"
Summertime,Anime is really popular in the US and Netflix's biggest show ever is a Korean show but sure absolutely no value at all. Great work as always.
Summertime,"Yes, this literally proves my point (keep reading below). There is sole exception. One. The tens of thousands of other properties don't even register. The value is zero.

To put content up on a service its a pretty big deal, you really have to prove its worthwhile and affecting churn. These random shows will do nothing in viewership and instead will just clutter up an english language service with completely random subtitled asian content that no one wants or knows what it is.  No mom in Iowa is turning on some random Korean drama on Disney+ after the kids just watched Frozen for the 165th time."
Summertime,"Anime is not really popular, its still ultra niche, and what makes it to the west is a tiny tiny fraction of it, there is an insane amount of anime made (and again most by Sony) what you see in the west is such a tiny part of it and even that is very very niche.  As I said, there are rare exceptions, Squid Game is an ultra rare exception. It basically proves the point, there is no market for this stuff, nothing else is there. No Korean Dramas, no japanese game shows, etc. The western world does not want it. Content goes West ->East and not the other way."
Summertime,">Yes, this literally proves my point (keep reading below). There is sole exception. One. The tens of thousands of other properties don't even register. The value is zero.

All of us are dead, Kingdom, Sweet Home, D.P., Hellbound, Money Heist (Korean remake), Juvenile Justice, The Silent Sea, My Name

And Netflix bought shit like Extraordinary Attorney Woo for international distribution"
Summertime,"That would make sense, except several other Korean shows have broken through on Netflix in America. So I guess it's not an exception, it's a trend. But I have no idea why I'm even trying to argue with someone that thinks anime is niche. Stuck in the 90s I guess."
Summertime,"> As I said, there are rare exceptions, Squid Game is an ultra rare exception. It basically proves the point, there is no market for this stuff, nothing else is there. 

Netflix continually commissions and buys a ton of K-dramas for western audiences."
Summertime,"> As I said, there are rare exceptions, Squid Game is an ultra rare exception. It basically proves the point

Exception that proves the rule. That makes sense.  

I guess you're right. Disney+ probably has made the calculations, and came to the conclusion it's not worth it. Netflix did a lot of worldwide streaming, and now they are in financial trouble lol. Just sucks if you want to watch these shows legally."
Summertime,"Anime is niche, and again theere are rare exceptions, but nearly everything is zero value. Anime is niche, it just has a lot of loud voices, especially on reddit.  Its also good to understand how tiny amount of anime ever even makes it to the west and even of those only a ultra select few ever get any notoriety. The anime production and distro process is totally wild, not sure how much you know of it, but its really wild. That I understand the process its a lot easier to understand how niche anime still is in the west. Its most  certainly growing and trending upward, but its still in the niche category. Sony also really isn't helping to push it, which is odd, they really wanted to as tentpole, but looks like they kinda just didn't push it as hard as they said they would (FYI Sony owns 80%+ of all anime being made)"
Summertime,A small % of anime is still a lot of anime that is watched by tons of weebs in US and Europe.
Summertime,"> Anime is niche

I don't like how you used the word niche here, I feel like you're just generalizing anime (and K-dramas). 

Like... wouldn't you say most of the shows HBO has released over the years (besides of course Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire and maybe Succession and Euphoria etc.) are niche? Wouldn't you say shows like Girls, Insecure, Carnivale, The Deuce, Barry etc. are niche?? 

Anime has some pretty big hitters that I'm sure are much more popular in the west than those shows I just mentioned. Demon Slayer? Attack on Titan? Death Note? Naruto? Bleach? I don't think Squid Game is the only exception at all when it comes to shows from the east."
Summertime,"You certainly wrote a lot here, credit for that. You didn't say much but you definitely wrote a lot."
Summertime,"> Its most certainly growing and trending upward, but its still in the niche category.

Now I start thinking it in terms of conspiratorial way lol. No benefit for disney+ to promote alternative entertainment like asian dramas or anime in the west. It may cannibalize the stuffs Disney makes, their core competence like cartoons and other shows/movies. If the Asian stuffs get really popular, there is no reason for them to go through disney plus to access the non-Asian market.  

They want to enter the Asian market, so they bought many Asian shows. Simple as that. And sometimes they release them outside the home country."
Summertime,[deleted]
Summertime,My guess is you don't know how the anime production/distro ecosystem works in that case. Its really weird. Its not like any other film/tv properties.
Summertime,"Yup pretty much. This content is not for the west. They probably got a variety of country rights for it, but there's not need for it next to The Incredibles"
Summertime,"They own probably 80% of anime distribution in the US now; maybe that's what they meant? But yeah, they definitely don't own the rights *in general* for that much stuff."
Summertime,Direct from Sony. There is absolutely insane amounts of anime made and most of it one way or another is owned by sony.
Summertime,"It might be the weirdest thing on earth, that doesn't mean that anime isn't popular in America."
Summertime,You keep saying this and yet you've provided no evidence for the claim whatsoever beyond the fact that you supposedly have personal experience. Start providing some actual sources or the argument is pointless; it still seems much more likely that at the most generous assumption you're confusing their percentage of distribution licenses with their percentage of full ownership.
Summertime,"> There is absolutely insane amounts of anime made and most of it one way or another is owned by sony.

I think you should clarify that when you say ""own by Sony"", you mean they own the distribution rights in the U.S. Those rights will definitely expire someday, so really, these anime are *owned* by their respective production studios in Japan."
Summertime,it's normal show but I don't like the ending it really let audience feel the winter is coming like why all women in this show have to support there loved man to go out follow their dreams and they end up in this small town(the main character summer and her mother also)
Summertime,"been a while since this thread is active but what age is edo meant to be? i find the dynamic between him and blue a little odd despite her being a child and not knowing any better , why does edo never actively say you’re too young?"
Summertime,I watched the whole thing just to watch something. But it's terrible really.
Summertime,"Yeah it's not great, if you want something like that Love 101 is way better"
Summertime,"What beach town is this supposed to be?  All I can find online is ""Adriatic Coast"""
Summertime,👏 THANK 👏 YOU 👏 No but seriously I’ve never stopped watching a show halfway because it sucked so badly despite having all the “elements” of a decent show. Oh and don’t get me started on the soundtrack. It was a phenomenal selection but whoever was in charge managed to fuck it up with tone and mood mismatch. -2/10 don’t recommend.
Summertime,"Someone told me to check it out becuase I apparently looked like the main girl (I guess being black and skinny is all it takes) but so far it's a glossy commercial with little substance, very much extended edition sunscreen ad vibes"
Summertime,Does anyone know what the black race bike Ale rides is ?
Summertime,"Why is everybody on this show in ""love"" without spending ANY time together"
Summertime,"2nd times being recommended this, but i just can't it looks dumb lol."
Summertime,who tf knows.
Summertime,Cesenatico
Summertime,"no but i suggest getting a screenshot and asking on a bike subreddit, or using reverse google image search."
Summertime,"It's a lot less stupid than sounds, it's like turkeys version of freaks and geeks with some slight differences"
Summertime,it's amazing you may seem a little bit unreal but the chemistry between the characters are amazing!
Summertime,"> Cesenatico

Cool, that's way further north than I was thinking."
Summertime,"aiight, bet. i might still check it out."
Summertime,"You've just reminded me that I still haven't seen that 5th season they made a few years after I watched the first 4.

I have great memories of the show and I'll probably watch it again someday. If anyone out there a car nerd or loves playing racing games you'll love the show, if not I'm not sure that you'll get much out of it.

I'm with you that the first season was probably my favorite too."
Summertime,"Yes. 

I stopped at Initial D."
Summertime,Ma-masaka? Kansei Dorifto? *Eurobeat intensifies*
Summertime,">banging *eurobeat* track

[I'M A SPACE BOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUTNX0FDPA)"
Summertime,I completely disagree the show is so darn good and I'm extremely excited to see more episodes. My only complaint is that I am not able to binge it.
Summertime,Big thumbs down for this topic
Summertime,"I'm not sure what episode they were on 20 days ago, but can I say at this point, I'm in LOVE. The show started enjoyable but nothing special. It has turned into such an odd wondeful edge of your seat adventure. Similar to Under the Silver Lake but more accessible. Definitely not a show for everyone but I am thoroughly enjoying it."
Summertime,"Hmm disagree, I think it's well done and Peacock's best show so far."
Summertime,I've been with my husband 11 years and hate to break it to you but I think I've ended up on that same Buzzfeed quiz before. Relatable AF man.
Summertime,"Well, time to downvote, kill, and eat anyone who likes the show because they must be shills. 

I don't get why it's cringe for someone to look up ""should I leave my relationship""? I mean, lots of people do that, there are tons of places for relationship advice all over the internet. 

I've never even seen the show but your two examples of why it's awful are pretty fucking mild jokes. It sounds like it's not the next Frasier but I didn't find either of those moments as you've described them to be horrifically cringey in a way that's not the point - because cringe humor does in fact exist."
Summertime,"I’ve enjoyed the three episodes I’ve watched so far,it’s light “turn your brain off and enjoy” tv."
Summertime,my major issue is I'm still thinking milioti is the same character from Made for love.  That and they have no chemistry as a couple.  Just like he didn't have any chemistry with bell in the good place.
Summertime,I like it. Pure summertime fun.
Summertime,"If nothing else, I find it amusing that the characters are so drunk while doing all of this. Eh, it's alright. I'm gonna see where it goes."
Summertime,It's turned out to be great. Very funny too. We're 4 episodes in now. Give it a chance or don't whinge.
Summertime,I freaking loved it
Summertime,You should lighten up. It’s a comedy and the parts that made you “cringe” are funny.
Summertime,It’s not amazing in terms of a mystery show but watching it as a comedy show that’s fun and I’m really enjoying it
Summertime,It's no White Lotus. Watchable fluff though. I'll see it through.
Summertime,I absolutely love the show lol it’s fun
Summertime,Calm down
Summertime,"Let’s be honest, peacock isn’t great. That show with the woman who had a bar in her back garden was the best thing they’ve done and that was only just watchable"
Summertime,Well peacock is the worst streaming service.
Summertime,haha Rusev changing his name to Roman Reigns...because Roman Reigns never loses
Summertime,[deleted]
Summertime,That’s your opinion.
Summertime,This is one of the worst shows of the year. My wife wants me to cancel peacock if they’re going to make crap Ike this and barely have anything else to offer. Trash streaming service
Summertime,I liked the show a lot. Those cringe moments were supposed to be silly IMO.
Summertime,Yeah it’s great

Never Have I Ever,Should have ended when pops died
Never Have I Ever,"He definitely hated being on that show, lol."
Never Have I Ever,"For someone who did not want to be on the show, he was pretty good.

The Goldbergs should have been canceled about 3 years ago."
Never Have I Ever,He should join Curb Season 12 instead.
Never Have I Ever,"Apparently Jeff is an asshole. He was mean to other actors and actresses on set and would complain a lot.

But what I do find absolutely hilarious is what brought about the internal investigation that led to him leaving The Goldbergs.

Apparently, every time he would get up from a chair or couch on set, he'd yell, ""Ow, my vagina!"".  He was asked multiple times to stop doing this, but this fucking moron *just wouldn't let up*.

He thought this bit of his was so good that he decided this is the hill to die on. Every time, ""Ow, my vagina"" until he was pulled off the show. Incredible."
Never Have I Ever,"There was a Doug Loves Movies episode where Doug brought out his most annoying guests, and Jeff was one of them. He was completely unaware of how annoying he was and was very upset about it. I don't know how many times this dude needs to be told his attitude sucks."
Never Have I Ever,Back in 2018 he admitted to loving being on The Goldbergs when he appeared on Joe Rogan but I feel just like the fans he felt the show declined in quality so he did anything he could to get fired
Never Have I Ever,Mindy Kaling continues to make baffling choices as a showrunner.
Never Have I Ever,"I love Jeff Garlin. I feel like he’s annoying to people who aren’t a fan of his, and I get it. But his character on Curb is gold."
Never Have I Ever,Great. Now he can scream vagina at a whole new cast and crew.
Never Have I Ever,">It's hard when you have a high school show, because you can't keep them in high school forever

That's why you go the South Park route and have animated characters in 4th grade for 25 years"
Never Have I Ever,"I’m surprised Mindy Kaling was okay with this.

She’s usually pretty progressive in terms of production conduct and he’s been so… problematic.

But dang, he’s a great actor and really funny."
Never Have I Ever,Garlin used to be Conan O'Brian's roomie when they were coming up. I wonder if he has any stories about Jeff behaving badly?
Never Have I Ever,Wait what the hell did Jeff garlin do???
Never Have I Ever,VAGINA!
Never Have I Ever,"Why the fuck do people keep hiring this guy? He's fucking awful to people. I've seen it firsthand on set. Chewing out PA's, berating covid compliance people, refusing to wear a mask at times, vulgar slurs, seriously. Never Have I Ever, I hope it's worth it, Mindy lol."
Never Have I Ever,Oh this is disappointing for Never Have I Ever.
Never Have I Ever,What’s weird is that he played Crazy Gut Gut in that 80’s T&A movie Spring Break
Never Have I Ever,Woah a creep faced zero long term stigma and instantly got another high paying job in Hollywood?
Never Have I Ever,F that.  Barry is the reason to watch the Goldbergs.  Him and JTG.
Never Have I Ever,Fcck that guy blaming mental diseases
Never Have I Ever,Ew why
Never Have I Ever,Absolutely wild that no one ever gets actually fucking canceled for doing things that people claim you can’t do anymore. The dude also completely Trash Talk the show that he was currently on and then gets to move onto another show immediately. Fuck this dude and fuck the people that keep hiring him.
Never Have I Ever,Nice
Never Have I Ever,This is the problem. No real consequences.
Never Have I Ever,are they still doing that show “fresh off free boat”?
Never Have I Ever,Anybody who thinks the Goldbergs was funny needs to get out more
Never Have I Ever,He was good in Californication or was it Seinfeld ? Larry David doods !!! 😸
Never Have I Ever,Owww! My vagina!
Never Have I Ever,"I agree if not before when Adam graduated from high school.

Now it's the same plot every week. Mom does something stupid & embarrasses the kids, kids get angry & this makes mom sad, they apologize for being mean, sometimes mom apologizes, lather rinse repeat.

Sometimes neighbors, friend or co-workers get involved but it's still the same shit different week. It just got boring.

I would love to see the kid that plays Barry in something else soon though because he's got great comic timing, but he may be typecast at this point."
Never Have I Ever,That's when it ended for me. My then wife and I watched it every week. Probably the last show we were into together. It parodied my life growing up. So when grandpa Al died.. so did my actual grandpa Al. I was his caregiver for the last 9 months of his life with Alzheimer's and dementia.
Never Have I Ever,They literally added another snappy old man character
Never Have I Ever,The show should have ended years ago. I really enjoyed the early seasons but it's greatly overstayed it's welcome.
Never Have I Ever,Well apparently he joined Goldburgs cause it’s creation was during that 6 year hiatus from Curb so Jeff had no idea if it was coming back. I doubt he also realized Goldburgs was gonna last 10 years. He’s also not used to the 20+ episode a year schedule since he’s ether worked with HBO or does stand up his entire life. He even got asked if he could stay on one show forever it would be curb. He’s also the executive producer for the show.
Never Have I Ever,I thought he was fired for inappropriate behavior on set.
Never Have I Ever,"He hated being on the show and judging by how no one from the cast came out to say how much they'll miss Garlin, no one misses him either.

It's unfortunate, him, after George Segal, was the funniest actor on the show."
Never Have I Ever,Right? He hasn’t quit Curb!
Never Have I Ever,"Yeah, I still watch because I’m attached to the family, but jeez it needed to end a while ago.

It’s so formulaic now.

Bev does something shitty, everyone understandably gets mad, she gets sad, everyone feels bad, everyone apologizes to her for getting mad at her being shitty.

That’s it, that’s the whole episode.  Every episode.  For multiple seasons.  Sometimes they switch it up and have one of the other characters act shitty and then get apologized to as if there shittiness is excused because they didn’t mean to be shitty.

Awful.  It needs to end.  It needed to end a while ago.  I can’t believe they didn’t just end it with the wedding episode with the CG Garlin.  It would have been a fine finale."
Never Have I Ever,"Yeah, they basically covered the whole 80s and refused to stop. The loss of George Segal and firing of Garlin was a good place to stop. But they kept going, and killed off Murray apparently?"
Never Have I Ever,Liked the scene in which he was mistaken for Harvey Weinstein.
Never Have I Ever,He’s not in the 12 season yet? Isn’t he like a main cast member?
Never Have I Ever,That’s so hilariously dumb. Sounds like something that would be in Curb
Never Have I Ever,He didn't WANT to be on the show...so there's that.
Never Have I Ever,I heard he had an affair with his dental hygienist and paid for her abortion!
Never Have I Ever,"The real story is that a female co-star said it once after a long read through session. He, understandably, found it hilarious and kept saying it to tease her."
Never Have I Ever,That's what it was? 😂😂
Never Have I Ever,I heard him interviewed on a podcast a year or so ago. He was eating the entire damn time and it made me think of him as rude as fuck.
Never Have I Ever,I mean this is pretty benign. Childish yes… but pretty inoffensive. Is there more that I’m missing about him
Never Have I Ever,"I hate that the joke was kinda funny to me, and for some reason the fact that he kept doing it gives me a chuckle. But you’re an asshole if you’re asked to stop cause you’re bothering people and you continue anyways. Doesn’t even sound like he wanted to have a conversation or understand what was bothering people, just assumed he was right cause he would know. Like you can still find something funny that other people don’t, and just not say it around them? Right?"
Never Have I Ever,Probably got chuckles from some idiot and that reinforced his “I’m right” attitude.
Never Have I Ever,"I've heard him on podcasts and I completely believe that, he never shuts up for one fucking second and repeats bad bits a million times."
Never Have I Ever,"That was it? I'd been let to believe it was for serious, real sexual misconduct."
Never Have I Ever,Can confirm Jeff Garlic is A HUGE ASSHOLE in real life!
Never Have I Ever,"Imagine how much of an asshole to the core you have to be, to refuse to stop saying a unfunny gross joke at work, to the point they have to fire you over it."
Never Have I Ever,Fucking weak ass cry babies.
Never Have I Ever,Jeff is phenomenal and I’m sure knew that was his contractual out.
Never Have I Ever,"Not an excuse, but isn’t he bipolar?"
Never Have I Ever,Lmfaoooooo
Never Have I Ever,Does he have a vagina? Has anybody checked?
Never Have I Ever,Ba dum bum!
Never Have I Ever,"he was defo looking for an out, haha"
Never Have I Ever,I was at the live tapping of that episode. Must've been like 10 years ago. It was a lot of fun seeing how baffled Garlin was by Pete Holmes and TJ Miller
Never Have I Ever,"It is the second best episode of DLM ever only topped by the ""Jesse Ventura"", ""Mark Wahlberg"" episode."
Never Have I Ever,I think I remember this one. Dude just steamrolled every bit with boomer complaints about marvel movies and then got mad at the audience for not laughing.
Never Have I Ever,"He also started how he didn't personally find the show funny or would watch it, but understood why families liked it."
Never Have I Ever,"Say what you will about her, but Never Have I Ever has been a fantastic series. I think she’s earned the benefit of the doubt on it."
Never Have I Ever,Idk why she said “you can’t make the office today” like that show has been remade for every single language and country and it’s still being ripped off you can certainly make it today
Never Have I Ever,What is most baffling of all is that people always think Mindy Kaling is the showrunner of Never Have I Ever and not Lang Fisher.
Never Have I Ever,[deleted]
Never Have I Ever,"I would think that Jeff Garlin being able to last 10 seasons on the show that fired him, plus decades of a viable career on other huge show before that, shows that if anything the system is largely fine with people like him"
Never Have I Ever,Because he's a talented comedic actor
Never Have I Ever,"I mean, there’s a massive difference between a guy making off-color jokes and someone being a “creep”."
Never Have I Ever,Creep? Are you mixing him up with Harvey Weinstein? Happens to the best of us
Never Have I Ever,I mean I have a friend who has no polar and every few years goes off his meds and acts like a complete whacko. It’s not entirely unheard of..
Never Have I Ever,Call down Susie
Never Have I Ever,Lmao this is such a reddit response
Never Have I Ever,"Actually, fuck you"
Never Have I Ever,"No, darn it!!"
Never Have I Ever,That kid is nearly 30!  He is funny though.
Never Have I Ever,"That’s the shitty thing about being on a show past it’s peak, your career gets stuck for a while."
Never Have I Ever,He played young Jack Black in both Nacho Libre and Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny
Never Have I Ever,Tbf thats been the plot since day 1
Never Have I Ever,"I dropped the show basically because of this lack of creativity for the plots. Every week was the same pattern happening until I couldn’t take it anymore.

And this was about 2 years ago, sad that’s still happening"
Never Have I Ever,"Unrelated to the thread, saw your username and wondering if you’re a Refreshments fan?"
Never Have I Ever,Seriously the show doesn’t have to be this bad.  I know the original show runner left so whoever took over really needs to get over this formula they are so obsessed with or just end it already
Never Have I Ever,"I didn't even realize the show was still going....

I watched it in the first few seasons then it just got to be too ridiculous."
Never Have I Ever,"Yeah I haven't even watched the entire wedding season, the show needed to end 2-3 years ago as it's now outlived its fun"
Never Have I Ever,It's so bad its namesake left lol
Never Have I Ever,No kidding.  It’s amazing how much people like nostalgia.
Never Have I Ever,Yeah I binged up to about halfway through season 6 or 7 and then just got bored
Never Have I Ever,"I I get why he had to leave, but I lost interest shortly after Brian Callen left"
Never Have I Ever,"my mom was watching that when i was a freshman, i graduated years ago… 😂"
Never Have I Ever,I’ve watched it to recent episodes and it’s still funny ass fuck
Never Have I Ever,Which is why shows should be written in their entirety before hand.
Never Have I Ever,I never watched a full episode. I couldn't make it past 5 minutes the few times I tried. Dumb jokes written by unfunny writers.
Never Have I Ever,It's a case where the network and the showrunners and creator are probably pocketing so much money that it makes no sense to end it for them.
Never Have I Ever,"So I admit, I was really young when the show was airing, but I always thought Jeff Garlin was on *Cheers*. I just imdb'd after I read your comment, and I thought he was George Wendt's character this whole fucking time, apparently.

Oops.

edit - also wtf, Jason Sudeikis is George Wendt's nephew??"
Never Have I Ever,"I think he said vagina,   like alot. Which made people uncomfortable."
Never Have I Ever,"They've sure got those trademark ""Goldberg lampshade jokes"" polished to a shine.

"Coronavirus, Explained","That's a pretty good write up.  I disagree with a few points of opinion here and there, but I think it's pretty standard to say that you can't get two NGE fans in a room and have them agree on everyrhing.

I do want to say a few things about the new movies without really going into spoilers.  For the first movie, I think that it did a much smoother job of showing the main character interacting with people, especially with his classmates.  And when it comes to the second movie, the finale is incredibly powerful."

"Coronavirus, Explained","This is a really great guide. I'm not an anime guy, but I watched the show last year and I loved it. But my ears are not used to Japanese voice acting so I switched to the dub a couple episodes into it. So glad your post is fine with dubs!"
"Coronavirus, Explained","i've been wanting to get into this for a while but have never really made sense of it all, guess i'm starting the show today or tomorrow!!!"

"Coronavirus, Explained",I used to live with a guy who was a bit of a weeb who _made_ me watch some Evangelion...in all honesty i found it pretty meh and boring but i had no investment in it at the time.

"Coronavirus, Explained","God damn, this is impressive. I wish I had found this before I finished the series and movie... 6 hours ago. 

You just convinced me to watch the Rebuild movies, but I might wait until 3.0+1.0 comes out. I'm not a fan of incomplete stuff."
"Coronavirus, Explained",Appreciate you for making this. Much thanks. Been debating on watching NGE for weeks so I looked up a guide and this pops up. Answers all my questions 🙏🏽
"Coronavirus, Explained","If the version doesn't have Fly Me to the Moon, I can't watch it."
"Coronavirus, Explained","I’ve seen the core story (26-episodes + End of Evangelion) and I just wanted to thank you for this guide nonetheless because those “remakes” intrigued me and this was so helpful in clearing out my understanding as to why a franchise that seemingly ended in the 90s was still so active.

I’ll check out the rebuild movies and I’m actually excited to do so after learning that it veers wildly out of the original story because I absolutely HATED The End of Evangelion. I am absolutely, firmly in the camp who thought that the core story ended in an incomprehensible, pretentious mess that unfortunately soured me on the overall experience of the series. The last 20 minutes of End of Evangelion was truly infuriating for me.

Though it sounds like the third Rebuild movie has elicited the same reaction from people, but nonetheless I’ll dive right in!"
"Coronavirus, Explained",I don't even really watch anime but I know subs>dubs
"Coronavirus, Explained","Great write-up, don't forget the fact that everything after the End of Evangelion sucks donkey balls and can be totally ignored forever."
"Coronavirus, Explained","I was about to start Parasyte today and was just checking the word on Reddit beforehand when this popped up in my results. Guess I'll be rewatching Evangelion after ~12 years of initial viewing. Let's see what wonders it does to my mental health this time.

edit: Finished the Netflix dub a couple of weeks ago. It was pretty good. Surprised by the way the certain episodes played out. Thought the last episode would hit me harder. Still haven't re-watched *The End of Evangelion* yet, though."

"Coronavirus, Explained","Literally just watch the TV show...  Anyone who needs to read a guide to watch a TV show, two movies and maybe a terrible George Lucas-esque remake, shouldn't probably start to begin with.

>– it’s an introduction to a lifelong practice of self-reflection and conscious growth, and that’s not a small thing.

And this is the cringe of the weekend for me. Reminds me of the time I was 13 and watched it for the first time, and not in a good way."
"Coronavirus, Explained",It's fully expected that by the end of the series you know all the lyrics and sing along every time it comes on.
"Coronavirus, Explained","More than that, I wouldn't recommend skipping the end theme. You'll start to notice why eventually, but it also provides a moment of reflection/digestion for those binging. Kinda like *Wolf's Rain*, but with some spice tossed in."
"Coronavirus, Explained",You lucky son of a bitch! I hope you enjoy it.
"Coronavirus, Explained","That would be really, really dumb. From a thematic perspective, the final episodes of the show are really important, but it's the movie that gives you a proper ending from a story perspective. I think the final two episodes and EoE complement each other perfectly (although a lot of people find the difference in ""vibe"" quite jarring)."
"Coronavirus, Explained","Agreed with your points, and yes, I knew I was overstepping by inserting a few of my personal opinions here, but I think with Evangelion, it's kind of impossible to get any kind of ""objective"" advice, so you have to resort to ""well, my opinion is..."" in a few places."
"Coronavirus, Explained","Your position is perfectly valid, and although my position is that ""this is par for the course for anime"", that doesn't automatically make it ""okay"". The only thing I would add is that I think the intention of many of the sexualised scenes was to induce discomfort in the audience, contrasting with the far more uncritical fanservice in other anime shows of the time, although you could argue there is definitely some uncritical fanservice in NGE too."
"Coronavirus, Explained","That extension sounds awesome, unfortunately I can't seem to get it to work."
"Coronavirus, Explained","If you powered through the whole original series, which I also struggled a bit with, you owe it to yourself to check out EoE, which is the nuttiest part of the whole franchise."
"Coronavirus, Explained","Let me tell you now that if you hated the series before it even ends then you’ll probably hate End of Evangelion even more. That movie almost made me rage quit despite only having 20 minutes left of the damn movie.

But uh... don’t let that stop you from watching it though lol."
"Coronavirus, Explained","The music licensing issue is pretty minor, the main issue with the Netflix version is the translation. It's not necessarily worse, just different, and that's annoyed a lot of people used to the original translation."
"Coronavirus, Explained",Weeb friends forcing you to watch anime is not a lot of fun... Source: I have been that weeb. You may well enjoy it more without the pressure of expectations though!
"Coronavirus, Explained",Woohoo! I really hope you dig it!
"Coronavirus, Explained",This is kind of hilarious. Did you not know that the movie was the final entry for a TV series that you absolutely 100% need to watch to have any idea what's going on?
"Coronavirus, Explained","It's 100% worth watching them! I think it's a good idea that you take a break before you start though, it will help you appreciate them as a separate thing. I'd still expect 3.0+1.0 to be out before the end of the year if we're lucky.

I hope you enjoyed the series!"
"Coronavirus, Explained",I low key wanted to say that...
"Coronavirus, Explained","Yeah... The third rebuild movie made the people who didn't think EoE could be topped reconsider their opinion. I would wager you'll hate it just as much, unless you can go into it without the expectation of a coherent story."
"Coronavirus, Explained","That's not always the case! In my opinion, a really well-done dub is usually better than a sub. For example, all of the Miyazaki movies have wonderful English dubs, and I much prefer to be immersed in the visuals than to have to try and read subtitles too."
"Coronavirus, Explained","This was generally the case during a certain time period with a few exceptions (e.g.: Cowboy Beebop). A quick internet search of ""NGE sub vs dub"" is all it'd take to get some opinions and comparisons before diving in."
"Coronavirus, Explained","Hi! The Manga has been published in a series of 5 omnibus editions if you want to get the print versions. Here's an Amazon link for the whole lot: 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKCWWH3?searchxofy=true&binding=kindle_edition&ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt_tkin

Originally there were 13 volumes, but they're condensed into these 5. If you find somewhere to read them online (which I'm sure you can), you might see them listed as individual chapters instead, of which there are 110."
"Coronavirus, Explained",Bro why do you need to be mean and belittle a dude for going all in on something he's clearly passionate about and wants to share with others? What the fuck is your goal? What the fuck is the point?
"Coronavirus, Explained","> watch a TV show, two movies and maybe a terrible George Lucas-esque remake

You should consider skimming the guide, especially where the films are brought up."
"Coronavirus, Explained","A few years back i was sitting in a little japanese place waiting for my takeout order, when I heard those opening bars and my attention (and gaze) whipped to the tv on some Japanese language sat channel. From what I could discern it was the OG singer in a talk show of some sort. Anyhoo once I had worked out what/who it was I started to turn my attention back to waiting for food. As I did so I locked eyes with one of the staff who had also been watching. I can only imagine for a moment out faces were kinda mirrors as all the that is Evangelion came flooding back. Cause yeah Evangelion and Gurren Laggaan really proved that anime was absolutely not ""cartoons for kids"" and that storytellers *could* expect more."
"Coronavirus, Explained","I think they conclude the story better than people say, because it was always about the pilots. There are loose ends otherwise which I feel is what the film exists for (On top of just demanding to exist because it’s so good), but I never watched the show *for* the Angels and whatnot, I watched to see how all of this affected these kids. The show wraps that up."
"Coronavirus, Explained","I agree, it's pretty much impossible to have a completely objective write up of NGE.  It's just too involved to have someone simultaneously cover it in depth while also avoiding any personal opinion."
"Coronavirus, Explained","> contrasting with the far more uncritical fanservice in other anime shows of the time

Anime shows have only gotten worse in this regard I feel like"
"Coronavirus, Explained",I think I got it to work after I installed and restarted chrome. But it may be buggy!
"Coronavirus, Explained",I was planning on watching the sub. That okay?
"Coronavirus, Explained","Yeah, it was funny... Thought I could power through it and maybe I would miss a few references/lore here and there but figured it would be a self contained story."
"Coronavirus, Explained",I did! Very different from everything else I've seen. Left me a bit depressed but most good stories tend to do that. The Last of Us 2 left me with the same feeling a couple of months ago.
"Coronavirus, Explained","u/Mitch_NZ  
...Have y'all seen Folding Ideas' two videos on End of Evangelion? He has an interesting take on End of Eva vs the final episodes, especially when it comes to character development."
"Coronavirus, Explained","Yep, this is definitely the case"
"Coronavirus, Explained","The Netflix sub and dub are both brand new translations and suffer from similar issues. If you don't have easy access to another version though, I don't think it's a big deal!"
"Coronavirus, Explained",Gotcha thank you!
Gleipnir,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that’s what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It’s been overlooked and it’s an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Gleipnir,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."
Gleipnir,"Do you ever get bored about watching shows featuring race, gender, privilege, or journeys of self-discovery? Seems to be every show on this list just about.

Gleipnir,I May Destroy You?
Gleipnir,Sounds like someone needs to see Ted Lasso.
Gleipnir,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
Gleipnir,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.

Gleipnir,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Gleipnir,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Gleipnir,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Gleipnir,is OP a feminist?
Gleipnir,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Gleipnir,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
Gleipnir,Bad list is bad.
Gleipnir,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
Gleipnir,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
Gleipnir,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
Gleipnir,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that’s just what you like.
Gleipnir,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I’m glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I’m not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it’s good, let alone one of the best of the year."
Gleipnir,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
Gleipnir,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake? These have all been released this year so I was wondering if you'd watched them. I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
Gleipnir,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
Gleipnir,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
Gleipnir,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
Gleipnir,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
Gleipnir,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.
Gleipnir,"> the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters

What show do you mean?"
Gleipnir,"Haven’t heard of zerozerozero but it sounds right up my alley. I’ll check it out, thanks"
Gleipnir,yep OP is definitely suffering from Wokeism
Gleipnir,"I like that OP sticks to their guns, but some of their choices are not great to me.

Desenfrenadas in particular I found just laughably bad in how clumsily it tried to present real meaningful subjects but fell terribly short with its transparent privileged fantasy idea of what struggle in the ground looks like. It takes checklist, cliched characters that it thinks will benefit from a taste of ""real life"", but the test it makes them endure, beneath the thin layer of modern coating is terribly old fashioned and cliched too and it doesn't realize ever seem to realize its vision of reality is just testament that no one involved has ever gone on a crash course road trip in places like the ones it depicts. I found the all the leads (besides lucia bracho, who is the best, deserves better than this and I hope gets a vehicle soon) wooden, stiff, perpetually-instagram-posed and unlikable.

Also, it didn't help that it's just the exact kind of ""nuMexico vibe"" mexicans like me are extremely tired of.

And even after all of that, it just doesn't have a great structure. I had to hyper sweep the show for a sort of documentary job and it has a lot of cracks. 

But I also thought my brilliant friend s2 was great, even if it fell quite a bit shy of S1 for me, which I just adoooored. So we're a bit in tune maybe."
Gleipnir,"OP is of course free to like whatever they like, but I think the reason people are giving them grief is more because they give off a really strong vibe of pretentiousness.  Personally I'd love to be introduced to new stuff outside the mainstream, unfortunately nothing in the OP's list that I haven't already seen really sounds all that interesting."
Gleipnir,"not the first time seeing someone asking for this in the U.S. but unfortunately no i don't think it's available in the U.S. It's actually even available in Canada apparently but not the U.S.

Gleipnir,"Interesting, that's where we are!"

Gleipnir,So not denying it then. Interesting.

Gleipnir,Did you write any reviews by any chance?

wait i thought we all loved a heartfelt drama about characters taking self-discovering journey to free themselves from the chains of an adulterous marriage. 😂😂"
Gleipnir,"Eh, bringing in a bunch of foreign TV to an overwhelmingly young, American demographic, and then dismissing something popular as not being ""avant-garde"" enough for you, is kinda gonna come off as pretentious to many people.

You like what you like, and honestly, more power to you.  This is obviously a list that is personal to you, even if it doesn't conform to the ""mainstream"" enough for most people.  As someone who grew up listening to music well outside the mainstream and being mocked for it, I can totally relate to that."
Gleipnir,If the trailer is anything to go by script needed editing by somebody from England. The way the English characters talk is very unnatural.
Gleipnir,"Ted Lasso seems to be the pinnacle for a lot of ppl on here this year. 😄 it was good, just not avant-garde enough for me i guess."
Gleipnir,Dude what!? ... I didn't say I was... I'm just wondering why are you asking here? 😕
Gleipnir,"But that is ""quality"" for me, as quality is a subjective thing, and that does determine how entertaining a show is for me. It is a criteria of sorts, but not for the list, it's a criterior for me. 

Originality, creativity and uniqueness, I'm literally telling you what I look for or want from TV shows. I'm telling you what my opinions are mostly based off of. That's all."
Gleipnir,Besides the obvious ones (Tiger King and Queen's Gambit) what shows did u watch?
Gleipnir,"How lol. At the end of the day, shits subjective. It's just his opinion"
Gleipnir,"> Yeah that show and Ted Lasso not being on your list shows us all we need to know.

2020 TV had more to offer than these 2 shows guys c'mon. 😅 have y'all even seen my top 2?!

> A drawback for Normal People is that straight couples on TV/film are pretty fucking boring now.

Yea as i said I'm hella biased against this show. It's something i didn't particularly enjoy... but can't necessarily say it's *bad*. I don't know, maybe it's because it kinda reminds me of my favorite film franchise 'The Before Trilogy', acting like a cheap imitation of that. Or maybe because of the sex scenes that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey... or idk, I just wasn't feeling it. 

> Just skimming your posts shows how much of a insufferable snob you are

Why? 😕 Because of that one line? It ain't that serious man it's all for fun and it's all opinionated. Me saying that is just how I felt at the time, I went on to love a lot of show focusing on straight couples, some of which are even on this list."
Gleipnir,No sorry. Only a short one for [Someone has to die](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/je2kuw/in_true_spanishdrama_fashion_alguien_tiene_que/).
Gleipnir,"I'll be honest, there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television. The demographic here is not suited for a list with so much foreign, dramatic, introspective content. People here are more in the male 18-34 demo, there's more focus on escapist shows. There's not enough comedy, sci-fi/fantasy, and action here for your list to be accepted. If you had kept the thread title as ""my favourite shows of 2020"", you might have gotten a slightly more positive response."
Gleipnir,"i still don't see why it should, as i said at the beginning of the post ""*100% opinionated and personalized*""... but whatever if it's pretentious so be it, im not trying to be though... just listing what for me were the most noteworthy shows of the year. 🤷"
Gleipnir,The trailer is absolutely not the thing to go by.
Gleipnir,"Yeah, I don't rate shows on their avant-gardiness.  

Different tastes."
Gleipnir,I don’t know how you’re being downvoted for just giving a personal opinion. Great write up even if I don’t agree with all your choices.
Gleipnir,^ yeah.......
Gleipnir,">I'm telling you what my opinions are mostly based off of. That's all.

Gleipnir,Lol I didn’t watch tiger king. That show is for idiots
Gleipnir,"You might be right about the demographic being hostile to my current taste... but on the contrary, I feel like the very heartwarming Ted Lasso and slow-burn heartbreaking romance drama Normal People being popular here proves that shows like these can be accepted. It's not really a matter of taste or me favoring the avant-garde too much, it's a matter of what's mainstream or what's popular. I think a lot of people just want to see shows that they've watched and regard highly whenever they see a ""Top TV shows of the year"" list. 

> there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television

like where? I feel like this is the only place someone like me could come and post about tv shows and actually have people see and read it without having to worry about gaining followers or building an audience, because the audience is already here. But if you know of any other place please do suggest. 

> If you had kept the thread title as ""my favourite shows of 2020"", you might have gotten a slightly more positive response.

But.... that's exactly what it is. As I said in another comment here, art is subjective, and any end-of-year list you see, whether posted on AV Club, Deadline, Variety, YouTube etc. will always be the author's opinion and limited to what the author has seen this year. Go on Variety and look at one of their ""Top TV Shows of 2020"" list.. now look at name of the author in that little box below the title, that's their ""favorite TV shows of 2020"". This is a fact that just seems to fly over a lot of people's heads here for some reason."
Gleipnir,"lol yea as i said at the start of the post, originality, creativity and uniqueness are my 3 main factors, whether in storytelling or execution (because I watch a lot of shows you see I latch on to anything even slightly avant-garde 😅). 

[Here's my sum up of Ted Lasso](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/j4hjmv/another_ted_lasso_apple_tv_post/).... which looking back now could've been longer (guess I couldn't be bothered at the time to write down my full thoughts). I gave it a 7/10."
Gleipnir,"Im no expert, but saying “it’s not avant-guard enough for me” is basically farming downvotes. We all have our tastes. Is when we’re subscribing to a taste for its own sake we’ll have a hard time bringing others along with our opinions."
Gleipnir,"thanks a lot. i really hate how much it seems to fly over users heads on here that lists like these will always be the writer's opinion... any end-of-year list, whether it's on Variety, AV Club, YouTube etc. it'll always be the author's opinion, and art is subjective."
Gleipnir,"Uggh I feel like you're still not understanding what I'm saying here lol.

> Most people look for a lot more than just ""originality, creativity and uniqueness""

I do too... good writing, good acting, beautiful visuals and good production values all round, but a lot of shows have those elements, what I'm saying is for me to consider it noteworthy or outstanding, originality, creativity and uniqueness are the 3 main factors that must be there... along with the essentials. 

> that's why people don't like your list.

Nah, let's admit most people come into posts like these expecting to see shows they've watched and regard highly, obviously this isn't that for most, so no i didn't make it expecting people here to like it.... but honestly it's going better than i expected. A lot of the comments are just misunderstanding me, guess i should've elaborated more in the opening NB. 

oh and p.s. it wasn't a serious *ask*, i just wanted the user to tell me what he thought about the list lol."
Gleipnir,"Ted Lasso is a comedy, it leans heavily on the goofiness of its main character. The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey. Most people don't enjoy that. People like watching escapist tv where characters are solving problems and going on actual journeys and landing in humorous situations, your list has nearly none of that. Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

And when you say stuff like ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular"", you will get called pretentious. Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are. I don't think r/television only follows what is popular, it follows the higher end of what the male 18-34 demo follows, and it doesn't seem like you are part or at least don't understand that demo at all.

Also, lists like AV and stuff are usually a collaborative effort, so it's usually not just one person's opinion and meant to be more all-encompassing than a random video on Youtube. And you really don't see many random ""top tv shows of 2020"" Youtube videos being posted here. You'll probably see more vitriolic criticism being spewed at those videos in the comments than what you are getting in this thread."
Gleipnir,"> The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

Yea... you right. But don't be dissing Dave though. 😂

> You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey.

Lol you right as fuck.... and i'll admit, this is something i didn't even realize before you said it, but the top 3 are essentially very similar shows story-wise, characters on self-discovering journeys. Lol you got me there. 

But see the thing is (*and this is something I guess I should've noted separately in the post, even though I did in some of the reviews*), I'm not just rating these shows based on just plot, im rating based off the way they chose to tell their stories, their visuals/cinematography or style, their production values etc. 

for eg. Partisan is ranked no. 9, but it has absolutely garbage ass plot that by the end leaves you quite unsatisfied (that's why I barely mentioned it), but it has beautifully unique cinematography and the way it builds mystery and tension with its cold and isolated atmosphere is quite innovating, thus... it makes the list. 

So Ted Lasso is good, it tells a decently good story, but how did it tell it? Was it innovative? Did it do anything creative like Dave's ""Jail"" music video montage? Was it doing anything special visually? ... or was it just pretty typically straightforward in the way it presented itself? (which it was in my opinion)

> Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

Shit that's pretty harsh... but I can't argue. I guess most of these aren't necessarily 'fun' shows. No. 1 is though (but demographic might be an issue there as you mentioned as it's a very female driven series. 😅)

> ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular""

Is that what I said or did you misquote? 😕 I feel like that's not what I typed. But if it was that's not what I meant. 

> Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are.

But... ""quality"" is subjective. 😕 Unless you mean ""quality"" as in production values well that is less subjective but that's not an issue on this list i promise you. 

And no if I come off like that I really don't mean to at all... like why would anyone even think that? 😕 it's just TV shows. I'm passionate about TV shows. I've been posting and rating TV shows all year, it's really just for fun. Something I decided to commit to earlier this year because I had a rough year last year. Im just giving my opinions on TV shows. Another commenter called be a snob... and I'm baffled cause I don't know how I'm coming off like that or how to stop coming off like that. It really got me down."
Gleipnir,"I hear you, I didn't call you pretentious myself (the poster I was responding to did), and I don't think you're trying to make it seem like your taste is better than anyone else's. People like what they like. But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I don't rate Lasso as highly as some people here do, but I still think it is a fantastic show. It may not be as creative as a show like Dave, but it provides joy and satisfaction that Dave could never give. You need to give more thought about what you simply enjoyed watching over what you thought was unique. A show can be derivative and still have quality at the same time. A show's quality should depend on how it makes you feel. That's why I think people are calling you a snob, because you're treating these shows like cases to study rather than what they are, escapist fantasies to be enjoyed.

I'll just give you an example, I think Queen's Gambit is infinitely better than Unorthodox, because Gambit is an uplifting story with well-fleshed out characters and a polished look, that doesn't demonize anyone and has no real villains (that last part makes it easily more unique than 99% of shows). Unorthodox, on the other hand, is not nearly as pretty of a show, and beats you over the head with the cartoonishly dumb orthodox Jew characters and a boring naive main character with zero charm. What could have been a good character study about a woman's struggle with her faith turns into a story of female persecution, which I thought made it completely unenjoyable by the end. But you have Unorthodox ranked higher than Queen's Gambit, with a much more muted description for the former as well. What you said about Gambit, ""one that actually takes our main character places, through losses, wins, good times and bad times"", people care more about than what you said for Unorthodox, a ""self-identifying and freedom-discovering story"". That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people."
Gleipnir,"> But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I mean... read the note at the very top of the post:


> *shows were chosen based on originality, creativity and uniqueness (as those are 3 main factors I look for in TV shows).*

..... that's what i enjoy. Those are the things I look for in TV shows. I'm fully enjoying a TV show when it's unique, creative, when it's giving me something I've never seen before. When it's being presented in a way I've never seen before. And as we agreed, the list is made by me, my opinion, my favorites. That's why at the start of the post, I tell people what I look for/want from a TV show. Creativity, originality and uniqueness, that's what the list is based on. 

Also keep in mind that I watch a lot more TV than the average viewer. Not to be a snob, as the commenters said lol, but after you've watched over a 1000 TV shows you tend to crave stuff you haven't seen before. 

> That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people.

Yeah, you probably right. But what did you want me to do tailor the list for /r/television? Fill the list with the most talked about shows on here. Think of any critic, would they do that? Think of music critic Antony Fantano, would he fill his ""Top 20 Albums of the Year"" list with selections that his comment section favored, or would it be filled with music that he enjoys? music that probably sways on the experimental side because just like me he's looking to be wowed by stuff he haven't heard before.

Also, The Queen's Gambit and Unorthodox aren't that far off in my head quality wise. I gave Queen's Gambit a 8.0 and Unorthodox a 8.3... and the only reason is because I liked Unorthodox directing and clean aesthetics more. They are both equally great stories to me. 😄

But anywhooooooooo! I actually really enjoyed this convo. I wanted you to check out the Top 25 list I made back in 2017 and tell me what you think... but it's on another site, I'd have to pm you the link."
Gleipnir,"Hey you, I just wanna say that I am watching all shows on your list right now (currently on 19). I feel like we have very similar taste. The only one I've skipped so far was The Dark Side of The Ring. I gave it a try, but it just wasn't doing anything for me. I've never been interested in wrestling though.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, your work is doing a lot for me these days."
Love 101,"I have a queation - does it push the envelope? Does it have important teen stories such as depression, anxiety, sex, abuse, homosexuality, alchohol? I'm wondering considering this is a turkish show and Turkey is very conservative. In most turkish shows I've seen they cover most of their bodies, they cut out any sex or drinking scenes. So I'm intrigued as to how this Netflix show portraits it as Netflix has some pushing the envelope shows like Elite and 13RW. There was also an anti-LGBT scandal weeks before Love 101 dropped."
Love 101,"I really liked it. It’s not as sensational as some other teen dramas on Netflix. Some of the scenes with Sinan, who’s battling with depression and his alcohol addiction, are really powerful.

But I do think it’s a shame that some of Osman’s scenes were deleted. He deserved better!

Also: I just discovered that the actor who plays Sinan and the actress who plays Burcu are both born in 1993, lol. He looks way younger!"
Love 101,"i saw it, watched the preview and said nope. lol. looked stupid. maybe i should try it either way? im interested in the turkey high school setting, just not the exaggerated love stuff."
Love 101,"At the first day series were released, I just wonder and I wantted to give a chance.. I watched the whole series at the day I started. When it finished, I felt that I cannot wait for the 2nd season. So, now I just think about that and I wonder (SPOILER) “Who knock the that f*kn door?!” Jajajja :)))

Sure, I watched better series before but it’s ok, i think.. If u like some love/youth/different soundtracks, I can suggest this series for u ;) <3"
Love 101,It doesnt have any sex scenes. But depression and alchohol.
Love 101,No lgbt either.
Love 101,It's a lot less stupid than american high school shows
Love 101,Give it a try. The trailer doesnt give justice to the series. Its very emotional and philosophical.
Love 101,"actually one of the five teenagers, Osman, is gay. but the show was battered by Turkish conservatives (on twitter) even before it was aired so they trimmed out every gay scene. that's why all other characters have strong back stories, love and sex lives but Osman has nothing"
Love 101,That's not true. Some random person said it on twitter and people believed it. And it's pretty silly saying.
Love 101,"It actually is true, information just came out saying netflix removed those scenes"
Love 101,"how else do you explain every single character having their own love lifes and complicated back stories like traumas and family shit but Osman is just hanging around eating nuts? he has literally two scenes and both of them is with his dad. also there was a trailer of the show before the release which shows Osman talking with a guy, the trailer is deleted now and the scene is not included in the show. https://twitter.com/love101netflix/status/1247950070768689152?s=19"
Love 101,Could you share a resource for it ?
Love 101,"That guy was probably one of the nerds. Osman's problem was money unlike other characters love problem. And does every character has to have a love affairs ? And that tweet is just some random person tweeting. I'm Turkish and Gay so believe me when I say Osman is not gay. At least for the show's first season. Maybe later on they might decide to make him a gay character. Which would be difficult. A gay person at those years in Turkey. He would be REALLY closeted gay.
After all maybe he is Asexual ? There is more evidence on him being asexual rather than him being gay."
Love 101,https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/netflix-removes-queer-character-from-turkish-series-after-regulators-warning/news
Love 101,"I'm Turkish and gay too lol. yes the first season has no scene of Osman being gay but him not having any personal scenes is still bothering me, I don't think they said ""this guy is just a nerd his thing is money let's not write him a single scene of backstory"". ofc not everyone has to have a love affair but we both know Turkish series do match every single character with another"
Love 101,"I'm not saying it's fake but it's not an official announcement. According to BBC someone from Rtuk told them these. 

Btw I'm not saying RTUK wouldn't do this kind of stuff. It would. I just prefer not to believe it without hard solid proof. I'm not denying it too. I just don't think Osman was gay and changed later."
Love 101,"I was so shocked to learn this had got a second season


Shame they made Osman straight. Netflix is probably canceling it because turkey is so homophobic.


There was another show that supposed to be made in turkey but there was gay characters and they wouldnt allow it, so netflix moved the show to spain"

Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,It really is kind of strange. Anime once became big in the West for its kinetic and detailed hand drawn animation and now Netflix puts out these cheapo shows that look like shit and it still finds an audience. I guess that's why it's gotta be established brands to find any viewership. I love Oshii and his GitS version but I have zero interest in seeing this.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Profits.  And simply not caring about the integrity of the animation quality or the overall production.  Which is kind of contrary to maximizing profits.  Dang.  You're right.  It makes no sense.

Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"if you get past the art style it's great, and I'm pretty sure that's all the original voice cast still....."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"The Stand Alone Complex hand drawn style with light CGI was phenomenal. What an awesome, forward thinking anime to have received in the early-mid aughts"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Also dialogue writing skills, but yes."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Big fan of Ghost in the Shell. I hate this.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Can't do it. It's just ugly, especially after you've seen the original movie."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,That cgi...yikes. Berserk vibes all over again.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Did they get Yoko Kanno back for this?

She was half of what made the first two series so good."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I’m going to watch it regardless cause it’s ghost in the shell. I’ll take every drop of cyberpunk I can get right now
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Man c’mon already why are they trying these new styles? What happened to I.G. and their sick ass animation? And no Kanno?? That’s like Spielberg without Williams. 

The story’s gonna be solid, so is the direction and VA. But for me GITS has always been the sum of it parts, when all elements come together in brilliance. That was the ‘95 film and SAC 1 & 2."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"That style looks... poor

and whoever cut the music together - jesus... that was just terrible"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Like others, I'm not loving the animation, but what drew me to the original SAC was the characters and the story.  I guess we'll have to wait and see how that goes, because this trailer definitely didn't convey much of anything.  It  seemed to be a muddle of action sequences."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Thanks Netflix. You've ruined my favourite anime with crappy CGI
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,animation looks pretty dull
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Looks like trash.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Why the *fuck* are they using shitty CGI? Stand Alone Complex was done in the early 2000s and *still* looks better than this.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,whaaaat the fack
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"I wish they had just stopped after 2006.

Please, no more conflicting storylines."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Overall I can ignore the CGI even if I'm far from a fan, but I'm just curious to what degree this is gonna pick up SAC. I really REALLY hope they don't just retread similar ground to what was covered with the Laughing Man as well as Kuze and Goda. Those seemed to build up an interesting mythos as well as a lot of national politics, especially with the American Empire which I can't imagine isn't still looming in some regards 13 years after 2nd Gig. I've been hoping for a continuation of SAC since Solid State Society so hopefully this at delivers on the story."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"I'm sorry, I don't have any constructive criticism.

This looks shit."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Is this coming out on PS2 or Xbox?
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I hate it. Couldn't even finish the trailer!
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"They CGI'd it?! OH, NO!"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,It does have the feel of the SAC series alright. The animation doesn't look that bad either considering the distractingly bad and low-framerate the Netflix-published CG anime usually is.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"I'm a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and I also enjoyed the original movie, so I really, really hope the story for this one will be good because it's the only way I'll be able to get past that animation which is, to be nice, not to my taste at all."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Netflix needs to learn this type of ""animation"" is hated by most."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,This does not bring joy.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"this can't be from 2020

this looks 1995"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"computer animation looks like shit from the 90s, stop it with this shit Netflix"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I miss Yoko kanno's score :(
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Wow this is bad
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Wow. I liked every iteration of GITS so far, but this one looks so fucking odd. Holy crap it looks like a PsOne cinematic ffs!"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I wonder if people realize that old school anime artists don't exist anymore. They turned into graphic designers that had to learn how to use maya and 3d rendering. It's simply more cost effective and efficient to create an animated series this way. I mean look at Cannon Busters. That crap is hand drawn and looks T E R R I B L E.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Sigh...
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Big fan of SAC Ghost in the Shell, so I definitely hate this."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Huge fan of GiTS. After Scarjo In the Shell, I'm extremely hesitant about anything new to the GITS series. :("
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Massive downgrade
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Is this a theme for anything that was once in high demand to use the lowest common denominator approach: shitty CGI which kills any magic of the older iterations.

You didn't see Devil Man Crybaby or the newer Blade of the Immortal series go down this path. Yes, I'm still upset on how Berserk ended up...Though it got me to read 37 or 38 volumes of that series instead."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Berserk was way worse than this. At least things are moving at a faster frame rate here.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"I mean, its not Berserk level of bad.  The three movies were alright, but the new series was teeeeeeerrible."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,This makes Berserk look like Samurai Champloo. I seriously thought I was looking at an animatic or some amateur 3d porn.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I can still hear Inner Universe and Rise in my dreams. RIP Origa.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Until September that is
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Same.  I watched some of the Arise movies, I will watch this.  So far I've never seen anything approach the cyberpunk pedestal I put GitS:SaC but I'm ok with second rate cyberpunk right now."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"When I want to see what a cyberpunk world is like, I just watch the news. Blade Runner wasn't that far off from the real 2020 if you think about it."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Netflix just can't handle anime right
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,No the pay to win video game broke GITS years ago. Netflix can't kill the dead.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Hasn't *everything* since the first 1995 film been contradictory? It's par for the course, surely?"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"None of the storylines are conflicting,  the two shows are separate from each other (SAC and Arise).  And the two movies are their own thing separate from the shows.  And the manga is also a separate thing.

Presumably though this will be a continuation of the stand alone complex storyline, since it bears that subtitle. I.e. this will not conflict with SAC."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I’ve never seen anything after the original movie. Should I be watching others?
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I actually rather like the Arise OVAs.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,[deleted]
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrZk9sSgRyQ
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Yup, SAC was the best era/continuity. Watched it multiple times with both subs and dubs. Can't get Mary Elizabeth McGlynn's voice for Major or the Lithium Flower Outro out of my head."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Big fan of animation, so I hate this the most."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Same, this looks like dog shit. They should have just continued with the older style"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,There’s a fucking Blade of the Immortal series???? I knew Takashi Miike made a movie but never heard a series was made. Thank you!!
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"Completely agreed. I won't speak to the quality of the 3D assets themselves, but Berserk's animation was **much** worse.

[Exhibit A](https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/259/388/5f4.gif)"
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,What happens in September?
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Only 231 days to go :’(
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"This is something I’ve been starting to realize more and more. Globalization, rapid technology, and all that shit."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,Strange. They’ve funded some really good western animation.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,They've also ruined the english dub to Saiki K. The oringial dub by funimation was much better and funnier.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,First Assault was not Pay-to-Win.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"They are all different adaptations, spin-offs, etc. Even the 1995 movie itself is radically different from the source manga, the closest thing to it being [the animated cutscenes of the PS1 game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTkOvNDhO_Y)."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"It's Captain Harlock rules. Nothing is consistent, just enjoy the ride and don't ask questions."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"It's one of my all time favorite animes. I'd recommend the following:

Continuity 1:

* Ghost in the Shell (1995, 82min movie)
* Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (99min movie)

Continuity 2 (Stand Alone Complex):

* GitS: SAC (x26 25min episodes)
* GitS: SAC 2nd GIG (x26 25min episodes)
* GitS: SAC - Solid State Society (108min movie)

Continuity 3 (Arise):

* Ghost Pain (58min movie)
* Ghost Whispers (58min movie)
* Ghost Tears (58min movie)
* Ghost Stands alone (58min movie)
* GitS: Arise - Alternative Architecture (x10 episode TV series compiling previous 4 Arise movies + 2 extra episodes to setup next movie)
* Ghost in the Shell (2015, 100min movie)

The Arise continuity isn't as good as the others, but still worth it if you loved everything else."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I really enjoyed the Ghost in the Shell:Stand Alone Complex TV show. I honestly like it more then either of the 1995 movie versions.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"The 2015 'Arise' stuff conflicts with Motoko's origin story given in the 2nd season of the anime.  Personally I'd avoid it.

After the 1st movie you have GITS 2: Innocence which takes place sonetime after the 1st but before the start of the anime series, GITS SAC. The 2nd season is GITS SAC 2nd Gig, and it's just as amazing as the 1st. There is also a movie-length episode called GITS Solid State Society, which is both really cool and also ties together all the loose ends."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,"The tone of the theme song is a bit too high energy, and despite the lyrics a bit too positive, so it feeds into how the animation is received. Also, all the backgrounds look really sparse and cheap. Like RWBY definitely has a lower budget than this, but it looks like it has had more care put into it than this new Ghost in the Shell."
Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045,I think it is more people (dat like/dislike bar though!!) associating this kind of animation to modern western saturday morning CG cartoons. I'm sure it is going to be one of those things you quickly get used to after the first episode.

Win the Wilderness,Could someone explain how cyberpunk is the anime of the year but not best new anime
Win the Wilderness,Best continuing anime series - sounds tailor-made for one piece.
Win the Wilderness,"Me vs Adam Smasher before watching Edgerunners:

""Nothing personal, dude, you are just in the way.""

After:

**""SMAAAAASHEEEER! I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EEEAAARTH!!!""**"
Win the Wilderness,Nova!
Win the Wilderness,"https://youtu.be/h4VJGNNSQnw

You know you want to listen to it"
Win the Wilderness,Is it recommended to play the game before watching this?
Win the Wilderness,"I think Edgerunners was 2 episodes away from being an all-time great anime. Instead of the time skip, I think it needed 2 more episodes to really expand on David's self-destructive nature as he gradually went more chrome. But even without those episodes though, it was still fantastic."
Win the Wilderness,"Didn't quite get the huuuge hype for this one, but it was enjoyable and it was very cool how in line it was with the game."
Win the Wilderness,The fact that Mob Psycho 100 S3 wasn't included at all is the biggest tragedy I've ever seen.
Win the Wilderness,"This is the first anime I've watched in a long long time.  I've seen Akira, Lodiss War, Cowboy Bebop, and Evangelion.  That's it!  Edgerunners was great stuff and I feel like it hung in there with the rest."
Win the Wilderness,justice for rebecca
Win the Wilderness,"These are popularity awards, so take it with a grain of salt. I dont have anything against the overall winner, but take for example - best fantasy anime - ofc demon slayer is gonna win , even though the fantasy element is pretty weak, because it has a fanbase of small country  and an obvious choice like made in abyss gets stomped. Same with category best supporting character - SxF, i think anya and floid both fit the role of the main character, pretty weird nomination. Then best ongoing anime, ah category made for one piece. And not including any Fall anime? what a joker."
Win the Wilderness,"Edgerunners winning was a genuine surprise, was sure it'd just be AoT or Demon slayer again.

Kevin should have won in OST though"
Win the Wilderness,Best Animation- Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc- The least surprising one.
Win the Wilderness,"*Crunchyroll anime awards

They're just as bad if not worse than the oscars"
Win the Wilderness,"Birdie Wing got robbed. The most anime anime and it didn't win jack or shit.

Hiw can you sleep on a show that can only be described as ""Lesbians vs the golf mafia""?"
Win the Wilderness,Cyberpunk was so damn good. Flash in the pan but it was so bright.
Win the Wilderness,Sonny Boy didn't deserve this :(
Win the Wilderness,"Demon Slayer walks away with almost every award it could possibly qualify for, but Edgerunners wins best of the year? 

What?"
Win the Wilderness,I would add “Crunchyroll” in the award title.  Important to emphasize that this is an award managed by an American distributor of an art form made mostly in Japan.
Win the Wilderness,The Girl From The Other Side wasn't even mentioned. It's a fucking crime.
Win the Wilderness,Anime awards be like: lets just nominate the shows who were the most popular and call it a day.
Win the Wilderness,Deserved. AoT winning best score is the most one horse race ever 🤣. Gives me chills every time
Win the Wilderness,"Just finished it yesterday. 

That was a trip. 

I felt so much."
Win the Wilderness,"I loved the first half, but kinda hated it after the time skip. The main character became completely unbelievable and mindbogglingly  stupid."
Win the Wilderness,"Fun show but, of the year? Highly doubtful."
Win the Wilderness,"Cyberpunk was so depressing, and not in a good way."
Win the Wilderness,have not heard many speaking about it
Win the Wilderness,That junji ito japanese macabre stories was way better than edgerunners
Win the Wilderness,Meh
Win the Wilderness,Didn’t really care for Cyberpunk much tbh
Win the Wilderness,"I am by no means an anime connoisseur; in fact, I'm not really into anime at all.  But I did watch Edgerunners, and I thought it was....decent.  It wasn't really exceptional.  I didn't understand what all the hoopla was about.

Arcane, however, really surprised me and was a great show, despite its origins in the League of Legends universe.  That's not really anime though, but it certainly seems anime-adjacent in some ways."
Win the Wilderness,"Cyberpunk was fine imo. Good for a quick watch, but didn’t stand out to me personally. 

Kaguya-sama season 3 was my AOTY by far. Absolutely loved every second. The humor was top tier and the payoff was wonderful."
Win the Wilderness,"I was suprised at this result.

Its a great show, i didn't think it was the best anime last year though."
Win the Wilderness,"That’s surprising

I can’t really think of anything about the show that really stands out from other shows this year."
Win the Wilderness,Popularity contest. Lame
Win the Wilderness,Eh. Cyberpunk was fine. Very middle of the road anime in my personal opinion
Win the Wilderness,"I mean, the story was fine, but I was really just in it for the gratuitous and purient sexual thrills."
Win the Wilderness,"Hm, really wanted to like it, like Cyberpunk as a general genre/setting, main character was kinda insufferable as were several other characters.

Also baffling descent into nonsensical action towards the end. How's nobody shooting at the shirtless unarmored dude center mass of the mech suit."
Win the Wilderness,Lycoris Recoil was awesome. Glad to see it won something.
Win the Wilderness,Guess I should probably get around to watching Spy x Family
Win the Wilderness,Where Stone Ocean?
Win the Wilderness,"Gotta get around to watching this, not into anime but this seems interesting and could be a gateway."
Win the Wilderness,"Lost every other category clearly not the audience vote

No Fall Season

CR as always removed as many shows as they could that they dont own 

the fake awards dumber ever year."
Win the Wilderness,Sooooo fucking overrated.
Win the Wilderness,"This mess my fault?

Is one of the most disturbing lines I've seen in media in a long time. 

Great show. 

Hope they make an anthology out of it.

Glad to see something at the top that isn't the same shit."
Win the Wilderness,Bleach should of been on this list alongside mob psycho III
Win the Wilderness,"Why can't people separate quality and popularity? Sure, it's a good anime, but top 10? Seriously? For such a bog standard, low value plot?"
Win the Wilderness,"Ranking of kings was way better. 

Edgerunners is like a 10/10 for the first episode, then each one is just a little worse and more predictable than the last. 

Oh wow, the young guy finds out he's actually super talented and is pulled into some underground society by a hot lady, and then he rises to be the leader and has to rescue his hot lady girlfriend from kidnappers? Are you even allowed to write a story that original and subversive?

Overall, I still think it's a clearly above average anime, once you factor in the amazing visual design, but plot wise it feels like that stuff is kinda wasted. 

I'm just glad attack on titan didn't win though."
Win the Wilderness,"That really blows. That anime was pretty mid, but fun. Never would think it would even come close to winning anime of the year lol"
Win the Wilderness,"Kongming, My Dress Up Darling, Birdie Wing… turns out the awards are just a popularity contest, but I guess we all knew that already."
Win the Wilderness,Damn people are really sleeping on ranking of kings eh? Very surprised it didn't win anything.
Win the Wilderness,I didn't care for it not saying it doesn't deserve the award but i dunno seems a little overrated to me
Win the Wilderness,I can't seem to make it through the first episode.
Win the Wilderness,If Edgerunners got Anime of the Year this must have been a rough year for Anime.
Win the Wilderness,Cyberpunk deserves it. That's a really good anime
Win the Wilderness,Well deserved
Win the Wilderness,"I thought it sucked. It was a garden variety anime with a generic and predictable plot. Visually, it looked like the game ran through a weeb filter. The acting was also the usual B-tier quality found in English dubbed anime."
Win the Wilderness,"Made in abyss s2 was robbed in both best fantasy and best ost. 
Honestly demon slayer and AOT did NOT deserve those wins. The aot s4 ost is nothing special even compared to the previous seasons, and demon slayer is barely a fantasy anime with how little of a focus is put on developing a coherent world and lore.

Cyberpunk deserves aoty though"
Win the Wilderness,Excellent anime!
Win the Wilderness,anime of the year is for me is my dress up darling 😉
Win the Wilderness,Deserved it.
Win the Wilderness,i ain't mad at it. thought overall the anime offerings in 2022 were pretty weak though.
Win the Wilderness,Dunno Eren Jeger was such edgelord in last final part imo. There are better characters but thats me
Win the Wilderness,"The idea that attack on titan won anything for whatever the fuck happened in the final season part 2 is truly absurd. Gotta be the largest shark jump ever, of all time, in the history of ever."
Win the Wilderness,I don’t think it was deserving of anime of the year but it was infinitely better than the game when it released.
Win the Wilderness,"I get that it's filled with a lot of emotion and stuff but I couldn't make it through the whole thing, the 3d animation was not to my taste"
Win the Wilderness,"The animation is gorgeous and the universe is great, but i thought the pacing, screenplay and dubing/acting make it unwatchable at times..."
Win the Wilderness,"it was good, but Spy X Family was a league ahead IMO.  I dont see Edgerunners having much staying power."
Win the Wilderness,"Alright look it was good but its not this amazing show people make it out to be. I think it felt way too rushed, and should be gotten atleast twice or triple as many episodes."
Win the Wilderness,"The first promo media I've seen for this was about the studio's insistent that a loli depicted character remain in the production because reasons. 

I checked out forever there. The fact that this won a best award discredits the award institution more than anything."
Win the Wilderness,"Goblin slayer needs to come back this year and show demon slayer who’s boss

Edit: if you downvote this it’s totally fine because they’re both awesome I just want season 2 of goblin slayer"
Win the Wilderness,Well deserved
Win the Wilderness,How is chainsae man not here? Or winner of the Anime of the year award? I know questioning the voting system of these awards are pointless but its kinda baffling.
Win the Wilderness,Didnt like it as much as I thought I would but it was still way better than the other nominees.
Win the Wilderness,"Where the game failed the anime succeed, huh."
Win the Wilderness,Absolutely deserved for Cyberpunk after it getting robbed by Arcane for Adaptation bs
Win the Wilderness,"I found it meh, to short to get any attechment going, art style was wierd, story ok but nothing special if you played the games, characters where allmost all likeable and David was a retard, littery saw a cyberphyco killing a friend and a friend turning into one, yet decided to ignore his own decent to Madness.

Also i hate writing on a phone"
Win the Wilderness,"Wow....tall about an undeserved win.

Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good and fun but I really don't think it was AotY or even the best cyberpunk show, not by a long shot."
Win the Wilderness,"Lycrois recoil should of won, it's literally John wick with lesbians"
Win the Wilderness,"I havent watched too much anime, I've tried Demon slayer/Tokyo Ghoul/Vinland Saga but couldnt get into them. Attack on Titan was pretty good

I really liked Edgerunners though, are there other animes similar to it in style?"
Win the Wilderness,Insane CDPR fans about to credit the Cyberpunk game for this.
Win the Wilderness,"I thought the show was decent enough, but there's one little detail I just couldn't get past: The CGI vehicles. Now, in itself this isn't a problem, and when sitting still or driving normally, they looked perfectly fine. The problem? The models were clearly very rigid and incapable of showing any sort of damage, aside from cracked windshields.

During action and chase scenes, they look like toys that are being thrown around, 100% intact without so much as a scratch on them even when hit and blasted into the air, only to suddenly occasionally explode.

It's not a severe issue, but once you start noticing this, you can't stop."
Win the Wilderness,I liked edge runners but I was super bothered by the fact that it mirrors Akame ga Kill. Bar for Bar.
Win the Wilderness,You know its a slow year for anime when erin fucking jager was the best anime protagonist of the year lol
Win the Wilderness,"Sorry but Kaguya season 3 was in contention and Edgerunners won? That’s a scuffed fucking competition. Kaguya was a masterpiece, Edgerunners was decent to good at best."
Win the Wilderness,Very well deserved

Or an anthology."
Win the Wilderness,It deserved it. It was a beautifully tragic anime
Win the Wilderness,I didn’t rate it. But now that it has won this award I feel I might have to go back for a rewatch.
Win the Wilderness,"I really enjoyed Edgerunners, great anime. I am a casual anime watcher for reference :P."
Win the Wilderness,Yess
Win the Wilderness,Where is bochi
Win the Wilderness,They had to create a special category for one piece to win something.
Win the Wilderness,"Came here expecting to see the anime elitests whining about it ""not being a real anime because it's based on a western ip."" 

Was pleasantly surprised."
Absurd Planet,Just had a similar experience. Couldn’t make it through the first episode. It’s just terrible.
Absurd Planet,"Watched 10 minutes and all wife and I could think is 'who is the target market for this?'.

The way it's presented and the annoying narration makes me think kids, but the humour seems aimed at...well I couldn't tell you.

Seemed like a great idea for an easygoing nature program but I can't watch it, it's just atrocious."
Absurd Planet,"The target audience is me I guess, because I thought it was hilarious. But at the same time it's really dumb, but also very silly. It's like a sketch comedy show with animals as the players. I think part of what's funny about it is that the jokes are adult oriented but presented like a kids show which gives it a sort of tongue on cheek satire quality.

Still I wouldn't call it my favourite and it can be hard to watch. 6/10 with highlights that are 10/10, in a Napoleon Dynamite sort of way. Probs straight 11/10 if high.

Edit: Alright fine downvote me for disagreeing. If you like the show Wonder Showzen, then Absurd Planet might be for you."
Absurd Planet,"I agree, I stopped it after 3 minutes."
Absurd Planet,I got to the dung beetle song and it just kept  going......... was enough for me.
Absurd Planet,"Exact same thing that happened to me.  I only got a few minutes in.  I will say though, based on the previews, almost all of the footage looks like it was recycled from other nature documentaries I've seen so maybe it's for the best."
Absurd Planet,"After hearing her voice I had my doubts but this show is just so plain you know what at least plain is watchable this one is just horrible. The horrible narrators annoying voice, the horrible intro, the horrible visuals, the horrible script just all around horrible."
Absurd Planet,"The people at Netflix saw ""[True Facts](https://www.youtube.com/user/zefrank1)"" but instead of hiring Ze Frank, we get this trash. I'll stick to his actually funny youtube videos. Also, Ze Frank actually tries to sound like a documentary narrator."
Absurd Planet,"It's obnoxious garbage. They say so little about the animals, it's more about the stupid jokes. Very shallow strictly from an educational perspective. People who watch nature shows do it to learn thing but somehow the seem not to know that. It's just weird that this got the green light. Just weird."
Absurd Planet,I had same thought. at 1st i was like oh its for kids. Then the next episode sounds like a stoner druggie or something. so not appropriate for kids at all. Just terrible.
Absurd Planet,Is it anything like Damn Nature! You Crazy?
Absurd Planet,They should replace the narrator and the bad editing
Absurd Planet,"I love nature docs, and can appreciate most kinds of comedy (including very dumb comedy).  However, this was just awful.  It was  all over the place, and the narrator's voice made me want to eliminate my eardrums with a power drill after about 5 minutes.  Just...why?"
Absurd Planet,Just no
Absurd Planet,"I saw the trailer on Netflix, that alone was way to obnoxious for me"
Absurd Planet,"Man it's one of the worst things i've seen.

It reminds me of that South Park episode (Butt Out) where these cringey adults come to school and sing a song about how smoking is bad. Just to make the kids actually wanna  smoke because its so bad.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqglh7WoBz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqglh7WoBz0) 

I imagine these people writing the show."
Absurd Planet,"i love all the animals and insects but sadly had to stop watching because of all the bad jokes, songs, and what not."
Absurd Planet,Most annoying narrative ever. I had this on my list for few days and was looking forward to it since I love animals’ show. I could not get past five minutes. What a waste for some really good footages 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Absurd Planet,"So cringeworthy, from start to finish. 

This show is dumb enough to drive people away from wanting to help preserve nature - and instead, start actively working against it...."
Absurd Planet,"I think the only thing that makes this show awful really is the narrator's annoying voice. If they had someone with an easier voice to listen to, it'd probably actually be funny, but I just can't seem to get passed her horrible voice to comprehend what she is saying. It's quite sad because people could actually learn about these different animals but nobody even wants to watch because her voice ruins it."
Absurd Planet,It's soooo bad... I couldn't make it past the first episode.
Absurd Planet,"If you want to see something similar but actually funny, check out some of  Tony Baker's videos on YouTube. He does comic animal voice-over vids that are simple and hilarious."
Absurd Planet,"I'm unsure of who this show is made for. 

Some of the humor I find too dirty for kids."
Absurd Planet,"literally no tv show is “unwatchable”

although Mr. Pickles comes close"
Absurd Planet,"I put this on for my work year old son and
The commentary started off what I remember my childhood like, dumb commentary, but then they had a bunch of fish going into the rectum of a sponge, mating inside it, then this switched to hornbill birds and them screaming about the scrotums being out.

I don’t mind as much if it certain things come up as nature but this seemed like immature adults trying to talk about nature.  Felt oddly gross."
Absurd Planet,"Just found this thread while looking for the end credits song. It's pretty good when you're on mushrooms. Pretty sure the tone and humor are more aimed at kids though, so that could be why it didn't click."
Absurd Planet,"Yeah, I was just baffled at who it's aimed at. I'm 40, I know the Beatles from my parents, but do younger people? I think the overlap of people laughing at poo and Beatles fans are not a big demographic"
Absurd Planet,So so so bad….i thought It was Another Attenborough show and was grossly disappointed when they (again) had to cast a black person to narrate just for the sake of casting a black person.  Her voice is worse than nails on a chalkboard.  Turned off immediately after dung beetle
Absurd Planet,[deleted]
Absurd Planet,"I like-ah the pangolin, I like-ah the horny toad, I like-ah the man-of-war… I’m here looking for the same thing!"
Absurd Planet,"“gross” is the only word i can think of, and i’m a pretty desensitized guy."
Absurd Planet,It is a certified bop. I just wish it was longer.
Absurd Planet,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Absurd Planet,"Neat. Thanks for this.

Space Force's stats are quite impressive for a show that only debuted a week ago."
Absurd Planet,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.

Absurd Planet,Interesting to see containment show up.
Absurd Planet,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Absurd Planet,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Absurd Planet,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Absurd Planet,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Absurd Planet,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Absurd Planet,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Absurd Planet,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Absurd Planet,How about movies??
Absurd Planet,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Absurd Planet,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Absurd Planet,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Absurd Planet,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Absurd Planet,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Absurd Planet,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Absurd Planet,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Absurd Planet,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Absurd Planet,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Absurd Planet,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Absurd Planet,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Absurd Planet,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Absurd Planet,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Absurd Planet,[deleted]
Absurd Planet,Pandemic boost
Absurd Planet,He write it at the end of his post.
Absurd Planet,Last 100 days
Absurd Planet,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Absurd Planet,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Absurd Planet,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Absurd Planet,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Absurd Planet,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Absurd Planet,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

Thank you for that other correction"
Absurd Planet,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Absurd Planet,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Absurd Planet,That's why I thought you should know...
Absurd Planet,[deleted]
Absurd Planet,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."

Absurd Planet,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Absurd Planet,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Absurd Planet,[deleted]
Absurd Planet,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."

Absurd Planet,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
Absurd Planet,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
Absurd Planet,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
Absurd Planet,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
Absurd Planet,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
Absurd Planet,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
Absurd Planet,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
Absurd Planet,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
Absurd Planet,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
Absurd Planet,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
Absurd Planet,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
Absurd Planet,What business have you with Seamus!?
Absurd Planet,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
Absurd Planet,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
Absurd Planet,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
Absurd Planet,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
Absurd Planet,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
Absurd Planet,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
The Midnight Gospel,[deleted]
The Midnight Gospel,"> The show has many parallels with Tuca & Bertie which also, we hope is fair to say, left-field in its wackiness. That show went onto get revived by HBO Max with the second season due to release in June 2022.

Well, that's just completely wrong. Tuca & Bertie was saved by Adult Swim and aired its second season from June - August 2021."
The Midnight Gospel,"While I loved this show, I would actually be more surprised if it was renewed. It was that perfect type of niche for a lot of people, I feel like anyone who fits that niche knows how ridiculously small it is."
The Midnight Gospel,"> The news of the cancelation came from Duncan Trussell who when responding to a fan said that “The Midnight Gospel was cancelled by Netflix.”

> He went on to add that they did hope for a season 2 saying:

> > “In my mind there’s one more season but the sentient glass “deciding” cube they keep in their catacombs vibrated “No more.” And it’s hard to argue with a cube.”

> Then following some of the responses, he added a PS saying:

> > “PS I’m so lucky that the folks at Netflix rolled the dice and let us make such a strange show. They were supremely supportive all the way through and I’ll love them forever for it.”


The show is really weird and great. Check it out if you haven’t already."
The Midnight Gospel,As others have said the episode with his mom is amazing. I watched it with my newborn and I just held him and cried. I watched it recently and cried again. It’s had a profound effect on me and I recommend that episode to all new parents.
The Midnight Gospel,That's not surprising at all
The Midnight Gospel,I hate these stealth cancellations where you're just left wondering if a series has a chance to come back or not.
The Midnight Gospel,"Thematically and stylistically, it seems like a good fit for Adult Swim. But I can't really see them being able to provide the budget necessary to do it justice."
The Midnight Gospel,I loved it. Was strangely relaxing
The Midnight Gospel,"Everyone owes it to themselves to at the very least watch the episode with Duncan and his mother. I won’t spoil it, but it’s very powerful and heartbreaking."
The Midnight Gospel,Booooooo
The Midnight Gospel,"Well it ended perfectly. I legit found my best friend dead in his room a day before this came out. He was my roommate and my girlfriend and I rented a beach house to get out of the our house and our heads . I believe watching that the night after there did help us quite a bit… I love you Duncan. From the bottom of my heart, thank you 🥲. 

Edit- it actually came out a few days before that happened. Show released on the 20th and my friend was found on the 22nd. My birthday is the day after on the 23rd. I always get things that happened on my birthday and April 20th mixed up."
The Midnight Gospel,Fucking goddamnit
The Midnight Gospel,"Hey, that's a bummer. I really enjoyed this. Hope Ward has something else in the pipes."
The Midnight Gospel,My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
The Midnight Gospel,"This is a shame, what a wonderful show."
The Midnight Gospel,"I love that show, but i wasn't exactly expecting it come back. It's such a lovely, completely out there show. It would be nice to see what's next, but also the finale was so breathtaking, it would be impossible to top it. I'm grateful that we got so much."
The Midnight Gospel,This was relaxing to watch when high.
The Midnight Gospel,"Netflix’s marketing is weird, I only hear about most of their shows when they get cancelled."
The Midnight Gospel,I watched the first episode of this on shrooms and it was the most ridiculous and hilarious shit
The Midnight Gospel,"""do you ever think about how everything is connected but sometimes you don't feel connected to everything""

-blasts zombie in the face-

""Sometimes I smoke weed and it makes me feel like I'm philosophising about really deep stuff and I like weed""

-dog shits out an egg which hatches into a clown car Duncan is driving-

""Death makes me feel sad but then I think maybe death doesn't have to make me feel sad, then death doesn't make me sad""

-some kind of bizarre cartoon mashup creature eats a pizza and watches TV and burps-

""Some guy stole my bike and I was angry but then I thought about how having a bike probably makes that person happier than not having it makes me angry. Also, my wife fucks other guys while I'm at work""

-credits-"
The Midnight Gospel,Boo
The Midnight Gospel,Disappointing. I absolutely loved it!
The Midnight Gospel,This show was very r/imstonedandthisisdeep material. It did not appeal to me at all.
The Midnight Gospel,"I full on admit this show is a bit pretentious and pseudo intellectual, but I really did enjoy it"
The Midnight Gospel,"Yeah, makes sense. Idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but after watching a few episodes it just seemed like the creators thought it was more thought provoking than it actually was. It's kinda just mediocre life commentary voice over someones Adventure Time fan-fiction."
The Midnight Gospel,"Was not a fan. It reminded me of sitting in a room in college and listening to people who thought they were way smarter than everyone else talk about how they had it all figured out after doing mushrooms for the first time.  It was suitably pretentious that I am not surprised it’s an /r/television darling though. Animation was really interesting, and the last episode was very good but overall not a huge loss and not a surprise whatsoever IMO"
The Midnight Gospel,"I don't know how they would continue the midnight gospel without undermining it. The whole point of the show was more or less the main character trying to mentally escape his life by immersing himself in various out-there philosophies, only in the end to realize he had to stop the navalgazing and face radical acceptance. Where does the show go from there without at best retreading old ground?"
The Midnight Gospel,It was just stoners droning on about their faux philosophical viewpoints set to weird animation lol. I thought the show was pretentious as fuck tbh. Couldn’t get into it at all.
The Midnight Gospel,So is Netflix’s goal to just keep making more and more people despise them?
The Midnight Gospel,Well that's too bad I loved this series :(
The Midnight Gospel,"Bummer, the episode with his mother really hit hard"
The Midnight Gospel,Buncha tartbakers! Wouldn’t know a good multiverse if they found one.
The Midnight Gospel,"The episode with his mother was good. 

The rest was like being sober while listening to people baked out of their minds try to have a conversation. It's just not intelligent stuff. Maybe the interviews he took the dialogue from make actual sense, but he was just picking out nice sounding lines while leaning on the interesting animation."
The Midnight Gospel,Tried it. Didn’t enjoy it.
The Midnight Gospel,"I didn't care for it personally. I was excited for it since I've liked everything else Pendleton Ward had done, but the complete mismatch between the visuals and the audio didn't work for me. And I just didn't find the stuff the podcast was discussing interesting."
The Midnight Gospel,Didn’t care for this show. Felt like they were trying to be deep and intellectual instead of actually being entertaining and thought-provoking.
The Midnight Gospel,I've rewatched the lastvepisode about 3 times and just thinking about it makes me start to ugly-cry man-tears. Honestly wish this show would get 6 seasons and a movie but am just thankful for what we got. Such a beautiful show and I'll always have a special place in my heart for Duncan and this experience he shared with us.
The Midnight Gospel, You know the Daniel Trussels Family Hour podcast is still a thing and just as fucking awesome. Love him!!
The Midnight Gospel,"Is anyone really surprised ?? This show had less viewers than cowboy bebop. If you like a show that streams, tell your friends to watch it, tell your friends friends to tell their friends to watch it. It is the only way to save shows that are creative with no viewers."
The Midnight Gospel,"This shit was mad annoying, couldn’t get thru ep 1."
The Midnight Gospel,Tried to like this show but so much half baked verbal vomit
The Midnight Gospel,They took mediocre podcast clips and slapped it over a mediocre cartoon. One of the few times where I genuinely felt like I was wasting my time watching something
The Midnight Gospel,Good. That was dog shit. Just some druged out writer who thought he was so deep. Like a podcast that’s scripted. So a less interesting less real less free podcast with unnecessary visuals.
The Midnight Gospel,"It really wasn’t anything special. Got a lot of hype because TrIpPy cOLoRs and Pendleton Ward’s name slapped on it

It was literally an animated podcast. Which is fine for YouTube but not enough for a standalone “show” IMO"
The Midnight Gospel,Aw man. I was just thinking about the show yesterday and tried to find out if there's any news on a second season :(
The Midnight Gospel,"I’m heartbroken, it’s such a creative show that covers some deep conversations"
The Midnight Gospel,"Lame, that was such a great show"
The Midnight Gospel,"I lost my dad to cancer last year, very unexpectedly after his last round of treatment. I’d watched the whole season before that, but the day after I just screamed and cried and watched that episode again. I also rewatched it on the anniversary this year. The catharsis was really, really bitter sweet. 
I listen to the podcast too now from time to time. I’m glad they got to put out what they did. It was fun and weird to watch."
The Midnight Gospel,I fear Inside Job is next on the chopping block
The Midnight Gospel,"It was a great, mind-expanding little show. More seasons would’ve been nice, but not necessary. I’m more upset by series with plot lines and characters developed over time, canceled mid-arc w/ zero closure on a cliffhanger. This was just a psychedelic trip that happened to be inspired and inspiring. The rewatch-ability of this series is deep and rewarding. It’ll be the Faulty Towers of animated podcasts. Only one season, but a perfect one."
The Midnight Gospel,I liked the idea of it but wish they had chosen more interesting podcast topics that weren't woo woo bs.
The Midnight Gospel,"I'd consider myself a psychonaut, and definitely the type of person they were trying to appeal to, and this ""show"" 100 percent sucked. 

It was all terrible clips from a shitty podcast set over insane visuals that never matched the theme of what they were talking about. It would be like a sixty-year-old couple talking about their open relationship while the animation showed Clancy on a spaceship."
The Midnight Gospel,"It was a loveletter, I don’t think it needed a sequel"
The Midnight Gospel,"Good.  That ""Pendleton Ward is working on a new series.  Oh, it's essentially a podcast"" move was the biggest fucking rug pull for a series in recent history."
The Midnight Gospel,"Fuck.

I did love this one."
The Midnight Gospel,"No shit, show was boring as hell, because if I’m remembering correctly it’s just a god damn podcast that had animations added to it

If I wanted to listen to someone wax philosophical bullshit to me, I’d go hang out with my stoner freinds"
The Midnight Gospel,Mom episode will change you
The Midnight Gospel,"The problem isn't the cancelling of shows.  

The problem is: a show that end unresolved completely kills any future money-making potential it has.  No one will watch a show knowing it ended in a cliffhanger that's never to be resolved.  

What Netflix needs to do is demand that seasons should end with a resolution that's satisfying enough that they can stand alone -- no massive cliffhangers."
The Midnight Gospel,This show gave me a lot of things to think about.  Great show!
The Midnight Gospel,Midnight Gospel was amazing. It's too bad decision makers at Netflix don't know their asses from a hole in the ground.
The Midnight Gospel,That’s so disappointing!!!!! Why????
The Midnight Gospel,"I really enjoyed this show. The conversational nature of each episode really worked for me. I hope someone else picks it up, it seems like it can't cost that much to produce."
The Midnight Gospel,That sucks. I love that show
The Midnight Gospel,The show is literally my phone screen saver. This sucks
The Midnight Gospel,"At this point, I’m surprised when something isn’t cancelled on Netflix"
The Midnight Gospel,Booooooo
The Midnight Gospel,WHAT THE FUCK
The Midnight Gospel,Booo the more popular shows they cancel the more subscribers they'll lose
The Midnight Gospel,Boo
The Midnight Gospel,That’s so sad
The Midnight Gospel,I loved this show! Duncan trussell is a gem
The Midnight Gospel,that’s terrible news
The Midnight Gospel,"This makes me sad, this one was in my top 5 shows."
The Midnight Gospel,"bummer, this show was really great.  inventive, interesting, it's nice to see people do new things with animated shows."
The Midnight Gospel,I absolutely love this show. I hope someone picks it up. He has plenty of content to pull from.
The Midnight Gospel,LOL was there literally ever a moment where anyone thought that oddity was coming back?
The Midnight Gospel,Nooooo!
The Midnight Gospel,But I love trippin to this :(
The Midnight Gospel,The final episode had me in my feels and that doesn't happen often
The Midnight Gospel,God I’m so sad. This show was my favorite.
The Midnight Gospel,"That's disappointing. It was such a thought-provoking, emotional, and visually interesting film. That last episode with his mom had me bawling my eyes out after I hadn't cried in years."
The Midnight Gospel,They really do hate the shows that people love the most huh
The Midnight Gospel,"I love duncan, but this wasn’t good… it was extremely tedious and tedium is the worst kind of pain."
The Midnight Gospel,Thank god we won’t have to put up with anymore pseudo philosophical wannabe deep episodes of this crappy show
The Midnight Gospel,"Upset that it got “cancelled,” but more because of the connotation of the term. Makes it sound like there wasn’t enough interest/wasn’t good enough to be renewed.

However, as other people on here have already said, I think season 1 ended perfectly.

“Be here now.”

Perfect end to a weird and profound show. Oh and the final song when Clancy is boarding the bus? dreams wash away? Still makes me tear up to this day."
The Midnight Gospel,Shocked I tell you.
The Midnight Gospel,There is no death in a soul prison.  Only rebirth.
The Midnight Gospel,Ngl I feel like the only people who liked the show were high when watching. I thought it sucked
The Midnight Gospel,"I read that title as ""The Midnight Mass"" and was about to say ""wasn't that a limited series?"""
The Midnight Gospel,The episode of his mum will stay with me for a long time. I hope they find a new platform.
The Midnight Gospel,Oh noooooooo...anyway
The Midnight Gospel,What a bummer. This show was supremely unique and entertaining.
The Midnight Gospel,"I'm fine with listening to/watching a podcast, but when there's a totally unrelated cartoon playing at the same time my brain has a hard time keeping up with both. So it was definitely not for me."
The Midnight Gospel,"This is so stupid. I can think of a lot of series that deserve to be cancelled rather than this.

This is different, very artistic, and it’s the kind of programming that Netflix needs to push to have people view the service as different to others."
The Midnight Gospel,That's probably for the best. This show was best just at one season.
The Midnight Gospel,I liked the animation but I really don't care to *watch* a podcast.
The Midnight Gospel,I don't even bother watching a series on Netflix until it's got a couple seasons out anymore.  I've wasted too much time on excellent shows that get prematurely canceled too often.
The Midnight Gospel,This is a fucking crime honestly
The Midnight Gospel,"More like, WhatsNOTonNetflix(dot)com"
Cooked with Cannabis,Bossy by Kelis is a banger
Cooked with Cannabis,Honestly I really liked it. It filled the gap that my gf and I missed from BA. Plus this seems to be more cooking focused compared to other cannabis cooking shows I’ve seen.
Cooked with Cannabis,"It’s actually ”*Cooked with Cannabis*,” you diseased rhinoceros pizzle."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Netflix actually had another show called ""Cooking on High"" in 2018, so..."
Cooked with Cannabis,Running out of ideas.
Cooked with Cannabis,"Was following along with what you were saying until the unnecessary Kelis rant. Who are you, Nas?"
Cooked with Cannabis,"Quite honestly, the only thing I can criticize about the entire show is the jury’s attitude ... Jesus ... Hope I’m not the only one, their reactions, their wish to get the most THC possible, ..."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Cooked with Cannabis,"Neat. Thanks for this.

Space Force's stats are quite impressive for a show that only debuted a week ago."
Cooked with Cannabis,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.
Cooked with Cannabis,I’m surprised Ozark is that high

Cooked with Cannabis,Interesting to see containment show up.
Cooked with Cannabis,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Cooked with Cannabis,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Cooked with Cannabis,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Cooked with Cannabis,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Cooked with Cannabis,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Cooked with Cannabis,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Cooked with Cannabis,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Cooked with Cannabis,How about movies??
Cooked with Cannabis,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Cooked with Cannabis,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Cooked with Cannabis,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Cooked with Cannabis,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Cooked with Cannabis,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Cooked with Cannabis,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Cooked with Cannabis,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Cooked with Cannabis,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Cooked with Cannabis,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Cooked with Cannabis,[deleted]
Cooked with Cannabis,Pandemic boost
Cooked with Cannabis,He write it at the end of his post.
Cooked with Cannabis,Last 100 days
Cooked with Cannabis,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Cooked with Cannabis,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Cooked with Cannabis,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Cooked with Cannabis,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Cooked with Cannabis,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Cooked with Cannabis,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

I use this which considers all 3 to be exclusive international distribution deals.


Thank you for that other correction"
Cooked with Cannabis,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Cooked with Cannabis,That's why I thought you should know...
Cooked with Cannabis,[deleted]
Cooked with Cannabis,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Was kinda odd place to put it anyway.

Had to scroll all the way down to read what they meant then scroll up again.. :p"
Cooked with Cannabis,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Cooked with Cannabis,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Cooked with Cannabis,[deleted]
Cooked with Cannabis,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I can't wait for ""Chopped 420 Junior""."
Cooked with Cannabis,I swear every new show they add to Food Network now is just some variation of Chopped
Cooked with Cannabis,Netflix tried this and it was embarrassing
Cooked with Cannabis,"lmao the judges gonna be blasted by the third round. ""I didn't think I'd like this mousse you made with tomato sauce, blueberries, Cool Whip, and pulverized Doritos... but it's delicious!"""
Cooked with Cannabis,sounds entertaining for exactly 3 episodes
Cooked with Cannabis,"Ron Funches has been one if my favorite comedians for a while. He absolutely crushed it on @midnight. Perfect as King Shark on Harley Quinn.  
Always glad to see him getting more work"
Cooked with Cannabis,Doug Benson walked so Funches could run
Cooked with Cannabis,shit I read that as cannibal at first
Cooked with Cannabis,Meanwhile I can still go to jail for it here in Texas.
Cooked with Cannabis,"Here’s my beef with stuff like this. I’m all for normalizing cannabis, but it has to sting the folks that are still locked up for cannabis related crimes. How can we as a society be fine enough with a THC cooking show, and still have people in prison for the same thing?"
Cooked with Cannabis,"I don't really get who this is for.

Are they judging on all the regular food show competition criteria, plus how stoned it gets you? How are they correcting for tolerance and personal preference?

Is an average tasting bowl of cauliflower soup that gets you completely wrecked better than a perfectly prepared laksa or souffle that gives you the giggles?"
Cooked with Cannabis,"Probably going to be awful, and always include z list celebrities. Like the Netflix shows. 

Even the Martha and snoop show was aggressively bad (but that’s cuz they couldn’t show cannabis as it was filmed in New York) 

I hope one day shows like Top Chef, masterchef and hell’s kitchen touch on cannabis for event days. I mean masterchef Canada should have been getting their ass already on this."
Cooked with Cannabis,"This would be a very entertaining show *if* they required contestants to take a fat bong rip before each segment. 

Ted: ""Bill, this is a challenging basket. What are you thinking of doing with the tincture?""

Bill: ""Well, I definitely want to... What are we doing again?""

Ted: ""And it looks like Emilia has eaten half of her basket, but has yet to start cooking."""
Cooked with Cannabis,people are still basing their entire personality around smoking weed?
Cooked with Cannabis,Fucking love Ron Funches
Cooked with Cannabis,Yet the white house fired a bunch of people who smoked weed. What the fuck is up with our government. Just make it legal. This is embarrassing
Cooked with Cannabis,"This show isn't for me but dude lost a ton of weight, good for him."
Cooked with Cannabis,Most cannabis cooking recipes taste horrible.  Nobody I know cooks with it.  I think all these weed cooking shows are terrible.
Cooked with Cannabis,"Cannabis tastes bad in food, full stop. In fact, most skilled edible makers go out of their way to either use only distillate which has very little flavor, or they water-cure their flower to get rid of the cannabis flavor. I can't see this show lasting long, also because at the end of the day they'll be doing exactly what ""Chopped"" already does but with a smaller pool of less talented chefs/cooks to pull from."
Cooked with Cannabis,Do people actually enjoy the taste of weed? I’ve yet to eat anything with cannabis in it that didn’t taste completely revolting. Even the smallest hint of that flavor makes me want to puke. No idea why anyone would want to eat a three course meal made from it.
Cooked with Cannabis,This is sooo dumb. What is the point?
Cooked with Cannabis,Bong Appetit Cook Off with B-Real and Cooked With Cannabis with Kelis already exist. This is not required.
Cooked with Cannabis,"lol Sam Talbot is one of the judges on this. He was always one of my favorites on Top Chef, such a goofball."
Cooked with Cannabis,Stoners
Cooked with Cannabis,This is where we are as a society.
Cooked with Cannabis,I smoked weed for almost a decade in my late teens to late 20's but weed culture is such a bore.
Cooked with Cannabis,I hope its better than that netdliz cannabis cooking competition show.
Cooked with Cannabis,I’ve been binging Chopped - so I’m basically a judge now if you need one. SIGN A SISTA UP
Cooked with Cannabis,Sounds like something you’d see on Vice
Cooked with Cannabis,"Can't lie, thought this said ""cannibal cooking series""."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Would love to see Gordon Ramsay be one of the judges!

""That's fucking Raw! LOL"""
Cooked with Cannabis,Ron Funches is awesome
Cooked with Cannabis,Oh snap Vice network chefs gonna be ready for this one
Cooked with Cannabis,How are people still being arrested and jailed for this but this is a thing?
Cooked with Cannabis,"I LOVE THIS GUY. 

He had a comedy bit about how he made his bird a scarf. I fucking loved it. I'm so happy to see him get to a healthy weight and succeeding in his chosen field."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Haven't liked any of the cannabis cooking shows yet - but if it's the same basic format as Chopped and has Ron Funches, this one seems to have the best chance of getting me interested. 

I just hope they avoid falling into the trap of attempting to appeal to what they believe ""weed culture"" is. That shit instantly turns me off."
Cooked with Cannabis,"Honestly I’ve seen a few cooking-with-cannabis shows now and they never really grip me for more than an episode or two. I find myself quickly losing interest in the novelty of weed infused food, because I smoke huge bowls and *then* eat delicious food....why would I want to put the weed in my food when I can just smoke weed before I cook/eat a meal?

Just seems like something to watch before I get high and eat food. It’s basically foreplay to getting high and eating."
Cooked with Cannabis,"during the tasting...

judge 1:  I find the sauce slightly boring

judge 2:  I agree with his assertion

Alex guarnaschelli:  I watched you make that lobster sauce and I am NOT impressed with your technique...but i am impressed with the flavor.

After the edibles kick in

Judge 1:  I feel nothing

Judge 2:   I agree with his assertion

Alex guarnaschelli:  GRRR I AM SO FUCKING HIGH RIGHT NOW FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"

Cooked with Cannabis,"I’m so sour on Ron Funches. I don’t think he’s funny at all he appeared on To Tell The Truth and was just roasting the contestants the whole time. It was really cringey. 

Fuck Ron Funches."
Cooked with Cannabis,"I’m not a huge fan of any of the cooking shows, but man do I love him as King Shark on Harley Quinn. So I think I’ll give it a chance."
Cooked with Cannabis,TBH this should be hosted by Snoop and Martha Stewart
Cooked with Cannabis,Meanwhile countless people are still serving sentences due to cannabis related charges
Cooked with Cannabis,It better be called *Funches Munches*
The Last Dance,"Michael Jordan has successfully controlled his likeness since he came into the NBA in 1984 by opting out of the players' union's group licensing program, figuring correctly he could make exponentially more by doing his own marketing deals. This is why he was never in video games in the 90s.  The fact that they've had unseen all-access footage from his last season with the Bulls for 20+ years and got him to agree to release it at the same time when there are no other sports makes this must see viewing for any basketball fan."
The Last Dance,[deleted]
The Last Dance,It’s been A+
The Last Dance,I have never cared about or watched basketball and I'm finding this documentary to be compelling as fuck. Started the first episode and then watched all 4 in a row.
The Last Dance,"Bad article. All this tells me is that more people are watching TLD *right now* instead of TK. So yeah, of course a currently-running docuseries is going to be more popular than something that debuted and was binge-watched 6 weeks ago. 

Nowhere in the article does it say how many people watched or are watching TK. Show me overall viewership when TLD wraps up. I am sure TK will be higher overall. 

Btw, TLD is awesome. Super interesting look at one of the most fascinating sports figures of all time."

The Last Dance,"Really? That's interesting cause I have not heard one person talking about The Last Dance but I saw memes and discussions about Tiger King everywhere. Obviously this is anecdotal evidence, so I need to consider that I am not going out and I really only use IG, reddit and Whatsapp, places where I interact with people who are similar to me (nerdy people not interested in sports)."

The Last Dance,"I'd just like to say, I do not blame Carmen Electra for running and hiding. If an angry Michael Jordan was pounding on my bedroom door, I would run and hide too."
The Last Dance,"I mean obviously? One has actual substance, the other is trashy in content and its viewers’ taste. Only place I see this show being circlejerked & enshrining some small time jit is this hypocrisy riddled site lol. Glorifying an actual psychopath & troglodytes doubling down their watch interests for a murderous dollar store Riff Raff, name a more iconic duo🙄"
The Last Dance,Thank god.. apparently I was the only one who didn't watch Tiger King.
The Last Dance,Good. I'll take basketball over the glorification of animal abuse and the public's martyrdom of a criminal ephebophile any day.
The Last Dance,"Fuck Tiger King. The people are trash, the producers are trash, fuck everything about it."
The Last Dance,[Still can't believe they were too cheap to interview Luc Longley](https://youtu.be/n5sCDAERMJo)
The Last Dance,Good. I’m sick of every fucking conversation forcefully finding it’s way to Carol Baskin.
The Last Dance,This doesn't really make sense to me. Way more people have Netflix than have ESPN. You'd also think more people are interested in gay methhead tiger dealers than Michael Jordan.
The Last Dance,"Did it really? This is the first mention I've heard or seen of it since it was released.

I have a time setup to watch it myself, but just would be surprising that it already passed Tiger King."
The Last Dance,So what basketball player did that bitch Carol fuckin' Baskin feed to her tigers?
The Last Dance,I am totally ok with that given the cesspool that was the subject matter of Tiger King.
The Last Dance,Tiger King is trash tv. Last Dance is quality tv reliving the best decade in human history.
The Last Dance,"Good! Never watched Tiger King, don’t plan on watching Tiger King, and I’ve been very happy since everyone stopped talking about it every fucking day for about 3 weeks straight. I’m loving The Last Dance so far."
The Last Dance,Tiger King was a documentary? Could have fooled me...
The Last Dance,"Bullshit, tiger king is more popular"
The Last Dance,The NBA used to be a lot more fun to watch...
The Last Dance,"Straight up have not even heard about it. As someone who has zero interest in basketball, is it worth a watch or no?"
The Last Dance,"Bullshit headline. It's not using total views rather it's using recent views. Obviously they want to sell a narrative here, wonder if CBS has a stake in its success."
The Last Dance,"Just started it and I’m really glad I did. As a Chicagoan, it really brings me back. The Bulls’ domination was almost a way of life. Along with that....they were just so much fun to watch."
The Last Dance,thank fucking god. sick to death hearing about this fucking tigerfag
The Last Dance,Member watching sports? I member
The Last Dance,"Worth the hype. 

You don't have to be a sports fan to appreciate The Last Dance, that's the beauty of ESPN documentaries. ESPN has gone down in quality as a channel, but their documentaries are made with a lot care for the subject matter and transcend the scope of sports.

Other ESPN documentaries worth checking out:

The Two Escobars

Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies

OJ: Made In America

The Price of Gold

The U"
The Last Dance,I’m so angry man. I started it without realizing it’s still releasing. It’s so damn good and I wish I coulda binged it.
The Last Dance,"They don't even begin to compare, in my opinion.  I feel as I wasted time watching the tiger king, whereas I could rewatch THE LAST DANCE several times for the thrill of the game."
The Last Dance,"People sure do like that dude from Space Jam, I guess..."
The Last Dance,If I never hear Tiger King mentioned again it will have been too much
The Last Dance,"> ""The Last Dance"" was one of the 20 most in-demand shows in the world **this week**   
>  
> Netflix debuted all seven episodes of ""Tiger King"" on March 20 and the series was the talk of the internet for a few weeks. **However, it didn't take long for ""The Last Dance"" to catch up after debuting on April 19 with its first two episodes.** 

do you really expect people to keep re-watching Tiger King for weeks and weeks?"
The Last Dance,I have not heard a single person talk about this yet I haven’t heard a single person not talk about tiger king?
The Last Dance,"Tiger king isnt a documentary.  Its a very biased opinion piece that tried to trick its viewers in to believing a very specific narrative.

A lot of documentaries lately are half lies."
The Last Dance,This is the reason  I enjoy my weekends currently
The Last Dance,I have no clue about the game of Basketball but I love the history of sports. This is one of the best documentary miniseries I’ve ever seen.
The Last Dance,Well considering we don't have sports right now... This is the best we got
The Last Dance,Only 4 epidodes out though. Just give me the whole damn thing!!!
The Last Dance,I doubt that. The memes with Tiger King have been everywhere. Only just heard of this one right now
The Last Dance,It’s indicative of the reddit audience that tiger king is/was all over the world and I’ve literally never heard of this
The Last Dance,I was really shocked when MJ took out a pistol and just shot those Jazz players.
The Last Dance,whats last dance?
The Last Dance,If these shows are documentaries then What We Do In The Shadows and It's Always Sunny are too.
The Last Dance,Good
The Last Dance,"No it didn’t. Netflix is just trying to get people to pay attention to something else. There is way more universal appeal with Tiger King, but no rewatch value."
The Last Dance,Its because we already watched every things else. Its not because both were good.
The Last Dance,Looking forward to the next episodes
The Last Dance,Thank the lord
The Last Dance,Really good doc.
The Last Dance,Netflix is never going to financially recover from this.
The Last Dance,Who wants to watch some shit about a dance
The Last Dance,"I find this hard to believe.  My entire Facebook feed was nothing but tiger king for weeks.  I have yet to see anyone mention this documentary there.  That said, we are watching it at home and enjoying it."
The Last Dance,I heard about Tiger King but not the other
The Last Dance,MJ changing the game once again
The Last Dance,I'm a bit late to the party. Where can I watch the last dance?
The Last Dance,But the cultural impact of the tiger king is 10x bigger. I have yet to see a single last dance meme come through my feed.
The Last Dance,How do they know this when Netflix doesn’t give any official viewing figures?
The Last Dance,Doubt
The Last Dance,Press X to doubt
The Last Dance,Its all that bitch carol fucken bakins fault
The Last Dance,I’m never gonna financially recover from this...
The Last Dance,In what universe is Tiger King a documentary?
The Last Dance,Fake news
The Last Dance,I’m not a basketball fan and yet I’ve found this entire documentary series so far incredibly gripping.
The Last Dance,"I think despite how many people are watching The Last Dance, that still Tiger King is going (already is) to be the more meaningful cultural touchstone, as it's forever linked with corona-virus and the start of the quarantine. It's unique, very meme-able, and came out of nowhere. That said, The Last Dance is simply the next big popular doc but it's more of a nostalgic trip rather than something new. You're going to see 1000 Tiger King Halloween costumes for years to come, how many people are going to be Jordan?

Edit: Getting a ton of comments so I'll reply here: I'm not suggesting that somehow Tiger King and Joe will ever even touch Jordan in the terms of cultural impact. I'm simply stating that the Tiger King documentary will be more connected to the ""Where were you in 2020 when Corona hit?"" conversations that will come years from now. I'm not even suggesting it's a better documentary, just that I'm contending that it will be better tied to this time period than Jordan will be."
The Last Dance,"I don't know, Netflix never really releases their data, but Tiger King has definitely entered the popular culture in a way Last Dance hasn't."
The Last Dance,"Once you get past the initial shock factor of Tiger King, there really isn't much substance to it. 

Michael Jordan on the other hand... can never be *not* compelling. When you achieve that level of excellence in a given field, it inspires imagination and the human spirit like few things in this world can."
The Last Dance,Faith in humanity restored... slightly.
The Last Dance,"Series is excellent, couldn't recommend it enough."
The Last Dance,"Good, one of them wasted his life and ended up in jail and the other one became member of hall of fame. Both documentaries teach a lesson however only one is inspiring."
The Last Dance,Maybe with sports junkies that read bullshit cbssports article and have ESPN. Tiger King is by far more popular than any documentary probably ever. The fact that they need to take two channels and put their ratings together to try to prove a point lmao nobody has watched the last dance more than people have watched tiger king.
The Last Dance,Dennis Rodman and Joe Exotic crossover when?
The Last Dance,I liked Michael Jordon for space jam and have no interest in nba. I put this on randomly and even for a novice I’m like “woah this dude just defies gravity” I’m hooked and want them to win the super league? Basket championship? The premier ballers? Either way. It’s a fantastic look into a sport I felt nothing for and all of a sudden I am watching classic games. Very well made.
The Last Dance,"This looks like click bait. Doesn't actually provide any information in the article to say the last dance surpassed tiger king as the most popular documentary of 2020. 

I would assume the title is completely wrong. I know people are dying for sports, and the Jordan doc has been fantastic right now, but Tiger King really impacted people across every demographic tuning into watch it and the Jordan Doc hasn't had the cultural impact that Tiger King Has. From my own sample size of my office, Almost 40 people here watched tiger king which is almost hte entirety of my office. I'm the only person who has watched the Jordan doc and no one has mentioned it."
The Last Dance,Nice try CBS.  No way that has been seen by more people than Tiger King
The Last Dance,Is this on Netflix?
The Last Dance,"Exotic Joe is going to be so upset that his 15 minutes have passed so soon, and while he was incarcerated."
The Last Dance,*So far.
The Last Dance,"It's more of a hagiography than a documentary, but enjoyable for basketball fans nonetheless, especially the ones like me who didn't live during that era."
The Last Dance,Where is this streaming?
The Last Dance,r/unexpected
The Last Dance,trying to find streams online for it has become really annoying
The Last Dance,"I'm actually surprised. Granted, I haven't watched either but I hear way more about Tiger King. Tiger King is talked about everywhere while I see little mention of The Last Dance."
The Last Dance,Is there a way to watch it for free?
The Last Dance,Thank god
The Last Dance,Not for me haven’t seen it
The King: Eternal Monarch,"If you liked the King, you should check out Goblin: the Lonely and Great God. It stars the same lead actress and is written by the same writer and it has a similar mixture of action, fantasy, romance, tragedy, etc. I'm watching the King now and enjoy it but I think Goblin is better.

If Goblin isn't on your local Netflix, you can watch it legally for free on Viki."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Thank god you didn’t say ‘Cursed.’
The King: Eternal Monarch,I would check it out but i really can't stand K-Drama's long ass episodes sometimes.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Watching if now on Viki and it’s fantastic so far.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I'm glad you're enjoying it! It's my favourite K-deama ever. I still listen to the soundtrack. If you're looking for a lighter, fun drama afterwards, check out my second favourite drama, Let's Eat. Both seasons are on Netflix, although I could never finish the second season. Season 1 is amazing."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Thank you!
The King: Eternal Monarch,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Good for Community.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
The King: Eternal Monarch,/u/wikirank please do this every month
The King: Eternal Monarch,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens —> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks —> Professor says something —> More talks about feelings —> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are —> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second —> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show’s success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
The King: Eternal Monarch,Ozark is so damn good!
The King: Eternal Monarch,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
The King: Eternal Monarch,You’d definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I’m surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
The King: Eternal Monarch,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC’s Dr Foster
The King: Eternal Monarch,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
The King: Eternal Monarch,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
The King: Eternal Monarch,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
The King: Eternal Monarch,TIL there’s a Japanese version of *Suits*.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
The King: Eternal Monarch,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Damn
The King: Eternal Monarch,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Prior?
The King: Eternal Monarch,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Good news for a potential movie too.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Is the show any good after S3?
The King: Eternal Monarch,[deleted]
The King: Eternal Monarch,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
The King: Eternal Monarch,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn’t realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Québec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
The King: Eternal Monarch,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
The King: Eternal Monarch,It’s a dumb translation but doesn’t take anything away from the show itself
The King: Eternal Monarch,Maybe English copyright issues.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
The King: Eternal Monarch,they're in their own world over there
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
The King: Eternal Monarch,I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
The King: Eternal Monarch,Sunk cost fallacy
The King: Eternal Monarch,The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
The King: Eternal Monarch,And it's a year old now!
The King: Eternal Monarch,Survivor is a TV series though
The King: Eternal Monarch,The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
The King: Eternal Monarch,Shit yourself.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Sim
The King: Eternal Monarch,Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
The King: Eternal Monarch,#sixseasonsandamovie
The King: Eternal Monarch,S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you’re watching the show."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
The King: Eternal Monarch,"How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I don’t think so. It’s not bad, it’s alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s *uhmayzing*."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit’s favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it’s probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it’s not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Rude
The King: Eternal Monarch,Kkkkkkkkk percebi que ela ficou muito popular do nada aqui mas não sabia que era por isso
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
The King: Eternal Monarch,If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
The King: Eternal Monarch,[deleted]
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

I still barely pirate stuff.

Cable costs me a dollar, Netflix and Disney plus aren’t expensive."
The King: Eternal Monarch,In the US. Netflix added Community globally.
The King: Eternal Monarch,[deleted]
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I feel the same. Saw first season, and it was quite predictable. Didn't get why it was so overhyped."
The King: Eternal Monarch,[deleted]
The King: Eternal Monarch,Already the 2nd one was already disappointing
The King: Eternal Monarch,">You won't get a good answer in /r/television

Proceeds to give good enough answer"
The King: Eternal Monarch,But Westworld is garbage.
The King: Eternal Monarch,Apparently I'm the only one that liked season 4 of Money Heist.  AMA
The King: Eternal Monarch,#NeckbeardRage
The King: Eternal Monarch,"I think it's moreso that it would be easier for me to obtain the actual legal rights to something I want to watch, than it would be to teach somebody like my mother how to pirate a movie."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Its not about being lazy, a lot of people  maybe have an interest in watching something but dont care enough to seek it out and are happy to just wait for it to come to a streaming service and just have a look at whats available at the present."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"Almost everything is easily available though (generally speaking, I don't know about your specific country). Anything not on Netflix will be on Prime Video, HBO or on any other streaming platforms, or on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Store, Youtube movies, you name it.  So we're back to the money question.

Except in rare cases, it's not about availability, not anymore. That was true 10 years ago."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Being predictable isn't a bad thing
The King: Eternal Monarch,I could go into specifics but i dont wanna give spoilers.
The King: Eternal Monarch,"To each his own,but if you already dislike 2nd season you should definitely not waste your time on the 3rd and 4th."
The King: Eternal Monarch,Why is it garbage? I completely disagree
The King: Eternal Monarch,"SPOILERS! DONT GO AHEAD IF YOU DIDNT WATCH SEASON 4.



1.How could Tokyo(not a surgeon) save Nairobi from a sniper shot even with an surgeon guiding her? beside the fact that the they lost the connection with the surgeon and Tokyo had to do it alone.No matter how much the proffesor trained her 6ou do not go from a normal person to a surgeon that does high risk surgeries.

2.Why go thru all this fuss to save Nairobi for in the end to kill her? If you let her die when she was shot the first time,she died with a purpose,Nairobi wanting to see how her child looks but instead she died cowardly getting shot by that special agent.

3.All those scenes with the special agents were like an action movie in which the main character will not die no matter what.And yeah i understand that he was a renown agent but if they wanted to make him powerful they could have done it by making him take smart decisions(tactics)instead of him surving 500 shots.How did that dude not get shot in that scene when he was in the middle and was shot at by both sides,one from the elevator one from the other side? and it wasnt just 3 bullets or 10,it was like 300.Yeah he had a bulletprof vest and helmet but still.

Another Rambo scene is with Nairobi when she died.The special agent tells her that she gonna get shot and the crew just stand by and watches him shot here.After that the crew shot at him but it appears out of 7 people with assault rifles nobody could shot him.

4.Music and sound effects were trash.

5.They could have ended the show in this season but they decided to do another for $$$ and because of this the season felt so slow that i was doing something else while watching it.

6.The development in relationships sucked too.

7.I get it that Berlin was one of the best character in the first 2 seasons,but they have to let him go.Its cool to get 1 or 2 scenes with him after he died but having 35% flashes of the past just straight sucks.

8.There was so more things to talk about but i forget about them since i watched the season a month and a half ago.This season felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie.The only ones who will like this type of season are the ones who are under 15 and like watching series like Riverdale,Arrow, etc.If you are 18+ and watched lots of series like The wire,The Sopranos,Dark,Mr.Robot etc that actually has good writing you will find this series garbage."
The King: Eternal Monarch,What you described is a lazy attitude.
The King: Eternal Monarch,It kills suspense and feels pointless to watch if it's not done right imo
The King: Eternal Monarch,Completely agree. S2 was so bad that I didn't keep watching and wish I hadn't even begun watching
The King: Eternal Monarch,"> felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie

I think you've figured out why Money Heist is so popular"
The King: Eternal Monarch,"No its not. Not everyone cares about tv shows that much. Saying ""I'm interested in watching community so I'll wait for it to come to netflix"" doesnt mean someone is lazy, it means they're not desperate to watch it right now. Believe it or not, people can enjoy tv shows but also its not something they spend a ton of their time doing, so watching if its there vs actively spending time seeking it out on a feasible viewing platform is a decisions based on interests and not laziness. Im an example of that, I love iasip but I spend my time doing other things generally and watch tv shows during dinner etc... so it works better for me to wait for it because I'm not in any rush to see new episodes when they're released."
The King: Eternal Monarch,"That is *so* fucking weird man. You can download new episodes an hour after they air in like 5m max depending on internet speed, then stream them to your smart TV and watch them. It's the definition of lazy, especially on good shows like IASIP."
The King: Eternal Monarch,How is it hard to understand that tv shows aren't a priority to everyone? Like how is it not clear that I don't care about watching new episodes of a tv show an hour after they air? I enjoy tv shows but they're not at the top of my list of activities. The definition of lazy would be if I was absolutely desperate watch new episodes but couldn't be bothered to look for them. Thats completely different to where tv fits into my life.
The Twelve,"Spoiler Alert:  Their friend is Jesus, but they call him Joshua.

Edit:  I mean Yashua."
The Twelve,These people are bat-shit crazy and have a restaurant near me. Will definitely watch.
The Twelve,"the one near me makes really good food though and is open 24 hours a day except for fridays

they also let anybody who says they cant afford to pay to come in and get a free meal"
The Twelve,"I know of them from concert parking lots. I believe that they were on Dead tour in 2009. They did some phish tours, too."
The Twelve,I just finished this - absolutely amazing.
The Twelve,"I kept feeling stupid that I caught a few words of German but the accents and rest seemed French. Of course, its Belgian."
The Twelve,[deleted]
The Twelve,"I got that afterwards, Belgian show, in Flemish. I got around easier with German and the handful of shared words than English when I visited a few years back. I am not great at languages"
The Twelve,"Don't go beyond season 1, quality really drops off"
The Twelve,"I really enjoy Killing Eve but if you have all of these issues with Season 1, you might as well stop there because the following seasons are much less tighter. They have no idea what they're doing with the Twelve but I personally love Villanelle, Konstantin and Caroline (and Kenny!) so I don't care so much about the plot.

I like Eve but I think she becomes increasingly less interesting as the show continues. Season 1 is the best season for her character."
The Twelve,"I too was excited about a show about an intelligence officer battling wits with an expert assassin.  I know a lot of people like the show, but I felt the same way you did.  First few episodes were very good and I noticed the same change you did.  Eve was dumbed down and seemed weak.  Others may disagree but the scene in episode 5 ?  where she stood frozen while Villanelle walked across a field shooting at her was not very realistic.  We aren't alone as I read quite a few comments on IMDB from season one that felt the same way; interesting early on but absurd by the middle of season one."
The Twelve,"The show is quirky and wild. If you don't get that, you should stop now."
The Twelve,"I loved the first season.

I think the next two seasons are ok.

Villanelle was an interesting new character but I now think she is fairly one note. Eve stayed interesting to me although she became more and more unrealistic."
The Twelve,"Ah thanks for letting me know, yeah I was disappointed because I was enjoying the characters and their chemistry but it feels like it really fell apart unfortunately"
The Twelve,"Right, and I've watched shows that get to that point of absurdity, but it's usually a few seasons in not the middle of season 1, it was kind of bizarre. And it wasn't the good, entertaining kind of absurdity, it started dragging and got hard to follow and really boring. Super disappointed"
The Twelve,"Bruh, I appreciate the effort and the analysis, but damn I’m gonna need a minute to run through this."
The Twelve,">Creed Bratton talks about important static circumstances and outcomes

>an ""outcome"" is some relatively major event/effect (good or bad, actual or hypothetical) that changes or sums up the matter

""When Pam gets Michael's old chair I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go."""
The Twelve,"Do you really see and pick up on all this while watching a show? If yes please don't stop writing these because they're super interesting, one of my hobbies is writing and when you break down the dialogue of the characters like this, it really helps you to create a unique voice for every character."
The Twelve,"Damn u really had some free time there lol

Interesting read though"
The Twelve,Maybe it's time to take a break and watch another show
The Twelve,music bands?
The Twelve,">*I MISS DWIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS, UNIVERSE. YOU WIN.*

The Twelve,"I believe you can apply those patterns to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece look alike)
 
Bonus with *inane* music band analogies:

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
Too Hot to Handle,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
Too Hot to Handle,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
Too Hot to Handle,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
Too Hot to Handle,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
Too Hot to Handle,"I’ve been watching THTH and I’m like four episodes in. Some of the conversation feels so artificial especially in the opening scene when they’re talking about fucking each other in less than a few seconds of meeting each other. It doesn’t matter how someone pitched Orgy Island to you, nobody is that forward, not even the shallow Instagrammer squad.

The fact is nobody really seems to care much about the money because they’re seemingly pretty wealthy anyway. The stakes need to be higher and involve people straight up getting booted off if they even so much as kiss. And as another user said, they don’t quite explain the prize pool: does everyone get $100k? Is it split between the remaining contestants? 

The narrator is not funny and strays toward really corny lame jokes. You can almost feel how she recorded her lines sitting at home watching footage and trying to riff as she goes with no one to proof it. ""What time is it? Time to build deeper connections!"" Please god make the cringe go away."
Too Hot to Handle,"The biggest problem with the show is that it is tonally all over the place. It’s obviously trash, but it paints itself as wanting to be empowering to men/women. The parts that aren’t trashy are boring af. 

I agree though that there needed to be something done about people that had no relationships. Like the Irish girl. She did nothing.

Also, why wasn’t there nudity? I’m surprised because Love Island isn’t as prudish and they’re both UK production companies. 

Why was the Irish girl left in the game? She was invisible."
Too Hot to Handle,I'm 5 episodes in and everytime Harry opens his mouth you just want to smack him. He's literally a whiny baby narcissist.
Too Hot to Handle,"What does Francesca see in Harry? The whole time I was watching him, I wanted to shave his horrific bangs off."
Too Hot to Handle,Kind of feels like that twist would work better with couples. Like literal honeymooning couples.
Too Hot to Handle,"Watched it all and I found a lot of things particularly annoying

1. They never resolved the conflict between Harry and Fran when Harry admitted to camera that he lied to the boys, and painting Fran as manipulative to the whole house. How is Lana supposed to make the boys better people when she never disciplined Harry for that heinous act and basically allowed him to go scott free. Also she lets Fran essentially get gaslighted and go back to him. Anyone seeing this the way its edited at least has to question if this is actually developing a deeper connection or just trying to stoke one of the only two real couples the show produced
2. Contestants were kept around for too long and there was not a lot of shift between the original group. In this case they might want to follow a love island type rule where if you arent coupled up or shown tangible proof that you are improving yourself like opening yourself up to others or showing maturity then after each episode that contestant goes home. I feel like they tried this sparingly because they just didnt have a lot of contestants lined up. This would have let people like David, Kelz and Chloe stay because I do feel they improved by themselves but kicked out Haley, Nicole, Matthew, and Kori sooner. Haley  and matthew would have either left a lot sooner or actually have been able to find someone to connect with.
3. There needs to be more punishment. The show tried to correct for how much Fran and Harry were accruing the mass amount of spending by giving them the opportunity to make it up. The problem is that I dont feel like it showed them as making better connections. Those two just stopped touching to not be forever hated for basically ruining the experiment for everyone. Realistically for the amount they took from the pot they obviously aren't going to connect deeper as people because they had already blown their load so they should have been kicked from the pot. But at least they would keep their relationship. I think the only reason why they were not kicked off the pot was because they were one of the only two couples.

So yeah I echo a lot of the complaints, lack of defined rules, not enough time and no revolving wheel of contestants to actually give those looking for change via love a chance or at least to actually try to practice chastity. I think their goal was to try to market love island with the gimmick of no sex with the pretense of self betterment.  However, Love Island itself basically does this already without having that gimmick. Love Island is still trashy sexed up tv but ironically focuses itself better on the real romantic connections because they actually let the contestants try to find them instead of sticking only a few people on a beach hoping a couple stick."
Too Hot to Handle,I couldn't get over how unnecessarily hostile and unfunny the narrator was.
Too Hot to Handle,"I breezed through but sort of wasn't motivated enough to either like or dislike it. It did come off as a bit haphazard.

>Netflix clearly thought they could fix it in the edit by letting a comedian just riff over the whole thing.

A small note that the show was created by U.K. production company Talkback and distributed by Freemantle. Netflix acquired it."
Too Hot to Handle,[deleted]
Too Hot to Handle,"I'm only on episode 5 and it's an entertaining show so far. But I'm really bothered by how Harry wasn't called out from lying about the kiss and turning the group against Francesca. Also the way the rest of the women didn't back her up because she's the most attractive (debatable, I know). Chloe in particular seems to dislike her from the beginning. When they were being introduced she was already starting a conversation with the rest of the girls, ""What do you think about Francesca?"" Like giiirrrl.

The rest of the group who do not have any pairing or similar connections seem to just be hanging out on the sideline and the show doesn't seem to make use of them a lot either."
Too Hot to Handle,"bryce is the worst of all lol, his acting was so bad, he made the show even cringier"
Too Hot to Handle,"Show was trash. I think they should’ve kept the rule breaks anonymous and had to spend $1,000 to reveal who broke the rules. Would’ve spiced it up a little. Also should’ve had some sort of real elimination process for those not making a connection. Just poorly executed. 3/10"
Too Hot to Handle,"My biggest problem with the show is that the show doesn't know what it wants to be.  
If you're going full trash, go full trash. Go balls to the wall, show everything. You're Netflix, there are no rules.  
If you're going for a deeper meaning about getting past superficial relationships and building deeper connections, using some people who are actually likeable might help."
Too Hot to Handle,"I liked it a lot. I mean it's the trashiest show I watched so far, but was very entertaining and funny."
Too Hot to Handle,"Not that I'm disagreeing but to be honest I'm assuming this could be more the norm for a while as TV shows with trucks worth of footage are edited--remotely. I applaud the push for my industry to WFH, but without clear structures in place and a story editor *sitting with* video editor and post supervisor, so much is going to be lost in translation and will fall flat. Especially with a premise as loose as this one sounds. 

TL;DR--Reality TV shows that debut ""B.C."" will likely suffer, being rushed to air while the post department flies blind. It will improve...eventually. :) 

That said, thank you for the time-saving heads up!"
Too Hot to Handle,"At the end they were like “ oh crap, we need 10 people for the workshop but we still have 11 so let’s pretend chloe is sick”. This really sums up how crappy this entire show is and I can’t believe I kept watching every episode."
Too Hot to Handle,I agree with most of your points and still enjoyed it lol
Too Hot to Handle,"Holy shit, the amount of people that actually enjoy this show kind of freaks me out."
Too Hot to Handle,"Honestly it was just as enjoyable to me as any other goofy, trashy reality show with hot people in a nice location. These shows aren't meant to be watched closely or analyzed, in my opinion - if you just toss it on while you're doing something else, it's totally enjoyable. 

I agree that the rules aren't set out clearly and that does hamper the structure of the show. But if you remind yourself that you're watching vapid reality TV, it stops bothering you pretty quickly. Genuinely, these shows can keep swirling further and further down the toilet and it won't change my opinion of them at all, because I'm not looking for quality when I turn one of these goofy turds of a TV show on.

I thought this particular show was an amusing descent into debauchery and my only wish was that it had hit a point where they cut their losses and just threw it out the window for a giant orgy."
Too Hot to Handle,"I was dying because at the end, it seems like they want to make it appear as if the participants experienced growth, maturity, self reflection etc. Did they rly think that these vapid individuals will suddenly stop caring about the number of instagram followers after the show ends?? 

And the idea about building deeper connections - the moment this show ends I just know everyone will go back to being their cocky self absorbed selves IRL.. and also the money they won doesn't really seem that deserved esp cuz so many of them still ended up kissing and having sex?!?!?!"
Too Hot to Handle,"Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghost busters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all of the while the slime was under the building"
Too Hot to Handle,i hope the winner proclaimed themselves the master of their domain
Too Hot to Handle,"Just finished binge watching and I just have to disagree with you. I found the show to be really funny and well done. I loved the narrators roast, and you can not tell me bounty hunter jesus was not one of the greatest things ever. Him hunting down Hayley was amazing it was uh pretty sad to see him try talk to Madison? 

One thing I feel is that the show is not at all about the money. It’s about self improvement. You see these amazing sexy perfect people and as you watch you realize they have the same problems, fears, and anxieties as you and that they have so much to improve on. I think it was fairly obvious the money was going to everyone at the end after they removed Hayley. I do dislike that they had Lana fuck her over because I’d rather had have them try to fix her problems as well. 

There were some obvious problems of course. I would definitely recommend not adding people midway through but after two from the og group dropped I guess the producers felt forced. I completely disagree with you about their removals and felt it completely made sense. After Hayley decided to fuck over everyone, everyone hated her and there was no reason to keep her. She had no interest in anyone calling them all stupid. The only thing Madison did was jebait my boy jesus into think she was not just a thot. But also his uhh yeah we wont talk about that. Kori had his part but after the date with Francis(I CAN NOT BELIEVE SHE EVEN WENT ON IT) everyone just hated him. Lydia and Bryce were both good additions but Lydia and Davids thing got no real expansion. 

Things I’d like. Straight up. I want a longer season. I felt that the biggest problem was just that there was so little time to really interact with each bother and figure out if you could go it with anyone. Nicole was constantly saying how much she wanted to fuck but when did she ever talk to a guy. So something like 12 episodes. Content wise I want way more workshops and activities. More dates. But especially in the early part maybe a sort of speed dating workshop. 12 starting contestants with a larger prize pool. As the end of the day it’s obvious that due to the nature of the show everyone at the end will win is guaranteed. So having $100,000 split between ten is $10k thats fucking nothing. And obviously people are gonna fuck around. I think making the price pool way larger but with the same percentages relatively would make so much more engagement to the contest part instead of people not giving a fuck about <10k. 


Overall I think that and a few other minor shakes ups like different punishments and rewards will solve a lot of the lack of “interesting” content. 

I also want to shout out David. That guys is the nicest fucking guy ever. After the group morale is fucked after The double kiss beginning he leads a workout session to get everyone together, he moves out of the way for his friend after he thinks he found his own genuine connection, and when Harry was super depressed about Francis going on the date with Kori he was legit there with him the entire time. He was the group leader and I’m real sad none of the gals fell hard for him but tbh none of them deserved him."
Too Hot to Handle,"I have a few issues with show:  


1. It's clearly scripted and they don't really hide it. The conversations and forced relationships feel really awkward and unnatural. A bit more on this later.
2. The cast's size made it hard to get anything meaningful going on between more than a few of them. Matthew, Haley, and Nicole especially contributed very little to the show excluding some very minor highlights. The show mainly catered to Sharron and Rhonda and Francesca's on and off relationship with Harry.
3. THIS IS A BIG ONE. The cast itself is very unlikeable and unrelatable. Sure, David is a sweetheart and he largely gets a pass here but the rest of the cast are all either Instagram models or reality tv stars in some capacity. They're all objectively beautiful and in all honesty, I just can't really relate to any of them because of how vain and disconnected from reality they are. For every touching moment with relatability we would have with somebody like Sharron with his trust issues and baggage, we were hit with dozens of vapid issues in relation to hook up culture and being too beautiful to ever worry about sex in the first place. Being released during a time where people are much more aware of social boundaries and trying to respect each other's choices, a majority of the dialogue comes across as tone-deaf and unrealistic. As somebody who had to live in a frat house and is very much familiar with the culture, everything in this show was a far cry from actual conversations that horned up young adults have on a daily basis. 
4. The narrator is pretty meh. Very subjective but I just felt like the dumb one liners added very little to the show. Honestly would have been better with a laugh track.
5. ANOTHER BIG ONE. The addition and subtraction of cast members comes out of nowhere and the show itself has no real structure. The intricacies to a pseudo game/reality tv show can go a really long way in making trash watchable and unfortunately, this show lacks most of those cogs and wheels to keep viewers interested. Maybe they could have instituted some sort of voting system or allowed the contestants to be off the director's leash a bit more in order to make some more compelling and fluid dialogue. They could have had real stakes and drama that mattered as people tried to side against one another and we didn't get any of that....and it saddens me. Plus, most of these people have a shit ton of easy money coming their way in endorsements already so it's hard to feel like 100k matters much to anybody (especially Francesca) and the whole prize concept of the show really doesn't make anybody feel compelled to stick around for some crazy ending.  


There are so many ways to make this show watchable and enjoyable (it has been done plenty of times before). As far as trashy tv goes, there is much better stuff out there to waste your time and I would largely advise anybody curious to skip this and rewatch LI, Big Brother, or the Circle for something palatable."
Too Hot to Handle,It looks like Love Island but mediocre tbh (love island is already a bit boring now).
Too Hot to Handle,kelz is the goat
Too Hot to Handle,"I am starting episode 4.

The Circle was kinda fun and cringe.

Love is Blind really boring except first few episodes.

Now, Too Hot to Handle is pure definition of cringe and just makes no sense.

\- People crying after being few hours without sex. When the motivation is 100k.. I doubt they had their last sex just before they left for show and now counting minutes before another round. (Ye Bryce fucks everyday, good for him)

\- Literally all they care about is the looks, no mention of personality - ever lol. All they ever talk is *""I WANT YOU SO MUCH, I CANT RESIST, SHOULD WE? SHOULD WE NOT?""*

\- Most People seem like they are either on instagram, in gym or in front of the mirror 24/7, so they don't really have anything to talk about and have no personality? I bet they spend just half day doing makeup in the show.

I feel like the whole premise of the show is just too dumb. In the most reality tv shows, you want the viewer to care about the goal or relate to it. But from the start you don't even know how much time they need to be without sex. For the viewer it is like - ""Hmmm is it like 2 weeks or a month without sex? I could definitely do it.""

I should be interested enough in a show that offers you **10 BORING PEOPLE TRY NOT TO FUCK EACH OTHER.** Well, the only thing that keeps you interested is question ""what the hell are they gonna do for 8 episodes???"".

And if you wanna tell me **THEY are US**, because we are in quarantine and feeling the same. I have a better idea for a show that I will relate to in quarantine - *Close 10 people into solitary confinement, survivors get 100k.*"
Too Hot to Handle,"Totally agree with you. At this point i feel like this TV shows are made

so those people can be mocked at. Everyone knows they are not the brightest and their moral compases are pretty primitive and they care about just 1 thing. To the peoplew ho take care for this people to have food on their table , roofs on their heads , they just seem dumb and weird, so we enjoy them for leisurely fun when we are bored."
Too Hot to Handle,"Agree with you completely. 99% sure it's scripted as well. The people not having sex just don't care about the money at all. No one gets mad at the assholes eating up the money. In fact, they congratulate then and say it's good for their relationship. No fucking way those people wouldn't be just going off on those brain dead idiots.

Like it honestly makes me angry. I enjoyed Love is Blind because there was actual structure to it and the personalities played well off each other. It was absolute trash, but it was well executed trash. 

This show has no structure. No rules. Follows just 2 couples really. The rest of the people just hanging out or get booted off arbitrary. I get so angry watching it."
Too Hot to Handle,"There are some bizarre cultural undertones as well. Everyone pretending they are talking to a ""computer"" instead of a woman fed lines by the producers to camouflage that they're monitored 100% of the time and doing the bidding of those producers, the idea that the only way to incentivize appropriate behavior is via cash prize or giving physical intimacy privileges, not telling the players how money would be allocated until the end (or pretending to do so), pretending there aren't camerapeople on set ALL the time (though that's standard for reality TV), the fact that contestants openly thank ""Lana"" as converts to a new religion and act as though they don't understand it's just the producers...truly baffling."
Too Hot to Handle,"The show is a train wreck but I’m not about to stop watching. 

I don’t know how completely the producers/editors changed the footage but it was jarring to see people go straight into sex/relationships after about 24 hours together. All the conversations they show in the early episodes are just about how hot everyone finds each other. 

It’s fun to watch someone who is clearly very attractive, and then the footage showing their actual personality makes them so undesirable."
Too Hot to Handle,"I can't believe how much I dislike everyone on this show lol. 

Still entertaining though!"
Too Hot to Handle,"i just started watching it and i don't understand the stakes. if it's 100k total then they only get 10k each minus taxes. that's nothing. especially for people who clearly were able to leave their jobs/ have their rent paid while they're gone.

&#x200B;

if i was as horny as these people i would just say screw the money and let's all have sex and ruin this show haha"
Too Hot to Handle,I really like the episode where the men rub mud on each other and shout and hug though I thought it was quite touching
Too Hot to Handle,"None of it made any sense.  I couldn't figure out how the second activity took place halfway into the ""challenge"" on day 15.  What had they been doing up to that point?  After 15 days it seems like even the shallowest of people would have gotten to know each other far better than what was portrayed.  I found it irritating the creators assumed the viewers had no interest in any of the people who hadn't paired off, which was the vast majority.  They were supposedly there to learn how to connect with people on a deeper level and while some of the contestants alluded to the fact that they did, those supposed connections were portrayed as very superficial.  I only made it to episode 5 so maybe it got better.  I'm not remotely invested enough to go another 3."
Too Hot to Handle,"I like the show, but by episode 4 i really got the impression Francesca and Chloé had been planted. They are the 2 only participants who ever start anything at all."
Too Hot to Handle,"This show is incredibly disorganized, probably very scripted, and has an uncomfortable concept... The whole show is just horny people trying to resist their urges with money on the line. The Bachelor, Love Island, Love is Blind, etc. all fall into a similar category of reality TV. The difference is that those shows have higher budgets and can pump out quality content (...for reality TV). Too Hot to Handle is the dollar store version of these shows so this one being ridiculous should not be surprising. I think that this is the type of show that you waste some time on but also have some good laughs with."
Too Hot to Handle,"This was the worst trainwreck I have seen all my life.    
F .... F-"
Too Hot to Handle,THTH is better than the circle and love is blind lmao
Too Hot to Handle,"Netflix has done this before with their reality shows. They have another series called The Fastest Car, a show about “regular” Joes and their hot rods drag racing against super cars.

The show itself is mostly about sob stories and drama, and the rules are not consistent throughout. I still recall in the very first episode, the referees lay out the rules that say if someone commits a false start - going before green - they will reset and have *one* more shot before they’re DQed. 

Well, I think in episode 4 or 5, a couple racers commit a false start, and they just DQ them outright. No reset or explanation about when or why the rules changed. 

It is annoying that they don’t go over the rules clearly. I wonder if they do it just so they can change the shows format or setup as they want to maximize drama and tension."
Too Hot to Handle,It's addictive but terrible
Too Hot to Handle,This show is fucking stupid. Why would anyone trust other ppl with their money not to commit sexual acts. The cast shoulda just all fucked each other in the first 10 mins and let the money get to $0 and gtfo outta there. Show makes no sense.
Too Hot to Handle,"Is wearing a bikini top that is a little too small so the bottom half of your tits hang out, a new fad? Seems like all of the women do it constantly.  I think it looks fucking gross."
Too Hot to Handle,my two cents: the men were all hideous& shallow - Francesca totally overrated and plastic. I warmed up to Sharran and Rhonda a little.
Too Hot to Handle,Hoooly shit this show makes me lose faith in dating.
Too Hot to Handle,"Well, I enjoyed it for what it was, which was trashy TV.

I was really disappointed in how only 2 couples really dominated the entire thing and we never got to see enough of EVERYONE and their time on the island.

Hands down tho, my favorite was Matthew aka Jesus.  Like I wanted him to have more screen time and when he did, well, it wasn't pretty but that's my dude! lol

I'm kinda surprised they only got 8 episodes total over a 6 week (unsure of total time line) span?

When Bryce was introduced, I couldn't have laughed harder as I was like... WTF is that guy doing here?  He seemed so out of place."
Too Hot to Handle,"I wonder what would have happened if all the contestants just said fuck it and like just hooked up to get the pot to zero dollars.

&#x200B;

I think that may have been more entertaining."
Too Hot to Handle,Grrrr omg all them so fucking annoying why did I have to sit through that steaming pile of shit! Harry is the most annoying little shit I have ever had to watch. The funniest thing is that he is going to go back to mummy and daddy’s big house with lots of money and carry on being an 18 year old... as if Francesca thinks she has actually found a man 😂😂😂
Too Hot to Handle,"I just started washing this trash hole yesterday. 

No person on this show has a single redeeming quality and their constant talk about how difficult it has been to abstain from sex so far (on episode 4 right now) is so fake. 

Like you've never gone a couple of days without having sex? Please. 

All that does is make you look like a huge douche to say that. 

People who tend to brag about sex all the time aren't getting any."
Too Hot to Handle,"I see a lot of good ideas, being suggested to the wrong people, I liked the show because i got to look at Rhonda , everytime i stopped what i was doing to look up at the tv. I like the superficial sexualy driven mood this show brought,  its fun and creates a relatable feeling, but everyone here is completely right.

And it would be nice to see these things implemented if they somehow funded a 2nd season. I  like this more than the circle, I just didnt like the whole catfish thing, it was weird and it was a little cringey ngl.

This show as well has its  questionable moments, but  wed be lying if claimed we havent experienced/seen people do more with less time and involvement"
Too Hot to Handle,"Yeah this show should have been called ""Too Boring to Watch"""
Too Hot to Handle,I don't watch reality TV. But the hot girls made me enjoy the show. I cringe at some parts. I can't tell if I like the show or just like the girls.
Too Hot to Handle,"It is truly awful, I don't normally watch these shows but I get the gist.  It feels like a complete parody..  Me and a couple of friends are watching it ""ironically"" and mocking it for how awful/fake it is - but how many are genuinely into this and lapping it up?"
Too Hot to Handle,"You need to ad ""spoiler alert""!!!"
Too Hot to Handle,"I honestly felt like I learned a lot from Too Hot To Handle, especially being someone with commitment issues. Although it may be a cheesy reality love show, it was more than what I expected watching the opening to the first episode. 

So, you know I had to blog about it, lol. I still loved the season and hope they continue with a Season 2!! [https://www.thisisuproar.com/post/5-things-netflix-s-new-too-hot-to-handle-teaches-people-with-commitment-issues](https://www.thisisuproar.com/post/5-things-netflix-s-new-too-hot-to-handle-teaches-people-with-commitment-issues)"
Too Hot to Handle,I just finished episode six and the main problem besides the shitty production is the lack of attractive women to compete with Francesca. Not saying the guys are all hot shit either but jeez
Too Hot to Handle,"Netflix cheapened itself by getting in the trashy reality show business. Amazon would never.

EDIT: downvoted by idiots that watch this shit and think Better Call Saul is slow and boring."
Too Hot to Handle,Who the fuck watches TV shows like this?
Too Hot to Handle,two words : Hot. garbage .
Too Hot to Handle,"This show was supposed to challenge these people and rehabilitate them but they werent super bad anyway and the whole temptation was useless and literally nothing happened as two of them were swiftly cut out.

Also so many people just got cut out so they would focus around the couples, we practically didnt see Mathew for a whole episode at one point, they only time people got screen time was if they were dating, breaking the rules, drama or in the confession booth. I really Kels but as soon Francesca left him he just became this old grumpy man getting pissed when people broke the rules.

That Irish lady (I cant remember her name) literally got nothing to do the whole time other than talk a few times to others. I'd try and bring other things up but that's literally everything we get for her.

Mathew is delt a bad hand, now he was my favourite character, Jesus was really wise and fun and I liked his deepness and advice, and he really was interesting, is what I would have said if we got time to build a connection too him, I swear after episode 3 or 4 who ever wasnt in a relationship or drama was completely put to the side and gathered dust and I'll be honest although the money at the end would have been nice I can see why he left.

Now Francesca and Harry are weird, they are given the most screen time by far but are some of the worst characters, they come of as bitchy and the whole ""I've never trusted someone like this before"" is so unfounded its just hard cause when I saw them I thought these guys could be interesting especially with the drama at the start and I did like the Francesca Haley plot until it just went and sizzles out. This show messes up with not sharing screen time enough with the WHOLE cast and obviously making it up as they go along, plus the comedian who narrated isnt even that good, I only sniggered once at her comments and that was a footjob joke! It's just really sad to see so many underused characters.

I like Sharron and Rhonda, I'd say there soem ofbthe best cast and especially now with more background on both of them I'm glad they left together, they definitely have the best growth in my opinion from beach sunscreen butt rubs to dates on a boat, it's honestly nice to see them together and I'd sometimes forget what I was watching when it was just them.

I'm not gonna do other characters as they're pretty forgettable and lack remarkable qualities such as charisma which slightly shines through with bryce but other than that not so much.

The premises itself is kinda BS. A wanna be echo dot telling horny adults not to fuck and then letting them kiss occasionally plus the rules were flimsy as fuck and everyone winning is kinda crap I was hoping that instead of money being deducted they would get straight up eliminated to try and knock it into them that they shouldn't just go round having 1 night sands and what not and if they had to maybe to a redemption challenge and the fact that the contestants just got nearly a third of their money back anyway is  awful they should have to live with the consequences of their actions. What I think happened is that the producers knew they need to give them more than $4,300 so they cut the newbies which is unfair and I didnt even like them, the only reason Layla stayed is cause she stuck with that other English guy. The prodyces were then also like 'shit they need more money, OK Harry and Francesca you two go to the suite you guys can do whatever we will give you the money anyways' and that's what happened. All in all I think 'Too Hot To Handle' was an unenjoyable, non-engaging, uninteresting, waste of potential and I doubt they will do another season purely on the reviews that are surely coming its way"
Too Hot to Handle,"Absolutely feels staged as fuck, like a producer is just off screen being like, ""how about you guys kiss to get ""revenge"" on the group?""  And I was so weirdly annoyed by the Harry/Francesca thing.  Like we all see Harry beg to kiss Francesca, and then blame her for moving on him.  Everyone in the group believes Harry because they all hate Francesca right away (a tale as old as time, btw), and somehow he gets off the hook while she's immediately labeled a manipulative bitch, despite Harry being shown telling everyone in the group that she's lying and kiki'ing.  And because of the show formula, Harry is never called on this and Francesca steps into the villain role (becoming the only semi-interesting character as a result).  Nonetheless, the whole thing is just coming off like Harry is a gaslighter who is just magically getting away with it over and over, even though his behavior is on film and not even edited to make it look more okay."
Too Hot to Handle,"Yeah I thought they would get booted off too, money doesn't seem to be much of an incentive or deterrent."
Too Hot to Handle,I think the host is hilarious! Adds a layer of fun to the show
Too Hot to Handle,"About the Irish girl Nicole O'Brien I was solely disappointed that she literally got no screen time, I calculated her allocated screen time and it only amounted to 4 minutes or so over the course of 8 episodes that are 43 minutes long."
Too Hot to Handle,i thought for sure she'd get booted with the 2 newer people. she didnt do ANYTHING
Too Hot to Handle,"He's a pretty standard modern Australian larrikin tbh. People love being around him and enjoy his banter, but he has a complete inability to take any responsibility for his actions"
Too Hot to Handle,"And he looks about 16 years old, while Fran looks like a proper aged person (25-29?). I don't see what she sees in him at all."
Too Hot to Handle,"Harry is a classic case of a tier 1 Fuckboi. Like Kelz told him, there are levels to this shit and dude is just on a different level of fuckboi douchebaggery that no one else besides Kori comes close."
Too Hot to Handle,I wanted to know this too. Aside from physical attraction that is. In the later episode they confessed they love each other and I wanna know how they get along and how it came to that. The only conversation I remember them having is how to pronounce oregano.
Too Hot to Handle,There is literally nothing appealing about him. I don’t get it.
Too Hot to Handle,I would pay to see that😂
Too Hot to Handle,Nah this is just normal relationships for any couple not in their early 20s lol
Too Hot to Handle,"This needs a million upvotes. Literally seeing 
Harry be a dick the whole time and having zero consequences was so annoying. Also... him calling Kelz ugly even though I don’t think Harry is attractive in the slightest was so strange (could be personal opinion). 
I could watch love island all day and love it... but this show.. I skipped through SO many scenes lol"
Too Hot to Handle,"Omg thank you. I've seen so much about Fran and Harry and nothing yet about how much of an actual slimy cunt that guy is, a complete and utter creep who lied MULTIPLE times and made out as if Fran drove the whole kiss and then straight up told people she was manipulative etc when he was the one lying. It came off really badly, especially when they then paired them up and he tried to act as if he was being the bigger man person and trying to move past the whole thing and that she was being petty or whatever when she had every right to be upset at the incredibly douchey and downright disgusting way he acted.

I'm honestly surprised the showrunners couldn't see how problematic all those scenes were with him lying about his actions to others, then pretending like he didn't know exactly what he was doing and trying to make her feel like she was over reacting about it all. Proper gas-lighting."
Too Hot to Handle,My draw dropped when Fran told kelz that she made enough money from instagram and that she didnt care about the prize money. What a self centered person. The money is for everyone! Its a team activity! She was responsible for so much of their penalties and was never truly punished or put on blast. Clearly a person who has never been told no in her life.
Too Hot to Handle,What was hostile about her? All she commented on was the contestants goofy behavior. She didn't pick on them while they were brushing their teeth.
Too Hot to Handle,"The sad part is all these women are... so artificial** looking. I'm a lesbian and I find none of them attractive; so fake looking and ""filled up."" The second they start talking I lose brain cells. It's amazing to me how these are considered stereotypically ""hot"" people..."
Too Hot to Handle,I don’t know why the last name thing cracks me up lol!
Too Hot to Handle,Is she a bitch in real life? She seems like she'd be a bitch in real life.
Too Hot to Handle,"Chloe was insecure from the get go, and I think that might be her age speaking. 

I disliked how her first reaction on the Kori-Fran date was “she has no morals” as if Kori wasn’t the one who picked Fran. This is like when men cheat and the girlfriend/wife automatically blames the other girl—That sickens me. 

I hope when Chloe watches the show, she’ll see her reaction and reflect."
Too Hot to Handle,But what about his song? Man that was so bad. But he doesn’t care. He has sex every day of his life with someone new on his boat.
Too Hot to Handle,They could have literally pulled in any random bro from LA and it would have been the same person
Too Hot to Handle,I thought he was the worst. When he first strutted onto the scene all the women went nuts for him and I did NOT get it. He reminded me of Rob Schnieder.
Too Hot to Handle,"God I know, what a fucking douche bag he was"
Too Hot to Handle,"Adding to this point my biggest issue was the montage party dancing. The basic reality show premise is that you put people in a stressed environment, up the tension and then watch it all come out with alcohol at the end of the night. Here they replaced the pay off with bizarre cringy clearly staged dance scenes. Wtf?"
Too Hot to Handle,When Francesca got mad at Kelz for caring about the prize money and ran back to Harry the show made it clear that it was aiming to be trashy
Too Hot to Handle,[deleted]
Too Hot to Handle,That is literally the whole point and I love it. Its horribly trashy and a complete mess but I can't stop watching
Too Hot to Handle,That’s where I’m at too.  These people are thinking about it way too hard when minimal thought and peak absurdity make for one of the best watching experiences I’ve ever had.  It’s trashy and insane and I love it.
Too Hot to Handle,"I thought it had potential to beat bridalplasty as trashiest TV, but unfortunately, it did not reach that level for me. The ending of THTH was a bit too scattered, I wanted more ruthless culling of the contestants by the producers. Like kick off everyone who broke the rules even once, and everyone who never had temptation to begin with. Winners would be Kels and maybe that new girl that stayed, lol."
Too Hot to Handle,B.C.? I'm guessing it's Corona related but I dunno what it means.
#blackAF,I saw the first episode and it was funny but also was kinda depressing.
#blackAF,I mean obviously dude...it’s racism.
#blackAF,That looks hilarious
#blackAF,"This looks really funny, and I love Rashida Jones and black-ish, so I'm watching!"
#blackAF,"What a stupid title , seriously a fucking hashtag?"
#blackAF,"I watch episodes of black-ish on in the background or in pieces depending on when they're on TV but never had a desire to watch the whole thing. This looks great, I could see myself binge watching this to completion."
#blackAF,I love me some Rashida. I'm in.
#blackAF,first role where rashida jones plays a person of color?
#blackAF,When is WhiteAF coming out?
#blackAF,Can we get a #whiteAF and white-ish as well?
#blackAF,Same. Wonder if she’ll still guest star on Black-ish as rainbows sister again at some point
#blackAF,Rashida Jones is a person of colour so she’s arguably always playing a person or colour.
#blackAF,"Her dad is Quincy Jones, she is a person of colour and it is not like she is utterly unfamiliar with the black experience."
#blackAF,Friends debuted in 1994.
#blackAF,"Huh U got a documentary called ‘WHITE PEOPLE’ ..  Plus Tiger king... Between those two shows u should feel a lil less victimized. 
Idk about these other folks but I’d watch a show called #whiteAF if it looked funny."
#blackAF,Just say you’re racist and move on
#blackAF,"The first thing I did was scroll to the bottom to see if this comment would be here, and of course here it is. Congratulations.

Edit: Just to clarify, I’m not on their side. I thought that was clear. I can’t stand comments like this."
#blackAF,I think they called that one modern family.

#blackAF,How I Met Your Mother had nine seasons.
#blackAF,"Jones's characters have never been ""black."" So this is interesting. 

Barris seems like a pretentious douche. 

But no one is pointing out the ugly husband-hot wife dilemma."
#blackAF,im talking about he roles she plays
#blackAF,THIS! is the reply I was looking for. Thank you
#blackAF,Could you explain to me why this is racist?
#blackAF,Because they fucking hate when minorities have anything. It triggers the fuck out of them
#blackAF,"Because you know if a show called #whiteAF appeared it would be labeled as racist.

That's why people get annoyed. Who would've thought people don't like double standards? Crazy I know."
#blackAF,"Cool, let's name it #whiteAF first."
#blackAF,"On a post about a show with black in the name, you commented how there should be a white version of it. This expresses an idea that people of color having shows about them is an advantage above white people, which isn’t really fair given that they are still in fact a minority group who is oppressed in our time. By asking this question, you’re saying that white people are a victim, which negatively portrays people of color in a culture that already does so regularly. It’s like people posting “when is international men’s day” every international women’s day, it takes away from the the fact that a group with a social disadvantage has something to celebrate by playing the victim. It tears down groups instead of celebrating them"
#blackAF,[deleted]
#blackAF,So it's the name you disagree with?
#blackAF,"I feel like I shouldn't have to read all this.

But a comedy about how white a couple is would be intriguing."
#blackAF,"You sound like a huge pussy. I'm fine with a show like this and completely support it. However, if a show came out called WhiteAF, people would be up in arms."
#blackAF,[removed]
#blackAF,"What? You don't see a problem with the name #White AS FUCK?

If there was a show called #whiteAF or white-ish, you'll have Redditors and Twitter Warriors (one of the same these days) crying racism.

But since it's #blackAF or black-ish there's going to be crickets."
#blackAF,[deleted]
#blackAF,[deleted]
#blackAF,"That makes virtually no sense. Some of yall had a point with dear white people, but now you're just dragging it."
#blackAF,Yeah maybe I am. Was more just stirring the pot. Show looks funny
#blackAF,Posts about reddit activity > complains about 'profile zooming' > bruh moment
#blackAF,"I really liked it, It’s less corny than blackish and I like the dry humor. Rashida Jones is great in it too."
#blackAF,I'm loving the show. My husband and I were cracking up. I've only watched two episodes so far and am looking forward to see how it develops.
#blackAF,"It’s very much like black-ish, so if you don’t like Barris’s stuff, this show ain’t for you

I wish it was more snappy and authentic like insecure, but I dig the dry humor and there is a lot of meta stuff here (the daughter calling Barris a one trick pony in the first line of the show is a great acknowledgment by the creator and owning his lane lol). 

Basically, this show is about rich assholes but they are black. I can see curb fans maybe liking it, also rashida Jones is great."
#blackAF,I guess I’ll be a countervoice here & say that I loved it. Show really picks up after the 3rd episode and so many of the jokes landed. It was kind of refreshing putting on a show and not looking to dissect every facet of it or look to be constantly drawing comparisons to monumental work.
#blackAF,Honestly I find the show to be fucking hilarious. Only thing I didn't like was the Samsung product placement...and I have a Samsung
#blackAF,"I was really confused when they were like ""nobody celebrates Juneteenth""- maybe it's just very LA/west coast centric but virtually every black person I knew growing up in Texas celebrated Juneteenth."
#blackAF,"Blackish is as satisfactory as a family sitcom with school aged children and on a broadcast network can be at this moment in time, this seems to reveal a lot of the source code behind it. Barris is very weak as an actor and it takes a lot of extra effort to process his corrosiveness as scripted humor. Jones basically keeps it bearable and temperamentally it's kind of an interesting departure from her Office and Parks and Rec characters."
#blackAF,"S1E2 sold me, Rashida Jones on Molly? GOLDEN"
#blackAF,Anyone know which movie they were talking about in episode 5?
#blackAF,He's doing his best Larry David impression and it kinda doesn't work. Rashida Jones is funny as hell though.
#blackAF,"Not a fan, humor is really dry and the message isn’t really resonating with me. Might continue to watch just because Rashida Jones"
#blackAF,Holy shit too much narration. The cutaways to the documentary are too long and ruin the pacing. Could be a good show if they left all that out
#blackAF,Omg Kenya is such a bad actor. The jokes arent landing. Rashida is having a hard time too.
#blackAF,Show sucks
#blackAF,"I kind of liked the first couple episodes, then just couldn’t stand it anymore after....the main guy is just trying too hard and too arrogant."
#blackAF,"Read the comments, Remember why I hate the internet"
#blackAF,The first episode of this show pissed me off so bad I won’t even watch his others anymore out of spite.  I watched the entire episode and was like this isn’t too bad until the very end when he said he hates white people.  He and the show can suck a dick.  What a waste of my time and money.
#blackAF,Do you notice how it’s kinda filmed like The Office and Parks and Rec? They even brought some of the characters to the script. I honestly enjoy it more than Blackish.
#blackAF,Kinda follows same formula as blackish but has its own taste to it. The first episode was kinda hectic but it grows on you. Overall not the best show but a cool 8 episode binge fr
#blackAF,"Rashida jones is too good an actress to be involved with this show. This show is tone deaf af and is like the embodiment of that ellen degeneres twitter where she said that being stuck all day in her mansion is like being in prison. I only made it to the first 10 minutes of the 2nd episode, and its sad. Seeing some rich middle age fool spend half a show talking about how he hates white people when thats literally all he hangs out with. Anyone black who is not in his family just shows up as a poster or a picture. Weird."
#blackAF,"This seems like a less relatable Dear White People, and did anyone else get sick of Kenya by the 1st episode? His voice just seems to whine and whine and whine."
#blackAF,I’m enjoying it. But then again dry humor is my thing. It comes across as more mockumentury than anything else.
#blackAF,"I can't watch this crap. After the first show I turned it off. Blackish and BlackAF. Same show. I honestly don't know one black couple that acts like this. Let's take the annual statistical categories off the table. Black fathers, family, money.. etc.. It seems all black shows either have to be drug dealers or entrepreneurs. Catching the bus or taking private planes. Black people need a middle ground. A regular show. A regular life.. Seinfeld, Friends,  big bang theory, Office are just regular white people living regular lives and its hilarious and funny. Black people can make a show about just being a bus driver or a nurse or HR specialist or IT guy or anything besides the common shit we see on TV. Im ranting but Tyler Perry and now Kenya Barris have turned black people into this fake family bs. What parent have you ever came across that pops Molly with their kids at the same party and has a white male assistant who goes out and buys groceries.. Like who writes this shit.. When Tyler Perry did a cameo I fucking lost it. Im going to go back and watch Martin and Living Single. Where everyone is just  living day to day.  Come on man.."
#blackAF,The trailer made it seem like a carbon copy of Blackish but with Barris/Jones instead of Anderson/Ross. Is that the case?
#blackAF,I like the show so far. Good writing and the kids are hilarious.
#blackAF,"Anyone know why they keep mentioning Samsung Galaxy phones, Rashida straight up asked ,"" bixby"" to do something , I'm an android user all the way but it. seem a little wierd right"
#blackAF,I don’t understand the message the show is trying to portray. There are parts that I find funny as a 20 year old brown kid but I feel the show tries to push the idea that slavery has affected every part of black life which rlly isn’t true. Also since when is it laughed at and deemed ok to say I hate white ppl. Any reply to my thoughts would be great.
#blackAF,[deleted]
#blackAF,They call anything racist.
#blackAF,"Is there a reason they were absolute dickbags to the white couple at dinner?

I get that the joke is white people suck. But, I don't see how them supporting the purple hair is white gaze. 

Glad he sold that stupid fucking chain though."
#blackAF,"I'll stick with Black-Ish and Mixed-ish. 

Kenya's voice is annoying, the humor doesn't land with me, and everything about this just seems less polished than Black-Ish."
#blackAF,I'm enjoying it so far--nothing ground breaking but it grows on you.  The first like 15 minutes were rough though haha
#blackAF,[deleted]
#blackAF,Terrible. Rashida Jones can’t carry this show.
#blackAF,"Anyone else notice a similarityn of Kenya and lil Dickey's cadence in his speech? A naieve asshole. ...

He's also got a weird obsession with Jewish people."
#blackAF,"Show is hard to watch, should be called fakeAF. What husband calls their wife “dude” and shows no empathy or feelings towards them on screen? Pretty bad chemistry between actors, I actually feel bad for rashida Jones on this one cause she’s the only thing carrying the show."
#blackAF,eh. Not really a fan of the genre.
#blackAF,"I’m only 25 minutes in, and I’m not so impressed. 

Still unsure what they’re trying to convey. Is it that black rich people are asshole-ish or absurd as white rich people?

And why is there so much swearing? Swear words can and are pretty humorous when well used, but on this show, this family — even the random little kid — is seen swearing. Is this how American, or black, families address each other?"
#blackAF,I thought it sucked. He lost me in the beginning of the first episode when he said he hates white people.
#blackAF,Why did I expect Kenya Barris to be gay and jaded?
#blackAF,"Perfect, now shut your pie hole and find another place to troll."
#blackAF,"I don’t really like the show but I especially HATE the samsung product placement! All the phones are samsung phones, the laptops and tablets and it’s so unrealistic!"
#blackAF,It's just not good. It's black-ish mockumentary style. It's just trying so hard to be something it's absolutely not.
#blackAF,"It sucked af kenya b/harris was a complete asshole, rich prick, also racism goes both ways racism against non black people, and also, his wife who rashida jones plays, is bot even a black woman. Therefore it deserved to be cancelled and it should matter of fact"
#blackAF,"Love the show, crisp writing. Kids are hilarious, Ms. Lady lol"
#blackAF,"Us too. Although I will say I saw episode 3-4 first (husband started it without me.. grrr) and then eventually 1-2, and the latter episodes are much better. Funnier and flow is improved"
#blackAF,"I agree, I’m on my second ep and I kinda like it so far. I like both curb and enjoy blackish so makes sense. I loveee Barris & Jones together"
#blackAF,"they are rich assholes but they are NOT FUNNY. the first episode was painful. from him lecturing his assistant in a scene that was ten times too long, to her being an asshole to her friend at dinner. like what? if you're a dick you have to be funny. they aren't."
#blackAF,"Except CYE is actually funny? This is literal crap compared to the legendary Curb, cant even compare."
#blackAF,I grew up in Florida and we have ALWAYS had huge celebrations for it.
#blackAF,Never heard of it coming up in LA.  It ain’t a thing.
#blackAF,"Every black person I knew growing up in Houston, Texas celebrated Juneteenth, there is even a parade."
#blackAF,I guess it really just depends. I never really celebrated it in my life and I don't know anyone who has celebrated it.  I would like to start though.
#blackAF,As of the last 10 years maybe.
#blackAF,Reeeeeeally trying to figure it out. Maybe Us or Sorry To Bother You?
#blackAF,Literally only reason I looked for this sub reddit in hopes to find out.
#blackAF,I didn't think it was an actual movie after the way they were describing some of the stuff that happened in it.
#blackAF,"Sorry to bother you.

#blackAF,TBF I didn't like Curb Your Enthusiasm when I watched it either. I think the cringe 'aren't we all just so terrible' thing just doesn't work for me.
#blackAF,"Yeah was very Larry-esque, I think I love Larry so much that I just enjoyed this as well, no where as good, but still fun."
#blackAF,">Rashida Jones

She really carries the show."
The Innocence Files,"This show will catch on soon,  I would be shocked if it didn't.   It has everything you want as far as good guys, bad guys, the innocent, the guilty. 

Dr. West.   He is pretty easy to hate.   I don't have the time to go into that guy's problems,  but he is just one of those harmful people that believe they are 100% accurate,  and it does not matter what evidence you give that to the contrary.

I'm surprised his last name is not goalpost, because he sure knows how to move them"
The Innocence Files,"BTW, The Innocence Project should have their own TV channel,   because they have been behind some great documentaries."
The Innocence Files,"I cried the first few episodes, imagining being in prison 15+ years for something I couldn’t/didn’t  do."
The Innocence Files,"Netflix algorithm at it's best. My front page has some ""too hot to handle"" fake bullshit reality show, instead of this for example. And I watch a lot of crime and detective shows."
The Innocence Files,"If you like stories like this you should check out the fictional Rectify on Netflix , one of the greatest shows ever made"
The Innocence Files,"Eye witness testimony, EVEN FROM A VICTIM, is a joke.  Let’s just start with that...."
The Innocence Files,"This reminds me of John Grisham book, the guardians. 

Helping those innocent convict."
The Innocence Files,Can you recommend some other good ones and where to find them?
The Innocence Files,"Aww man, when Kennedy was freed and his mom started shouting and the whole courtroom just lost it"
The Innocence Files,The most amazing part for me was how forgiving they were. Incredible people those first two guys
The Innocence Files,I really teared up with Franky talking about his kid (which I guess was episode 5 or so?)
The Innocence Files,Dude.  I'm worried.  They're making more and more reality shows.  And they're showing up in the top ten.
The Innocence Files,"What kills me is that I'll select something and, after watching,  I conclude it is a steaming pile & give it a thumbs down, (I'm looking at YOU 'Coffee & Kareem'...) Netflix interprets it as 'SlashsHat doesn't like comedies'"
The Innocence Files,"Thanks for recommendation, will check it out."
The Innocence Files,And with Tre who plays Louis on Hey Shorty and went from OMIGOD I hate this guy (on rectify) to OMIGOD this dude is the best character on this show! (On hey shorty)
The Innocence Files,...except when it isn't--which is *most of the time.*
The Innocence Files,"The next two were incredible as well, the Hispanic and then Chester. Both seemed like such good and intelligent people. Terrible what was done to them, no amount of money will make up for losing 20+ years of their life."
The Innocence Files,"Eyewitness testimony is extremely unreliable. We have known this for at least a decade.

The Innocence Files,"""extremely unreliable""  
no...it fucking isn't.    

yep...we've known *for well over a decade* that people can be mistaken...that they can misremember details...and be implanted with false memories.  

exceptions to the rule.  
they happen. who cares?  
  
""eyewitness testimony is a joke""  
it's ""extremely unreliable""    

the number of cases where eyewitness reports are accurate--and sometimes THE thing that solve the entire case--are overwhelming.  
don't be a dunce."
The Innocence Files,Lol you’re last paragraph is hilarious and shows you’re commenting on a thread about a show you haven’t even watched.
The Innocence Files,"...show is about exceptions to a rule--that being that eyewitness testimony IS reliable most of the time.  

exceptions to a rule change that rule...how?"
The Innocence Files,On epi 6. Pretty fascinating. I’ll say the bite impression “expert” in the first few epis is a despicable human being
The Innocence Files,I’ve watched ep 1 and it was good. Not the best Netflix doc but I’ll watch more
The Innocence Files,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

The Innocence Files,Interesting to see containment show up.
The Innocence Files,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
The Innocence Files,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
The Innocence Files,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
The Innocence Files,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
The Innocence Files,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
The Innocence Files,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
The Innocence Files,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
The Innocence Files,How about movies??
The Innocence Files,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
The Innocence Files,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
The Innocence Files,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
The Innocence Files,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
The Innocence Files,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
The Innocence Files,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
The Innocence Files,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
The Innocence Files,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
The Innocence Files,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
The Innocence Files,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
The Innocence Files,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
The Innocence Files,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
The Innocence Files,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
The Innocence Files,[deleted]
The Innocence Files,Pandemic boost
The Innocence Files,He write it at the end of his post.
The Innocence Files,Last 100 days
The Innocence Files,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
The Innocence Files,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
The Innocence Files,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
The Innocence Files,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
The Innocence Files,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
The Innocence Files,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

I use this which considers all 3 to be exclusive international distribution deals.


Thank you for that other correction"
The Innocence Files,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
The Innocence Files,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
The Innocence Files,That's why I thought you should know...
The Innocence Files,[deleted]
The Innocence Files,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."
The Innocence Files,"Was kinda odd place to put it anyway.

Had to scroll all the way down to read what they meant then scroll up again.. :p"
The Innocence Files,Thank you. What a scummy guy
The Innocence Files,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
The Innocence Files,[deleted]
The Innocence Files,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
The Innocence Files,"She's so fucking good in Fringe. Liv can seem quite wooden at first, especially when she's opposite a man who regularly has emotional outbursts over sweets... until you start picking up on the fact she's just guarded in her expressions, and there's a million tiny ways she shows huge emotions"
The Innocence Files,"Also, John Noble in Fringe should have gotten emmy noms or awards, he is seriously fantastic.  Awards ignoring a great performance just because its a sci-fi show"
The Innocence Files,"also 'the newsreader' for something more recent. basically follows her as a nightly news anchor in 1986 that covers a really interesting few months where we have halley's comet, the challenger disaster, important update on ""the dingo stole my baby"" case, bombing of a police station in australia, and chernobyl."
The Innocence Files,or Mindhunter. She's great in it and the show itself is so enjoyable and well crafted.
The Innocence Files,"Brilliant series, one of John Noble's best roles. fun fact, there is an observer in every episode of Fringe, sometimes milling about in the background or,.. well.. observing."
The Innocence Files,"I’m rewatching s1 right now! Been meaning to do a full rewatch of the series, so what better time to start"
The Innocence Files,My cat is named Olivia Dunham
The Innocence Files,[removed]
The Innocence Files,Fringe was SOOOOOO good.
The Innocence Files,Loved her in Mindhunters
The Innocence Files,I'd say her best performance is from The Newsreader. The rent was due.
The Innocence Files,"Also, Mindhunter on Netflix."
The Innocence Files,I like the fringe so much I bought the whole DVD set
The Innocence Files,"Funny enough, I started S1 today"
The Innocence Files,Literally watching it right now. S1E6
The Innocence Files,She was amazing in Fringe.  Need more of her.
The Innocence Files,"Fringe is great. The last season is blatantly tacked on and imho, not very good."
The Innocence Files,"Loved that series, but it got a little TOO weird towards the end."
The Innocence Files,"I could never get through like season 4. Does it get better? Season 1 was one of the best seasons of television ever made, I just felt like they never knew where they were going after that."
The Innocence Files,"I still can't believe that people tuned out. Such a great show but the decline in ratings influenced story changes, a move to Fridays which was considered a death sentence to any tv show, time jumps that later became a plot point. To be fair, that was a pretty genius move by the writers. The fact everyone wrote the show off at s3 but it held on for 2 more seasons is further proof of what a great show it was. It was originally intended to last longer than it did. For the time it did some pretty out of place things. For those who have yet to see it, it has multiple dimensions, multiple timelines, alternate realities, a giant conspiracy that spans the whole of 5 seasons, and multiple endings."
The Innocence Files,"Whaaaat? I was a die-hard X-Files fan and you’re setting the expectations pretty high. I’ll give you that it ended poorly — both times, during the regular series and the reboot. 

But season 1-6 of The X-Files was insanely good. And Gillian Anderson was phenomenal from start to finish."
The Innocence Files,"Xfiles did it first and did it better. X-files did go on too long and ended poorly, that's for sure."
The Innocence Files,Fringe was amazing. Walter!
The Innocence Files,Great in Mindhunter aswell
The Innocence Files,I absolutely loved Fringe -- even bought the boxset during Amazon's prime day sales. Anna Torv was amazing. I loved her and Kirk Acevedo being partners. And when she had to play her alternate self. I miss the show immensely.
The Innocence Files,Fringe is fantastic.100% recommended.
The Innocence Files,Fringe is my all time favorite show. It was nice seeing Torv in LoU.
The Innocence Files,"X files on acid in the 70s

Outer Banks,Netflix execs must be happy with Season 3 if they renewed it before it premieres this Thursday.
Outer Banks,3 seasons in the can? Time me for to invest and give it a chance
Outer Banks,Good for Madelyn Cline. She's so beautiful and a pretty good actor.
Outer Banks,Don’t forget to take the ferry from chapel hill to Wilmington
Outer Banks,"This is such a fun guilty pleasure show of mine. I always say “Only one episode” every time a new season comes out and then I end up binging it all in one night because of how fast paced and addicting it is

An easy turn your brain off, vibes only type show. 

Glad it got early renewed before season 3 even comes out so I can relax a bit. They probably want to have the next season actually come out in the summer time when the show is a summer show"
Outer Banks,"Strange I never even heard of this yet the reviews all say it's great. Gonna check it out tonight, I tried the National Treasure show on Disney, hopefully this is what I thought that was going to be"
Outer Banks,"I noticed with Ginny and Georgia that just before the newest season came out, the show was back in the top ten list on US Netflix. I dont see that with many shows and the same thing just happened with outer banks."
Outer Banks,"I’m glad to see they have faith in Outer Banks. Season 2 did the equivalent of 35 million complete viewings over the first month. Solid ratings but 30-35 million is usually the cut-off point for Netflix. The early season 4 renewal is obviously a sign of confidence in the show and indicates they do not expect the third season to drop significantly in viewership from the previous season. 

All good in my opinion as this is one of the more fun YA shows of recent years. Feels like a fun mix of The OC and The Goonies to me!"
Outer Banks,"I'm on season 1 rn, maybe around midway through. Really enjoying the show so far, but is there really enough meat on its bones to carry it to 4 seasons? I kinda just thought it was about this really interesting mystery stuff but should it really take 4+ seasons to reveal everything?"
Outer Banks,Hopefully with a time jump. Thes actors can't pass for highschoolers.
Outer Banks,Didn't you just kick all the fans off their parent's netflix accounts? Don't you want to wait and see how your viewership in Canada and NZ is affected?
Outer Banks,They only have a few more years before those men and women will be too old to portray sexy teenagers and will be force to portray sexy young adults.
Outer Banks,There was a fake festival in Huntington Beach today called poguelandia.  I think they were filming this show.
Outer Banks,How many treasures are hidden/buried in the Pogue/Kook area?
Outer Banks,Meh they kind of lost me halfway trough season 2
Outer Banks,Might give it a chance now
Outer Banks,Surprised Netflix let this get past the season one stage
Outer Banks,"How does this get renewed, a glorified teen soap opera, but not something like the OA. Like it’s good, but it’s low entertainment tv"
Outer Banks,Must be super cheap to make. And extremely good.
Outer Banks,The fact this gets renewed over other series is hilarious
Outer Banks,"Who da hell named this ""Outer Banks""?   

Outer Banks are in North Carolina.  Don't give it a bad name/rep with this crap on TV."
Outer Banks,I thought I read that s3 is the last?
Outer Banks,How many banks were out there jeez
Outer Banks,To bad I won’t be paying them to watch it …..Rrrrr
Outer Banks,"Well y'all have fun with that mess of a show.

I enjoyed the first season, it was a great escape during the pandemic. I liked to call it a live action Scooby Doo with no Dog and a little pot.  The second season was just an alternate reality."
Outer Banks,Shocking /s
Outer Banks,"Can someone help me find a song in the show? Season 3, episode 7. Rafe is discussing his plan with the gold. I can’t find the song anywhere! It’s not listed on the soundtrack"
Outer Banks,"Season 3:   
So where to start? Maybe from the fact that the male characters stay on a desert island for ONE MONTH and don't even have a hint of a beard? Or by the fact that at the end of the second season it was autumn as demonstrated by the jackets and clothing used by the characters, as well as by the foliage (the guys disappear almost in October as kindly specified by Sheriff Schoupe S2 ep10,min53.59) and so in the third season it should be almost winter, and instead extraordinarily in the Outer Banks in Carolina it seems magically to be summer again, no one is wearing a jacket or even a sweatshirt anymore, there are mosquitoes, a beach party and a heat so sultry as to force Sarah to steal beer for thirst. Ok that suddenly this season everyone seems to believe in miracles and be mystical in some way, but this is just too much.  
This season has been completely subdued: the music, the dialogues, the interpretations of the actors, the shots all crooked, the clips recycled from the previous seasons, scenes copied and redone but in a worse way, like the one of the plane on the same runway, Rafe who every time has the same issues with his father and nothing has changed despite everything they've been through (which is unlikely), Pope making up a little story with the guardian just like JJ did in previous seasons, Topper that appears to help Sarah and takes her to a party just like in the second season.. the fact that they were really out of ideas transpires, but inserting El Dorado to do something was really a ridiculous choice.  
Furthermore, the characters were not at all consistent with themselves: starting at the beginning, the first episode, Kiara who in the previous seasons always defending the animals and the environment (S1 ep2 min 17.07, S2 ep2 min 25.10) would never have killed a skate. Eating it yes of course, after a month you just have coconuts, but killing it herself? No.  
Just like JJ who defends Kiara in the first season without agreeing at all with Pope when he accuses her of being a Kook (S1 Ep8 min24,42-25), and here instead he is the first to accuse her?! It doesn't make sense, nor even the fact that he, impulsive par excellence, suddenly with the girl he's always liked, acts withdrawn and doubtful. It would have been much more believable if something had actually happened between them (also because during a whole month on a tropical island with the chemistry that existed between them, how is it possible that not even a kiss ever escaped?!) , but then JJ repented out of respect for Pope and then ok that it would have made sense if he pulled back also having doubts about what he could offer Kiara. As for Sarah, how is it possible that not even for a second she names of her little sister, worrying about her, abandoned alone and in exile at the mercy of her crazy family? And Topper? Helping the pogues? But when ever?! Moreover with his father's car , really absurd. And Rafe, who used to always get angry by chasing and beating the Pogues far and wide, here they even steal his boat by betraying him and leaving him in trouble and he doesn't take revenge? Bah. And Barry who used to be a drug dealer, now suddenly isn't anymore, nor does Rafe use drugs anymore. Ward suddenly is a Christian, Pope's parents who in season 1 (ep10, min49.17) hug JJ, here knowing his house is under eviction they host Cleo who is a complete stranger and offer no help to ever best friend of their son Pope? Even Kiara's mother would never have slammed the door in Princess Kook's face, cause she was trying to curry favor with the rich for 12 years(S1 ep5 min 15:44). After all, Rose is still alive and it makes no sense to miss this opportunity or behave like this, since the parents had hosted and fed the Pogues even with food from their restaurant (S1 Ep3 min 27:15) and now they don't even host Sarah or offer her a glass of water?! They are responsible adults after all, it just doesn't make sense nor is it consistent with the characters. JJ was a very emotional person: he cried or had fits of anger, here instead he practically never has a breakdown and if it happens he is not as credible or well interpreted as in previous seasons. Ki and him were always having fun and laughing, a moment like this never happens here.  
But why no character is himself anymore???"
Outer Banks,"Everything that was the heart of this series, the friendship between the Pogues, the police as a very present ""character"", the chases, Rafe, Barry and drugs, the celebrations and the drinks, the laughter, the Outer Banks, the canals, the boats, the Surf…everything has been completely abandoned. One of the key features of this series was precisely the hardships and injustices of being Pogues. Poverty, social inequality, the desire for redemption, oppressive or bad parents, the police always on their heels, the cruel Kooks always with victory on their side, the fatigue and oppression that all of them always suffered was one of the things which always made you sympathize and root for them. Here, however, they always got away with it, for this and for all these other reasons it really doesn't seem like the same series anymore.  
The friendship that characterized their group is no longer there: they have practically no scenes all together, they are always divided into couples but not at all spontaneously as could happen in previous seasons. Pope and JJ have almost no lines together, and Cleo never even speaks to Kiara. Also when they kidnap Kiara twice (a little too much, no?), no one gets desperate or does anything except JJ, which would never have happened, because they've always been a close-knit and united group. Just as it is not possible that no one offers to host JJ or Sarah, since they are without family and without a home.  
The soundtracks of the previous two seasons were beautiful, and the usual song at the end of each episode was a trademark and immediately made you want to see the next episode. Here, on the other hand, they haven't even granted us this anymore.  
Also how come that before John B. have to be turned over to social workers while here both JJ, Sarah, and John B. (since no one knows Big John is back yet) are left alone in peace?  
Let's fly over the incredible boredom of all the scenes with Big John (perpetually sweaty and dirty) who is the latest arrival that no one is fond of and who has instead monopolized this entire season. As well as on the bleached hair of all the characters and which doesn't flatter anyone, John B.'s haircut that magically changes (S3,ep3, min42.15): he goes to sleep with one length and wakes up with shorter hair (let's keep on with miracles) and why Sarah can never tie up that hair?! They're annoying if you're always running away, considering that Ki always changes her hairstyle, what would it cost to give Sarah a braid or a ponytail once in a while too?!  
I'll jump straight to the end: in Season 1, (ep 3, min 5:07) Kiara says that if they ever really get the treasure and money, she would record an album (which is amazing, it makes perfect sense since she's always there with her ukulele) and instead what do they say at the end? That she's saving turtles. But oh, in the first episode of this third season she killed a fish without hesitation. It is full of errors and contradictions.  
As far as El Dorado is concerned, no offense to anyone, but we found it really ridiculous: in 500 years people after people have attempted the feat and no one has ever succeeded and then poor and underage kids arrive (although by now it's really hard to see especially John B. as a teenager given his almost forty-year-old appearance) and they succeed?! Come on it makes no sense. The beauty was the fact that it was believable that there was a hidden treasure there, in the Obx, and that it was all set there! The public has grown fond of those places, what's the point of setting almost the entire season anywhere except in the Outer Banks? And then why resurrect Big John, who had always been a positive character in his son's memory anyway, apart from the arguments, to make him an even worse father than Ward? Big John uses his son, thinks only of money, excludes his son's friends and kills people, monopolizes the scene and it is a horrible person and all the scenes with him (far too many) are boring as hell. Why have him come back to make a character so awful and then he re-dies at the end anyway?! The green filter that made everyone look like frogmen was nauseating. Why is Wheezie only seen in 1 scene, plus wearing red lipstick while she is supposedly watching over her dying father??  
And the villain? In theory, a very powerful mafia-boss, who in reality doesn't scare anyone and even goes everywhere in person, always bringing 2 men with him when he could have a squadron? Why do the pogues wait for John B. who goes to the bell tower until sunset without hiding and why do Carlos Singh's men not arrive until the last moment? And the whole story of Carla Limbrey who was a respectable antagonist in the previous season is absurd here.  
And the whole story of Carla Limbrey who was a respectable antagonist in the previous season is absurd here. Furthermore, the story of JJ AND Kiara, which went on from the first episode of the first season, could finally give us some joy and instead it was developed very badly. That kiss with those chilling cringe screams was truly atrocious. With all the beautiful places where the two of them could share their first kiss: the beach, in the waves, on the pier, in the woods…anywhere except in that terrible dormitory full of smelly breath and embarassing girls staring at them.  
To conclude, the series we were so fond of seems dead and it was a bitter disappointment.  
It had so much potential, it was so simple, the whole story was already there, it was enough to conclude the threads of the plot that had already begun, without adding a thousand other nonsense things.  
We are dejected and discouraged, we fear that from now on the essence of the series that we liked so much will never return, but that instead it will continue on the completely changed and ridiculously different turn that it has unfortunately taken by now. Of course we hope not and hope that Obx 4 will actually be what it was, and that it makes sense that it is still called “Outer Banks”."
Outer Banks,Did anyone else feel like season 3 was kinda crappier than the other two in way? Like at one point I remember getting so frustrated because EVERYTIME they set out to go and do something specific it was always this drawn out interruption and idk it just felt really annoying to me lol. And I also couldn’t stay Big John. I honestly liked Rafe in this season but there wasn’t much of him I felt like
Outer Banks,Season 3 looks bonkers(in a good way) from the trailer. It looks like a long action movie. I was actually a bit worried that it was a final season just based on how it felt like one.
Outer Banks,plus we have also seen where these execs dont give a shit about pulling the plug even after its shot anyway (like what happened to the Workaholics movie)
Outer Banks,"I think of it like the OC meets National Treasure. If that appeals to you, get into it! It’s a stupid good show!"
Outer Banks,"so basically the show is not good


but it is **amazing** if you want something mindless on. It's the best thing in at least a decade for mindless fun bullshit"
Outer Banks,It's a one episode commitment show. The first episode should be enough to tell if you'll like it or not.
Outer Banks,The first season of OBX I didn't think she was anything special but she is an absolute smoke show in Glass Onion.
Outer Banks,I totally thought it was Florence Pugh in the onion mystery movie in the beginning
Outer Banks,">I always say “Only one episode” every time a new season comes out and then I end up binging it all in one night because of how fast paced and addicting it is.

Me."
Outer Banks,can you tell me what its about or give me the one line pitch?  or is it better going in blind?  will be checking it out either way
Outer Banks,"If that is what you are looking for, you are going to enjoy the hell out of it"
Outer Banks,"It’s like a modern Dawson’s creek complete with the love triangles, but it’s fun."
Outer Banks,"What is up with that show?  It looked like teengirl stuff based on the old ads, but the new ads make G&G look like a crime drama."
Outer Banks,"This is the other thing that a lot of people keep forgetting about. There's very little YA TV shows that actually work and are good. The Babysitters Club (as a dude in his late 30s, this show was the shit because of how well shot, written and acted it was) and Doogie Kamealoha are two other examples. Most of the others are pretty bad, but this is one of the few that works."
Outer Banks,"Cheap to make, no CGI, low salary.

The entire cast probably makes less than Henry Cavill in Witcher per season."
Outer Banks,A lot of things start unraveling as the show goes. It gets a bit silly but it's very entertaining.
Outer Banks,I doubt they're in highschool anymore. Weren't they like seniors when it began?
Outer Banks,"They couldn't even pass for high schoolers in season 1, when I'm p sure a few of the actors were just out of high school at the time. The main djde has to be at least 24-26. I'm on s1 and I'd sooner believe he's 32 than 17"
Outer Banks,"It wasn’t a fake festival, it was a real 1-day festival with Khalid, alt-J and others performing. With appearances by the Outer Banks cast."
Outer Banks,"It was definitely a real festival, I drove by it and the line was literally over a half mile long."
Outer Banks,Not filming for the show but just a promo event
Outer Banks,Outer banks is way better than you give it credit for.
Outer Banks,"It’s constantly in the top ten Netflix spot for like 3-6 months after it comes out. 🤷‍♀️ just because it isn’t for YOU, doesn’t mean other people don’t watch it"
Outer Banks,Other series like?
Outer Banks,"Just plan bull shit your peddling. Season 2 was good. Highly entertaining, good show."
Outer Banks,"I think after the second, the show really started to find it's niche. There's really nothing like it on streaming."
Outer Banks,"I saw the first season but not the second, but the big thing I remember was them somehow not getting shot despite being dead to rights multiple times and I saw it again in the season 3 trailer lol."
Outer Banks,Workaholics movie hadn't started filming
Outer Banks,"I do actually get The OC vibes from this show, totally agree"
Outer Banks,It's basically the goonies for adults
Outer Banks,"Damn, you just sold me on it lol"
Outer Banks,"The show is good, unrealistic but definitely good."
Outer Banks,"I never understand the people who say shows aren’t good but they say they love it, 

The outerbanks is so good, it’s dumb fun but it’s amazing, shows don’t have to be written as masterpieces to be great tv, 

Just entertain me"
Outer Banks,"I've been saying since the first season ended that it's perfect for background noise and mindless entertainment. If it wasn't for COVID, this show would have been done after one season."
Outer Banks,"Exactly. It’s amazing in the same way the Fast and Furious movies were amazing from about 5 to 7. Just bonkers, out-of-control and fun storylines."
Outer Banks,Better mindless fun bullshit than Burn Notice?
Outer Banks,I always describe it as The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders(by SE Hinton) with a little bit of the OC.
Outer Banks,Zoomers try to track down treasure ala The Goonies with some rich-kid-poor-kid drama with a dash of what I think The OC was from the commercials
Outer Banks,Plus potentially crimes and missing people and sunken treasure IIRC before my interest fizzled. Cinematography was pretty but I got a bit bored with some serious stretching of reality/pushing past what’s in any way believable combined with unnecessary “pretty rich girl meets boy from wrong side of the tracks” narrative.
Outer Banks,Second season goes to dark places. Imo better than first one.
Outer Banks,Just drama.
Outer Banks,The Babysitters Club cancellation still pisses me off. That show managed to successfully toe the line between sweet and saccharine. No idea why it couldn't have been granted at least a third season for a proper send-off. It couldn't have possibly have been a budget issue.
Outer Banks,I think so. Pretty sure Pope was applying to colleges during the last season
Outer Banks,The lead is actually 30 years old.
Outer Banks,No no they must know Netflix is secretly switching to just the OBX channel and can't possibly renew more than one show with its miniscule budget...
Outer Banks,"I think when I popped on Netflix the other night, it was back in the top 10 because of the new season."
Outer Banks,"Being popular doesn’t make something good.  Mediocre acting, bogus plot with made up geography, but you do you boo"
Outer Banks,pre production
Outer Banks,"I mean good in the way that a show like Ted Lasso or Brooklyn Nine Nine are good. Good good, not background noise good"
Outer Banks,"Idk, the majority of people hate CW's The 100 for example. But I loved it! Even with all its flaws.


I knew some stuff was ridiculous, but I enjoyed the premise, how each season upped the stakes. So I guess I was very aware of the reception and its cons, but still liked it cuz it was fun. (The last few episodes were shit tho lol)"
Outer Banks,"people tend to say the same thing about every teen show, instead of admitting that they dont like the genre"
Outer Banks,I mean it's kind of the definition of guilty pleasure shows.
Outer Banks,"It's because there's different kinds of good.


Trust me, I get what you are saying - I love a good hatewatch."
Outer Banks,"yup, like Ted Lasso it came out at the PERFECT time"
Outer Banks,Burn Notice ended in 2013
Outer Banks,"Actually a great description, even the OC comparison is perfect. 

I like OBX but a lot of shows in general seem to put west-coast ""vibes"" into east-coast settings. Minor complaint, just something I constantly notice lol"
Outer Banks,"From what I’ve read, it wasn’t viewed enough for Netflix to renew it. I’m still hoping that they release it and Disney picks it up because of the relationship that Disney and Walden media have."
Outer Banks,True but iirc the time jump between S1 and S2 was only like a few weeks or something. And each season was itself only a few weeks of in-show time.
Outer Banks,the mediocre acting is part of the fun
Outer Banks,Ratings means it’s worth the money spent you can’t over budget shows that are critical darlings that nobody watches and just keep them going that’s shorty business
Outer Banks,[deleted]
Outer Banks,Yeah…pre-the entire production.
Outer Banks,This is like the opposite of a background noise show.
Outer Banks,I liked the 100 a lot. The first season was kinda generic YA stuff but it got better. The last season was a complete let down tho. They fumbled so hard. And they did my boy Bellamy so incredibly dirty.
Outer Banks,"Loved the first 4 seasons of that lol, got too sci fi and weird in the end tho"
Outer Banks,[deleted]
Outer Banks,The 100 is one of my favorite cw shows ever and I rewatch it all the time. While it had it's cringey moments I feel like it was genuinely a phenomenal teen show and is the best apocalyptic/disaster show with a teen viewer base that has been done. people need to get past the first five episodes and it becomes phenomenal imo
Outer Banks,"Idk I’m not even hate watching it I love it, I don’t try to make excuses for it"
Outer Banks,"It's not even a hatewatch. It's good in an action adventure kind of way, like The Goonies or a more lowbrow Indiana Jones."
Outer Banks,Lol I’m from the place it is supposedly set in..and yes it is bothersome since none of it is accurate.  Perhaps if it was set on the west coast it would be believable but the acting would still be meh..It’s very Californian.
Outer Banks,Yeah wtf this show has some of the most suspenseful scenes I’ve watched recently. Just finished season 3 and I couldn’t look away from the tv I was stresssssed

Married at First Sight,We are on Season 13 already
Married at First Sight,"I'm a big mafs fan but I find the Australian one much more interesting than the American one, which literally sent me to sleep"
Married at First Sight,I’m watching it now and I’m SO disappointed in Paige and the show for letting Chris treat her that way. I’m also really disappointed they put Erik with Virginia knowing she was the party girl and had no intention on changing.
Married at First Sight,I had a channel that started showing this on saturdays from lunch through midnight late last year.. and they cycled through the first nine or ten seasons.  So I watched quite a few seasons that way (thanks to my dvr or leaving it on as background noise as I did other things in the house).  As the seasons went on the show got worse at putting couples together.  Too many contestants just outright lie and aren't interested into changing their lifestyle at all... and I'm not sure if the producers just opt not to dig too deep or worse dig into this and decide it'll make for more interesting tv.   Best thing is not investing in any couples as the whole process is so overproduced and fake that few real connections are made let alone survive.
Married at First Sight,I realize. But that's not available on Hulu.
Married at First Sight,Also isnt season 14 also concluded?
Married at First Sight,"It's pretty fucked up of the show to let that continue. 

There's no reason to be disappointed in Paige. She was victim of an expert narcissist. It's not her fault. Lots of people get fooled."
Married at First Sight,"> As the seasons went on the show got worse at putting couples together.

My fiancee had me watch some of the seasons too. I just couldn't do it anymore because they were constantly focusing on the drama in these relationships and not actually counseling these people when they needed it. It's clear ""the experts"" are trash and only putting people together so they can clash."
Married at First Sight,That’s true. She deserved so much better.
Married at First Sight,"Yeah, which makes it as serious a show as the Bachelor/Bachelorette which is mainly just people that want to party, travel, and be on tv. I kind of enjoyed the married at first sight more as a what not to do in a relationship as so few worked out."
Married at First Sight,"They didn't even vet the people to make sure that no one was a criminal or had a history of DV.

I can handle them in pairing a couple up with what they think they want rather than what they say they want, but some of the partners were put in abusive situations because of the show and that's not ok."
Married at First Sight,It’s “reality” tv of course it’s scripted and rigged.
Married at First Sight,"I think you’re 100% right that they actively put people together to cause drama. The purpose of shows like this (including the Bachelor and similar series) is drama. They don’t really care if the cast members find true love and they in fact probably prefer it if they don’t since that could get in the way of the drama. These mismatches aren’t careless mistakes or bad vetting, they are carefully managed and planned."
Married at First Sight,"all scripted and rigged, that's reality tv for ya. Got a camera? got a script"
Married at First Sight,"I watch, and it's obvious that they pair some couples for the drama.

Yes, it definitely is very scripted, but what I am loving about the last few seasons is that they break the 4th wall all the time now. Again though, this is scripted.

This season has been hilarious with the horse girl who hates her new husband, yelling at the producers that they are trying to make her look bad and come across as a bitch. Then they cut to a scene where she is being a huge bitch. It's great ""reality"" TV.

Unfortunately, you also have to factor in the people that would even consider going on this show. Some are truly nice people who don't realize it's a show, and some are just looking for screen time. Then you have a few seriously woke people who get it, and just go for the ride.

My favorite guy from 1 or 2 seasons ago was Henry. In the beginning the show made him look like an idiot on the spectrum, but by the end he was a really funny straight man to the absolute bat shit crazy antics of his ex-wife."
Married at First Sight,If everyone was a perfect match and lived happily ever after it would be boring to watch. That’s why they purposely match some absolute train wreck couples together
Married at First Sight,[deleted]
Married at First Sight,"I like trash TV and MAFS is one of the fakest and trashiest I have seen. I am talking about the Australian one, not sure how that differs but the people are absolutely vile."
Married at First Sight,"I feel like rigged, but not necessarily scripted."
Married at First Sight,I don't think it's scripted as such. Just rigged.
Married at First Sight,Gasp!
Married at First Sight,"Reality TV generally isn't traditionally scripted. More, everybody is told their role and to turn their personalities to 11. And then, they edit the episode to tell the narrative they wish."
Married at First Sight,The editing is pretty obvious too
Married at First Sight,"There's a matchmaking special at 8pm, then episode 1 starts at 9pm and goes for two and a half hours!

Thank you. "
Married at First Sight,">After several weeks together, each couple must make a decision: do they remain together or decide to divorce?

Yeah, it's definitely the gay people getting married that ruins the sanctity of marriage.

Seriously, though.  They couldn't just live together for a couple of weeks?  They have to get married?  And there have been four seasons of this already?  Fuck this show.  Everything about it.  It's disgusting."
Married at First Sight,"People make their own decisions about their lives. Why does what other people choose to do bother you so much? It's **their** lives, not yours. 

The people on this show are taking a risk to find love in a controlled experiment. Arranged marriages may be foreign in Western civilization, but it happens every day in this world. People do find love through this show. "
Married at First Sight,It's funny when they don't like each other at all. I only saw two episodes of the first season though.
Married at First Sight,"I'm not a fan of arranged marriages regardless, because come on, that's gross.  But at least arranged marriages are at least intended to be permanent.

The premise of this show is that marriage is important, otherwise we could just have them live together without getting married, and have the same result.  But this show tells me that marriage isn't important, because if you don't like it you can just bail out after a couple of weeks.  The very premise of the show contradicts itself.  All so that people who so desperately want to be famous they're willing to marry a stranger can be on TV for 42 minutes."
Married at First Sight,"> I'm not a fan of arranged marriages regardless, because come on, that's gross

To you. 

> The premise of this show is that marriage is important, otherwise we could just have them live together without getting married, and have the same result. But this show tells me that marriage isn't important, because if you don't like it you can just bail out after a couple of weeks.

Just like real life.

"
Married at First Sight,"Well, they have to stay legally married at least 6 months.
At least in Season 1."
Married at First Sight,"> Just like real life.

Except, like I said, the show is implying that marriage matters.  They can't have it both ways.  Either marriage matters and getting divorced at the end is disgusting, or marriage doesn't matter and making them get married instead of just date for a couple of weeks is a meaningless addition."
Married at First Sight,"That really doesn't make sense. Marriage is important, but people are free to do what they want. They can't force people to stay married. Even though the premise of the show is that they stay married for six weeks, if someone wants to get divorced before that, they can, because they have the right to. 

Having them get married is a deeper commitment since divorces are not easy things to get done. The people are committing themselves to marry a stranger, to commit to trying to make a marriage with them work. "
Married at First Sight,Do they get to choose if the person they marry or is it all set up for them? 
Married at First Sight,Does anyone know what the danish show is called?
Married at First Sight,"Channel 4 have a small amount of very good TV programmes. It's such a shame they also decide to broadcast so much reality TV like this, calling it a 'social experiment'."
Married at First Sight,"Sounds like it's all set up
 > *the series will match three couples on the basis of scientific and sociological criteria before bringing them together to get married in front of friends and family without ever having met before.*"
Married at First Sight,"[Seems like it's called the same thing](http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8761536)
"
Married at First Sight,"If this was an actual social experiment, I would watch the hell out of this. I'm sure it's just the edited-to-death soap opera we have all come to love though. "
Married at First Sight,I shamelessly enjoy the American version. The entire premise is just so fucking ridiculous I've found it impossible to turn away from it at any point.
Married at First Sight,"Do they legally marry in the US version?

Watching the US version, I didn't feel like it made a mockery of marriage. It was very much talked about like a situation where people could put aside their shallow ideas and wants and see if a lasting relationship could be formed based on deeper characteristics. That said, being on a reality show automatically makes it skeevy. "
Married at First Sight,"But was it explained the couples would not actually marry, all the promotional clips make you think this here."
Married at First Sight,I *think* so. If they want to back out they get the marriage annulled but I believe they do get legally married.
Married at First Sight,Survivor. Nothing else matters.

Married at First Sight,"> Cops

There's a podcast about cops that's pretty interesting. It's called Headlong and it goes into a lot of the crime statistics and background for interactions on cops.

The show has ruined a lot of innocent people's lives by doing things like arresting people based on field drugs tests, then airing that on television, only for the proper lab testing of the ""drugs"" prove they were innocent of any crime. But cops doesn't go back to those stories and put out retractions or stop airing them. 

It's pretty fucked up"

Married at First Sight,"What all these folks need is couples' therapy, but since they've chosen reality TV instead, I guess we're along for the ride!"
Married at First Sight,"The only reason this show works and isn't an immediate turn-off for me, is they did something pretty smart and cast only couples that I already think should break up. 

Can't be devastated if they split for somebody else, because I already want them to."
Married at First Sight,"I hoped there would be 30+ years people, but most of them are just college graduates, too young for marriage, especially guys. They don't know yet what to do with their life"
Married at First Sight,"I’ve seen people mention the way Colby treated Alexis….unless I misunderstood, I don’t see it. She tried saying he said she was unattractive, but unless I misheard, he said he wasn’t attracted to her. Two different things. She refused to take no for an answer. I found her almost unbearable. Speaking of actually unbearable, Madalyn. Ugh. Seemed like a completely unlikeable person. And, am I nuts, or was she always stoned or drunk?"
Married at First Sight,I wish they wore name tags of who they are and the original partner because I can barely keep up 😂
Married at First Sight,"This maybe an unpopular opinion but I really dislike April, she is childish and manipulative. She starts crying when she is put on the spot about her selfish ways. She never addressed the issues Jake had with her, going through his phone, calling him a cheat when she put in him in that position, acting like she might be pregnant. Speaking of her wanting to get pregnant, she seems like the type to try to trap a guy with a baby. Everything she does is about her, she is always talking about herself and what she needs, the only time she addressed any issues about Jake is when she was scared he might leave her, she doesn't act like someone in love, she acts like someone obsessed. It's a very toxic relationship, maybe Jake and Rae aren't for each other but Jake definitely needs to brake with April."
Married at First Sight,The point of most of these shows is always “what will create the maximum amount of drama to make you yell at your tv”. I think this will fit the bill.
Married at First Sight,I'm on episode 5 and I'm so curious if this show will have a second season as I honestly just don't think this will work. We all know that in honeymoon stage we try our best to show the best of us. Once the stage passes every couple will have their own issues. To me this show just further complicates their issues by bringing in a third person lol Feeling like eventually both relationships - old and new - won't work.
Married at First Sight,This show is nuts I love it this is the perfect trashy tv. I’ve certainly laughed a lot
Married at First Sight,"It’s funny how the ones who brought their partners for the ultimatum get frustrated that the partner is going to date others (but I guess not really cause all they want is for them to say yes to marrying them). Just about everyone was doomed from the start. Lauren doesn’t want kids her bf does. They need this show to show them that children/no children is the one thing you can’t compromise on in a relationship. Rae couldn’t say why she loved her man despite being the one who brought him here???? He seems like a pawn in her world, a box ticked off of her life checklist. Is there any couple that seems like they have a chance?"
Married at First Sight,Madlyn is so toxic that it's hard to watch when she's on screen. Otherwise I think this show blows the other dating shows out of the water.
Married at First Sight,"Its like Love is Blind but everyone's already in a relationship, just to complicate things"
Married at First Sight,I’m on episode three and DAMN. Lol
Married at First Sight,I'm on episode 1 and kind of hate it but of course I have to see what happens LOL. Most of these people are WAY TOO YOUNG to be wanting to get married anyway. And many of the couples are very obviously wrong for each other. So ridiculous.
Married at First Sight,"I just finished binge watching this series - so many thoughts !! I feel so bad for some people - some couples are clearly not made for each other coming into this . Some of the individuals  (and their friends) were just TOXIC, some had their insecurities pushed to the limit .And then there was also hope - I liked the way 2 of the couples communicated (not naming anyone) it was genuine and done so well. Definitely gives real life couples sitting on that fence something to think about.

 On a separate note - I felt so bad for Colby . He was brutally honest with everyone, him texting someone is not even close to the other one getting physical and downing him with her friends. I don't know what he was expecting out of this but he was dealt the worst cards of them all. 

PS: The stainless steel wine cups - please switch them out . drinking champagne out of it is a crime"
Married at First Sight,I literally cannot stand April I just can’t.
Married at First Sight,I'm honestly surprised to see positive comments about Colby. Am I the only person who really dislikes him and thinks he's a horrible boyfriend?
Married at First Sight,Lmao at Rae’s mom having to talk to both Rae and Zay like they’re children to get them have an even halfway productive argument.
Married at First Sight,Am I the only one who thinks that Jake only likes April because his mother does? He's definitely just not that into her.
Married at First Sight,"Rae just wanted to be single and date around. I feel for Zay because I think it’s fair for his abandonment issues to be triggered. If Rae hadn’t found Jake, or any man for that matter simply interested in her, I’m sure she would have been happy in her relationship."
Married at First Sight,"This is a horrible thing for couples to do… not smart at all but it helps that they are all horrible together anyways. These people seem immature and not ready to marry. And I don’t mean their age… I’m 25 and I’m sure as hell ready to find my person, get married and have a family. But no way in hell would I be in a relationship where the other person doesn’t want the same thing. You can’t trick them into wanting to marry you…."
Married at First Sight,"""I stay in the gym, I cook, I clean, and I know how to fuck.""  -Rae

One of the greatest quotes in reality TV history."
Married at First Sight,I’ve been dying for drama and this is pretty close!! And it doesn’t feel scripted. So many of these viral shows have people say the same type of words but not this show. It feels a lot more real and raw and emotional
Married at First Sight,I really want to know what Shanique wanted/meant when she said Colby should rephrase what he said about Madlyn (“her words can cut deep….”)
Married at First Sight,"I binged this show at 2x speed.  The show’s premise is mind bogglingbecause of the participants’ young age and short length of courtship. I understand the partner’s frustration. Been there, done that.  In college, I met my first boyfriend and I constantly bothered him about us getting married one day.   Looking back 11 years ago, I was not ready for marriage. And I can honestly assess that many of these couples are not prepared for marriage. 

a few reasons: 
1) age.  these people, except for Alexis and Hunter at 28, are very young. April at 23 yo wants to get married with kids? That’s great, but kids cost money. Monthly expenses cost $.  Kids’ clothes, braces, shelter, food.
Without a good salary, life will be hard. The number one reason for divorce is money. Second reason is in-laws.  Rae wants to get married because she finished her college degree and has a career planned. And I can't remember what are the other names 

2) short length of courtship. why are these people giving ultimatums after dating for 1.5 or 2 years? It’s not like they have been dating for 10 years.  I know couples who began dating in high school year at 19 and are now 29. NOW I would ask “why not marry?”

3) Lack of financial stability due to youthful age.  Alexis saying $ is essential is not a joke. It’s maybe harsh and off-putting per Colby’s reaction and other similarly minded people

4) Colby is a huge jerk. The way he kissed or slept with different women without telling his gf.  The way he treated Alexis.  The way he kissed April when he doesn't have feelings for her.  

Overall, the lesson for me is don't push my partner into another ‘s embrace. Even if I think I'm ready, shit will hit the fan unless I'm  a rare robotic human breed without feelings"
Married at First Sight,Most of the people in the show that gave the ultimatum are either wanting to trap the other person by guilt tripping them into a relationship and are not willing to see that they not right for each other. Also most of the girls don't understand what marriage is... The guys are giving real reasons to not get married such as financial instability or not agreeing on what they'd want for a future together. Marriage is not an Instagram photo marriage is hard fucking work
Married at First Sight,"I can't wrap my head around this premise knowing myself and well the large majority of humans I wouldn't be ok with me and my partner sleeping around on TV and can't for the life of me see how it's supposed to bring the couples together. 

It's gonna be a s**t show but I will deff watch it bcs I love me some reality TV drama."
Married at First Sight,I’ve been watching for 20 minutes and this Madelyn just seems selfish. And she just wants to fuck Randall. She’s had her eyes on him from the moment she walked in. Smh
Married at First Sight,This show is insane... and messy as hell.. but I watched lol
Married at First Sight,Does anyone else feel like this show is staged?? I went on their instagrams and only one couple has an old picture together. The rest don’t have any at all.
Married at First Sight,This show should be called train wreck lol love it give me more
Married at First Sight,"This show isn’t about marriage, it really just seems like “lets separate these couples, let them have a hall pass for 3 weeks, then we’ll see if they can repair their relationship after”"
Married at First Sight,If the show is watching this thread - can we get some older couples that are on the fence for the season 3 . It would be very interesting to see what and how couples value after their first marriage is done .
Married at First Sight,"Right!! I'm watching the first episode in awe, just trying to understand it but NO. I don't."
Married at First Sight,How does this show not have its own subreddit????
Married at First Sight,"i can't believe this show looks like it's just filled with a bunch of fake spoiled rich people. i wish they had more real couples, people from different walks and classes of life. it's just so fucking elitist."
Married at First Sight,"I’m conflicted about Colby and Madlyn. One the one hand she really acted like she didn’t care about him in the beginning, but she clearly feels for him based on how she reacted to what he did at the nightclub. I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to them.

I’m also really rooting for April and Jake. I don’t really like how Rae seemed to give an ultimatum to Zay but couldn’t even explain to him how she feels about him. As much as everyone in the show seems to want Rae and Jake to get together, I’m not a fan."
Married at First Sight,"Only on episode 3 but here are my thoughts. The first episode of this show was great until you realized they all date each other while their ex’s are a mere 6 feet away.

If a season 2 comes out they should change it so that the couples arrive, have the speed dating with all couples for day 1 and then they spend the next 3 weeks guys in one house and girls in another. In these houses they bring in 10 additional single people into both houses. 5 of those people are looking for marriage and the other 5 are not. And then the couples seek out other relationships 

The whole “exploring other options” while your “ex” is there just doesn’t seem mentally healthy. Netflix had this show in the bag and then ruined it by not being a classier temptation island."
Married at First Sight,They showed like nothing about Colby and April
Married at First Sight,I think April is my crush 👀
Married at First Sight,"As a big fan of the genre, I’ll put this ahead of Love is Blind but short of Are You the One? In any case it’s been a fun watch!"
Married at First Sight,"There’s only one participant that I genuinely feel sympathy and compassion for, and that’s Randall. Everyone else seems genuinely toxic and unlikeable so it’s hard to care about them."
Married at First Sight,Why are the cups all metal?! Literally every bar and restaurant they visit uses metal cups! Do you not have glasses in America?
Married at First Sight,"Love is Blind was already a stretch, but I can't sit there and watch the hosts be holier-than-thou while pimping this cruel bizarre premise. Hard pass"
Married at First Sight,"Why has no one pointed out they all have GIANT pupils, like absurdly dilated? I don't understand."
Married at First Sight,Lololol that’s all I could think of. My favorite thing to do is watch therapists assess the interactions so it’s like I get to see them “go thru” therapy without them actually doing it lol
Married at First Sight,Amen. I feel bad for some individuals but they deserve better
Married at First Sight,"I for some reason naively thought that it was going to mostly be couples who would end up together at the end. Then they started introducing them and I was like ""yikes, they shouldn't be together, they shouldn't be together, they shouldn't be tog-oh of fucking course, it's reality TV, obviously there's gonna be a ton of breakup drama"""

Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,That photo makes it look like he is performing a play on stage.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Is it because they got out of R Kelly's house finally?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Sweet Jesus. At this point I gonna ask who didn't he raped?

A part 2.... Jesus Christ..."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"There was a part two? Damn, first I'm hearing of this.

I hope he and all other rapey cunts get the book thrown at them with nice, long jail sentences. That means you too, Harvey."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,R Kelly is a bum
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,It's not good when a show about 1 persons abuse of others gets a second part
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,We need to send a message to these rapist by harassing them whereever they go. Continually posting on Twitter daily
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Was anyone else extremely Disgusted wotj Life Time having those two r Kelly white in bred pigs on i want their asses arrested i gurantee they had something to do with that evil vile Facebook surving lies Page
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I know people will watch this, and I watched the first series, but doesn’t it seem like they’ve gotten the message across now? He’s already in a ton of legal trouble and he won’t be able to escape it. I don’t know, this wasn’t a show where I was like “I want to watch more accusers tell stories!” The whole thing is really tragic."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,He looks like he can believe if he can fly
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,R Kelly must have been busy.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,all pedophiles need to get their genitalia cut off and force fed to them
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Modern lynching
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Don’t bother if you’re a man.  They can’t make an easy case with you as victim and even with video evidence and proof you’ll be laughed out of the door. Unless it’s clean cut case on video and even then barely.

Domestic violence hotlines are the same.  You’ll likely end up with charges depending on what is said so best if you have a penis don’t ever ever ever call these lines."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Why not call to police or remove the threat of the rapist with your second amendment right?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"He was definitely acting when he went on that poor little me rant. Props to her though, she wasn't having none of that and called him on it."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,To pee or not to pee
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,He must have raped him to.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"He rapes, but he saves."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Bums aren't dangerous, he's a sociopathic serial rapist"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,What are you trying to say?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Here's the thing, R Kelly has been an open secret for years and apathy is what allows him to continue on. I'm fine with them keeping his feet to the fire"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted aside from not capitalizing the first A. I think castration should be automatic for pedophiles.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Dude, based on your posting history I'd imagine the reason you have trouble with these hotlines is not what you think it is"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"You need help, but not that kind of help."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Hey man. PM me if you need someone to talk to. You shouldn’t be on this website it’s clearly not healthy for you if all your comments are so toxic and it’s not your fault you don’t need to keep doing it.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,">	even with video evidence and proof you’ll be laughed out of the door. Unless it’s clean cut case on video 

Pick a lane

Edit: that post history is a yikes"

Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Yes, the thing America needs most is even more needless shooting deaths."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Of course, SNL spoofed this interview as well."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Only thing that makes my life complete is when I turn your face into a toilet seat. I want to pee on you.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Says who
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Yes I know his story well.   Just don't call these hotlines if you're a man is all my point is.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,it isnt needless if it's in self defense? stopping a rape is needless?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Just watched on YouTube, pretty funny. Is this the camera? *turns to a house plant*"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"https://youtu.be/qAtvxFFsoeg

Surprisingly good skit from them. They've been sagging a bit lately."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"You think? I thought the past two episodes were some of my favorites in years. Can’t go wrong with the return of Eddie Murphy (so good, plus Lizzo!) and ScarJo is always one of the best hosts they have. She has complete commitment to a bit and it’s amazing."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,There’s more??
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"imagine being such a fucking piece of shit rapist that they need to make a Season 2 of a docuseries detailing your continuing history of shittiness

yikes"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I didn't expect much because of the Lifetime network but this was a really great docuseries. Looking forward to see what is next.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Hold on to your butts!
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,[deleted]
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,R. Kelly may be a giant dick bag... but you gotta admit that Ignition is a poppin' hit.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,If he gets out of this shit he better join Kanye and start singing for the lord. In my opinion he is the greatest R&B singer of all time but I don’t see anyone wanting to hear him sing about sex after all this shit.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I'm the furthest thing from an R. Kelly fan, but...

Have any of the allegations against him even been proven in court?  How the fuck can they get away with making this trash otherwise?"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I expect this to go into the early 20’s like his trapped in the closet videos.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,That feeling when you pee in the morning after a night of drinking.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,30 years of crimes and cover ups means lots of material to work with.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Seems like a fluke almost. Like it’s something they wanted to have buried by placing it on Lifetime but it broke through
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Some people are comparing Michael Vick to Cosby and Kelly ?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"After all the shit he's done...nah bro, this fool's music is forever tarnished"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"1. He’s on film banging a minor.
2. It’s no secret he married a minor.

Despite any other allegations, which there are numerous, those facts stand. 

Dude is sick, he’s getting his due."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I smell another REMIX !
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Some folks really love them some dogs.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Yeah, because it's fucking long."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Kinda have to. I could be misremembering, but Part I is around 16 hours long, Part II was more like 35/40 hours, even if a lot of those events are concurrent

Edit: apparently I remember it being longer than it actually is! Still, I think it benefits from being approached as multi season arc, as someone who likes the vast majority of it"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I feel like part 2 could be adapted as two shorter seasons of 7-8 episodes, with hopefully a quicker turnaround. It'd suck to have to wait two years between seasons 2 and 3 after the likely 2 year wait (optimistically 18 months) between seasons 1 and 2."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I’m curious where the split will be in-between seasons. Unless season 2 is going to be all >!Ellie hunting Abby and end with Abby confronting her at the theater, but I don’t know if they’re going to do the POV switch in the show because it could seriously dissuade show-only members if a season 3 starts and they only see Abby every week for over a month. Paralleling their days in the same episodes seems like a better fit for the medium.!<

Also I’m guessing they’re going to add a lot to the show because even thought Part 2 is twice the length of Part 1, it has a lot of extended combat scenes (moreso than Part 1) that will likely be taken out. I can see them fleshing out >!some of the side characters like Yara, Jesse, and Isaac were who fairly one-note in the game, and give more backstory to the Seraphites since they felt like set dressing for the most part.!<"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,If I don’t see the >!Rat King!< I will stop watching 🐀
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"That was obvious but what I'm curious about will be the timeline. Will they keep it like the game or make it more linear? Either way after season one, I trust them."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Third season will be the NG+ playthrough where the story is the same, but all the gun stats are maxed out from the beginning."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I really hope they keep the crane
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Hope they keep the rope puzzles, I loved those."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Part I really needed that extra runtime as well.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"This sounds like they’ll be able to give it room to breath and maybe it’ll give them a chance to structure the story  in a way that feels a bit tightly focused. I love the story they told with the game, just feel like the way they told it could have been re structured a bit to work a bit better."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Makes total sense. If the pacing is about the same as Season One, Season Two could comfortably take us to the natural ""inflection point"" that anyone who's played the game can appreciate.

Part II is a more complex story with a larger cast of major characters. Would definitely feel rushed if compressed into a single season."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I don’t like a lot of the choices from part II, I think a few changes here and there and it can be received much better. 

It will probably still be an absolute shitshow online like when the game released."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Really wish the first season was longer
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I hope they take their time with it. This season has felt a little too rushed, in my opinion."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"This season was good but as it went on it felt like they were rushing through the plot and the finale felt just a little hollow as a result, almost like I was watching a catch-up summary for the next season. Doesn't help that every show now has to be 10 episode seasons or less. Looking forward to starting the game and getting the full effect."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,[removed]
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,It was a significantly longer game so that makes sense.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I still think they could have made Part I into two seasons. Maybe not 10 episodes each season but something like 7-8.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"So I haven’t seen the show yet, but for those who have, is season 1 part 1 only?"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"All of yall thinking where to cut in the video game, but im guessing they could go the hobbit route and randomly introduce a love triangle between side characters. 

Oh lord"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Absolutely hated Part 2 for personal reasons, but if they decide to adapt so that >!Season 2 is Abby’s background and story, maybe leave out the part that intersects with Joel and Ellie first so that new fans don’t know who she is and they get to bond with her character and then either end Season 2 with their initial confrontation or start S3 that way and have the entire season focus on their conflict!< I would give it a shot.

Main reason why I didn’t like Part 2 was >!The way they wrote Joel’s ending!< and >!the game’s ending!< being absolutely disappointing for me. But I hope they make it work somehow."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,The drop off of viewers is going to be interesting after a certain event.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"everyone working ""spoilers not spoilers"" into their comments, suck, for those of us who didn't play the game, and are just trying to enjoy the story presented by the show"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Huge spoiler take

>!show dies when joel dies!<"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,This last episode felt rushed with 9 episode season for sure
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Why don't they just make a couple seasons that explore what happened between the games?
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,This show started off amazing. I got bored as the season went on. I’ll watch season 2 but I’m not excited about it.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I personally didn’t really think Part 2 was that good, but I can definitely see it being handled a lot better in a television series format, especially considering Part 2 will be stretched longer to make everything feel more developed and complex."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"a 3 season show feels about right, I'd like it to have a definitive end there and not just say ""hey, success, lets keep it going!"""
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I hope the actress that plays Ellie will be able to pull off the older character. I'm assuming so, but still makes me nervous"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I thought they flew through David’s storyline. I’m loving this so much that I don’t mind if they stretch it out, I know they won’t ruin it and I trust that they will stick to source material and not exhaust the series"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Should have done the same for part 1. One of the most poorly paced shows I've ever watched. I'm glad they stayed pretty true to the game but damn, they could have done so much more."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I think they are between a rock and a hard place with the next season. If they follow the games' story there will be a ton of people that hate it, if they dont it will be admitting that the direction they went with the game's story was essentially a mistake. Will be interesting to see how they navigate it."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,[removed]
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,I imagine you’d have to just for pacing purposes when translating it to live action formats. The fairly early game twist would be jarring if they just hit that off the beginning episode of season 2. Not to mention there is plenty of in between game happenings that could be made into great character development moments to make the events of the 2nd game more impactful in tv format
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,they could have adapted season one into multiple seasons. they rushed through the plot points I thought.
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,Money
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Probably should do their own spinoff, too, explore the whole world, get as wild as they wanna."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Could have done that with s1 too, felt rushed ino"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I think they will probably pseudo-alternate between TLOU and HOTD every year, like they did with GOT and Westworld years prior. 

They now have seasons 2 & 3 mapped out. HOTD S2 is coming out in 2024, so they might do TLOU S2 (first half of Part II) in 2025, and do HOTD S3 in the same year (2025) or 2026 and do TLOU S3 (second half of Part II) in 2026 (since it would be a two-parter story, I don’t see this coming out in 2027). 

Maybe a break after 2026, and they might have revealed or even released TLOU Part III by then. So possibly TLOU S4 in 2028."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"First game needed at least 3 or 4 more episodes. Or 2 seasons. With Joel almost dying as the finale/cliffhanger.

Glad they will be making game 2 at least 2 seasons."
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Pitch Meeting:  
 *So, you got a tv show for me?  Yes sir I do. You know how you like money sir.  Ohhh yeah, is that what the script is about?  Well it can be sir. I was thinking we take a single story and make it last 3  or 4 seasons.  Oh very cool, sounds like the fans will love waiting 4 years to watch it.  I think so sir*"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"I haven’t played 2 because it seems like a despair burger (I get notoriously dark with stuff like that)

Is it worth it though? Im seeing people saying it’s an experience not worth missing. May have to change my mind…"
Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,"Without spoiling the games, is season 1 the entirety of part 1? Like part 1 and season 1 ended at the same spot?"
