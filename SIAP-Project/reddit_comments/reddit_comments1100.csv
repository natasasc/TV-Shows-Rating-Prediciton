TV Show,Comment
High Seas,If I just look at Rhys Darby I laugh.
High Seas,"‚ÄúOur Flag Means Death‚Äù premieres Thursday, March 3, on HBO Max is all I need to know."
High Seas,‚ÄúWhat we do on the seas?‚Äù
High Seas,"There‚Äôs a memorial dedicated to Stede Bonnet at White Point Garden in Charleston at the site where he was executed. The plaque gives a pretty brief synopsis of his life, and anytime I have friends or family visit, I make a point of showing it to them. That little blurb is enough to make his life sound like satire, and I‚Äôve always joked that it would make a great tv show. I really hope it‚Äôs good!"
High Seas,Based off the Internet Historian video I have high hopes for this show.
High Seas,More Rhys Darby content !!! Yes!
High Seas,Taika is basically on that list of people that if they are a part of something I‚Äôm down for it.
High Seas,"Blackbeard, present. Anne Bonnie, present. Murray, present"
High Seas,"Taika Waititi, Rhys Darby.  That‚Äôs all you have to say.  I don‚Äôt need to know the plot.  I‚Äôm there."
High Seas,"Why so many negative comments? Waititi doesn‚Äôt really miss. This looks funny!

Edit: For those commenting now, this post originally had a handful of deleted comments that were all downvoted dozens of times. Everyone has the right to their own opinion; I was more of commenting on the comments that were so negative that they were downvoted and deleted."
High Seas,The Internet Historian did a great video about this entire story https://youtu.be/vrGf4nJWVOU
High Seas,"I hope I don't get Waititi fatigue. He has been great in everything so far.

I think Lin Manuel Miranda is amazing, but I need a break from his content for a bit.

Same with Ryan Reynolds. I'm so tired of that self-aware humor that he has."
High Seas,Will this be a weekly release or all at once?
High Seas,"My friend got a part in this, but the American Embasy wouldn‚Äôt grant him a visa because of Covid. He argued that everyone coming from England were granted visas, but it was still rejected. 

I‚Äôve never seen someone get so close to their dream, only for it to be taken away by some prick in an office."
High Seas,When does this guy sleep?
High Seas,"As far as I‚Äôm concerned, everything Taika touches turns to gold"
High Seas,"HBO max is kind of killing it tbh. Peacemaker, Righteous Gemstones, Raised by Wolves on top of their library which already had some of the best series of all time."
High Seas,"Looks funny. For serious pirate shit though, nothing beats Black Sails. Incredible really."
High Seas,"I worked on this show, it was fun to do a period piece like this."
High Seas,"While waiting for this to air, I urge fans to **find and watch ""Wellington Paranormal"".** 

It's more of his brand of humor, and a show that I never see mentioned here."
High Seas,"[So they managed to turn the Sundance reject ""The Gentleman Pirate"" into an actual series. Internet history to remember!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrGf4nJWVOU)"
High Seas,I was sitting on the beach in Malibu a couple months ago when this film crew rolled up in front of me and I got to watch Taika direct Rhys Darby coming out of the ocean from like 20 feet away.
High Seas,"The trailer did nothing for me, not a single giggle. Might check it out when it's available outside of the US, but not having too much hope. Usually love Taika's stuff, but this one seems kinda off to me"
High Seas,"Oh yeah! Cant wait to see Dharby and crew, especially Samba Schutte! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è"
High Seas,I hope it's at least half as good as the Internet Historian's video
High Seas,"If it as good as what we do in the shadows, i'm game."
High Seas,Why is everything I want to see on HBO? Why can‚Äôt other networks do awesome stuff?
High Seas,"I doubt many people ever listened to this but I think this might have been the precursor for this show. 

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mysterious-secrets-of-uncle-berties-botanarium/id1197664141"
High Seas,"Guys you should really check out the series by the internet historian about these events the video most likely influenced the show in some ways

https://youtu.be/vrGf4nJWVOU"
High Seas,Typos. Is IndieWire too poor to afford editors?
High Seas,Looks like good fun. I‚Äôll watch
High Seas,Here's the sub: r/OurFlagMeansDeath
High Seas,Damn the reviews are C/C+ mostly. That's a bummer to hear
High Seas,Oh my god he brought back Murray!! Yes!
High Seas,This looks truly awful
High Seas,The trailer did nothing for me when I saw it but I'll check out the first few eps for sure
High Seas,I was excited to see Rhys in a show but the trailers for this felt super weak.
High Seas,[deleted]
High Seas,This will be maximum cringe if the trailer is anything to go by. Bummer
High Seas,[deleted]
High Seas,[deleted]
High Seas,These guys can‚Äôt do anything wrong. I live everything they put out.
High Seas,I‚Äôll watch anything tied to Taika! And love it.
High Seas,So weird to see this crunched in between news of Ukrainian and Russia.
High Seas,Fair to say this is to pirates what WWDITS is to the supernatural?
High Seas,He‚Äôs my favorite character in Yes Man üòÇ
High Seas,"My name is [Muerte](https://youtu.be/PwBv2ZSJc5w), it means death

Nice to meet you Morty"
High Seas,You had me at Waititi.
High Seas,If Murray is in it I‚Äôm watching
High Seas,"Just the way he says ""Present"" during the band meetings in Flight of the Conchords is enough to send me into a fit of laughter."
High Seas,"Me too‚Ä¶ me too. It‚Äôs the innocent idiot character. He always comes off as an innocent idiot, which makes any character he plays even more hilarious, in my opinion. He‚Äôs just good at playing oblivious. Using him for farcical things is definitely the best choice."
High Seas,"I remember hearing his name floated as a replacement manager for Michael Scott. I really, really wanted that to happen."
High Seas,"I honestly can‚Äôt decide if he‚Äôs one of the greatest comedic geniuses of all time, or if he‚Äôs just a super awkward guy that fell into some luck.

Either way, I‚Äôm a huge fan of everything he does."
High Seas,"Check out the TV show Wrecked with him in, it's pretty funny"
High Seas,"Dude is hilarious, when his characters get angry and he gets higher pitched I always lose it"
High Seas,More people should check out the YouTube shorts he and some friends did over first lockdown. The Alone Rangers. Hilarious
High Seas,Voltron was fantastic!
High Seas,Glad I‚Äôm not the only one
High Seas,"Man, I can‚Äôt believe how long it‚Äôs been since I first saw him in Flight of the Conchords."
High Seas,"Scene from wrecked where he plays chess is hilarious, his character in that is actually brilliantly played."
High Seas,"Usually I don't get sold on name alone -- Taika and Rhys, especially together, are an exception"
High Seas,When I looked at him in this pic I had to look twice to realise it wasn't Kenneth Williams.
High Seas,Hes been in some of my favorite media including playing Russel in half life Alyx he stole the show.
High Seas,Present!
High Seas,makes me sad with how Stede Bonnet's story ends...
High Seas,One of the funniest stand-up comedians too.
High Seas,Leggy Blonde
High Seas,"His voice came into the trailer before it showed his face, and I immediately shouted, ""Murray!""

*Prisint*."
High Seas,"Finally got around the watching the Jumanji films recently, his small role was easily the highlight for me.  When he returned in the 2nd I was *delighted*"
High Seas,Oi! Ginger balls!
High Seas,"I don't know if that Fleetwood Mac joke existed before FOTC or if one of them wrote it. Either way, it's still my favorite joke in the whole show. Loved Murray's interactions with Bret the most. Bret's always slightly antagonizing Murray.


https://youtu.be/LK9kzCnunWo"
High Seas,I love him so hard. He is so funny.
High Seas,"I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as hyperbolic, but this looks like the greatest show of all time‚Ä¶"
High Seas,"Bro I haven't even heard of this but seeing Rhys in the thumbnail is all I needed. Short Poppies, Flight of the Conchords, and WWDITS were literally all him imo"
High Seas,"Oh hey, a show to fill the void that Peacemaker left behind!"
High Seas,Anything featuring Rhys Darby and by Taika Waititi and I'm in.
High Seas,"Saved me a click, thank you!"
High Seas,"Only reason I'm here, thanks for making it quick!"
High Seas,"this is what I came to find out, thank you and good day."
High Seas,"I have Crave+HBO, will it be on that?"
High Seas,Thanks. Saved me from clicking.
High Seas,"Watching it now, trying to get it."
High Seas,"""Did you thank the nice man for his gold and merchandise?""

""No captain, I thought that since we was stealing the....""

""What arrre we?""

^"".....pi-rates ^not ^ingrates""

""I can't heeear you""

""pi-rates not ingrates!"""
High Seas,If it's as good as wwdits I'm in. I love the movie and the show
High Seas,‚ÄúWhat we do when the flag blows‚Äù
High Seas,"The gentleman pirate is such a fun but of history. When I saw the trailer for this show, I immediately loved the idea of Taika telling it. I‚Äôm excited for it."
High Seas,Wow that's so cool. I've passed it many times but never read the inscription.
High Seas,"If you‚Äôre a fan of podcasts, The Dollop did an episode on Blackbeard a while back, and included a lot of info on Stede. Top 10 episode for me, and that‚Äôs saying sometime cause they‚Äôve done *a lot* of episodes. 

https://youtu.be/sRj26fEqL0k"
High Seas,Howdy neighbor
High Seas,I need to see that
High Seas,which video? got a link?
High Seas,"This was clearly created after someone watched that video and decided to cash in. If I had to put money down, ill say the IH video will be the superior one, because cash in shit always falls flat."
High Seas,wait anne is in this? what about rackham?
High Seas,"Note that he is the producer, not the creator."
High Seas,"The trailer did not do it for me at all... I typically love his stuff too but I dunno. Just fell flat. Now that's just the trailer, I will still definitely check it out. But less excited now than I was when I originally heard about it."
High Seas,His humor got repetitive and trailer didnt look promising.
High Seas,"As much as dipshits use them as an excuse to cover valid criticism, haters are very much a real thing."
High Seas,"Lot of other more critical reviews, basically saying it‚Äôs tediously earnest"
High Seas,Didn't look funny at all from the trailer. Black sails would be a funnier pirate show I reckon.
High Seas,"I don‚Äôt have anything ‚Äúnegative‚Äù to say, because I really liked some of Waititi‚Äôs work, such as Jojo Rabbit and Thor: Ragnarok.

However, I‚Äôve always struggled to get his comedies. I really wanted to like What We Do in the Shadows but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. Nothing against those who enjoyed it though."
WHAT / IF,I wanna watch it for Jane Levy. Hope it isn‚Äôt that bad.
WHAT / IF,Wdym soap. It‚Äôs not like days of our lives is it? Can someone explain ‚Äúsoap‚Äù please? Also she‚Äôs not that big.
WHAT / IF,"Not gonna lie, your description makes this my next go to series.

On the question you asked, she took a pretty long break from the spotlight there for a while. It‚Äôs quite possible she didn‚Äôt have her pick of the litter anymore.

Or, honestly more likely, Netflix threw piles of money at her AND it sounds like a project unlike anything she‚Äôs done before (and from my perspective as an actor, these kinds of shows, while not high art, are a shit ton of fun to work on)."
WHAT / IF,[deleted]
WHAT / IF,Soaps are good now.
WHAT / IF,Maybe she thought it was ironic and cool in a b-movie way?
WHAT / IF,I got 5 episodes in before it was 3 am and i needed to get to bed. Dont know if ill come back.
WHAT / IF,Her career has been on life support for 15 years. There's no way a 50 year old Zellweger has her pick of projects.
WHAT / IF,"Great show, loved it"
WHAT / IF,Shes awful in it. Just like most things shes done.
WHAT / IF,"How is it absurd?  Renee Zellweger hasn‚Äôt been relevant in a long time. In fact I don‚Äôt think she ever was.  Seems like she‚Äôs at that point in her career where she will take any gig she can get. Many people in Hollywood end up that way.  I find it hard to believe that they would beg her to join the cast,she probably had an agent that got her an audition."
WHAT / IF,Agree with you. Can't believe she wasted her talent on this trashy show.. She won f*cking oscar!
WHAT / IF,I enjoyed it actually. Def melodramatic but also fun and interesting. Like a summer beach read.
WHAT / IF,"Soap opera: overdramatic, absurd plots, low production quality."
WHAT / IF,"I haven't seen the show, but I've heard it's more of a primetime soap rather than a daytime soap. So more Grey's Anatomy than Days of Our Lives. 

The two styles (at least in America) share the typically large cast of characters, the crazy and emotional plotlines, interweaving arcs, etc, and are typically different in frequency of episodes (weekly vs daily), episodes in a season, production value, and more."
WHAT / IF,[deleted]
WHAT / IF,"Not too sure it was just for the paycheck. She apparently wrote and filmed her own pilot (before they even started writing the show) to help her flesh out her character. She seems to have been involved in a lot of aspects, before the straight to series order."
WHAT / IF,Last 2 episodes were solid.
WHAT / IF,"She didn't audition for the role, it was written for her. She signed on before they started writing the show.

The last major release Renee Zellweger film was Bridget Jones 3, which made $200M+ worldwide in cinemas and more on home media, off a $30M budget.

Her next major release is the Judy Garland movie, which BBC Films big awards season release.

So how have you concluded she's a has-been, desperate for roles?"
WHAT / IF,Agree she may have lost her relevance but starting with Jerry MaGuire late 90s and then 5-6 years of Bridget Jones movies she was THE actress to cast in her day. And she was critically acclaimed. Everyone knew she would win when she was nominated for Best Actress and won the Oscar. I think a thing to remember about Hollywood is it has a collective long memory of people's talents and acting chops. Casting her brought viewers like me the same way casting Zendaya is bringing her generation to Euphoria. The show isn't great but honestly I think Z is over the top perfect for the role.I'm disappointed in the tone of the show but when she's on screen I'm hooked.
WHAT / IF,Oh boy
WHAT / IF,You must be really young.
WHAT / IF,"The thing about soaps is that a good soap like season 1 of Revenge is super watchable.

&#x200B;

The fact of the matter is like 80% of the watching audience is there to stop thinking and tune out after work. A really good soap is enthralling enough to get you invested but silly enough to make you not take it seriously. There is plenty of Soaps that have run decades and prime time soap opera used to be way more common then they are now. Maybe Netflix is hoping this is unserved market like romantic comedies have proven to be for the service.

&#x200B;

Lastly Renee is at a really dangerous age range for female actors. Actresses around 40 to 60 really lack parts (unless the make it themselves like Nicole Kidman) and a long running TV show is a great way to bridge that gap and keep you in the public eye. I don't believe this show in particular will last but these types of shows can chug along for years without you noticing it."
WHAT / IF,i did end up finishing it. i skipped a lot of the doctor storyline scenes. All in all it was pretty interesting.
WHAT / IF,[deleted]
WHAT / IF,"I heard its an anthology series though, so im curious to see if this is renewed if some of the cast will be retained just put in different roles in season. I especially wonder if Renee will come back as a different character."
WHAT / IF,"They could literally cut those characters out and the show would work as is. They were *that* tacked on. However I could see their story continuing in a 2nd season, as part of a bigger ensemble again.

I also want to say the old high school friend with the video camera (Billy?) has to be one of the worst characters to appear in a TV show in years. But I sorta lowkey want him to come back as a lead next season, if there is one."
WHAT / IF,"Oh look, an article from 2007. That TOTALLY holds up in 2019. By that time Nicole Kidman's heyday as an actress was pretty much over. She racked up impressive movie credentials from the early 90's up until the early 2000's.

Renee did a bunch of good movies in the early 2000's, so this was right after that. It's not unfathomable to think that they were at difference stages of their movie careers, hence the equal salaries in 2007.

But over the lifetime of their acting careers, Nicole Kidman has had the bigger star than Renee Zellwegger."
WHAT / IF,I love the Buffy one and the supernatural one as well
WHAT / IF,"Supernatural, 3x11, 'Mystery Spot'.

""It was the heat of the moment

Telling me what my heart meant"""
WHAT / IF,"X files had a fun one, I remember enjoying the outer limits episode with a time loop too. Just weird to see Kevin Nealon in a non comedy role"
WHAT / IF,"The TNG one (cause and effect) is my personal favorite, and probably a top episode of the entire show for me."
WHAT / IF,Misfits had a good one of these its first season
WHAT / IF,There‚Äôs two incredible episodes of Fringe that had me crying. One was called ‚Äúwhite tulip‚Äù And another called ‚Äúand those we left behind‚Äù
WHAT / IF,"Doctor Who (series 9, Heaven Sent). 12 Monkeys. Also the new Quantum Leap just did an great time loop episode.

Edit: kept messing up the DW episode title, sigh"
WHAT / IF,Travelers.    Season 2 episode 7.   17 Minutes
WHAT / IF,Lots of great ones have already been mentioned. I'd say the best one that hasn't been is the one from Legends of Tomorrow.
WHAT / IF,"Been there, done that, episode of Xena the Warrior Princess."
WHAT / IF,Agents of SHIELD had a good one in the last season.
WHAT / IF,"I only saw the title and immediately said ""Stargate"".  I think it's the only one I've actually liked."
WHAT / IF,Agents of shield 7x09 As I Have Always Been
WHAT / IF,"12 Monkeys Season 2 episode 8 ""Lullaby"""
WHAT / IF,Here's an obscure one: Cloak and Dagger's episode was probably the best one in the show
WHAT / IF,Every episode of season 1 of Russian Doll.
WHAT / IF,"Shows that had something similar but you wouldn't expect it:

Community - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial\_Chaos\_Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial_Chaos_Theory)

Person of Interest - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-Then-Else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-Then-Else)

Blindspot (don't @ me) - [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7808238/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7808238/) Everlasting"
WHAT / IF,"Not a ""time-loop"" episode in the strictest sense, but...

Person of Interest, *If-Then-Else*."
WHAT / IF,I like the one from the Magicians
WHAT / IF,"I agree with Stargate. Such a great episode I‚Äôve watched a million times. 

The other that comes to mind is TNG‚Äôs Cause and Effect."
WHAT / IF,"American Dad

Their Christmas episodes are always fire."
WHAT / IF,"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.- S7.E9: As I Have Always Been.

12 Monkeys - S2.E8: Lullaby.

Dark Matter - S3.E4: All the Time in the World."
WHAT / IF,A Year of Hell from ST Voyager
WHAT / IF,The mentioned ‚Äúcause and effect‚Äù episode from TNG is probably the best. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm about to recommend something from Star Trek Discovery but ‚ÄúMagic to Make the Sanest Man go Mad‚Äù is actually a really good spin on a similar concept.
WHAT / IF,"The Agents Of SHIELD one was absolutely fantastic, and pretty funny. It knows its audience, knows the audience knows these episodes, and does things a bit differently or amusingly.

But I quite like Red Dwarf's riff on them in Future Echoes. Only the second episode ever, it takes the concept - seeing the future - and makes it *immediate*. Rather than experiencing the future all as one before returning to the start, the episode says ""here's a quick bit of the future, now here you are again experiencing it from the start - *and nothing you do will change the outcome*"".

This is best illustrated by Lister finding the Cat with a broken tooth in a ""future echo'"". He doesn't know what caused it, but decides he can change the future by preventing the Cat from breaking his tooth. Realising the Cat is about to try eating his robot goldfish and breaking his tooth on that, Lister wrestles the robot goldfish away from the Cat, and in the struggle breaks the Cat's tooth."
WHAT / IF,The Librarians has a really good episode where the team is stuck in video game and only Ezekiel Jones remembers each time they respawn.
WHAT / IF,If-Then-Else from Person of Interest. Perfect hour of TV.
WHAT / IF,The Stargate Universe time loop episode was fantastic as well
WHAT / IF,"Not exactly a timeloop, but Community's Remedial Chaos Theory resets each timeline. Fantastic episode."
WHAT / IF,Russian Doll
WHAT / IF,I really enjoyed Lost Girl's version of this.
WHAT / IF,Yule. Tide. Repeat. -American dad
WHAT / IF,"I still remember the ""Point of Salvation"" -------> >!""Oh, like a save point!""!< aha moment when I watched that episode of The Librarians and got to the twist."
WHAT / IF,Stargate is the best one.  Legends of Tomorrow and ST:TNG were great.  Russian Doll season 1 was very good.  The Flash just did one and it was mediocre.
WHAT / IF,"Discovery season 1 had a good one, with the villain in control of the loop.  Also my favorite Discovery episode"
WHAT / IF,First episode of Dirk Gently!
WHAT / IF,Not a show but love how Palm Springs did it
WHAT / IF,"AoS

They go all the way,  

it's the same over and over. 

There are real consequences. 

It's funny. 

They do the intro credits more than once"
WHAT / IF,"Does Person of Interest's If-Then-Else count? If so, that.


If not, my #2 would be Fringe's White Tulip."
WHAT / IF,There's an episode in the new Twilight Zone series where a woman finds out that a dude who seemingly knows everything about her is trapped in a time loop. She proceeds to beat his ass up after not taking no for an answer. There's more to it but I don't wanna give everything away. A very decent twist on the old concept.
WHAT / IF,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: ""Endless Eight"" episodes.

Eight of the 28 episodes of the series are each mostly the same as the other seven, with slight differences, until the time loop is broken in the eighth episode. Thankfully, the repetitive episodes came in the second season.

They aired one after the other, in their regular weekly timeslot, so I can only imagine how frustrated viewers were as it first aired, wondering why this episode is pretty much the same as the last, and the one before that..."
WHAT / IF,Future man.
WHAT / IF,"Charmed has an outstanding Groundhog Day episode called ""Deja Vu All Over Again"". Season 1 episode 22. So well done.

Surprised at the Buffy mentions on here. It was only a couple minutes of Groundhog-ness...That's the power of Buffy though. Endlessly iconic."
WHAT / IF,"Doctor Who

>!Heaven Sent!<"
WHAT / IF,Heaven Sent from Dr Who is best example of this. It is also one of the best stories from the franchise overall.
WHAT / IF,Remedial Chaos Theory.
WHAT / IF,Extraordinary S1E8
WHAT / IF,"It‚Äôs not exactly Groundhog Day style but Remember Me - Star Trek: TNG

There‚Äôs an intro which shows Dr. Crusher get caught up in a warp bubble but the first time I watched it, I missed that part.  All I saw was people disappearing off the Enterprise over and over with no one but Crusher remembering they even existed.  It was such a ‚Äúwhat-the-hell-is-going-on‚Äù moment for me!"

WHAT / IF,I enjoyed the one in DC's Legends of Tomorrow. RIP
WHAT / IF,Person Of Interest Episode *If Else Then*
WHAT / IF,"33 minutes from Battlestar Galactica. 

I know it doesn't really count, as it isn't a timeloop perse, but it was such a great (re)introduction to the concept of a fleet of refugees being hunted by calculating relentless robots."

WHAT / IF,LEGION
WHAT / IF,Supernatural Season 3 episode 11 Mystery Spot

I already liked Supernatural and came across it but I doubt youd need much prior info to enjoy it."
WHAT / IF,"Well you basically already listed most of my favorites, except for the first episode of Bravest Warriors, a web show by Pendleton Ward. I love it because at the beginning of the episode they find themselves from the previous time loop dead on the floor, so they try prevent that from happening, >!but at the end of the episode they die anyway in the same way next to their other dead selves, time loops back and when the next version of them sees two other versions already dead they say nope and just leave without fixing the time loop. Because even when knowing they were gonna die they couldn't stop it, so obviously they couldn't do it, better to just give up and dip.!<"

WHAT / IF,In the Heat of the moment
WHAT / IF,"Does ""My butterfly"" from Scrubs count?

Basically the same day plays out differently because a butterfly landed on a different random person's chest. You see how each effect impacted the diagnosis of the same patient (on where lots goes wrong, one where lots goes right) but in the end the patient dies in both stories either way. Showing that even if you can do everything right, things can still go bad."

One Spring Night,"Oh I saw this in 2019. Sooo good.

Thanks for the heads up!"
One Spring Night,"Saw this in the fall of 2018 in NYC.  The part with the [violinist being lifted in the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fxMTKDgX5c) while she plays the Goodbye Brother theme, with leaves falling all around is worth the price of admission.  I would literally go and see it every year if it was an option."

One Spring Night,See episode of Buck Rogers with [Markie Post.](https://www.google.com/search?q=buck+rogers+markie+post&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari)
One Spring Night,I think we are getting a sequel series soon! I am actually excited about it. üë®üèº‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
One Spring Night,"No one ever remembers this show when I bring it up, glad to see some recognition ! Have t heard of a reboot but I‚Äôm curious for sure"
One Spring Night,"Markie Post, still hot even with that horrible haircut."
One Spring Night,Dan Harmon (creator of Community and Rick and Morty) on his podcast Harmontown did a [version of this theme with lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1J3-nFrw20) and I can't hear this song without hearing his lyrics
One Spring Night,Would watch this every Wednesday night at 9pm on NBC back in the 90s.
One Spring Night,This is basically the reason I decided to pickup the bass. This and the Fraggle Rock theme song
One Spring Night,I binged Night Court a couple months ago in preparation of the sequel series coming early next year. With Harry's Daughter as the judge and Dan will be back.
One Spring Night,You know what that means? It's time for the Intern Special Olympics
One Spring Night,is this a red letter media reference ?!?!
One Spring Night,is there any way to stream this show yet?
One Spring Night,My all time favorite sit com.
One Spring Night,I can hear it even with out watching the video.
One Spring Night,"Excellent! I say, $20 fine and time served. (Real Night Court fans know what I am talking about)"
One Spring Night,I loved that show. Thanks for the flashback.
One Spring Night,Hey! That's the Intern Olympics song!
One Spring Night,A reunion of friends...
One Spring Night,I'm sorry if they tried to steal your precious antibodies.
One Spring Night,I‚Äôm convinced the Seinfeld bass slaps owe the first part of this theme for inspiration
One Spring Night,"Same composer, good catch."
One Spring Night,I know Night Court creator Reinhold Weege wrote several episodes of Miller.
One Spring Night,I'll never understand why they got rid of the sexiness in season 2 of Buck Rogers.
One Spring Night,"Damn!  I was always more of a Princess Ardala kind of guy, but...damn!"
One Spring Night,[Yep!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Court_(upcoming_TV_series))  And same!
One Spring Night,RIP
One Spring Night,"Interrrrrn Olympics

Wokkkketern Olympics  
We're so woke"
One Spring Night,According to Amazon you can watch it free with ads through Freevee
One Spring Night,"That explains it!  As soon as I heard it I was like ""yeah, but that one with the cops in NY was better, with the instrument-by-instrument intro.  What was the name of that show?  I can google it, but 'NY cop show 80s' is just going yo give me 'Hill Street Blues.'  What were the character names?  Wojohoeitz or something like that?  Or was that Taxi?  No, that was Ignatowski.  I bet someone in the comments already thought of it, I should look there."""
One Spring Night,"The NCIS and NCIS Hawaii crossover got us to start watching NCIS.  So they work, but I don't generally like them."
One Spring Night,"> In the episode ‚ÄúA Long Time Coming,‚Äù while Agent Rountree and Fatima are searching for Kilbride, who has been MIA, they are ambushed and learn that every member of the team has a $200,000 bounty on their head via the dark web. The NCIS team must save Rountree and find Kilbride while every cartel, hit man, gang and psychopath hunts them down.

I think the price would have to be **a lot** higher than ""$200K on the dark web"" for every criminal in the city to try and kill a federal agent *in the military* but that's just me."
One Spring Night,"I hate cross overs, with most shows really. They tend to not evolve any character development and are usually a waste of time"
One Spring Night,The unanticipated crossover from 2 uninspired police procedurals that somehow haven't been off the air yet.
One Spring Night,If Jag was still on it would be a 4 way
One Spring Night,The original is older than Millie Bobby Brown. Gotta leave that here.
One Spring Night,"The original show is a fantastic time capsule show.  You go back far enough and cell phones are bricks, then flips, then finally smart.  The culture of the characters and their interactions change over time too.  I definitely encourage you to check out the old seasons just to see the arc of the show.  It has been a ""family dinner night"" show for me since before I left for college!"
One Spring Night,"I had actually given up on NCIS after season thirteen, returning only when Ziva came back, and then the crossover with Hawai'i ended up luring me back in - it felt like new life had been breathed into the show with all these new characters.

I am now completely caught up on the show!"
One Spring Night,NCS is my favorite show to put on when I'm sick although I was so glad when Kate got shot cuz her storyline of her always clashing with Tony  got really old really quick.
One Spring Night,"Isn't that most of these law enforcement procedurals though?  Meaningful character development only happens in premieres, finales, and sweeps."
One Spring Night,I've seen early episodes of the show.  I did not like the characters and tone.  It seemed that everyone was a jerk who did not get along with the others.  It was just unpleasant instead of fun.
One Spring Night,this is why i like Law & Order SVU despite all its flaws. our attitudes on what is acceptable and what isnt have changed so much in 25 years. Like the shit even the more liberal minded characters say 25 years ago would really piss off even the most conservative ones today
One Spring Night,You‚Äôre a monster
One Spring Night,"Minor development happens during the season, leading up to the actual major character developments. But yeah in these types of shows I really only watch for the premieres, mid season finales, and finales."
One Spring Night,"One of my favorite shows this year. I ended up enjoying it slightly more than ""Outer Range"", which is probably going to have a similar fate."
One Spring Night,"J.K. Simmons has now had 2 great sci-fi series cut out from under him. Damn this is so frustrating as a viewer, I can't imagine how it is for him."
One Spring Night,"I would say poor marketing, because this is the first time I have ever heard of it, meanwhile I get flooded with the new Chris Pratt movie in the same platform"
One Spring Night,"Details:

>Launching to largely positive reviews, the series did not make a significant viewership impact while carrying sizable costs tied to its sci-fi content. But regardless of the cancellation, Night Sky already has secured its place in TV history.
  
>Prime Video, in conjunction with Amazon Web Services, SES, and Intelsat, beamed the show‚Äôs first episode into outer space, marking the farthest distance from earth that a TV series has been distributed and making Prime Video the first streamer to distribute its content directly into space."
One Spring Night,I actually liked the show. Cliffhanger of course. Oh well.
One Spring Night,Sad.  A great show off to the TV graveyard.
One Spring Night,Amazon make these great shows with great actors then just releases them with no promotion or fanfair at all. At least Netflix understands the importance of marketing.
One Spring Night,"This sucks, loved this show."
One Spring Night,[deleted]
One Spring Night,"It hooked me early on. I thought ""hey I can't wait to see more of that alien planet or see them discover changes!"" And then ""oh, people and more rooms"". And then ""ok it's an illuminati type deal?""

It hooked me with an interesting and mysterious sci Fi concept that then proceeded to get left off for so much of it. It felt like the interesting parts were all sprinkled throughout each episode and the rest was filled. Like they could have cut entire chunks out and we wouldn't miss anything.

If it's cancelled I'm probably going to just look up spoilers. But at the pace it was going, I doubt I would have given season 2 a chance."
One Spring Night,WT actual F?!?! I just started watching this yesterday. It's an awesome show! Why can't we ever have anything nice? Dammit!
One Spring Night,"I guess I'm not surprised - I thought the pacing was excellent and the premise was interesting, which is usually a death prognosis for tv shows."
One Spring Night,"I'm subscribed to Prime, log in regularly, first I'm hearing of this show. Their app and their promotion is terrible."
One Spring Night,Noooooooooooooooo
One Spring Night,"Aww. Fucking shame, that (literally my actual muttered response). Thought it was very nicely paced, performed and ended on a hell of a cliffhanger. Would have needed a budget increase for S2, sure, but a two season and done arc seemed a fair ask."
One Spring Night,Fingers crossed Outer Range survives. I loved that one.
One Spring Night,"So annoyed as I really enjoyed it but I'm also not surprised that it didn't have a large enough audience, I never saw anyone talk about it on Reddit or social media."
One Spring Night,"I really like sci-fi. I really liked the premise this started with. 

I got bored after the second episode, and stopped. Felt like the what now seems like normal padding of story to try and make a play for multiple seasons. I think life‚Äôs too short for that cynical malarkey. I probably won‚Äôt go back to it, and I‚Äôm not surprised it was canned."
One Spring Night,"I really hate this shit. I was hoping these streaming giants would at least give us fleshed out stories. If they're willing to bite the first season, why not give us at least 3-5? What's the point of having 3-5 1 season shows that have no conclusions? Imagine buying a book series and only getting a few or one of the series. (Looking at you George R. R. Martin)

I absolutely loved this show and now it'll be another one of my shows that ends on a fucking cliffhanger."
One Spring Night,How did people like this? This seemed like an interesting concept.
One Spring Night,Man I am so tired of shows I like being cancelled on a cliffhanger.
One Spring Night,"It‚Äôs sucks cause shows get canceled for poor viewing numbers but most of the times there‚Äôs no advertisement for them. Most of these shows rely on word of mouth, which can be slow."
One Spring Night,Disappointed does not even begin to describe my feelings right now. Aside from The Boys (which I enjoy but don‚Äôt think is amazing) and Invincible there aren‚Äôt any shows that interest me on Prime. Too bad.
One Spring Night,nooooooooo
One Spring Night,"Ah dammit!

Another great show cancelled before we learn important stuff, like what was in that town they see on the other planet, or did the other guy survive, or not?

Brings me back to the show Defying Gravity.  One season in, my wife and I totally got invested in all the plot lines, the secrets - what the hell was on the ship that was making everyone so crazy - ABC decides to pull the rip cord - we will never know.

Same thing here."
One Spring Night,That sucks. I really liked it
One Spring Night,"Wow, that was a pretty good watch and looked like it was going to get even better."
One Spring Night,Yet again the broken way they are telling these stories is a disservice to the fans. Cliffhanger makes watching this series mostly pointless. There was so much filler they easily could‚Äôve told a complete story. Completely remove the klepto subplot and they would‚Äôve had time to tell the full story.
One Spring Night,"Was on my list after The Old Man, oh well. Sucks."
One Spring Night,Good show that Amazon never gave a chance with zero marketing and release week after Outer Range.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,The one part of this show that actually was worth watching was the few seconds where her and Kim kardashian were staring at a wall of appliances trying to figure out which one was the blender....
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Does she make hot ham water?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"I‚Äôm not someone to be offended by Paris Hilton. At this point, she‚Äôs a nostalgic icon who lobbies for Utah schools to not beat kids which is fantastic. 

She‚Äôs just not that interesting to watch on TV."

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,She‚Äôs cooking in a white silk dress. This tells me she‚Äôs not doing much of the cooking

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"I remember watching the episode where Paris had her family over to cook with her and it was so uncomfortable. Like, those people did not want to be in a room together. 

I thought a Paris Hilton cooking show would be a silly fun time, but the only somewhat entertaining episodes were the ones where the guests carried it (namely Saweetie and Kim K)"
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"It was just not good. There was no zip even with guests that are normally vivacious and hilarious. The show was not informative, relaxing or funny. 

I went into it hoping for something between ""Ugly Delicious"" and ""Nailed It!"". Not sure what they were going for but it didn't land for me.

And ""sliving"" is not a thing."

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,I feel like we‚Äôre just one of the throwaway universe with random content that just shows up on interdimensional cables

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"I hadn‚Äôt seen it, but I (attempted) to watch a Bon Appetite video where she guested and I just couldn‚Äôt take it. She had nothing to offer that was worth watching. Brad (the host) did his best to help the segment but nothing could have helped."

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"She had a cooking show? Like, not knocking her or anything, but if they‚Äôre canceling it due to low interest/ratings I‚Äôd have to blame marketing because I don‚Äôt know of anyone who knew about this."
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"Good for her for staying in the spotlight but I don‚Äôt understand the person interested in watching her content. Her discovering where the kitchen in her 5th mansion, great‚Ä¶"
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,TIL Paris Hilton had a cooking show on Netflix
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,I always wondered if it was all an act or are they really that stupid or are they that stupid but trying to act like they are acting?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Because why wouldn‚Äôt it be?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,No shit
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Wow a cooking show with Paris Hilton being cancelled after only one season tell me it isn't so.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Man I‚Äôm genuinely surprised that a show with such deep and cultural roots got canceled after just one season. A true shame. Think of all the little children who will grow up not knowing that all they have to be is pretty and fake to be famous and wealthy.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,What? Netflix cancelling a show after 1 season? Unheard of! /s
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,How is she still a thing in 2022? She stopped being relevant when she did that show with Lionel Richie's daughter
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,I don‚Äôt know how this show even got one season to begin with.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,I am kinda sad about this and I hope she'll upload something like that again on YouTube like the Lasagna video.

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"Ok now after seeing all these comments, I kinda need to see the show for laughs (maybe?). The kind of pony and laugh laughs.  For the record, I‚Äôm a British Baking show gal."
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Shows like that should be saved for YouTube.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,It‚Äôs like cooking with Selina but without the chefs and without the celebrity

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,This generation fetishises dumb fucks way too much.

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Netflix are going to get a reputation for Cancelling shows after 1 or 2 seasons.  Not that I really care about this show anyway.
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Great decision Netflix great decision
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,Wow. What took so long?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,She needs to give it up! Even her porn career sucked!

The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,The hell were they cooking? Meth?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,She had a show?
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,"Put this on out of pure curiosity as to whether she could actually even cook.

I couldn't even get ten mins in."
The Little Paris Kitchen: Cooking with Rachel Khoo,This was actually quality content
1994,The early seasons of TRW were amazing. There was nothing like it. I don't think there will ever be anything like it again. It was lightning in a bottle. Everything is too scripted and overproduced these days.
1994,Now you know why MTV as we knew it died. Reality TV was cheap and effective.
1994,"It's bizarre to consider what a cultural powerhouse that show actually was at the time - that season is largely considered to be the peak of what that show was, and *could* be (it went *really* swiftly downhill a couple seasons later, and became a cynical, gross, and weirdly *conservative* clown show by the time the 2000s hit - at which point it was more or less just a feeder show for The Challenge).

For example: the memoir that put Dave Eggers on the map and started the literary empire he's best known for is largely about trying to get on *this season* (he ends up not making it, and Judd Winick gets the slot). And it wasn't considered a cheap, tawdry ambition to have at all, at the time! It seemed like an opportunity to be part of something meaningful, and that definitely comes across in the memoir - and was further reinforced by how the season actually played out."
1994,"If you're up for some comics, check out [Judd Winick's graphic novel about his time on the show and relationship with Pedro Zamora.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_and_Me)"
1994,I watched it in real time back in the day! Pedro! I just can't...
1994,"Ah yes, the early years when they all had goals and it wasn‚Äôt just Fuck Buddy Mountain."
1994,"Two wheels good, four wheels bad!"
1994,"I think in general due to the fact that it was one of the first such shows, both the cast and the producers were treading a fresh path, and so they didn't have the past few decades of experience to draw on when it comes to both casting and how they ""script"" the show. 

Now they have decades of experience when it comes to what kind of episodes get the best ratings, what kind of people the audience best responds to, how to edit the shows to get the best content, and so on. Those first few Real World seasons were probably as real as this kind of show could get, it's never going to be recaptured unless the people don't actually know they're being filmed."
1994,"Are these available somewhere. Hulu only has this San Francisco season and season 30. I got cable during later seasons and remember some of it, but I'd like to see The Real World from the 90s."
1994,Reality killed the video star.
1994,Came here to recommend this. It was my introduction to graphic novels as a medium and it's extremely compelling.
1994,That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôll likely be wanting to check this out after I am done with the season. When the guy mentioning being a cartoonist I was curious about what his art looked like.
1994,"As a man who lives for off the beaten path graphic novels, you‚Äôre speaking language."
1994,"Even after S01 you can see how they make huge changes. No one who is an artist is doing shows on the road, they can't just watch TV like Andre did in S01, alcohol becomes widely available"
1994,Paramount+
1994,"He wound up being one of DC Comics' big 4 writers in the mid-2000s.

Besides Pedro and Me, you can see his art on display on two ends of the spectrum... his early series The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius, which is about a foul mouthed 10-year-old supergenius, and his current series Hilo, which is all-ages fare.

I haven't read Hilo, but it's quite successful. I have read Barry Ween, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1994,"Yeah, IIRC that kid from London who put on the play, I remember reading that he just ended up laying around the house not doing anything the whole time they were there. 

I also think that they hid the romance between Kat? and that singer guy because he had a girlfriend. No way they'd do something like that later on."
1994,"No.

The coming out episode was built up for a couple of weeks.  It was a huge pop culture moment.  The ratings for the episode were through the roof.

However, the quality of the writing at this point in the series had really gone downhill.  The audience dropped week after week, ultimately leading to cancelation."
1994,"What?

How would she come out on a sitcom without the people making the show being aware?

Sitcoms aren‚Äôt broadcast live."
1994,"Having lived through it, that doesn‚Äôt sound right at all. It was a huge publicity thing. Everyone was talking about it. Producers usually only care about money, and that was certainly good for business. 

But then it wasn‚Äôt. After a big spike, ratings dropped and the show started to focus too much on gay issues that alienated mainstream audiences. 

In the end it got cancelled because ratings were way down. It just wasn‚Äôt the same show anymore, so people weren‚Äôt watching."
1994,"Nah, the last season just wasn't that funny. Instead of being primarily a fun slice of life series, the last season was only about Ellen's relationship problems and facing discrimination. It was just not that funny anymore, and the side characters were mostly there only to support Ellen and didn't have many storylines of their own."
1994,"I remember everyone saying about that coming out episode: ""yeah no shit, everyone already knows. """
1994,"The episode in question is from season 4, episode 22/23. Two more episodes aired that season. 

The show aired for another full season (5th season) before being cancelled.

So I would say no, the show was not cancelled because of that storyline. 

Not to mention, if the network didn't want to air the episode they wouldn't have. They could have easily stopped it from airing in the first place. The network gets copies of the script every step of the way, so no storyline is going to suddenly appear out of nowhere on taping day. Thats not how it works."
1994,"Other people have answered, but for what it's worth, folks, if you haven't seen the episode, it is worth seeking out. It is genuinely extremely funny, has aged very well, and if you don't know the cameos in advance, don't spoil them on yourself because I promise you won't guess.

The show went downhill afterwards, and you'll need to forget what you know about Ellen herself now, but it‚Äôs a great little self contained two parter, so don't worry about it.

It's called The Puppy Episode because when Ellen wasn't interested in her character dating a guy, Michael Eisner proposed writing an episode around her getting a puppy instead. The writers called this ""the puppy episode"" as a kind of sarcastic working title and it stuck."
1994,"The producers agreed that her character would come out, and she decided to fully come out personally at the same time.  (She had been making strong hints for years)

The thing was that the producers got cold feet afterwards, and wanted to backtrack, put the genie back in the bottle.  They and Ellen started having creative differences.  When they were filming the season after the coming out episode, producers wanted to cut the gay content and jokes from the show.  They wanted to add a parental warning before the show.  The show suffered because they had to constantly rewrite it to appease both the producers and Ellen who were feuding.  Eventually, the ratings started to sag and they just cancelled the show."
1994,[removed]
1994,"Yeah, there was build up to the episode everywhere. ABC advertised it heavily, Oprah was even in the episode."
1994,"Yeah this.

The coming out episode/moment was a big marketing deal, like hugely plastered all over about what ‚Äúmight‚Äù (cough) happen. People were talking on it before during and after. 

Not that people didn‚Äôt know she was gay, but this was her official party and it was never like totally confirmed she was gay, but it‚Äôs not like at this point everyone wasn‚Äôt aware after the massive marketing blitz 

After that, the show just trailed off like most sitcoms do, not much more to it."
1994,"I'm glad to hear someone else say this. The narrative I usually hear about it is, ""America wasn't ready for a sitcom with an openly gay main character."" The truth is, it became a completely different show, and that show wasn't very funny."
1994,Thanks so much for the info! Totally made no sense to me as well. Very cool you got to see that I have mixed feelings about Ellen as an individual but there is no denying she‚Äôs an icon and is very talented
1994,Thank so much for all the info! I watched the episode (i love it) with someone and they told me this but it just didn‚Äôt make any sense.
1994,"No she didn't, *Ellen* fnished in 1998, Willow didn't come out until Season 4 which was around 2000"

Then real life became more interesting and outpaced what the show could keep up with, Spacey was outed as a predator, and the writing fell off a cliff. Now nobody ever talks about it."

1994,"It's already looking like this thread is going to have the same discussion it seems to have every other day about which shows declined in quality and stuff like that.  It's nice that you brought up New York Undercover, I didn't know it was streaming.  I know BET was airing reruns recently and I watched a few episodes.  I used to watch it back in the day, I think I stopped around Season 3 or around there.  It was a really long time ago, so I can't really elaborate on what exactly changed, but I know I wasn't enjoying it as much as I used to so I stopped watching.  It was a very unique show for its time, in that the two main characters, detectives were minorities and their captain was a woman.  And it felt natural, it didn't feel like they were pandering.  It had that Dick Wolf feel like Law and Order, but it had a more gritty, on the ground quality since it was just about the cops.  I'm just giving my really basic assessment; again, I hadn't watched it in a very long time until recently, and only a couple of episodes at that.  Malik Yoba and Lauren Velez seem to have had pretty decent careers, I still see them in stuff to this day.  I don't know what happened with Michael DeLorenzo, I don't recall seeing him in anything after this."

1994,"SNL.  They had the hottest actor currently in the world, Pedro Pascal, and bombed in all live skits with him."
1994,"Exclusive for a dub of a show, but the original DiC production of Sailor Moon ended up suffering a loss of quality rather rapidly with even the original English dub's voice actors outright stating that they agreed with fans that the dub was completely rubbish. In fact, the show's second voice actress for Setsuna/Trisha/Sailor Pluto, Susan Aceron, even said that it was a mistake that she was cast to be in that series at all.

There's actually a known and stated reason for this, however, as given by Roland Parliament who was the voice of Umino/Melvin and the show's second ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) director in his autobiography *Sailor Moon Reflections*.

In short, the first voice of Sailor Moon, Tracey Moore, was also the show's first ADR director but was so heavily overworked that she suffered from burnout and quit thirteen episodes into the show's production (episodes 1-11, 15 and 21), so when she quit she was replaced with Roland.

They tried to keep her in the role by replacing her as ADR director with castmates who had smaller roles in the show. But because of clashes with a producer at Optimum Productions, Nicole Thuault who also heavily clashed with Moore while she was the ADR director, Parliament was fired from the role as ADR director as well as his replacement John Stocker, who played Rei's grandfather in the dub.

When Optimum completed their original recording sessions for the show, DiC decided to stop licensing the show and left them stranded. But Cartoon Network and YTV wanted more episodes dubbed so they paid for it themselves and ordered the adaptations directly. All 77 remaining episodes... in four months. Optimum couldn't get most of the original cast for a number of reasons - some of the voice actors hated the conditions and refused to come back while at least one of them outright couldn't due to being on maternity leave.

After this, Thuault decided that she might as well take on the role as the show's ADR director instead. This was despite the fact that despite being a producer on the show's English dub, *she didn't fucking speak English* and in fact needed a translator on-site to help her communicate with the cast and crew. By the way, did I mention that Optimum was based out of Ontario?

So, the ADR director wasn't able to properly quality control the recording, they had to adapt 77 episodes of the show in four months and most of the original cast was gone. They only had four hours to record each episode and took were only allowed to do two takes for each scene/episode and decided to use the one that wasn't shit. Quality dropped immensely, the seasons adapted were widely hated until the entire series was re-dubbed by Viz and it proved to be such an old shame that the DiC dub will never be rereleased again.

And for added hilarity, when they were doing the translation of the scripts into English, because of a stupid term of the contract that they were using, they weren't adapting the original Japanese scripts of the show but the earlier French dub produced in Paris.

Oh, and here's something funny I wanted to bring up as well. They had to make some changes to the show to appease US censors, mainly because the show could actually get somewhat violent for US audiences. One pair of junior high school students were expressly a pair of lesbians in the original Japanese version which was turned into them being cousins in the English dub... but they didn't fully remove all of the pretext, so it made them look like teenage *incestuous* lesbians instead."
1994,‚ÄúUnreal‚Äù. Season 1 was great but season 2 was garbage. Iirc the main show runner left the series at the end of season 1 and took all of the writing talent with her.
1994,"Designated Survivor very good for around 2 seasons, then it fell off..."

1994,"Yellowstone, where Taylor Sheridan's inability to work with a collaborative writing staff combined with his ever growing list of spinoffs/projects/ranches has taxed his ability to maintain a consistent plot that makes some sort of rational sense."
1994,Ive never seen a show drop as hard as game of thrones
1994,"Biggest drop in quality I've seen in a show was Man in the High Castle.

The first two seasons had some really incredible writing.  The alternate historical worldbuilding felt really thoughtfully crafted and rich, the tone and setting were suspenseful and engaging, and the character writing was generally fantastic.  I've heard some criticism that the main couple characters felt a little bland but I feel like that was intentional and in a way fits with the bleak scenarios they are in.  But regardless, any lack in Juliana's character is easily made up for by an astounding cast of deeply written and rich characters (friends and foes) around her.  I know I am absolutely not alone in saying that John Smith had the potential to be one of the greatest television characters of all time if they had stuck the landing - his story and how it was told was truly one of the most engrossing and compelling stories I've seen in film.

And then it feels like between seasons 2 and 3 the entire writing team got scrapped and replaced.  Season 3 kinda just felt like it had lost a bit of an aim and was missing some depth, but was by no means unsalvageable... And then season 4 jumped the shark, flew right off a cliff and landed in an absolutely crushing disaster of a dumpster fire.  Gone was any sense of historical basis and every single carefully crafted and compelling character arc took a major random turn into stupidity and pathetic oblivion."

1994,"This is a great answer, I remember watching week to week every season and asking myself ""Why"". 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And then the reboot happened..."
1994,"It's less about the ""real life"" thing and more because they had no idea how to write an interesting show about Frank as President and Season 3 became bloated and boring. There were a *lot* of comments on this very sub about how people had trouble paying attention to Season 3."
1994,show was trash even before all the spacey stuff happened. season 3 was already dumb as fuck
1994,"Yup, at the season 3 finale."
1994,"I was about to tap out during mid season 3, but I wanted to see how it wrapped up as I didn't remember details. 

But yes, jarring to say the least."
1994,"Two non white cops with a female boss. Characters using racial slurs to help drive the point of the episode home (for example white kid accused of bombing black churches). Pretty edgy for the time but it was Fox, after all. 

One thing the show portrayed was a strong, black man that was an attentive father. It often bucked stereotypes but sometimes would fall victim to some obvious preaching. 

Then maybe halfway into season 3, the show became more generic, and lost some of the ""urban"" feel. I'm as white as they come, but grew up in an area where I was the minority. 

Another thing that stuck with me was the subject matter. Lots of kids being killed on camera, and other brutal crimes relating to children either as victims or perpetrators. 

Lastly, it made NYC look just as dirty as it really was at the time."
1994,"Oh I've seen it, multiple times. While I agree with what you're saying, that debate has had its day in the sun."
1994,"I didnt like the second season, but felt the 3rd was pretty good"
1994,Ugh. That one really annoyed me. It was my introduction to sci-fi and I immediately loved it. Recently watched the series again as well.

1994,no u
1994,first season was amazing and incredibly popular.  then the writers strike hit.
1994,"There is a a behind the scenes documentary on YouTube about it.  There was an edict tfrom the network during season 3 to tone down the urban feel of the show.  At the same time, the two leads basically demanded more money before the start of the season. Cooler heads prevailed but everyone on the show was shocked when they got that final script and seeing that Eddie was being killed off.  Keep in mind, the ratings for the show were still strong.

The killing of Eddie Torrez essentially killed the audience.   Eddie/JC were the show. And it is especially frustrating when you realize how unneeded it was. In the storyline they had already written his character off by having him have to move to a different precinct.  And, he didn't die in a multi-episode arc or from a meaningful villain like Ice-T.  It was a random villain of the week that blows him up.

Audiences were pissed, and within a few episodes of season 4 it was clear they weren't coming back. The show was canceled pretty quickly into season 4."
1994,"Yes, I believe New York Undercover was part of Fox's Thursday night bloc, which were all shows with a (mostly) minority cast.  I believe it was Martin, then Living Single, then New York Undercover (since Fox's prime time slot was just two hours, and still is today).

Your view on what changed about the show sounds about right.  I can't point to anything specific (that time/memory thing yet again), but it started feeling ""samey"".  A part of television since its inception has been shows about cops and the law, and so many of them seemed to hit the same exact note.  New York Undercover appealed to me because it felt so fresh and raw compared to the other cop shows airing at that time.  My theory is that the ratings were flat and the consultants at the network wanted to boost them up, so they ""retooled"" it and took away what made it fresh and raw and different.  Again, something you see to this day."
1994,Absolutely. It does make you wonder how much bigger a deal stories like yours would have been if social media had been a thing much earlier.
1994,"Yeah, there was a point where everyone literally stopped caring about the infectious plague currently in their research station cause the writers were already on the next idea lol"
1994,"It‚Äôs true, it was just different the cops weren‚Äôt white, that was all it had going for it, and I watched it every week"
1994,I also loved the chicken wings commercial
1994,"There's nothing wrong with Saturday Night Taped but Saturday Night Live is broke.  

I love Update, but even it's writing is getting worse."
1994,"Don't let the writers off that easy. The strike is why the season was only 11 episodes long, not why those 11 episodes were bad. Scripted TV shut down for a few months, they didn't replace their writers."
1994,"Yup. I remember how he died but was surprised at the fact he'd have to leave the precinct due the marriage. Ok fine, so leave, don't show him on screen. Made no since. Something similar happened on SVU where Rollins quit the force to become a professor. In reality she didn't get the money she wanted, so they wrote her off. 

People underestimate Latin/Hispanic support. This was a prime example of that."
1994,"Well, name another cop drama that showed 90s NYC for what it actually was? Nothing about this show was pretty."
1994,"Me too, but not a live skit."
1994,"And it continued to be crap in the following seasons. 

The writers strike maybe made the downfall quicker but it was inevitable. It's clear that season 1 was the only one they really had figured out a story to tell. After that it was just milking it and making shit up as it went along."

1994,"This would really be a great subject for a series *if* it wasn't being produced by WWE.

I'd love to see an honest, critical accounting of this trial, and also one on the Monday night war for ratings between WWF and WCW. I still can't believe this hasn't been the subject matter by a major studio or documentarian outside of the wrestling media, which just preaches to the same choir of old wrestling fans who already know the story. It's still hard to fathom how pro-wrestling absolutely took over pop culture in the mid to late nineties. There's a really great subject there.  The money, the ratings, the drugs, the deaths, and the proliferation of low-brow shock content full of racism, sexism, and homophobia that caught on like wildfire among an entire generation of straight white adolescent males."

Chip and Potato,"Since you can have different products of the same name, it seems you'd have to replicate the trademark and whatnot before saying the product links two shows."
Chip and Potato,"it could be the nostalgia talking but

- the original *ducktales* had it all - stand alone episodes, multi part episodes, and a theatrically released film (with higher budget animation). it was adventure and treasure hunting while trying to teach lessons to adolescents

- *chip 'n dale* did similar to *ducktales* with a team going on adventures while foiling criminal acts

- as you pointed out, *goof troop* can now be watched with adult eyes similar to how we watched *a goofy movie* and related to max, but watching it now, you totally get where goofy is coming from. highly recommend: *Atlanta* s4e8 ""The Goof Who Sat by the Door""

- *gummi bears* is one of my personal favorites and so many loose ends in the story. Alicia Keys never watched the cartoon, but maybe you'll enjoy her singing the theme: https://streamable.com/49d9ug

- if you're a *darkwing duck* fan, take a chance and watch *ducktales* (2017) s2e16 ""The Duck Knight Returns!"" 

- speaking of *darkwing*, in an alternate universe gosalyn (mallard) grew up to become mallory mcmallard of *the mighty ducks* (1996)

- *talespin*

- and most importantly *gargoyles* - one of the best cartoons ever made"
Chip and Potato,I just tried showing my 4 year old Tailspin a few weeks ago on Disney+. I was excited to show her what I watched as a kid. The animation quality was pretty mediocre compared to what's available now. The story was fine but not amazing. Maybe she'll appreciate it when she's older but I think I got my nostalgia fill after one episode.
Chip and Potato,"No, as an adult the storytelling quality is sorely lacking."
Chip and Potato,"I still enjoy them, especially the musical scores. I have seen many modern cartoons (I have 2 young kids so I have to sit through a lot of toons now) that just don't have a memorable soundtrack. With that said, Phineas and Ferb definitely ranks up there with the toons from the 90s."
Chip and Potato,Rewatched some Gummi Bears not that long ago. Was  surprised by how much lore that show had.
Chip and Potato,"I probably wouldn't revisit most of those shows, but I will say the Chip N Dale movie was excellent and legitimately funny."
Chip and Potato,"üíØ 

I actually made it a mission to collect 90s cartoons that I loved so I watch them from time to time 

The last couple years I rewatched Gargoyles and I forgot just how amazing it was, I love Keith David in pretty much everything he's in but what a well written cartoon especially the avalon arc.

Notable ones I've watched recently 

Darkwing duck
Quack pack


The Not so Disney ones.
Bots masters
Bucky o Hare
Beast wars 
Reboot"
Chip and Potato,"Slightly off topic, but if you still like any of these shows, you absolutely, positively need to give the Ducktales reboot a try. It's essentially a 90's Disney show cinematic universe, and it's just so damn good."
Chip and Potato,"im ready for the downvotes but i dont see the appeal of kids shows as an adult

they were OKAY when i was in 3rd grade but no im not watching ducktales"
Chip and Potato,Gargoyles was ok. The rest were typical Disney crap.
Chip and Potato,Look up the ‚ÄúCooCoo Cola‚Äù song for a flashback memory of chip n Dale
Chip and Potato,"I'd be more likely to go to animaniacs, pinky and the brain, Dexter's lab, Ren and stimpy, etc."
Chip and Potato,"I loved them as a kid. Now, as a 36 father of 3; I find it weird that all the characters have now swapped back to their ‚Äòoriginal outfits‚Äô in current shows like clubhouse & mixed up adventures. It‚Äôs very distracting that Chip & Dale are naked again. Although the clothes were very 90‚Äôs. Goofy in his sweater and bow-tie, Donald in his Hawaiian shirt, daisy with short hair and one piece dress, Chip & Dale as Indiana Jones & Magnun P.I, Mickey in his House Of Mouse suit and the triplets in their Quack Pack designs."
Chip and Potato,"Voltron, centurions, galaxy rangers, sky commanders, jayce and rhe wheeled warriors.

Basically all of its utter garbage when rewatching.  

Duck tales could be fun though.  Maybe ill give it a whirl.

I still remember the shangri la episode ‚Äúmillions of shiny bottle caps‚Äù"
Chip and Potato,Loved em after school in the early 90s but I have trouble watch cartoons in general now as a adult. If it wasn‚Äôt for the kids I wouldn‚Äôt watch non.
Chip and Potato,GARGOYLES forever!
Chip and Potato,"The rewatchable ones for me are the TAS trifecta I.e. Batman/Spiderman/Xmen. 

Watching these again as an adult actually made me enjoy them even more. They are ageless imo."
Chip and Potato,">if you're a darkwing duck fan, take a chance and watch ducktales (2017) s2e16 ""The Duck Knight Returns!""

Also consider S3E12-13, ""Let's Get Dangerous!""."
Chip and Potato,"All these great shows and you missed a personal favorite, TaleSpin. Because what kind of kid doesn't want to fly around in a sea plane flying on your pull behind wakeboard and fighting air pirates!!"
Chip and Potato,Definitely give Stephen universe a shot if you haven't already.

Chip and Potato,I just mean it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs different shows reusing a fictional prop with no connection beyond that. OP is trying to make it sound like it somehow confirms they‚Äôre meant to be the same universe.

I once painted a house lime green (I am not a painter) so that when they picked a better color the change would be more dramatic."
Chip and Potato,I can imagine there are tons of stories like this regarding these shows.
Chip and Potato,"I remember one a long time ago that was basically two(?) teams designing different spaces, with judges to determine which fits better, and one team did like, a burnt wood motif at a fire station and the judges straight that team ""you fucked up hard, we're going to have redo this.""



It was refreshing seeing a *negative* design experience, being directly called out."
Chip and Potato,Pretty much every single one of these home renovation shows has been like this. The shoddiest work for the most amount of money possible. Much older shows weren't this way but they were the fixer upper style shows where the guy would walk you through how to fix things in the house. Once the reality TV show crap took hold it was all down hill. [There's an episode of the simpsons](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Hurricane_Neddy) which really showcases what happens when people who don't know how to build houses build houses.
Chip and Potato,This Old House Supremacy
Chip and Potato,"The thing I hate about these makeover shows is the arbitrary fake deadline. I can understand having a hard budget, you can only spend so much an episode.

But when you rush construction, shit absolutely goes wrong."
Chip and Potato,"Maybe they will start to crack down on the rest of the industry.  The allegations against that one show (different couple hosting it, not chip & joanna) are not at all uncommon in the industry of home makeover shows."
Chip and Potato,[deleted]
Chip and Potato,"After watching several shows like this me and wife agreed to do a reno on our home, our budget was 50k. We went to a home design expo and got several business cards from several companies that seemed like they did the type of work we saw on TV, even their Instagrams were all photographs of nice work looked like magazine quality stuff. We picked three contractors to come out and give us a bid, here's where we almost just gave up. The companies that were coming out turned out to just be designers, even though they came off like contractors they were not, I'm betting that this TV couple is the same. They pitch you this idea, show you Instagram photos and then hit you with a high quote. All three of the bids we got were over a 100k, way out of our budget for a kitchen remodel, removal of two walls, new rear French doors and paint. Non of these companies even took out a tape measure, write any notes down, no checking prices, they just threw out a price and asked for 1/2 down. Shocked by this and determined to get the work done I started looking online and researching and found out that all these companies you see on the shows or on your local TV commercials don't do the work,  they subcontract the entire project out to other companies. It seems in this case one of the subcontractors made off with the cash and left both couples hanging. I ended up finding an actual licenced contractor to do the exact job I wanted how I wanted for my budget and once we got to trusting him actually added more work."
Chip and Potato,"Slightly off topic, I remember hearing all the horror stories about that show ""Pimp my Ride"".
They modified people's cars with the most outrageous upgrades. Eg. Popcorn machines built in to the car, large screen tv's etc... 
When people saw their modified cars, they hated it, but they were forced by the producers and the car modifiers to act shocked and excited about seeing their shitty cars with shitty upgrades."
Chip and Potato,"This seems to be the case with the property brothers as well, they outsource and it‚Äôs never as rosey as portrayed on tv.  Many times the homeowner is left to fix the issues with the same
Contractors or find new ones‚Ä¶"
Chip and Potato,"How many other shows like this did the homeowners pay the full reno costs? Like, shouldn‚Äôt the labor be part of the show‚Äôs budget? A homeowner can pay if they want marble or hardwood but these costs seem nuts to be on a show that earns money for its producers."
Chip and Potato,Same thing was reported about the Love It Or List It show on HGTV.  They basically put a bandaid on the issues and don‚Äôt dive deep if there is a problem.

I remember them cutting to him shingling a roof looking like he's on the verge of heat stroke and I thought to myself ""either he's been running around the block all morning Or that man's actually been roofing."""
Chip and Potato,"How can people not be over these shows by now?  The market is saturated with these couple designer/builder dream makers that overpromise and under deliver.  The formula seems a bit stale, but they still try to build whole networks around it."

Chip and Potato,Woah!!! I just read the whole thing and it‚Äôs INSANE!!! Like every homeowners worst nightmare.
Chip and Potato,Do your homework folks. 40k for a full kitchen guy should‚Äôve been the first red flag that these 2 were full of shit.
Chip and Potato,"My daughter and I have watched some of the shows with this couple, where they have been renovating their schoolhouse for themselves and their ten million kids.  Okay. I dunno how many kids they actually have, but that isn‚Äôt the point anyway.  I can‚Äôt quite nail it down, but there is just something about them that really seems less than genuine.  Like, they kind of get into period appropriate finishes and stuff.  But, then do a really self aggrandizing project where they bring in an artist to do oil paintings of their whole family.  Like not one portrait of the entire family to hang over a fireplace or something.  But rather, individual portraits of each kid. Dressed in turn of the century costumes.  The scale of these paintings was crazy, like five feet by ten feet or something.  The artist did an incredible job, but the whole thing was weird.  All of the painting were hung in a single room, like it was the fucking hall of presidents.  I can‚Äôt even imagine the cost.  Yet, this couple tries to do budget / crafty projects for some things to appear folksy.   I guess if you can afford to have an artist come in and paint larger than life portraits of all of your family members, hey own it.  I suppose we know, from the article, how they manage such extravagances."
Chip and Potato,Why do these people all have seventy jillion children?
Chip and Potato,Sounds like their show needs a‚Ä¶ makeover
Chip and Potato,"I feel like if I was letting these people renovate my house and profit from turning it into a show, I would want a contract that basically says ‚Äúyou will complete all the work and I will pay no more than $x‚Äù. 

If a homeowner goes over budget, they can pull back and change plans. The show probably just charged ahead and said ‚Äúit costs what it costs‚Äù. 

Not to mention damage on top of that‚Ä¶sheesh."
Chip and Potato,I also wonder about families gifted homes through those ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù shows like are they suddenly going to be able to afford the taxes on that property?  So many questions
Chip and Potato,I watched one episode where these people did their own home and that looked sketchy at best...as well as ugly.  Whenever I watch these shows it is with a grain of salt (or two).
Chip and Potato,Those people have very punchable faces.
Chip and Potato,Those two just rub me the wrong way. They just come off as so wholesome that it has to be fake.
Chip and Potato,Boondocks did this joke over 15 years ago.
Chip and Potato,These makeover shows always downplay just how cheaply and quickly they can complete jobs as well as the quality of their work. I have a family member that was the recipient of an Extreme Makeover Home Edition house.
Chip and Potato,"I mean that's practically every light residential contractor these days. They think they're hot shit, quoting $150/hr for labor and shit, and they're getting away with it because boomers are refinancing their houses. That's why millennials are having to do everything ourselves. You can't find good help for less than thousands of dollars, so the only option is to learn it yourself on the internet and steal the materials list off an itemized quote."
Chip and Potato,It seems to me they used these contracts to finance that huge school project they did. When you‚Äôre paying that much and all you get are IKEA cabinets for your kitchen? Omg
Chip and Potato,Not surprised. Most of these house flip shows are run by designers and not actual contractors. Some of the shows will actually show the contractor but pretend he's an employee of the hosts instead of a separate company.
Chip and Potato,The Money Pit
Chip and Potato,You got Punk‚Äôd!
Chip and Potato,[removed]
Chip and Potato,Oh no! Anyway.
Chip and Potato,I'm surprised it wasn't due to an overdose of shiplap.
Chip and Potato,They are reality TV stars not professional contractors. I do a lot of work for Allison and Ari (Windy City Rehab) they‚Äôve told me several stories about some of these diy personalities. Just give the editor enough footage and he‚Äôll make you look like an expert.
Chip and Potato,damn i hate when they cancel homemakeover reality tv shows
Chip and Potato,Any actual professional designer will tell you they are garbage and brainwash people.
Chip and Potato,Am I the only one who thinks a 25K USD budget for renovating a kitchen is a lot?
Chip and Potato,Not the good Christians they made themselves out to be huh
Chip and Potato,"It‚Äôs all that shiplap!!! 
And wtf is the Magnolia Network? 
Grossss"
Chip and Potato,Thats true
Chip and Potato,Body after body crashing through shit wood.
Chip and Potato,"I've been waiting for this kind of stuff from them. I NEVER trusted them to begin with. For some reason I can't believe anything Joanna says. Something about her just never sat right. Chip seems to act like an idiot on purpose to make himself look like an affable handyman or something, and never bought that either."
Chip and Potato,"I‚Äôve been waiting SO patiently for this couple‚Äôs uptight ship hit a turn it couldn‚Äôt handle. I hope their enterprise sinks slowly and publicly. They capitalized on toxic consumerism at the expense of our planet, and they colonized themselves to do it. I hope their children can break their cycles. Bless.

Edit: If y‚Äôall think I typed this for anyone but myself, you‚Äôre mistaken. I hope all influencers that benefit from any fast-trend disappear from the internet. We are out of time to prevent colonialism from destroying the planet. All we can do now is put out fires and pray for the best. I‚Äôm glad this particular fire is dying out. Hmph."
Chip and Potato,chip and joanna are trashy people anyways....
Chip and Potato,What is the Magnolia Network? We must be pretty far down the list of channels.
Chip and Potato,"Chip and Joanna are total frauds, everything is fake except for Chip's stringy, greasy hair."
Chip and Potato,Ah that‚Äôs such a bummer if true. I really enjoyed the series. Her style is really unique.
Chip and Potato,Get Hillary in there to ask for more money.
Chip and Potato,Wow‚Ä¶ remember msn messenger?
Chip and Potato,These Fucking sick people need to be held accountable

Well-Intended Love,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Well-Intended Love,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Well-Intended Love,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Well-Intended Love,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de L√©a (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de L√©a is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Well-Intended Love,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Well-Intended Love,Severance show
Well-Intended Love,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Well-Intended Love,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Well-Intended Love,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Well-Intended Love,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Well-Intended Love,"I don‚Äôt care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn‚Äôt have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it‚Äôs fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Well-Intended Love,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Well-Intended Love,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Well-Intended Love,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Well-Intended Love,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? üò©

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Well-Intended Love,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Well-Intended Love,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. üòÖ 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Well-Intended Love,Luckily haven‚Äôt seen a single one of these lol
Well-Intended Love,I highly disagree about Heels.. it was a well written show with good drama.
Well-Intended Love,A worst shows of 2021 list is incomplete without Apple TV's Invasion included.
Well-Intended Love,I will not stand for Heels slander.
Well-Intended Love,I'm not entirely convinced half of these shows aren't made up.
Well-Intended Love,"i had to sit thru Sex/Life. Wife loved it, for me every minute was torture."
Well-Intended Love,"I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin. It was canceled the same day it was released (hyperbole).

Also, where are Wheel Of Time and Foundation? Again, I enjoyed both, but I spent a considerable amount of time on both subs and both series are very divisive 

Heels doesn't belong on this list. A Best of 2021 series..

I agree with Yasuke. I was expecting historical fiction that made me Google a whole bunch of terms, but instead we got some science fiction junk. Did have a great soundtrack."
Well-Intended Love,"Never heard of Them but it's got a great iMDB score. I don't know if I mind a little ripping off, that's how new frontiers are explored. There wouldn't be a lot of great bands if they never ripped off Black Sabbath."
Well-Intended Love,"Katla is fine imo.

Invasion and Cowboy Bebop deserve to be mentioned on this list."
Well-Intended Love,Wheel of time for me. Expected and wanted better.
Well-Intended Love,"Gossip girl reboot was so painful. I would argue that *some* of the case is talented. The actor playing Julien makes me want to stab myself with her delivery. Max is like Chuck bass lite. Audrey is like only the nice parts of blair with none of the spice. There‚Äôs not as much plotting which is what made the original so much campy fun. I think they need more monet and Luna to inject some life into this thing. I feel like zoya julien and Obie and aki don‚Äôt have much charisma to speak of 

Also I literally couldn‚Äôt  believe how cringe the writing/ dialogue on sex/ life was. I‚Äôm shocked I finished either of these shows but I was couch bound for a period of time so that‚Äôs probably why"
Well-Intended Love,"lol Didn't even know there's a remake of I Know What You Failed at Last Scream Ripoff.

Speaking of which, that wasn't even a great movie to begin with. I don't know why anyone would bother to remake it."
Well-Intended Love,Definitely agree with Katla. The first episodes I was hooked because you want to find out how and why these things are happening. But the season falls apart more and more with each episode and characters doing incredibly incredibly stupid shit.
Well-Intended Love,Lee Pace is solely responsible for Foundation not being on this list. It should be though.
Well-Intended Love,The most remarkable thing about this list is that Foundation and Invasion are not on it.
Well-Intended Love,"Thankfully haven‚Äôt seen these. And the ones I know of, I actively avoided. The worst show I watched was Nine Perfect Strangers. Couldn‚Äôt even finish it."
Well-Intended Love,Have a feeling the 4400 reboot will make this list when it comes out. Only saw Katla was hyped for it due to who was involved but just your average Netflix/SVOD drama.
Well-Intended Love,"I know it's not a new show, just a new season, but Snowpiercer season 3 has been pretty disappointing. First three episodes were okay, then five where basically nothing happens, and now one moderately good one leading to the season finale which just looks like it's going back to the first season."
Well-Intended Love,"I thought Gossip Girl was entertaining as hell, and I enjoyed having the Hawaiian setting of I Know What You Did Last Summer on in the background as I was doing other things. There's way worse stuff out there. Like Invasion or The 4400 reboot."
Well-Intended Love,"My full round-up of 2021 television (including this post):

*Thank you guys so much!* üíï"
Well-Intended Love,Book of boba fett started in December right?  Lol
Well-Intended Love,did only watch katla from the list. i wouldnt say one of the worst but that review couldnt be more agreeable. writers sucked badly about a good premise and cast did really bad job on this.
Well-Intended Love,"Wondering what Sex/Life would be like had it bee made in the 80s and if Patricia Rozema directed all episodes. Maybe it's the times, but shows about a woman's rock phase now has less bite than it did forty years ago. 

Also, another friend of mine tweeted about how Sarah Shahi plays a psych major but can't figure out her basic bitch of a husband which is accurate."
Well-Intended Love,"Yasuke instead of being what it should have been - probably something like Rurouni Kenshin, wanted to be Samurai Seven and just couldn't make it."
Well-Intended Love,I actually watched I Know What You Did Last Summer and even enjoyed most of it in a so bad it's funny way for the most part but the ending was just offensively stupid.
Well-Intended Love,I don't think I've even heard of a single one of those.
Well-Intended Love,This is literally the first time I've ever heard anything negative about it.
Well-Intended Love,"Definitely. Heels is a gem with a 8.1 score on IMDB after 6.2K votes. Ace, Wild Bill, Jack and Crystal are interesting characters with nice tension between some of them and the plot, which feels authentic, made me very invested."
Well-Intended Love,Nor will I sit for it
Well-Intended Love,"If you only use reddit as proof, then any book adaptation is going to be garbage. Outside of the diehard book fans, wheel of time did really well. It had good reviews and great viewership. Even the ratings are good when you consider the fact that diehard book fans brigaded and gave one star reviews"
Well-Intended Love,">I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin

Not even close.  Yasuke was clearly worse."
Well-Intended Love,"It's not really a rip off, black horror is a popular genre now. Jordan Peele is not the only person that can make black horror films."
Well-Intended Love,"They could've at least not titled it ""Them"" considering there's a recent release called ""Us"". Like if you're going to rip off Black Sabbath you probably wouldn't want to call yourself Dark Saturday."
Well-Intended Love,i agree with invasion.
Well-Intended Love,Yep.  It‚Äôs one of the worst shows I‚Äôve ever watched.  And I‚Äôve watched a lot of cheap sci fi/fantasy made in the 80s & 90s.
Well-Intended Love,"Agreed. My expectations were tempered as I knew cuts would have to be made.  But they introduced entirely new scenes, rewrote character personality and motivations, and switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

It was an expensive, poorly constructed vehicle to promote The Message."
Well-Intended Love,"Second this, because from all those in the list above, I expected shit, and we got shit.

Wheel of time with its budget and potential was probably the biggest let down."
Well-Intended Love,"The 4400 reboot has been out actually, it premiered last year in October, I believe.

I saw maybe one and a half episodes and uhh... Well, personally, I just hated the dialogue, can't comment on much else as I didn't get very far :D"
Well-Intended Love,"Giving ""worst performance"" to a 6 year old is certainly an opinion lmao"
Well-Intended Love,"It‚Äôs almost a bit disrespectful regardless of how good the film is to force that semantic ‚ÄúUs and Them‚Äù connection, normally reserved for spiritual sequels, to a film they have no relation to, purely for marketing reasons.

It reminds me of a book I read where a superhero called Battery (because she charges energy) is forced to take on a partner who calls themselves Assault, purely to completely change the meaning of Battery‚Äôs identity through the automatic ‚ÄúAssault & Battery‚Äù association."
Well-Intended Love,"For a second I thought I was on the Witcher sub cause everything u described happened with the Witcher lol.

>	switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

The only difference being that the achievements were mostly given to one character, Yennefer. So much achievements and character arcs were given to her that folks speculate there is some [self insert](https://reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/rwhzzh/the_show_is_in_love_with_yennefer_and_it_will/) going on with the showrunner. It probably also doesn‚Äôt help she said Yennefer is her favorite. The cherry on top is that I wish the only change they made was giving her so many achievements and character arcs, they also decided to just completely change her character from the books.

Season 2 is 90% made up with the first episode being the only one that is somewhat based on the short story from the first book. The rest is I kid you not all made up. Even the ‚Äúdeathless mother‚Äù, which is a huge character in S2, doesn‚Äôt even exist in the book. To add insult to injury it was the showrunner‚Äôs second time promising the season this time would be a close adaptation with little to no original content. With s3 coming she is once again promising the same thing on her twitter lol.

Edit: linked one thread talking about it"
Well-Intended Love,"Honestly, I couldn't look past them cutting out the boat training montage. It was my fav part of book one lol."
Well-Intended Love,[deleted]
Well-Intended Love,What‚Äôs wrong with honesty? Not like he said it to the girl just gave his opinion.
Well-Intended Love,"lol i don't know if you've seen this series, but if you did, i don't know *how* you could and this kid's performance not standout to you because of how atrocious everything was everytime he appeared on screen. 

there were even a few memes of the kid on twitter. lol. everytime he had to deliver a line the entire flow of the show just crumbled. worst child actor I've ever seen."
Well-Intended Love,"I did read Cavill has supposedly negotiation for more story control, and he said he intends to keep it closer to the book.  We'll see.

Unfortunately, WOT has no actor or celebrity with enough clout to do the same."
Well-Intended Love,The showrunner shoved in filler for over 25% of the season.  And the filler did nothing to drive the plot or make the adaptation better for tv/visual medium etc.
Well-Intended Love,"Great review, will definitely check it out"
Well-Intended Love,"New Girl higher than Arrested Development and Always Sunny? Sir, we need to do emergency surgery on your funny bone."
Well-Intended Love,You'd probably enjoy Married With Children.
Well-Intended Love,"i love New Girl, one of my favorite shows of all time, but it had bad seasons 

season 3 leans too dramatic and suffers as a result 

season 6 is mediocre and season 7 is just plain bad from start to finish"
Well-Intended Love,"how i met your father - i do like sophie, sid, and ellen but the rest of the characters - valentina and charile are terrible and should be written off 

i don't get much chemistry between sophie and jesse .......in fact i think sophie and sid had better chemistry in that brief conversation they had by the vending machines

i honestly thought sid's fiance was going to reveal she was cheating on him given how weird she was acting 

i'm glad it was only 10 episodes long. too many sitcoms make a bloated 20 + season and maybe half are decent/good. 

the biggest changes i would make are : get rid of the Kim Cattrall future segments except 2 episodes per season - the beginning and final episode of the season 

and lastly, as above, i would write out valentina and charlie - they're both boring af"
Well-Intended Love,"> The IT Crowd is actually the funniest sitcom ever made

I totally agree with you.

And I highly recommend The Good Place if you haven't watched it yet. The IT Crowd, The Good Place and Community are my Top 3 best sitcoms."
Well-Intended Love,Thanks for writing all this. I hope you do well in your studies.
Well-Intended Love,No Cheers nor Frasier and Friends at number 2 lol. Comedy really is subjective.
Well-Intended Love,"You could have just arranged them randomly and it would have made more sense.  Top 5 of this list is Friends, US Office, Arrested Development, Seinfeld, and Always Sunny in Philadelphia."
Well-Intended Love,Try Happy Endings if you haven't already.
Well-Intended Love,"I love Always Sunny, and i explain that its only that low bcs i havent finished it, but new girl is awsome you should watch it"
Well-Intended Love,Modern Family seems to be an appropriate recommendation after that as well.
Well-Intended Love,I will check it out thanks!
Well-Intended Love,"Yeah i can see why some people wouldnt like season 7, but to me its what those last 2 eps of himym should be, plus the ending and winston final prank were really good imo"
Well-Intended Love,"I actually really like charlie, without him i feel it would be a much more plain and boring sitcom. But yes i agree, jesse and sophie have no  chemistry, but i think it's bcs they needed more time to develop the realtionship. As it stands, they barely interact, the season spends half her plotlines with random guy drew"
Well-Intended Love,"Yeah the good place is awesome, i just didnt find it a ""conventional"" sitcome and that is why it isnt on the list"
Well-Intended Love,"I have never seen cheers or frasier, maybe i will give it a shot"
Well-Intended Love,Yeah it is. Friends is number 1 for me
Well-Intended Love,"I mean this isnt a review of this shows, this is just my opinions and biased thoughts. I do say that i really liked arrested development, for example, but just wasnt my type of humor, so while it could be objectivly better than himym, i prefer himym way more."
Well-Intended Love,"lol, charlie is plain and boring, imo"
Well-Intended Love,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, just sharing mine. Righteous Gemstones is my current favorite and I would put it on here bumping Friends out."
Well-Intended Love,I will check it out thanks!
Well-Intended Love,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm‚Äôs way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang‚Äôs blue tattoo isn‚Äôt because he‚Äôs an Avatar, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs an air nomad, and most people really don‚Äôt care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula‚Äôs character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn‚Äôt just a big explosive action scene, it‚Äôs representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he‚Äôs fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang‚Äôs stories are mature. Aang‚Äôs people are dead, he‚Äôs a child, oh and by the way he‚Äôs been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it‚Äôll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being ‚Äúthe chosen one‚Äù at age **10**.

Sokka‚Äôs plans are oftentimes stupid and don‚Äôt work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it‚Äôs because he has to learn to grow up and stop ‚Äúplaying‚Äù soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn‚Äôt before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no ‚Äúbest power‚Äù. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It‚Äôs also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it‚Äôs set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin‚Äôs comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The ‚Äúlife-bending‚Äù from the Lion-Turtle isn‚Äôt a deus ex machina, it‚Äôs a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would‚Äôve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai‚Äôs bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn‚Äôt without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don‚Äôt have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the ‚ÄúI can name ten animated shows far superior‚Äù at the end just makes it seem like you‚Äôre farming for outrage. Like it or don‚Äôt, but don‚Äôt come on to Reddit and act like you‚Äôre some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Well-Intended Love,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Well-Intended Love,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Well-Intended Love,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Well-Intended Love,"I‚Äôve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn‚Äôt stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn‚Äôt mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They‚Äôd taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there‚Äôs the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there‚Äôs The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin‚Äôs Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn‚Äôt have

The Great Divide wasn‚Äôt that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn‚Äôt have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King‚Äôs bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you‚Äôre complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn‚Äôt they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I‚Äôve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that‚Äôs where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang‚Äôs story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Well-Intended Love,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."
Well-Intended Love,Hello 30 yo guy who just found out Avatar.
Well-Intended Love,"Eh, I'm a fan of Avatar and I think it's overrated. In terms of children's cartoons (90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them), it's the GOAT, but I don't think it's the best show ever made. I don‚Äôt even think it's a masterpiece."
Well-Intended Love,">  I can name 10 right away that are far superior.

Yes, do that, at least this post will give me a watch list then."
Well-Intended Love,"I agree with you in regards to comedy, it falls in to those constant anime tropes. That was my only criticism."
Well-Intended Love,"I enjoyed it. It was definitely a kid's show as you never truly felt that the main characters were in peril.

You're right about Azula's turn to crazy being a 1 episode thing - it came on fast like in Game of Thrones when Dany turned evil for reasons to wrap up the show.

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Its Bruno!,"i have no idea what this show is about, yet I want to see it"
Its Bruno!,"I can imagine the thought process behind this show...

Mr. Netflix: People love dogs... *Throws cash in the air...* Get me more dog shows."
Its Bruno!,"nice, i am already loving it. at least its not another procedural."
Its Bruno!,Wait this isn't the Sacha Baron Cohen character? I'm out.
Its Bruno!,What did I just watch.
Its Bruno!,They cancelled Santa Clarita Diet for this?  üòµ
Its Bruno!,"This looks funny, but why bother with it?  It'll just get cancelled after a couple of seasons, right when Bruno's stuck our cold dead hearts."
Its Bruno!,Netflix can make a show out of trash!
Its Bruno!,I‚Äôm trying to figure that out too
Its Bruno!,Cancel your subscription if you disagree with the direction Netflix is heading in.
Its Bruno!,"None of the originals i enjoyed has been cancelled yet, so yeah for the mainstream, I guess"
Its Bruno!,It‚Äôs so stupid(ina good way). Good way to unwind after work.
Its Bruno!,"Cheesefest makes it sound bad though...I LOVE IT. Good writing, good acting and totally original."
Its Bruno!,"Loved it, i like the format, story moves quickly :) can't wait for s2 cuz i finished s1 in a few hours"
Its Bruno!,We loved it.  Binged it in one sitting.  I think it's genius in it's cheesiness (cheesyness?).  Cannot wait for Season 2!
Its Bruno!,"It‚Äôs awesome, just a lot of fun"
Its Bruno!,"Digging just about everything about this show so far (two episodes in). 

Most randomly excellent moment to this point goes to the kid who steals Bruno then starts dancing when his dad shows up."
Its Bruno!,Is Charlie supposed to be an amalgam of Jay and Silent Bob?
Its Bruno!,"I definitely didn't mean it in a negative fashion. It's a good cheesy. Great, even."
Its Bruno!,Same
Its Bruno!,Definitely the best kind of cheese.
Its Bruno!,"Have you seen Wilfred, it‚Äôs about an awkward young man and his neighbors dog Wilfred. It‚Äôs brilliant."
Its Bruno!,Did you watch all of it? The premise is certainly original but i am a bit worried about what kind of plot can be built here
Its Bruno!,"I have to agree. I did not know what to expect going into this show, but I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting the absurdist controlled chaos that was each episode. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a huge dog person, but the lovable yet tough pet store owners were so delightful to me."
Its Bruno!,Id watch a movie about it but not an on going about some dude and his dog.  You can only stretch that out so far.
Its Bruno!,The episodes are super short
Its Bruno!,"Right... So you'd watch a movie length version but not an 8 episode series with a combined total of 1 hour and 20 minutes?

Makes sense."
Its Bruno!,My man... John Wick
Its Bruno!,I knew I was going to like it when the command competing started. We dog owners have all been there.
Its Bruno!,This show is spot on with the personalities of New Yorkers.
Its Bruno!,"Clicked by accident. Didnt stop watching it til the whole Season was finished. Watched it 2 more times since then beginning to end. And my favorite character is the dude who says ""Everybody on the block knows""."
Its Bruno!,Honestly I'm not even a dog owner and don't plan to be but I still loved it. My dog owner friends I feel are seriously missing out.
Its Bruno!,"We binged it last night.  Could not stop laughing!  We're displaced NY'ers and we loved seeing that part of Brooklyn.  And also, Bruno is hella cute!!!"
Its Bruno!,"On episode six right now, I love their relationship.

Also, the main actor adopted his dog and loved him so much he actually created this show to show him off to the world."
Its Bruno!,It definitely isn't for everyone but it had me rolling. It reminds me somewhat of High Maintenance.
Its Bruno!,Just stumbled on this show last night and binged it in one go. The perfect show to watch with my Yorkie in my lap who's recovering from dental surgery.
Its Bruno!,Wonderful show
Its Bruno!,I would absolutely love for a couple crossover episodes where The Guy is delivering to Malcolm's buddy's house with the frenchie humping the one guy's leg. Each show could have its own episode with a shared scene from different perspectives.
Its Bruno!,[deleted]
Its Bruno!,[deleted]
Its Bruno!,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
Its Bruno!,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
Its Bruno!,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
Its Bruno!,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
Its Bruno!,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
Its Bruno!,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
Its Bruno!,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
Its Bruno!,"If it‚Äôs not a Netflix Original, it‚Äôs not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread‚Ä¶"
Its Bruno!,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner‚Ä¶ how is this a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn‚Äôt a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn‚Äôt a bad one, but it‚Äôs phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
Its Bruno!,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
Its Bruno!,Insatiable
Its Bruno!,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it‚Äôs been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
Its Bruno!,Crazyhead
Its Bruno!,Friends From College.
Its Bruno!,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
Its Bruno!,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
Its Bruno!,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
Its Bruno!,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
Its Bruno!,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
Its Bruno!,Everything ends brother
Its Bruno!,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
Its Bruno!,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
Its Bruno!,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
Its Bruno!,The Mist?
Its Bruno!,"You have to define what you mean by *ending*. I would not consider many shows on your list, e.g Mind Hunter, need an ending."
Its Bruno!,Omg guys calm the fuck down. Its just words its not gonna hurt you. go out and touch some grass or some shit

Also The Beauty and The Baker. Again, not a Netflix show but streaming."
Its Bruno!,"Sword of trust. Actually a great movie, until suddenly it ends very annoyingly & with no real resolution.

I heard that a woman who directed & wrote it died, & that's very sad but releasing it without a real ending was a total bummer."
Its Bruno!,"La Revolution and Black Spot

Still salty about those two."
Its Bruno!,You could be meta with The OA and say that they're in our world lol
Its Bruno!,"Santa Clarita Diet doesn't have a conclusive ending with all questions answered, per se, but the end of it is an ending. If they had placed ""and they lived happily ever after"" on the screen after the last scene it would function perfectly fine as an ending."

Its Bruno!,Mindhunter is just on hiatus.
Its Bruno!,the stranded was officially cancelled. i think its bruno had a nice ending and maybe we will even get new episodes since the show hasnt been cancelled.

Its Bruno!,"Its ridiculous how much cancelled unfinished shit they have.  Like I've been saying ever since they cancelled Teenage Bounty Hunters, before long, people will need a ""does the dog die dot com,"" except it will be ""does the netflix show get cancelled without a finale dot com.""  Which is exactly what this thread is about in a way.     
         
Ten years from now their back catalog is going to just be a complete minefield of unfished shit that you are afraid to even bother starting.  Not to mention, who wants to start a new netflix show in its first season when the odds are that it gets cancelled are so high?"
Its Bruno!,If you're ana Amazon prime member Bosch is a fantastic series!
Its Bruno!,"I think only Bojack Horseman, OITNB and House of Cards have endings with only Bojack having a great final season.

Depending where you are it is easy AF to buy a gun."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Is this one of the episodes that was removed in 2020?
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,For some reason I expected the AR-15 to be bigger. That looks like a toy gun. How underwhelming.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,I will burn you alive like the last bitch who crossed me!?
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,I didn't realize until I got to the end of the episode that they had literally just dedicated the whole episode to that anecdote lol

which episode is that?"

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,like two ships passing in the night
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,South Park straddles that line pretty well imho
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,They do end up going to a gun show in the episode. It doesn't end up being any easier.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Congress seriously needs to open up the background check system to the public. It only tells the gun store Yes (this person can buy a gun), No (this person can't buy a gun), and Hold (don't sell the person a gun, we need to investigate a little more).

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,South park makes fun of and insults you for caring about either side of an argument. Not exactly the same thing
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,That's not true. The private sellers at the gun show are fine with not doing a check but want to charge them double so they threaten the sellers. The point is to show that there are checks but it's still not hard to get one. Frank is deranged and he owns plenty of guns in the show
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Thank you. Going to watch the rest now. It‚Äôs one of my favorite episodes ever
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"I did a rewatch (on Hulu) recently and don't remember any of the gun episodes. 

Entirely possible I just wasn't paying as much attention as I thought."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Lol, very loosely. Most of them spend maybe 2-3 minutes total talking about the specific episode, but that's what makes it great. The episode is just a starting point and you have zero fucking clue where they'll end up."

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Paul Walter Hauser is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. He‚Äôs so fucking good and needs to be protected at all costs. He chooses the best projects; to go from I Think You Should Leave to this and just murder every scene he‚Äôs in is remarkable.  A virtuoso that remains under appreciated.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,so sorta like Mindhunters? I'm in
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,The serial killers voice gets me laughing everytime üòÖ
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,You‚Äôd be cluggin‚Äô a few cans if you were a serial killer who‚Äôs only friend was an undercover snitch.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Apple is on a roll!   I think this Is another great new series!   Loving both Egerton and Hauser in their roles!!

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,I‚Äôm not usually into ‚Äúcat and mouse‚Äù thrillers anymore but I‚Äôm a sucker for Lehane‚Äôs style
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"I'm seeing ""teleplay by"", ""written by"", ""story by"", ""screenplay by"" all listed in his writing credits. Can someone please give me a quick breakdown of those in comparison to each other?

I'm assuming the screenplay and teleplay are the same thing, just named for medium (films and TV respectively).

There's also ""based on the novel by"" and ""novel"", but those are a bit more self explanatory."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Same!
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Definitely is!!!
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"When I first saw him playing the Juggalo kid on It's Always Sunny, I would've never imagined he'd turn out to be such a great and versatile actor."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Lehane could definitely bring that similar atmosphere
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,It sounds like Barney from *The Simpsons*.

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Teleplay (also called the ""series bible"") is an overrall rundown of the whole season. It describes the plot points, character arcs, setting, etc."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"He wrote and sang the theme tune for four of the shows he was in, something that got satirised on *Little Britain*."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,After finishing *Monk* and *Psych* I was casting about for another mystery show. I found *New Tricks* and have been watching it religiously. A large part of the show's charm is the fantastic performance Waterman brings to the show.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"*I could be so good for you.*

RIP."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs passed, but it has stuck in my craw how cavalier he was about his abuse to ex-wife Rula Lenska. On Piers Morgan he said ‚Äú It's not difficult for a woman to make a man hit her. She certainly wasn't a beaten wife, she was hit and that‚Äôs different‚Äù. I hope he took time to atone for that before he died."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Off to flog second hand coffins for arfur üòÅ
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,RIP
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Surprises me that his r√¥le in the original ‚ÄòLife and loves of a she-devil‚Äô hasn‚Äôt really been mentioned.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Noooorrr!
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Time to do a rewatch of Minder. RIP.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Mind how ya go Tel.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Weirdly, though this seems to happen a lot to me, I have been rewatching Inspector Morse & last week's episode had Alum Armstrong(Brian-New Tricks) as a sub for Innocent. So I had looked it up to see if he was still around & of course the rest of the cast came up.  Dennis Waterman was the first one I clicked on."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Write da feem toon, sing da feem toon"
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Absolutely agree! I loved his character in New Tricks.  Damn, this is actually making me sad.  He was fantastic."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"If you like those 3, try:

Mr. & Mrs. Murder

Death in Paradise (it goes through several lead detectives, if you don't like one try a few seasons later when it changes)

Mallorca Files

Murder in Suburbia

Agatha Raisin

Elementary"
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"There is another vibe he specifically brought to *New Tricks,* which is that he's basically playing an older version of George Carter, [the character he played on *The Sweeney*](https://youtu.be/KS1fICIkUYQ?t=9) (kinda/sorta/not really the UK equivalent to *Starsky & Hutch,* and the show that *Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes* were riffing off). The current show most like *New Tricks* to me is *Death in Paradise* (Britbox); the latest season (11) is running on PBS at the moment. Like *New Tricks,* they do the cast-turnover thing. *L&O: UK* (IMDbTV has some of the seasons) ain't bad, either, if you're into comparative viewing and spotting *Doctor Who/Battlestar Galactica* actors. :D

If you need more not-ITV cozies, I'd recommend looking at *The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency* on HBO/HBO Max, and for Blue-Sky-ish shows, try *White Collar,* *Burn Notice,* or *Suits,* though those are less mystery-centered. I also liked *Rizzoli & Isles* and *In Plain Sight,* but ymmv. I also love *Leverage* (IMDbTV)*.*  SF alternatives to *Psych* and *Monk* would be *Chuck, Eureka,* and *Warehouse 13.*"
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,I‚Äôm watching it a second time now. It‚Äôs completely addictive!
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Yikes! That kind of ruins him for me entirely.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Rewatched the series on youtube this morning, He was really good in it. Hadn't seen it since the 80s.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ofSjDcA7zE&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ofSjDcA7zE&t=1s)"
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Thanks for the suggestions. Looks like I‚Äôll have to add Brit Box to my viewing options.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,These are all excellent suggestions. Mr. & Mrs. Murder and Murder in Suburbia are two shows that are never talked about. I would add Shakespeare & Hathaway to that list.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Thank you for the recommendations!
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"If you like those shows, check out *Castle*."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"There's a very different mind-set to that age group in ways we do not tolerate today. That is not to say all men of his age would, as there are many who never, ever would, but there are those that do."

Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,2022 coming for celebrities
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Jesus, the cause of death:

>His family said Denny died Monday in Santa Barbara, CA, of a rare spontaneous splenic artery rupture.

And perhaps the worse thing I've read today is from this [scholarly article](https://theultrasoundjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13089-015-0026-4):

>It is usually asymptomatic until it ruptures.

Oh, wonderful! One day you're alive, well, and living, and then suddenly your splenic artery bursts and you're dead! Why are our bodies so fragile..."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,People dying young is very sad. I hope their family has all the comfort in the world in these times. I can't imagine losing a relative that young it has to be horrible.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Article says he was on Curb Your Enthusiasm, but I couldn't find anything on his IMDB or Wikipedia. Any clues what episode?"
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,RIP
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,This is getting ridiculous
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,Howard stern 2022
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Between Meat Loaf, Louie Anderson, and this young man this year is reminding me a lot of 2016."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Calling him a celebrity is a stretch, but rest in peace my man."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"Most of our collective popular culture comes from the 1970s and 1980s. And as people who made it big in the 1970s and 1980s start to hit their 60s and 70s on top of many of them who were not very kind to their bodies, we're going to start to see the effects of this. 

Honestly, due to everything having a much longer shelf life in the public consciousness these days, every year that passes is going to have more and more celebrity deaths that make us pause."
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,It looks like a bunch of his roles were bit parts. Assuming same goes for Curb. Uncredited or a brief flash in the end credits.
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,It got cut
Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed,"I know, I can't believe it!   
I can't believe people are dying. They should just stop it already...even if just for a year so we can have a chance to breath a little."

If you are on IMDB, watch out"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Why would anyone watch this show without Tim Gunn (or even Heidi Klum)? He is the heart and soul of the show. This isn't The Voice -- you can't just bring in a new person. People watched the show specifically to see Tim Gunn. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",One minute you‚Äôre in and the next you‚Äôre out
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Hopefully he'll still be able to direct Guardians of the Galaxy 3.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",damn now I can't do my Tim Gunn impersonation when I watch
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Well I think any reasonable person would. For all the money Bravo makes off of the garbage they spew out, you'd think they might want to spend a little on some actual quality television, but I guess not. Oh well, I'll just watch Heidi and Tim's new show on Amazon. It sounds like it's going to be exactly the same, only now people can actually buy the clothes on the show, and the designers can make some money."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Tim Gunn is probably one of my favorite parts of the show... I will definitely switch to watching the series on Amazon. I was getting tired of PR anyways, but its just one of those shows I record to watch when I need to watch stuff on the elliptical. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Haven't seen this show in a while but... have to say... as a straight male that understood 0 about women's fashion, this show was one of my favorites, primarily due to Klum, Gunn and Kors. All three are very smart and in many ways very human/humble. All are hard workers. They're very good examples to everyone including some of the bratty contestants, the majority of whom have no f'ing clue what it takes to make it big. Yet you have these three exemplary figures who give it to you like it is: be kind, be hardworking, and be resilient."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","This is a terrible article. I haven‚Äôt seen anything this poorly written in awhile. It‚Äôs like a high schooler wrote it. Numbered paragraphs? ‚ÄúAdroit query‚Äù yikes. 

Calling Tim Gunn dapper is redundant. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","somewhat off topic, i think tim gunn is a character on a show my daughter watches but i can't think of the name"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Well honestly PR was/is dying. It‚Äôs way too run by the producers and they were all smoking crack letting people stay for drama not talent. I stopped watching a few seasons ago. 

I will watch anything Tim Gunn makes. I loved his solo show. He and Heidi are pure gold together. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I hope Nina goes with them and they bring back Michael kors !!
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",The first theme on the new show should be black jack and hookers.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Auf Wiedersehen!
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Is it just me or did the show go downhill the second it switched from Bravo to Lifetime? The channel made the show more about feelings, than the clothing and then they had the whole thing from the models point of view and just completely screwed up the show. I watched it like clockwork all of the first six seasons from start to finish with my dad as soon as it switched over we just stopped watching after a couple episodes. Shame. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",">As she does in performance, Dailey waited ‚Äî alert and alive to possibility, without stealing focus ‚Äî until it time came to pose each adroit query with just the right tone.

... Was this written by a bot?"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I mean a 60% paycut for them is still probably massively worth it to the rest of us but I get it. The show wasn't as popular as it was too so of course funding is gonna come down a bit. They likely hoped they'd step down to see if new hosts could refresh the series. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Heidi really let herself go in that pic
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I'd agree to a 60% pay cut for 60% less work. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Thank you for putting a good summary in your title.   Upvote for you!
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Klum and Mr. Gunn are established brands with a going rate. If they continue their previous performance, they‚Äôll get that rate.

Bravo gave that low ball offer to get Klum and Gunn to leave, that‚Äôs it."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Oh wow deoppig this show.  Tim Gunn and Heidi are the reason i watch it.  Hae All Stars because they arent on it. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Auf wiedersehen (whimpering and crying)
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",That article was written strangely.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Heidi Klum has really let herself go 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","I think for Project Runway to be taken seriously as the earlier seasons (I know) than it needed a rework. I don't mind Heidi and Tim leaving, at this point it was just mall clothes, a game show, and a sweat shop for Heidi delicates.  If this show is supposed to be an opportunity for fresh designers to make it into the business (like Christian Siriano), then it needs to be revitalized.

Heidi and Tim new show seems right up their alley and what Project Runway (currently) is anyway.  "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","So glad they went with the Amazon offer, they‚Äôll have a bigger budget and audience. They definitely need to bring Nina & Michael back. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","I did not know he left the show, and now I am immensely sad and will likely no longer watch it. (I‚Äôm sure everyone else cares to know that, lol)"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","So instead he took a 100% one. :)

*edit calm down people, it's a joke"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I thought it was because he was getting ready for the next King Crimson tour...
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Damn if somebody asked me to take a paycut I‚Äôd still be making zero dollars. I make nothing. I have nothing. All I have is Spider-Man.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Wow, Heidi is looking a bit rough"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Well at least they both got the same pay cut rather than... you know, the pay gap thing."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",This is fascinating.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",The author of this article needs an editor. Badly.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","‚Äú60?  How about 100% bitches, I‚Äôm out!‚Äù"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",makes my decision to quit viewing the series miles easier. also lack of time during the week
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",This article had so many errors it was difficult to read.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Story is in the headline.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I wonder who the new hosts are going to be? Alissa Milano?
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Haha. What the fuck were they thinking even making this offer? They probably just laughed and walked out. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I watched this show just to see Tim.  
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Guess they couldn‚Äôt make it work. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",That‚Äôs ridiculous Tim Gunn makes that show and hedi is fabulous. Karli Kloss is such a mediocre model who isn‚Äôt really recognized for fashion.. I‚Äôm  definitely done with project runway
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","My god, that was a terribly written article in need of a proofreader (corrected)"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Heidi Klum has let herself go. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Wow, Heidi Klum sure looks different"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Man, Heidi Klum really let herself go."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Wow Heidi looks different 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I was always not wondering about this.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",The show really was getting very stale. Although I'd blame that more on the stupid decision to stretch it to and hour and half than anything.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",MAKE IT WEEEERRRKKK. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Man, i can still hear him say ""Designers, make it work"""
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Make it work without me then.

"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Can't blame him for that decision.

"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",This skit alone from MadTV shows how integral both of their characters are to the show https://youtu.be/olLeSPzPta8. Without them and their quirky personalities you couldn‚Äôt make something as funny as this.

"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Make it work Tim 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Good for them to go over to Amazon. Smart decision. Project Runway will struggle without both of them.

"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Heidi has really let herself go...
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Super sad, but agree with their reasoning.

They are worth it.

Fuck the suits.
"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",So what happens to that 60% pay cut. Does it go to the ceos grimy pockets or do they actually put it to good use for production?
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Project what?

they get paid. HOW MUCH?  


wow. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Tim Gunn is on my top 5 list of people to hang out with for a day. I‚Äôd love to walk Manhattan with him and just give snarky comments about people and their clothes. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Jesus, Heidi Klum is looking rough. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",So instead he took a 100% pay cut?
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Gunn has the most stereotypically wonderful middle aged gay guuuuuuuuuyyyyy voice. It amuses me.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Not because the last twelve seasons were terrible?
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Kill everything we love with greed. Got it. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Well, won‚Äôt be watching that anymore."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Shows like this beyond 1-2 seasons really have no point and they're not a real competition cause it's scripted to get ratings anyways.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",So he took a 100% pay cut instead? That's some damn fine businessing. He should be a professional businesser. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","He‚Äôs named after a gunn but gay as fuck, ironic"
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","So how do they show them, well we will quit and save you even more money. Lol yeah that showed them. Like the show can't go on without them."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I hate Heidi
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Cry me a river üôÑ when you have thousands or millions in your bank account and your net worth more than that, a ‚Äúpay cut‚Äù won‚Äôt hurt your pockets. All about ego. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Even setting Gunn aside, it's not like Heidi is an uninteresting character. Ageless German supermodel that has occasionally unintentionally hilarious phrasing? Come on."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Even when one of the contestants impersonated him behind his back Tim Gunn LOVED IT.
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","I dont watch reality shows at all, but when I was younger, my sister and I watched this show and Gunn was easily the best part. She and I would quote him all the time. I still remember him fondly."
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",Make it work I guess?
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I agree. They are both awesome. He really feels like a caring teacher and she was kinda like the evil boss but done in a fun light spirted way. They are the life of the show. 
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","My wife watches the show and sometimes I‚Äôm around too, Tim Gunn was the only part of the show that I liked. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa","Right?? Like that's not my area of interest at all but when my sister was binging through I sat to watch because he was that charming. 

Network can't seem to make it work. "
"Heidi, bienvenida a casa",I agree; he‚Äôs the best! And Heidi is awesome too.
Will and Grace,"I don‚Äôt remember there being a lot but I‚Äôm sure there was some prior to the first episode airing.

The show went to great lengths to not be gay for a show with two leads playing gay roles. They were almost never seen in any type of physical relationship (the first gay kiss was done for comedic effect). I recall reading somewhere many people still thought that by the end of the first season, Will would see ‚Äúthe error of his ways‚Äù and end up with Grace."
Will and Grace,"Was there a backlash? I never heard about it.

If so, what was the backlash about?"
Will and Grace,"It was very popular. Jack and Karen more so.
It has held up terribly and most of the jokes are so mean spirited and elitist."
Will and Grace,None. One of the biggest shows on air at the time. Rightfully so it's friggin hilarious!
Will and Grace,"The backlash to Ellen coming out is basically revisionism that everyone now believes.

Her sitcom was dropping in ratings so they did the coming out episode. They announced it was coming and Ellen got magazine covers and lots of interviews so they got higher ratings for a while but not long after they dropped again so the show got cancelled.

Somehow this has now turned into she had a successful sitcom, came out as gay on it and because of that it got cancelled."
Will and Grace,"I was in high school when it came out. I never knew or heard any backlash about it. Everyone I knew watched it and loved it. I can't watch reruns now, it makes me cringe."
Will and Grace,Only backlash I remember was at the awful ‚Äúlets have a baby together‚Äù storyline.
Will and Grace,"Overall I don't really remember a lot of backlash. Just flashes here and there.

I'd see it mentioned as an example of the 'moral decay,' but that was really rare in my particular universe.

Beyond that, I remember there was some criticism how Will just didn't seem gay. (This wasn't in reference to tropey stereotypes like Jack's campiness).

He wasn't physical with his partners, and we viewers we're told that he was gay. Oh there were set-ups where he was put into very safe situations like sitting at a table with another man to as if they were on a date, but nothing more.

I don't really remember the later episodes so that may have changed, but that above was in reference to it's beginning run."
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,"There wasn't anything particularly special about the show. The joke was more about the girl having the ""gay best friend"" trope and how the actor of Will wasn't actually gay. But this is all very minor, very minor, the show was popular and him being was more of a character in a sitcom not like trying to be representative. The show was completely uncontroversial. LGBT representation wasn't a at all an important topic in network TV at the time, and to a degree this was just a show with a bit of a quirk is all.

In other words, there's nothing there"
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,It was controversial but Ellen came first and really drew a backlash.  Conservatives complained about Will and Grace but I think all the attention they gave it made more liberal people watch it just to stick it to the right wingers and a lot of people just ended up liking the show.
Will and Grace,It was not a hit with bisexuals at alllll
Will and Grace,"They went so far as having the ""gay friend"" character that a lot of shows have, even though the show was already about a gay man. Can't have our *main* gays being *too* gay now, can we?"
Will and Grace,that's what makes it funny. It's held up wonderfully imo
Will and Grace,Ah I see. I get that it‚Äôs a sitcom and in a sense they poked fun of the stereotypical ‚Äúgay lifestyle‚Äù but I imagined (especially considering the hate ellen got) that a show with main characters just being gay wouldn‚Äôt have passed well during that time.
Will and Grace,Straight white privilege and nobody dares to even consider it lol.
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,"Catholics, Christians, Bigots, homophobes, etc etc. They've been around before the 90s."
Will and Grace,"I remember hearing an interview with Eric McCormick years back where he talked about being sort of a Trojan horse.  Jack was the flamboyantly gay stereotype that was so common in sitcoms of the day, and that drew attention away from the fact that Will was also a gay man.  So people who were uncomfortable with homosexuality could watch the show and laugh at the silly gay man with his wacky antics not realizing they were growing to like and support the more down-to-earth gay man at the same time.  He said his dream was for homophobes to cheer him on when he meant a guy and cheer on them getting together and kissing before they realized what they were doing."
Will and Grace,"Sorry what!

Is there a certain way gay people have to behave to meet your standard of being gay?

My brother is gay but is a very serious and sensible character. Much more so than me. 

Not every gay person has to act flamboyant.

Stop trying to score points and get likes by making smart comments and think about your own prejudice."
Will and Grace,Ellen mostly got shit because they made it this giant marketing spectacle of her coming out. It was easy pickings for religious groups.
Will and Grace,Ellen was too serious about it. Will and Grace made it ok to laugh about it.
Will and Grace,Really? Essex in the UK in the 90s no way did I ever hear of a specific movement. It didn‚Äôt have a name as such. Not like now. Plus the amount of bullying that went on if you were even suspected of being gay. I mean not just the normal bullying like full on lynching.
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,"It also likely didn't help with how it was positioned. 

This occurs two episodes prior to the fourth (of five) season ending and basically gives people something to talk about for months between seasons. 

For Will & Grace, it was something that was kind of always there and didn't feel like a publicity stunt or ever really mattered. Nor was it about that in any extreme way, both of which I imagined helped."
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,[Stonewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) was in 1969.
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,"What does ""too gay"" mean then?"
Will and Grace,"He commented they couldn‚Äôt have someone being ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù. Which is a prejudice statement as it suggest some people are more gay than others. 

Is my brother less gay because he is a reserved character?"
Will and Grace,Many of my old school friends have subsequently come out only in the last 10 years or so due to the repression of that time in the area.
Will and Grace,It was a sarcastic commentary on the network's decision making process not the gay community.
Will and Grace,"He was criticising the network for not having a flamboyant gay lead. Having the straight man as the lead wasn‚Äôt appropriate as he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt gay‚Äù enough. 

Unless you would like to explain how else he was criticising the network? Sarcastic or not."
Will and Grace,The network and the actor that played will have literally said they made will not too gay because Ellen had gotten cancel for getting to gay
Will and Grace,One of the few revivals to make it work. I think it‚Äôs a good time to stop though
Will and Grace,"I'll miss Sean Hayes, one of the few actors to make slapstick work in the 2010s."
Will and Grace,"Good, now McCormack can get back to making other shows.

I rather enjoyed him in [Perception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714204/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10) & [Travelers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5651844/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3).

Curious to see what he takes on next..?"
Will and Grace,"Oh I'm so saddened by this, I hoped it would carry on and on."
Will and Grace,"I liked some of the new changes, like childless W&G and Beverly Leslie getting the Bobby shower treatment. Gotta have my Beverly Leslie vs. Karen. 

It will be interesting to see how W&G ends this time around."
Will and Grace,I haven't watched Will and Grace but canceling it leaves NBC only with Superstore and Brooklyn Nine Nine (The Good Place is ending as well)
Will and Grace,"Aww, I enjoyed this for what it was. I loved the original and even though this didn't really live up to it, I still had a fun time watching it and got a lot of laughs."
Will and Grace,"Oh sad, me and my BF loved watching this."
Will and Grace,"Honestly, it‚Äôs for the best. The new series never really recaptured the originality and charm of the original show."

Will and Grace,"I'm surprised it lasted that long. The revival wasn't very good. 

The same old tired jokes without the comedic timing."
Will and Grace,Fantastic.
Will and Grace,Yeah its been ok and even great sometimes imo
Will and Grace,"I think it's a great time to stop the trend of revivals, definitely.  This was about as good as they got, and it was hardly worth the effort."
Will and Grace,"I‚Äôm not sure about that. While I‚Äôve watched the revival, it just doesn‚Äôt have the spark of the first time around. A lot of their comedic timing is a bit off. Even the characters do t really click like they did the first time around.  I loved the original and am just disappointed this time."
Will and Grace,Totally! He‚Äôs the only one who nailed his character after all this time.
Will and Grace,"It got super convoluted at times, but I really liked Travelers a lot. 

The ending works rather well as closure for the series and am happy it got far enough to reach that point, but man I wish that it would have gone on for a bit longer then it did."
Will and Grace,"Seeing the name ""Travelers"" gave me flashbacks to the eight episode ABC series [Traveler](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0805668/). I remember liking it at the time, but I can barely find any footage that isn't shitty. Just thought I'd share.


Anyone else remember this thing existing?"
Will and Grace,I think he would make a good Scott Bakula replacement for a Quantum Leap revival.(if Scott Bakula doesnt want to do it)
Will and Grace,"They've got a lot in development though, and with Brooklyn 99 this year basically being a midseason replacement for the good place, it gives plenty of slots for new shows to find their spot"
Will and Grace,"And only half a season of B99 at that (they only ordered 13 episodes, unless they up the order like they did last year)."
Will and Grace,"She missed the mark the most out of everyone. In the original, Karen was subversive and cool. This time around, she played her corny and pandering. It was one of the biggest disappointments of the revival."
Will and Grace,"I‚Äôm of the opinion that most revivals are awful at best and pandering at worst. I don‚Äôt think this revival is good, but compared to most revivals it‚Äôs solid"
Will and Grace,"> A lot of their comedic timing is a bit off. 

I don't think it's them, it's because Peter Chakos isn't editing. He gave the show a very snappy, and precise rhythm that gave the dialogue a flow and helped jokes ""land"".

From what I've seen of the revival, it feels a little more like you're watching a stage play... if that makes sense."
Will and Grace,That's because you are watching old people play young characters. It's a lot easier to move around a sound stage and perform when you're younger. They arent jumping around like they were in the 90s
Will and Grace,But how many of their new shows are going to actually stick for the long run? Sunnyside seems nice.
Will and Grace,Hopefully they will extend it. I wish for a whole season though.
Will and Grace,Is it her or is it writing?
Will and Grace,The new season of veronica mars is pretty good.
Will and Grace,Seinfeld anti reunion is the the only one I like
Will and Grace,It's weird how you wrote that sentence for punch instead of logic.  Unless you actually consider pandering dramatically worse than awful.. to me awful means no redeemable quality. Pandering is at least attempting to give a hand job to the fans.  It's weird how people write so thoughtlessly but in a style that makes it appear as a refined thought.  And because of that little flair you learned how to put on your opinion you get all these upvotes.  This is kind of what's wrong with the world right now. People just look at the surface not the content.
Will and Grace,I totally agree. A stage play is exactly what it seems like.
Will and Grace,  No. That‚Äôs not it at all. I‚Äôve seen much older actresses and actors slay the stage.
Will and Grace,"It‚Äôs a combination of both, but she used to rise above poor material and this time it seemed like she was bored and barely tried."
Will and Grace,"I mean, it was fine, but it doesn't come close to the first two seasons imo"
Will and Grace,"Thank you, I've watched only first few episode of Will and Grace after reboot, so don't remember much from more then a year go.

That's interesting, because IMO she was the most vocal about the show being good and cancelled before it's time."
Will and Grace,Is it better than not having it?
Will and Grace,"Man, I wish Joel McHale had a better career post-Community. He proved he had some real emotional depth in the last couple of seasons and isn't afraid to go [full ham](https://youtu.be/xKqJQswHEfg) either. He just needs to pick some better projects, he's a great lead."
Will and Grace,"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, one of his first ever Hollywood acting gigs was in Will & Grace. Kind of neat to see that go full circle"
Will and Grace,"After seeing how bad he was as a guest judge on rupauls drag race, I don‚Äôt want to see him around anyone or anything even remotely gay."
Will and Grace,"There was a rumor he was being eyed for some of the late night roles that opened up when letterman and Craig Ferguson left, but nothing came of it."
Will and Grace,He just seems like he doesn't care about any role or anything hes in. They had him doing game awards and he just seemed drunk the entire time.
Will and Grace,His netflix show was basically destroyed by the same idiot that ruined the Ghostbusters movie
Will and Grace,[deleted]
Will and Grace,"That's kind of his hosting persona, though. Watch some clips of his old show *The Soup*, it's a kind of personality he's playing. As an actor, he obviously does more of a range of acting."
Will and Grace,"I enjoyed it, I also used to enjoy The Soup."
Will and Grace,"Paul Feig? I know he was an exec producer, and kind of dropped the ball with Ghostbusters (although to be fair Sony didn't help), but what did he do with Joel McHale's show?"
Will and Grace,"His Netflix show was just weird tho, the celebrities on it felt really awkward and forced"
Will and Grace,"Jesus, relax a little. Feig's one of the most influential figures in modern comedy. Calling him an idiot is also shitting on Freaks and Geeks, Arrested Development and The Office. All shows that paved the way for Community. That idiot is a big part of why we know and love Joel McHale.

Not to say everything he did is gold. But come on, if that's an idiot than what does it make the rest of us?"
Will and Grace,"He was hilarious, especially when you compare him with the string of bland, completey uninterested guest judges who sleep through the whole episode we've been getting lately."
Will and Grace,"‚ÄúI CAN SEE HER BUTT‚Äù

How could you not love him for that? And he annoyed Michelle? Even better! (I like Michelle, but I love Annoyed Michelle)"
Will and Grace,Oh i loved it but the hamfisted joked about paul feig didn‚Äôt help sell the show at all
Will and Grace,"He was the executive producer, I believe. And constantly forced himself on camera."
Will and Grace,Took up a new life as a [home plate](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4KHVajVMAAVLNO.jpg)
Will and Grace,"We all know Joel McHale from The Soup, hence the point of wanting to enjoy this show. Paul Feig wrote in several bits that weren‚Äôt in line with the original spirit of the show, and essentially put himself on camera just to say a few lines that were not funny, get a forced reaction from the crowd, and have Joel thank him. It wasn‚Äôt funny, it ruined the flow of the show and it was ultimately why it wasn‚Äôt better received.  So due to all of that, yes, Paul Feig is an idiot for how he completely fucked up the easiest show possible to produce."
Will and Grace,You have to catch Drag Race UK if you haven‚Äôt yet. It has one of the best reads on the series from Alan Carr. It‚Äôs on Wow Presents Plus when it drops in the UK (3 eastern on Thursdays) or starts on Logo next week. You can also find the read on r/rupaulsdragrace
Will and Grace,100%. Feig is embarrassing.
Will and Grace,"Let me guess, always wearing a foppy tryhard suit?"
Will and Grace,....So you've seen the show!
Will and Grace,Nah he's seen Paul feig
Will and Grace,Classic sitcom logic. And that's for the best.
Will and Grace,"If a HIMYM revival ever happens, thats exactly what they need to do as well"
Will and Grace,This is understandable. People want a revival to be the same show as before. Having both Will and Grace married and raising kids would drastically change the show. 
Will and Grace,More room for Beverley Leslie.
Will and Grace,"I'm honestly not pissed.


That finale was hot garbage."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Maybe the fan base is just too toxic for the series to continue. Emika had a really hard time at the end as well.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"So they took off the current stars, but what about the people in the background. I hope they choose new people for that too, she should‚Äôve been getting more support"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,I never got the appeal of the show. The panel's commentary feels extremely toxic... and it's an integral part of the show itself.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,The title is simple sensationalism. Only the current season is cancelled. No word if the series is canceled.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Honestly. This broke my heart to hear. I hope next season the commentators can make a point that when thousands (or anyone) attack after them online, they‚Äôre actually hurting a real human being themselves not an actor playing a role"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"The weird thing is that the actual appeal of the show for me and I‚Äôm sure for a lot of its viewers is that it‚Äôs anti-reality tv. A group of real people come to stay at a home, eat together, spend time together, politely date each other or not, and advance in their careers, and leave when they feel they have got what they wanted from the environment. It‚Äôs an oddly soothing show to watch. It‚Äôs the British Baking Show version of the MTV‚Äôs Real Life. It‚Äôs pure quarantine comfort watch. 

What became toxic over the last few seasons is that the longer the show has gone on, later in the seasons, the commentators became crueler, meaner, especially to the women. Even the contestants are usually there just to promote their careers, Instagram page or business, and don‚Äôt provide the ‚Äúpure romances‚Äù the viewers or commentators want. So the producers plug in obvious conflict between the participants, edit it to make villains and tragic heroines, push couples together just because that‚Äôs what has worked in the past. As the show becomes more produced, you can see the interactions becoming more awkward and strained as the show has gone on, the commentators become assholes to them for not being ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù which then creates a more toxic loop to the fans."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Reality TV. People eat this shit up
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"You got downvoted for your opinion, but I agree with it.

I tried several times to watch it on Netflix but it feels like the show is about enjoying other people's drama and misery (like most reality shows, I guess).

The TMZ-style commentary by the panel did not make the show more appealing to me. They come off as extremely judgmental."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"This season is the only one called Tokyo, though the full title is ‚ÄúTerrace House Tokyo 2019-2020.‚Äù Other ones have been ‚ÄúTerrace House Opening New Doors‚Äù or ‚ÄúTerrace House Aloha State‚Äù for example. But many people may not know that, so the article title may seem misleading."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Title seems ok to me... I think you might be confusing the Terrace House franchise with the title of the current season, which is Terrace House Tokyo?"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"But... This is all I thought when I read the title. Doesn't that mean it worked? Or is it just a St something you decide because you just read the word ""sensationalism"" on twitter?

Apparently 22 other people need an education in the show and the English language."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,It's also nice to watch if you are learning Japanese!
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"> A group of real people come to stay at a home, eat together, spend time together, politely date each other or not, and advance in their careers, and leave when they feel they have got what they wanted from the environment. 

Except for maybe that last bit, it almost sounds like you could be describing the first couple seasons of The Real World. Back before it created the template for forced drama reality TV populated by self-promoting wannabes, it was literally just ""Lets get a disparate group of people, put them all in the same house, let them live their lives, see what happens, and film it."" It was closer to documentary filmmaking than current reality TV."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,what conflicts have been inserted by producers? I‚Äôve really only watched Aloha State and Tokyo
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Thank you! That was really insightful.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,The panel bitching about the show is part of the fun for me. I feel like it's a huge stretch to go from watching a reaction panel on the show (which is pretty common in Japanese TV) to attacking the cast members directly and personally. That is mainly on how toxic Japanese internet culture and fandom is.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Japanese television is basically reaction television where you have a panel of celebrities reacting to the events that go on.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,I love Reality TV! But this show is like watching paint dry.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"I don‚Äôt even see the drama. They‚Äôre constantly talking about work, careers. I fail to see what‚Äôs fascinating about it."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"I just don't see it at all. I mean, actually listening to what they say and how their narratives and jokes and understanding of the stars of the show develop over the course of getting to know them. I understand the instinct but not the logic of attempting to describe something you've barely seen with such confidence despite your lack of comprehension."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"As an American, I found the cohabitation between the contestants fascinating. Where Real World contestants were clamoring over the furniture to claim the coolest room or be first to jump in the pool; TH was polite, articulate, and considerate of each other. Like all reality TV I indulge in, I‚Äôm learning how other people react to situations outside of their control. I see myself in a few character arcs. I appreciate seeing a group of people work together and use each other as support in their lives and careers. The cadence of their voices is very soothing as well. 

The panel of judges or whatever is to me like the peanut gallery that is your extended family- all the bullshit you would expect to hear from people not actually living your life. I did not get the impression they were heralded as guiding the general storyline of the show."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"For any of you seeing this saying ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Owl House? Should I have known about this? Is it any good?‚Äù the answers to your questions are ‚ÄúOne of the best cartoons ever made, accessible to adults and kids alike. Not necessarily, Disney undermarketed it due to disputes with the creator over things like lgbt inclusion, only to discover that when it hit streaming it steadily accrued a massive fan base through word of mouth. And yes, it is very good.‚Äù"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Unfortunately, thanks to iTunes and Disney Channel's continued ineptitude... the episode leaked 16 days early.

So a word a warning to those who still can:

#**AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS**"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"This post really makes me sad, since it highlights the poor marketing Disney is giving the series. 

It's been [known](https://twitter.com/DisneyAPromos/status/1600624288855658496) for nearly a month, yet there are still people out of the loop/it wasn't established enough to get hype. This, coupled with iTunes leaking it, will hurt it when it ultimately airs."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Looking forward to this. Will be terribly sorry to see the show end though, it really hit a hell of a stride."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,[removed]
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Neat. Can't wait.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,S3 taking so long to drop and in 3 chunks makes me just give up on it. It's not as good as Amphibia or GF but it sucks S3 is getting such a shit treatment.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Didn‚Äôt they cancel it?
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,I would also argue that the latter half of S2 was as true an heir to the good episodes of Buffy as I've seen. The sense of genuine desperation against the terribly high stakes hits that same bittersweet note.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"It's very weird to me how persistently iTunes Canada, specifically, leaks *everything*, from Disney shows to indie albums. I used to be a music blogger, when that existed, and they were *notorious* for it even then."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Do not go on YouTube and any socal media storm since there are filled with spoilers for that special!
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"What ever you do, stay off the internet for the next two weeks. The special got and people are already posting screenshots and reuploads."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Sort of, but yeah. Instead of an actual season 3, there are three final extra long specials to wrap up. 

This one is the second of the three, and then there will be one final later one."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"> A cause of death was not immediately clear. However, the most recent update on her Instagram story on Friday featured a photo of her with her cat, with a caption that reads ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù She had also recently posted a series of troubling tweets, one of which, according to a fan translation, read that she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to be a human anymore.‚Äù

>‚ÄúThank you to everyone who supported me,‚Äù read another message, which also implied that she had been cyberbullied. ‚ÄúI love it. I‚Äôm weak, I‚Äôm sorry."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Twitter was a mistake. Poor girl.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"I doubt this is solely the result of the laundry incident on terrace house.

I've seen a bunch of the japanese twitter posts showing years of abuse from a couple of accounts that were pretty much daily asking her when she's going to die and shit like that.

I imagine the extra attacks regarding terrace house, lack of wrestling shows to participate in due to COVID and a bunch of other shit in her life has caused this.

It's really sad, my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to watching the rest of Terrace House season and Hana was one of our favourites."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Cyberbullying is no joke. Just because you do not care about cyberbullying doesn't mean others can cope with it. I hope the people who wrote those messages knew they just indirectly murdered a person.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,It's been a rough week for pro wrestling. RIP Hana
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"She had all the potential in the world. Sky was the limit. A charismatic performer and a extremely talented wrestler. I knew people had been sent to check on her and heard she was ok. Relieved, I then sat my phone down for an hour only to come back and get hit in the face with the news. Gutted. I can't imagine what the Stardom family is going through. R.I.P Hana."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Oh my god. She was so young. Wow.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,I love TH and cannot believe this. It is such a sweet show.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,[deleted]
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"That‚Äôs sad, geez"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Holy fuck, she was one of the nicest people to ever be in the house.."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"That truly sucks.

This is one of the few shows my wife and I watch together and we both loved her."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"So sad that it ended like this.  She was very fun to watch on Terrace House and even though there was some controversy, it was never meant to be serious and the internet overreacted as usual."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Hana Kimura plays a bad girl in Terrace House, and the actors and producers keep saying the tv show is genuine, although this is quite clear that they make drama happen.
Anyway Hana washed her clothes and forgot one item that was very dear to her. I‚Äôm not totally sure but I think it‚Äôs a piece of clothe related to her pro wrestling career. Another guy of the house didn‚Äôt see it in the washing machine and did his own laundry which caused Hana‚Äôs clothe to shrink. She got batshit mad at the guy like the 22 years old kid that she is.
And Japan, as usual overreacted and started bullying her in twitter mostly. There is a tweet that has been now removed saying that the world would be better without her and she liked it before killing herself.

After her death the Japanese football player Keisuke Honda wrote about how people were gutless for bullying a weak person and that they should aime at strong targets like himself. Which is super disturbing but the guy is a professional troll."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Holy shit.

Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Twitter is such an awful place. I sincerely hope it‚Äôs shut down. Rest In Peace.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"If in fact she did commit suicide, I feel like whatever country she is from should be able to trace any cyberbullying and prosecute for it. People have to learn to be more loving towards each other. So many people genuinely suck."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Rest In Peace Hana Kimura. Such a tragic loss
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,That‚Äôs awful. :( the poor girl she must have been going through such turmoil.
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,The people who drove her to suicide should ALL be held accountable!!!
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Reality TV has dominated TV for 20 years now. Haven‚Äôt watched a minute. So glad.

What I do know is that 95% of former contestants on reality shows regret it and caution others.

Editing is so slick these days and the viewer can‚Äôt tell. Whole conversations can be contrived. It‚Äôs too late, you‚Äôve already signed off legally.

Then Social Media has its day with you."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Look up dead wrestler of the week/month. It‚Äôs insane how many wrestlers have died.

She was so fun to follow and a great member of the community"
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"What's truly said is all these comments justifying bullying by saying ""people who commit suicide are weak.""

The fact is, it's weak minded to think that about anyone that feels suicidal, or commits to killing the self. You don't know the mental weight they were under, and just because you've never felt pushed to kill yourself, doesn't mean they were weak for doing so."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Rest Easy Hana üôèüíî
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,She‚Äôs so beautiful and watching videos of her talk she seems like an emotional person. Wish someone could have helped her before things started going south. This makes my heart ache.

She was so nice, beautiful and sweet girl. I just feel like there is a terrible online bullying culture in Japan that have not been addressed well. I see the same thing in South Korea too. I hope they do something about it soon because this is ridiculous."

I didnt know who she was but its sad that she felt that way and Im sorry she had to go through that.  I cant imagine what its like especially with the 'world' of twitter anway saying horrible things to you all the time and being hated.  


I hope for her now that all of her problems are gone and she is at peace in some way."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,Omg this is heartbreaking. Hana you were such a sweet being
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,[removed]
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"I am so sad about Hana, she was one of my favorites on the show - I thought she was so pure and genuine. I think she was disappointed in Kai for many reasons and her anger stemmed from a loss she felt at the possibility of something with him being over in her mind. (She had also been unsuccessful with/let down by Ryo so her anger could have been a build-up even from that.) Kai‚Äôs flubbing the laundry situation was just a catalyst. I came here to see if anyone had any more information on whether any of her Stardom cast members tried to get to her or help her after her (cry for help) Twitter posts. I lived in Japan for a few years and it is very common for people to be very hard on themselves and not reach out for help. Shame at any failure to deliver, or letting people down, can be overwhelming and, unfortunately, suicide is too commonly the ‚Äúout‚Äù. RIP, Hana-chan."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"RIP Hana, you will be missed."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"Let's show love by raising money for Hana's family.

Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"I think this just goes to show the horrible, negative influence that social media can have on a person. It appears to be especially bad in Korea and Japan, for some reason. It seems every year there are a few celebrities who commit suicide due to social media bullying, usually young women. 

Reddit often tries to be a decent place but even this website can get pretty insane. I think it's healthier to limit social media and spend more time with loved ones in real life. Unfortunately for me I can't really do that right now, so all I have is social media. It's a poor substitute, though."
Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020,"The problem with reality tv is that it's real, but it's not real. It shows only bits and pieces, often reducing people into caricatures. The events might be real, but the depiction of them and the people involved is edited. Fiction can be spun out of non-fiction if you pick and choose which elements to show. Audiences will go off the information they're given and fill in the blanks.

It's like those ""based on a true story"" movies. The fact that part of it is true messes with audience's heads as to how much of it actually is. Social media arrived at a terrible time in this aspect, as we're not taught critical thinking, let alone in a new application as this. I'm still not sure that we as a species were ready for social media."

The Defected,"Not just any double agent - Kim Philby. The biggest of the Cambridge Five.

Ben Macintyre writes his stuff like a novel, but they're non-fiction books; he's also the guy behind the original book for *SAS: Rogue Heroes*."
The Defected,"Oh Epix just refuses to die.  I'm looking forward to watching this when it eventually ends up on one of the bigger streaming services.

The cablefication of streaming continues."
The Defected,"> **MGM+, the premium cable network and streamer currently known as Epix**, has landed domestic rights to Damian Lewis drama 'A Spy Among Friends' after the series was to have aired as a Spectrum original.


> **The six-episode series** that reunites the Billions star with his former Homeland exec producer Alexander Cary was among the programs that were left without a home after Charter shut down its Spectrum Originals banner following the departure of exec Katherine Pope. 

> **Created by Cary,¬†Spy¬†is based on the¬†New York Times¬†best-selling book by Ben Macintyre**. The series, produced by Sony and BritBox parent ITV Studios and Veritas Entertainment Group, **revolves around the defection of a British intelligence officer and KGB double agent (Guy Pearce, who replaced Dominic West, who was originally in talks for the part) and his relationship with an MI6 friend and colleague (Lewis)**. The role marks Lewis‚Äô follow-up to Showtime‚Äôs Billions. Cary, Patrick Spence, Nick Murphy, Chrissy Skinns, Bob Bookman, Alan Gasmer, Peter Jaysen and Lewis exec produce.


> The series was originally supposed debut this fall first domestically on Spectrum Originals and then to stream on ITVX (which includes the former BritBox). **It will launch first on ITVX starting Dec. 8 and then at a date to be determined on MGM+ in 2023.**"
The Defected,Oh man I loved this book; so fascinating. Can‚Äôt wait for this
The Defected,"Honestly, I just binged this and it's really terrific. 
Guy Pearce must have had a blast playing Philby, but the whole cast was excellent."
The Defected,Two of my favorite actors. Hopefully this shows up on a major streamer I don't have to pay extra for.
The Defected,A true story
The Defected,"Oh, good, it's still alive, given the death of Spectrum Originals.  \[Now if only we could find out about S3 of *Manhunt*\].

Oh, boo, it's going to be on MGM+ (fka Epix).

And... isn't this just [*Cambridge Spies*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346223/reference/)*,* [*An Englishman Abroad*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085492/reference/)*,* and *A Question of Attribution* all over again? :D Gotta admit, it would be awesome if someone cast Samuel West as Anthony Blunt for the *third* time after *Cambridge Spies* and *The Crown.* :D"

The Defected,Operationan Mincemeat and The Man Who Would Be King are my favorite MacIntyre books. You're right; he has a novelist's sense of pacing when it comes to non-fiction stories.

> Seems odd this isn't on Prime if MGM+ is a thing.

Yeah, MGM+, formerly known as Epix, should have been part of Prime, not a separate service. This comes off as double dipping."
The Defected,"I explicitly referred to Lewis‚Äôs *own* comments as to what the show was about.

‚ÄúI lack reading comprehension skills‚Äù - you"
The Defected,Yes because the educated should all think the same way. Fascistic.
The Defected,How can anyone forget great hits like That's My Bush and Lil' Bush?
The Defected,"They almost certainly can't just unilaterally throw everything that was previously on one service onto another; the only options are probably to either shut down the MGM+ service and not have stuff on it available at all for a while or to renegotiate a lot of contracts before merging them. (They may still make contracts for new things like this to help justify the service's existence in the meantime, but with provisions that would allow the content to be moved once all the renegotiations are done.)"
The Defected,To be fair Paramount do the same with multiple services and so do Disney. I‚Äôm sure Amazon will bin MGM+ as soon as the cable revenue drops to the point that it is no longer profitable. Which is likely not that far off.
The Defected,[removed]
The Defected,"I honestly can't tell if this is a joke or not; your choices here are confusing for multiple reasons.

But in any case, That's My Bush! is a genuinely great show that holds up surprisingly well; I watched it for the first time just a few years ago. But I've never seen Lil' Bush."

The Defected,"TL;DR: The show blames the operators, while actual data seems to blame the equipment and regulations. The show draws heavily from a fictitious book written by someone with a personal grudge and less authority and knowledge than they claim to have had."
The Defected,"Funny, I watched the show and I got the impression that yes, the operators were somewhat to blame for pushing the equipment. BUT the equipment was faulty to begin with because the USSR didn't want to pay for correct equipment. They wanted to do everything the cheapest way possible. I didn't know anything about what went wrong in Chernobyl before this miniseries so all of these conclusions came from the show."
The Defected,No offense to OP but that's a mammoth post to read. Can someone give me the tl;dr version please?
The Defected,"It‚Äôs a fucking tv show, fcs."
The Defected,Did we watch the same show?
The Defected,"Jesus, komrad, we are never gonna read all that. I guess that's why you/Russia are producing another TV show that blames US black ops forces for Chernobyl, huh?"
The Defected,You here to promote the new russian version with CIA bad guys?
The Defected,[deleted]
The Defected,"The likely hood is that this show distorted the facts for a worse reason than the Soviets. They were protecting their countries reputation.  Not defending this at all just pointing out that the people distorting the facts for this show probably just did it to make a better story. After all you need a good villian.

I see the Russian moles have turned their attention to my comment."
The Defected,Ra ra Rasputin lover of the Russian queen.
The Defected,"That wasn't really my takeaway from OP. The show doesn't wholly blame the operators, but it does make Dyatlov seem like a power tripping ignorant tantrum throwing teenager, when many actual reports do not support this. I think that's the issue they have with the show. They make it seem like the path leading toward the event was mainly the result of one idiot's incompetence, when that may not really be the case."
The Defected,Guy says that the show was not showing the true image of the operators and  they were making Dyatlov to be too evil and the problem was solely because of the Soviet totilarian system. Most of the other commenters  thought he was a Soviet sympathizer and he's how look like shit without even reading his badly written paragraph. Just a classic case of people jumping to conclusions without knowing the case. OP's at fault himself here for not explaining well though.
The Defected,TV shows are disturbingly influential in making a narrative seem concrete. Historical works of fiction have to be held to an impeccable standard of factual sourcing.
The Defected,"Jesus Christ, did you read any of what he said?

Or did any of the morons who upvoted you.

He wasn't absolving the USSR of any blame, just pointing it at the right people in the USSR"
The Defected,I love how you just didn't want to read and called him a Soviet sympathizer when he wrote things that were blaming the USSR.
The Defected,"It's so obvious that is hilarious. Why would Joe Redditor take the time to put all this together?  

Those Russians really don't like that show very much do they.

Edit:. It's been pointed out that I jumped to the wrong conclusion.  I was wrong."
The Defected,"Read the post, it's not about US vs USSR. It's about blame being properly given and not stacked upon dead men who can't defend themselves."
The Defected,"TV Shows based on historical events are incredibly influential. When they aren't factually based, they are literal propaganda."
The Defected,"Oh look, another person that didn't *even* skim the OP and yet still has an opinion anyway.  Isn't that neat."
The Defected,"Not really. Art/entertainment is disturbing influential in bringing the topic up for discussion. Apparently that‚Äôs working pretty good in this case. However, creative liberty‚Äôs are quite often used to make the material entertaining. I don‚Äôt have any problem with knowing the facts, but I don‚Äôt expect HBO to teach me. Since watching this limited series, I‚Äôve learned more about Chernobyl reading about it. Up until then, I totally forgot it even happened."
The Defected,"He's basing his argument on the guy being ""railroaded"", and the sketchy results of the ""official"" investigation.  

The only way to get to the bottom of it would be an official forensic investigation done by a team of qualified historians and inspectors/investigators, coupled with an experienced nuclear engineer spotting contradictions between the physical evidence and the witness testimony.

The reality is that no one on reddit will (ever) know what the ""correct"" story is.  Chernobyl is merely entertainment, cloaked as a cautionary tale."
The Defected,[removed]
The Defected,"Because people don't like propaganda being fed to them.

The Russian government would take more issue with this post than the actual miniseries.

Use your brain and read the post."
The Defected,I don't have an opinion. I presented lyrics.
The Defected,"> I don‚Äôt have any problem with knowing the facts, but I don‚Äôt expect HBO to teach me

The same can't be said for others who take it as facts."
The Defected,I'm sorry *morons* don't read a post and then get offended when called out for it.
The Defected,So yeah. I did skip most of it and I did completely misinterpret it. Thank you for pointing it out. I admit when I'm wrong.
The Defected,"Yeah, I know. They also take everything on Facebook as fact, and you know how that worked out for the US."
The Defected,">I admit when I'm wrong.

One of the best character traits to have. I'm guilty of not always doing that myself."
The Defected,"Interesting, but I think you are missing a proper hook and reason to tune in for characters -- the world being the hook only lasts a couple episodes

One of the issues with alternate history media is that you really need a specific central character(s) that the audience can relate to as a newcomer so you can unfurl the world to new eyes, then you have to make them care about the characters who are playing this world out -- its incredibly difficult -- you need to set the rules and then tell me how they work and who I care about

Its ""easy"" to play world builder in alternate history, because you can simply make anything true, without necessarily needing real-world logic, but in the end, it has to be a  grounded story about people who happen to live in those times, and not about ""those times""

Background and overarching ""world"" plot arcs are fine-- but tell me the character(s) that I come back for each week.

(lastly, this would need to be non-ad supported, I can't see a lot of companies wanting to buy ads against this)"

The Defected,Do you know why they didn‚Äôt make Confederate?
The Defected,"So the United States is still a global superpower without all of the CSA states? Makes Abe Lincoln look like a dumbass for trying to preserve the Union when apparently he‚Äôd been better off just letting them go according to you. You don‚Äôt seem to understand how inflammatory of a statement that is and then you fail to detail what type of theme you are trying to explore or outright statement you are trying to make. Your idea is almost all about war plots and nothing about the cultural or thematic issues you would inevitably commenting upon with a story like this. What are you trying to say? The country is divided, sure, but what statement are you trying to make? You don‚Äôt really mention politics or culture and so this seems more like a war games fantasy. Which, to be fair, is less controversial than actually dealing with all the political and social themes involved in A Story like this, but also, why use these themes if you don‚Äôt want to address these issues?"
The Defected,">hypothetical

We're only 2 years past a moment when white supremacists carrying the emblems of the CSA overran the US capital in favor of overturning the defeat of a white supremacist president. 

None of the ring leaders have been censured, charged, or convicted. Most of them are back in office.


Not a hypothetical."
The Defected,It‚Äôd be interesting to explore present day stated as disputed territories.
The Defected,Tbh I think the whole succession thing was just an issue because Benioff and Weiss were unpopular after the GOT finale. I agree it sounded like a concept that could be interesting
The Defected,"Interesting. I like it.

I don't think the CSA would be as impoverished as you suggest. Agriculture would their #1 export/a profitable industry."
The Defected,Harry Turtledove would be a great read for you.
The Defected,"Agreed, I'm hearing a lot about events and plot but not a lot about people.

One of the best books in this genre is called ""underground airlines"" by Ben Winters, which has a really compelling main character - a former slave who hunts down other slaves in order to maintain his freedom. The background is great but the characterization makes it really compelling."
The Defected,"HBO and D&D never addressed it again. The outrage was actually mostly manufactured, but regardless, the show was DOA from it... I actually don't think it was going to get greenlit anyways, but of course the reveal went poorly so it didn't matter"
The Defected,"No, all I know is that they dropped the idea"
The Defected,"What are you on about? 

The majority of the story is literally politics/geopolitics followed by spy intrigues and finally military actions (and even then it‚Äôs either a professional military fighting insurgents for most of the time up until the end where actual war between two industrialized nation comes to fruition). This is literally just an idea I thought up of after watching a short alternate history video on YouTube, obviously if I spent time on this I‚Äôd flesh out the cultural, societal, economic, etc. consequences of a Southern victory. 

>What are you trying to say? 

Again, literally thought up of the idea on the spot after watching a YouTube video yesterday. It‚Äôs not a multi-year project or whatever with solid, concrete ideas and themes fleshed out. But since you‚Äôre so inclined to ask, if I had to find a theme, it‚Äôd probably be analogous to the triumphant spirit of our country, doing what‚Äôs right (with ‚Äúright‚Äù being defined in a morally grey zone), the internal logistics behind why major political decisions get made, how a war affects a country, etc."
The Defected,Good question.  Why wasn't Ray Epps arrested and charged?
The Defected,"I'm sure that was part of it, but there's also the optics of two white guys being the one to tell the story of an alternate universe where the South won."
The Defected,"Particularly ""The Guns of the South,"" which is really the literary starting point for these sorts of stories."
The Defected,Because it was a terrible idea.
The Defected,Can someone please escort the Trump cultist back to r/conspiracy?

The Defected,I wanted him to get caught and punished for his crimes.  Having his sister die and then dumping her into the ocean like he did with the other trash was just a slap in the face. 
The Defected,God that ending was dreadful
The Defected,"The major issues I had with the end of Dexter include

- Dexter not wanting Harrison to grow up with a murderer, so he gives him to Hannah... who is a murderer.

- Dexter's mother-figure was in the whole of season 8 and we never got anywhere past surface level with her and how that sort of figure could help or hinder Dexter. They brought a potentially great character to the show that could have a lot of ties to the show and its themes as a whole but they basically wasted her and the entirety of the 8th season on another one-off season-long arc that didn't have much to do with the rest of the show.

- Dexter's young prot√©g√© in this season also could have been a complex character to help Dexter develop and understand his own motives more, but this character's usefulness was wasted and cut short too. 

- Keeping Dexter alive simply because Showtime wanted the option to bring his character back in the future. The original showrunner wanted to kill Dexter in his series finale, and that could have been one hell of a reveal. For such a previously edgy show, Showtime ruined the edge at the end when they refused to allow the character to die. 

It's like they had the basis of a good idea for the season but they didn't go anywhere with it. I, and a good majority of the audience, wanted something that put the rest of the show in perspective. Season 8 and the final episode didn't really do that at all. All it did was show surface level drama and Dexter making bad decisions, someone we are supposed to know to be a smart character. There was not enough *substance* to the new characters and the entire season's storyline. There could have been so much more done with the characters in an effort to develop Dexter and the overall show themes, but they didn't really try at all in season 8 to do any of that. It's not a terribly bad season of television, but it is supremely disappointing and a shell of the show that people came to love in earlier seasons."

Not only did she mask evil intentions the whole time before she was revealed as a villain (okay, granted, she was part of the Maquis, but so were Chakotay, Torres and a bunch of others), she was also a Cardassian spy that was genetically altered to pass as Bajoran, AND turned on Voyager and her former Maquis crew to help the Kazon AND had a baby using Chakotay's DNA without his consent AND planted a booby trap program in the ship's computer that wasn't discovered until after she died.

* Samurai Jack - A mysterious female swordsman teams up with Jack early on. Turns out she's Aku in disguise. While it's a bit more obvious, the twist actually has a rare, *Bad Guy Wins* ending.

* Attack on Titan - Annie, Reiner, and Bertolt are enemy spies.

Phi,"Savitar from The Flash is a very good one. Reverse Flash is up there as well. But I think the best villain reveal I‚Äôve seen is when identity of the Kanima‚Äôs Master was revealed in Teen Wolf Season 2. It‚Äôs quite unexpected, if you ask me."
Phi,"WWE Raw. The Shield betrayal was a huge reveal to fans, that Seth Rollins was working for the Authority the entire time. The war with CM Punk as their benefactor, the invasion of Raw. The War with the Wyatts. Then the final War with the Authority where Seth Rollins assaults Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose, weeks after the build of Dean being teased as the traitor.

Phi,I love it because you kind of know it in the back of your mind but they manage to pull you away enough to where it‚Äôs still a gut punch.
Phi,"""Don't tell mama"" Gave me so much chills and the two credits scenes were something out of horror film."
Phi,I've never even heard of this show. Gonna go check it out.
Phi,Thank you for not spoiling. Your review really makes me want to go and watch this shown now. Is it really that good? I absolutely adore murder mystery type shows.
Phi,I haven't rewatched Lost for so long that I kinda forgot who Henry Gale was lol. Ben fucking Linus
Phi,Got any milk?
Phi,"[spoiler](#s ""Ward"") is possibly my favorite MCU villain. He's compelling and fun to watch in all his various forms."
Phi,"Apparently that got sprung on them last minute to tie in with Winter Soldier, and the actor was a bit gutted. They obviously still really like him as he's back every 5 minutes."
Phi,I thought Agents of Shield was a pretty bad show until that villain twist.  To me it saved the show.
Phi,That was one amazing twist
Phi,"Oh, that was really well done. The drums, Martha's reaction to the pocket-watch, then the Doctor's reaction to her telling him, all while the doddery old scientist is thinking, and actually *looking* at the pocket-watch for the first time in years."
Phi,"Also, World Enough and Time. I hadn't seen any trailers or anything and damn!"
Phi,Angels turn was phenomenal as well.
Phi,"That's the moment when the show goes from B-tier to A-tier. He disposes with the boring, generic villain and suddenly everything is firing on all cylinders."
Phi,"As ""The Higher Power"" Corporate Undertaker was working for"
Phi,90s kids will always be able to flaunt that they got the best toy commercials and the motherfucking attitude era.
Phi,"Aw, sonuvaBITCH!"
Phi,[removed]
Phi,"Out of the darkness, into the light, Hail Hydra. That fact that it happens at the same time as the reveal in the Winter Soldier makes it amazing. How a movie changed a tv show."
Phi,"I love agents of shield.  But that moment felt totally out of place and almost like they were just making shit up.  Ward, at no point, had any shred of Hydra in anything he did before that happened.  It just wasn't his character.  It felt like they just decided he was bad halfway during production."
Phi,I'm very thankful that I wasn't on the message boards for that show because when it happened it blew my goddamn mind
The Society,They were told they were cancelled 4 days before they started shooting season 2.
The Society,"Damnit, this was a good one. That is disappointing."
The Society,A cool story with a great cast... Such lost potential...
The Society,To be fair they should‚Äôve answered some of those questions by the end of season one. An entire season can‚Äôt just lead up to a cliffhanger. The concept wouldn‚Äôt have lasted past one season anyway. In my opinion.
The Society,[deleted]
The Society,season 1 was hot garbage change my mind
The Society,"first 3 episodes were more than enough to cancel this mess but since network didnt, universe stepped in."
The Society,Thanks for clarifying
The Society,Agree üíØ
The Society,"Although I don't think the story would have lasted past 2 seasons, I would agree that maybe a limited series of about 12-15 episodes could have been perfect."
The Society,"It‚Äôs possible they used all the good ideas they had in that first season, and it built to something stupid. It was kind of a wtf ending."
The Society,The show was definitely not perfect. The Guard being probably the weakest and most cringe aspect. The mystery of why and the how of they got there was very intriguing to me.
The Society,I dont agree. They were actually being smart; you don't wait until the very last moment when food is about to run out to then start thinking about growing crops
The Society,Agreed
The Society,[deleted]
The Society,"I agree with you and there are obvious leaps that we were supposed to make in order for the story to move forward as a TV drama. Imo there would have been many more people vying for control and their place the leadership than just what we saw. The Guard would have been the entire football team. There would have been more questioning of who decides who does what. And a select few arbitrarily choosing Allie after Cassandra is murdered? That would never happen. All were decisions to move the plot forward.

Still I appreciated what they started and would have loved to see it play out. It probably should have been done as a limited series of 12-15 episodes."
The Society,I'm not okay with this
The Society,I have a feeling we are going to get a few more articles about this happening to shows in the next couple of weeks.
The Society,"The society was the closest i was ever gonna get to an adaption of Gone :( bro, fuck covid"
The Society,The Society needs to have a proper ending
The Society,I‚Äôm Not Okay With This was one of my favourite Netflix shows in a long time. Damn
The Society,"Goddamn.  I Am Not Okay With This was so damn good, and really left the viewer wanting more."
The Society,"Hey, Netflix has a new excuse!"
The Society,‚ÄúDear coronavirus: Go fuck yourself.‚Äù
The Society,I can‚Äôt believe this! I Am Not Okay With This was so good... I wonder if someone might pick them up.
The Society,"I am not okay with cancelling 'The Society'. They renewed the show back in July 2019. They could have started the 3 months filming long before the pandemic hit the world.

The first season ended on a cliffhanger & now there won't a resolution."
The Society,"Sonofabitch.

I really enjoyed The Society and was looking forward to the next season."
The Society,"Sounds like all the scripts for the season were written for both shows, would be cool if those got released or summarized in some way. 

Lots of talented young actors across both shows, hope they find new projects filming in safer areas."
The Society,Damn... I really enjoyed I Am Not Okay With This and was excited to see where they would go in season 2
The Society,"Being a not so young adult. I actually enjoyed watching The Society. I mean, I had some frustrations about some aspects of it... but I liked the whole Pied Piper of Hamelin meets Lord of the Flies vibe. The way that different factions were forming and breaking. It was really cool.

I can see the production issues being impacted by social distancing. I would just hope that they'd postpone the filming. But I guess you can't keep everyone on hold indefinitely without knowing if/when it will be safe to work."
The Society,Damn... I just wanted to know who Becca‚Äôs baby daddy was
The Society,"The Society wasn‚Äôt great, but it created enough good ideas that I was interested to see where it would go. This is too bad. 

I‚Äôm starting to get pretty tired of Netflix randomly canceling things and now that we can‚Äôt even trust a renewal by them makes it even worse."
The Society,That's a real shame...I blew through The Society in a matter of a couple days and was truly hoping for a conclusion. Another Netflix casualty sadly.
The Society,Fuck Netflix.
The Society,"Sucks that now we have to worry about shows getting canceled after they were already renewed.

Have a feeling this will be the first of many to come.  Bubble shows won‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to scheduling production when things ramp back up and there is limited space available."
The Society,"damn all those ppl on every trailer netflix drops asking ""where is The Society season 2?"" are gonna be pissed. üòÇüò©

also, I Am Not Okay With This was a fucking gem man. fuck covid, and fuck all you motherfuckin' americans who didn't want to stay home."
The Society,"Is this for real? I'd been waiting for The Society S2 for a while, they literally renewed it and not it's cancelled? It doesn't make sense!!"
The Society,Had meant to check out The Society for Kathryn Newton but never got around to it. This sucks!
The Society,"I loved The Society. This fucking sucks, i was so excited for the new episodes too"
The Society,Damn and I know the Society was like a week out from filming before everything shut down.
The Society,"Oof, two of the few shows I actually watched on Netflix."
The Society,"[Bullshit!](https://media.giphy.com/media/TEHn0Ly4cyvPBXPAjR/giphy.gif)

I enjoyed The Society when I watched it, but now that it's cancelled it feels like a complete fucking waste of my time. Nothing resolved, cliffhangers aplenty, you'd have to be insane to start watching it now if you haven't already. In some ways I feel sad for the cast more than anyone else; that we won't get to see how their characters grow and develop, when there was some pretty damn fine acting in there.

I haven't yet started watching I Am Not Okay With This but I was really looking forward to doing so. I'm going to be fucking gutted if the consensus is ""you'd have to be insane to start watching this now.""

I have a horrible feeling that overall we may be entering a situation that's like the WGA strike of 2007 times a thousand :| How many more shows will be cut down in their prime, or without even being given a real chance?"
The Society,God damn it lol. I actually liked The Society.
The Society,Not ok with this. The society was going to be a hit
The Society,Devastated by The Society‚Äôs cancellation. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
The Society,"Honestly it's getting more and more tempting to drop Netflix, because they keep pulling this utter bullshit. I'm overly mad about this but I waited so goddamn long for the society season 2, and I am not okay with this is great too. How the FUCK are you going to make 3 ""the kissing booth""s, but ditch these? They don't know their audience and it's embarrassing."
The Society,"Bro, what the fuck!!!!! Thats bullshit"
The Society,"Bummed about ""I am not Okay With This"".  It really seemed like (once they were able to film again), it would be cheaper to produce since the episodes were shorter."
The Society,"Hopefully another streaming service can pick up ""I Am Not Okay With This"" because I really enjoyed it. One of the better coming-of-age genre mash-ups I've seen."
The Society,"Dammit, these were two of the best teen shows out there."
The Society,"They KEPT Outer Banks and got rid of these two shows?! Make it make sense, y'all."
The Society,"two of their best teen shows, easily. don‚Äôt know how these two get whacked but boring ass outer banks gets a s2."
The Society,"I'm surprised a bit that *I Am Not Okay With This* was cancelled - [I wrote about it a little at the time](https://alexmoreland.co.uk/2020/02/28/weve-seen-i-am-not-okay-with-this-before-but-thats-the-point/), and the way it felt so much like it was written by a Netflix algorithm would've made me think it's the sort of thing they'd try hard to keep. Suppose that's just the nature of it with Covid, though, and I wouldn't be surprised to see quite a few more of these cancellations soon."
The Society,And here I was waiting for news of season two of I am not okay with this
The Society,"Honestly surprised more shows haven't been cancelled because of COVID-19.  How many of them are filmed in the US?  Most of them?  Foreign filming is happening but it's going to be a while for the US projects can open up.

All the while Netflix has to fulfill their content obligations and... where are they going to get content from in like 3 months time?"
The Society,"Netflix should add a new genre to their library called ""Cancelled"""
The Society,"DON'T YOU DARE MESS WITH *DEAD TO ME*, NETFLIX"
The Society,"""The Society""?!! C'mon.    
Other movies and series have been put on hold for years."
The Society,"""due to covid related circumstances""

is such a cop-out.

both shows could be put on extended hiatus until the pandemic is over"
The Society,Shit like this makes me glad I axed my Netflix account.
The Society,"I get it, but it sucks.  I feel like there are going to be so many stories that we've been looking forward to being told on TV and in movies, and so much is going to be scrapped now because of Covid.

I haven't mourned this much for filmed entertainment since the writer's strike, but this feels worse because no one can be blamed for it."
The Society,I really dug I Am Not Okay with This. Damn..
The Society,"Damn, I am not okay with this was a good show and I was really looking forward to seeing where it went"
The Society,But somehow they will manage another Witcher Season with Covid going... Not that I'm upset I liked The Witcher TV show.
The Society,"Our whole society here in the US is being cancelled by Covid, and I'm not ok with this."
The Society,"I'm pretty fuckin mad about this. I really loved I am not okay with this. I am *not* okay with this.

My loyalty to my Netflix subscription is becoming seriously waned with my lack of confidence on starting new shows without knowing for sure they will get a satisfying resolution."
The Society,Awesome. Happy I wasted my life investing in watching the first season of IANOWT with no resolution
The Society,"I am not okay with this surprised me, I really liked it and was looking forward to more."
The Society,Okay are we going to at least find out what was supposed to happen to I Am Not Okay? Huge huge cliffhanger
The Society,Dead canceled or temporarily canceled? I am not okay with this was better than most of the other Netflix originals I‚Äôve seen lately
The Society,Why?? The barely scratched the surface with her powers!
The Society,I‚Äôm so tired of Netflix doing this to almost every show I like.
The Society,I'm getting pretty tired of Netflix cancelling every single show I enjoy. Think it's time I finally cancel my membership after being a nonstop member since year 2 of them existing.
The Society,"AKA, let‚Äôs get rid of the actual good shows so we can afford to make a shitty live action Avatar the last Airbender"
The Society,"Yes, sure, whatever the fuck you say Netflix. Covid is going to be here for probably the rest of our fucking existence, so lets be real here Netflix, you just cancelled them, don't pin this on the virus.

'I Am Not Okay With This'was fucking brilliant.

Netflix, you're very close to becoming worse than cable TV at this point. You actually make great originals, but cancel shit before anything really concludes, or you let them go on until you'll have a 'Lost' situation where those creators won't be able to write themselves off that fucking Island. Marco Polo was amazing and had so much potential. Sense8 was interesting enough and I'd like to have seen it play out as it was intended, but you actually did some good faith to fans. OA is a fucking travesty that it will never conclude.

Yeah lets make more shitty original films where we might actually get 1 good hit out of 100. Just fucking stick to original shows, but FUCKING LET THEM FINISH!"
The Society,"Fuck you Netflix! I‚Äôm done with you leaving shows open ended and ruining anime with live action reboots. I had hope for Avatar but you fucked that up too. You already lost Friends and soon The Office. Not to mention you raise your prices every year and for what?! So you can green light every show you can just to cancel them with out proper conclusions. I will stick with Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc. There‚Äôs just nothing special about you anymore Netflix."
The Society,I Am Not Okay with This sounded familiar i hoped it wasn't show that i thought but after googled it yeah i loved that show. I wonder if there was no COVID would they cancel it? I hope they can bring it back in the future.
The Society,How are they filming shows and movies at all with all the covid stuff happening
The Society,"Ironically I watched all of ""I Am Not Okay With This"" while i sat at home, 90% sure I had Covid"
The Society,I watch both of these shows and was excited to watch the next season for both of them wtf
The Society,My girl Kathryn deserves better üòî
The Society,This is not okay.
The Society,What!!! What happens to Carrie 2.0???
The Society,"Both shows are amazing, they just should of gone on hiatus."
The Society,Figures. I binged I Am Not Okay With This last week. It‚Äôs hard enough to have free time to watch TV and now I wasted it all.
The Society,I am also not okay with this
The Society,Hope channel 4 Uk pick up I am not okay with this they co produced end of the fucking world and it‚Äôs the same director so there could be a chance.
The Society,damn....i was looking forward to both. I need major closure for The Society though ...
The Society,The Society has an horrible season ending with huge cliffhanger. They at least could do a movie or 2h episode to say what was the f...ing mistery.
The Society,I was REALLY looking forward to a 2nd season of Im Not Okay With This
The Society,"Nooooooooooooo! I Am Not ok with this was a great show.  
Guess I‚Äôll go watch Dark again...and again"
The Society,Lame. Can't we just postpone it?
The Society,So disappointing about INOWT... and I‚Äôm still mad about the cancellation of The OA
The Society,Fuck! I loved 'I'm not okay with this'
The Society,Figures! You get into a show and they pull the plug .
The Society,Fuck the society was such a good show. Left such a huge cliffhanger and mystery. Hopefully a different platform picks it up
The Society,The Society is shut down by covid. fitting.
The Society,Was it the lack of dancing minors?
The Society,Dude man FUCK Netflix for this shit! Wasting my fucking life ffs
The Society,I am not okay with this society
Jailbirds,She really has no leg to stand on. She helped in the murder of 3 people.  A tongue lashing from a judge is the least of her concerns.
Jailbirds,"She committed a crime resulting in three murders, she should be sentenced to a cruel and painful death."
Jailbirds,"I‚Äôm conflicted 

Firstly, I only know what was stated in the show which leaves some blank spots in the events for me. Secondly, I only had tayler‚Äôs telling of events until sentencing. Based upon those, she truly seemed like a pretty normal 19 year old who regretted epic poor judgement that occurred in the past. So I was rooting for her - it did seem like she had real potential to turn her life around.

However, now I question if she downplayed her own culpability and if the downplaying is a) for herself to not deal with it emotionally or b) for others to paint herself sympathetically. If b - then the judge was probably correct. But part of me still wants to believe in her potential and believe in a"
Jailbirds,"I‚Äôm so sorry to Taylor the judge has a place next to satan for how she treated that poor, poor young 19 year old.
I was gutted for her. 
It‚Äôs incorrigible how she was treated in that moment. I could cry for her. 
She admitted to her crimes, which at best we‚Äôre shrapnel‚Äôs of the initial suspects crimes.
She didn‚Äôt kill anybody. She was a victim if you listen to her story. 
That doesn‚Äôt mean she did no wrong. But in comparison to suspects of the case, she was a mere bystander. 
Sad to say that a victim to many things she is!
Including the system she‚Äôs in.
Tsk tsk, we can do better."
Jailbirds,Wow! Tell that to the victim's family.
Jailbirds,"People my age need to know how chill TAGS is. It's one of the coziest shows you could watch, but enough stakes to keep you engaged."
Jailbirds,It's funny how Barney can carry a tune when the script allows it.
Jailbirds,And that jailbird guitar picker grew up to be Rosco P. Coltrane.
Jailbirds,"Man, James Best was sexy!"
Jailbirds,"It is only now that I realize one or more generations may not have grown up on those reruns!

I think I need to sit down."
Jailbirds,"Yes, and I love how happy and relaxed Andy was in the black & white seasons."
Jailbirds,It‚Äôs a shame they did not have Andy do a guest on Dukes of Hazard and do a new version with the Sheriff.
Jailbirds,Geeooot geeooot geeoooot
Jailbirds,The seasons after Barney leaves just aren‚Äôt the same at all
Jailbirds,I'm going to start watching because of this post. So thanks! 
Jailbirds,"Personally I love seasons 1-7 all the same. 4 is the best and 5 is the worst, but I don't ever notice a big drop in quality. "
Jailbirds,"Damn, I remember your original post. Think I'll start a rewatch myself."
Jailbirds,"I literally just started watching shameless not knowing much about it and not knowing there were than 2 seasons. Now we're on the last ep of season 1 

Loving it so far! "
Jailbirds,"I love shameless too, but this is funny because I remember seeing your original post somewhere. Cool stuff"
Jailbirds,"Ive been a Shameless fan since season 2 when no one was talking about it, I'm so glad it blew up thanks to Netflix and it has now become one of the most popular shows, I seriously hope it hits double digits before the end. "
Jailbirds,Been meaning to watch this show for awhile now .. ugh it‚Äôs like 70 episodes at this point 
Jailbirds,[deleted]
Jailbirds,"I'm surprised you liked Amanda so much for Lip. Sure on paper she was the perfect girlfriend, but her personality was consistently awful and I just wasn't buying that Lip could stand to be around her that long."
Jailbirds,you're welcome. üôÇ
Jailbirds,"yea. it hardly ever drops in quality but there are times where it's dull right before something major happens and it picks up again. Even though season 5 was my least favorite it did bring us the bianca plot which I loved. 

The show does change a bit as it progresses though. As I said in the post, in the later seasons it tends to be less of a family drama and more about these characters from a dysfunctional family struggling to get their lives together or find their place in society. 

And again too, Shameless is so much better when you binge-watch. I didn't realize just how great season 7 was until I rewatched it just now. I can't wait for season 8. "
Jailbirds,yea you're in for a treat. 
Jailbirds,https://gfycat.com/RecentThreadbareBrahmanbull
Jailbirds,"Random. I'm avoiding googling to not see spoilers but how does it work with young actors and smoking, nudity. I guess Karen is over 18. Ian m, though ""stuff"" is implied, must be over 18 too? Also I wonder what the parents of deb and Carl think. "
Jailbirds,"wait are you asking for the actors age or characters age? I'm pretty sure all the actors who've done nude scenes on the show are over 18. 

Character wise, in the 1st season Ian is 15 and Karen is 17. Lip is also 17. Not sure how old the actors were exactly. "
Jailbirds,Exactly. I am assuming the actors would have to be older regardless of the age of their character. And I know that is common.  
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Why the hell aren't they working on more Attack on Titan?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,gives me a snowpiercer with zombies vibe.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,The first episode is on amazon prime
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,So...this is the exact same show except with a train and samurai?  Also that Eren Yeager voice actor makes my ears bleed.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"They are, but it's taking time. This is their current show, which I so far prefer over AoT. Sadly, it's only going to be 13 eps."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Season 2 is announced for 2016 so it will probably come out during the fall season.

Don't expect the new season to have anywhere the amount of action as season 1 though."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Pretty sure they don't want to catch up too far to the manga.  Too often an anime adaption doesn't pace itself, and risks either going on a much longer hiatus while they wait for the manga to buffer, or the show just creates bad filler."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Came here wondering this. Da fuq? We've been waiting for season 2 of an anime where the story already exists for like 3 years.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,It's like a steampunk zombie Snowpiercer type thing.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I caved and started reading the Attack on Titan manga the other day. I am not in possession of enough patience to wait for new episodes.


The Manga is awesome btw, incredible artwork."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I shudder to think how long it will take for us Dub plebs. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,See: Overlord and One Punch Man.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I did the same thing. Season 2 is going to be fantastic. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Faces in manga are a bit iffy, rest is pretty decent tho."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,probably not long. Funimation started doing simu-dubs.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"My personal go-to example is Kenshin, season 3."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. Best thing about it is the trains.
You probably want to ask this over on the anime subreddit.
"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Why? Why would you suggest that kabaneri started of well but after biba it was such a mess. I would not recommend it at all. Especially in comparison with AoT
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"The animation quality is very very good. The characters are bad anime stereotypes. And the story is a rip off of Attack on Titan, with a steampunk twist."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I've seen this its kids like AOT but isn't you just need to watch it to tell the major differences. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Kabaneri is an original series made by most of the production team of Attack on Titan - it's fully intended to replicate the success of Attack on Titan (though it does so less effectively IMO). It being in production is also one of the reasons the new AoT season was delayed.

I don't think anything I'd recommend came out this year. If you're cool with older anime, I'd recommend Monster, Paranoia Agent (darker psychological series) and Black Lagoon, Cowboy Bebop (lighter action series). None of these series pursue an apocalyptic angle. If that's what you're looking for, you'd have better luck reading manga or watching live-action tv.
"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Watch better anime.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,This subreddit has a weird hatred for anime. Idk why.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,It was written by the same guy who did attack of titan
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Seen all those you've listed, guess we just have to wait!"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"If you had noticed, I asked for suggestions"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"The manga for Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin was written by Hajime Isayama and adapted into an anime by Wit Studio. Isayama didn't write Kabaneri, it is an anime original story created solely by Wit Studio. A lot of people seem to not really like Kabaneri though. While the story kinda falls apart at the end and most the character are pretty flat, I thought the extremely well made character design, aesthetics, and animation made it well worth a watch, especially because its only 12 episodes long. As for other recommendations for more mature anime that came out this year, [91 Days] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/32998/91_Days) is currently airing but seems to be very promsiing so far. It's a prohibition era mobster story which is pretty rare in Anime. [Erased](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) which is a time travel/mystery show which came out earlier in the year and was pretty good. [Re:Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) is another currently airing show that is really popular right now. If you want to talk more about anime and find other recommendations i would recommend heading over to /r/anime. It's very active community that that will be much more enthusiastic about anime than r/television. Just be careful, they might seem a bit strange if you're up to date with all the hip new anime memes and such."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"nice ill check these out.  its really hard to find anime thats not full of those lame emotion things or whatever they are called  and more for adults. 

what was that anime that was about people going to outer space to fight giant ants or something?  they censored the shit out of it but was supposed to later be released un-censored.  wonder if that has happened yet"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Oh yeah Terra Formars. It's probably uncensored now, it's been a while since it's come out. I haven't seen it but I've heard its not that great. Also, there are tons of great adult orientated anime out there, you just got to know where to look. Anime is a medium, not a genre,  so they come in all different shapes and sizes. [This flowchart] (http://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q) is great for finding new shows for any genre you are interested, or I can give you some more direct recommendation for shows that are not from this year if you tell me what specifically you're looking for. "
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Every time I see an article about this show it gets more expensive.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Too bad the laws of physics in our universe state that they simply can not both be successful at the same time.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"One airs on a Friday and the other on Sunday‚Ä¶ that is to say, they aren‚Äôt competing for my time‚Ä¶"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"My guess is most of us are watching both. They‚Äôre not really competing for our attention, days of ratings is over. We watch things when we have time. The only real loser here is Netflix."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"After two week?!?

Cool.

We can have two shows, it's fine."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Business Insider said it cost $500 million a few days ago; 

https://www.businessinsider.com/rings-of-power-more-than-a-tv-show-for-amazon-2022-9?amp

The post here yesterday said it was 700 million‚Ä¶now its a billion? Lol, pick a number for your talking point."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Funny but I‚Äôm pretty sure I literally read the exact opposite article like two days ago
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I actually like both at the moment!
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Since the show are obviously going to be compared endlessly while they are both running, *I guess* I'll throw my 2 cents in for why HotD seems so much better right now. The 3 main characters in HotD, in particular Daemon and Rhaenyra, are just so much better through 3 episodes than any character in Rings of Power. Just look at how much everyone has fallen in love with them in just a few episodes. Meanwhile RoP is still trying to find any reason to make you care about the people on screen."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"House of Dragon is cheating a little bit though. No matter how mad I am as s8, the theme song and the dragons are too dope! 

Plus it all feels _familiar_. I was still pretty confused ep3 of original got, trying to remember all the houses and names and people and alliances."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Cool.

Why is this news? 

Why does it need to be a competition?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Enjoying both!  Why does it have to be a competition?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I'm enjoying both, and I'm only mildly confused which one I'm watching sometimes."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,They‚Äôre both phenomenal shows. I‚Äôve been very pleasantly surprised by rings of power. House of the dragon is doing an amazing job at having that classic GOT feel. Some of the best TV I‚Äôve watched in a long time.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I've been enjoying them both quite a bit. I don't really get the hate for RoP. its definitely more of a slow burn, but its been visually stunning, and im enjoying the weaving of the narrative they've set up so far."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,HOTD gets me excited for the next episode as soon as I‚Äôm done watching. I watched one episode of Rings of Power and I‚Äôm good to wait a while before watching more
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,And then there is she hulk. I wonder how it's doing
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I love hot d
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I love how this show can‚Äôt be mentioned without it‚Äôs budget. I‚Äôm starting to think the full title is amzons $1 billion‚Ä¶.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"HBO are like a seasoned veteran whereas Amazon are the rich overconfident rookie who's on the team because of nepotism. This isn't a fair comparison but I will say ROP seems like an extremely slow burn, I'm enjoying the visuals but not fully sold yet. As long as it doesn't go the route of the wheel of time I'll be content with the first season being slow."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I‚Äôve only watched half an episode, so please tell me if I‚Äôm totally wrong, but LOTR feels a bit reductive. Episode 1 felt like I was watching a very hi res version of the original movies with slightly worse acting. Does it try to do its own thing eventually?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"""Viewer battle""?  I'm watching both, as are most of my friends.

If you're interested in one you're probably interested in the other"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,This is such a stupid stance to take.  Streaming is NOT cable.  Viewers don‚Äôt have an obligation to watch right when things come out and shows can continue bringing viewers in long after an episode releases.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Typical bargain basement journalism, invent a non-existent conflict or competition between two separate entities to encourage clicks on their shitty article, that no one would read otherwise."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,i like both
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"2 episodes into RoP, incredible visuals, meh storytelling, but what worries me is that I am so blatantly unattached to not a single one of its characters, with the slightest exception of ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ lets see what Galadriel does next I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I watch both!

Bring me Witcher 3!  I‚Äôll watch that too"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Shit, am I breaking a law by watching them both??"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Watch an episode of both shows and you'll see why. The writing, pacing, and characters in House of the Dragon are leagues ahead of Rings of Power"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I've always had a bit of a thing against Game of Thrones. Only truly liked it in season 3-4 which wasn't a popular opinion for most of the shows duration. And I loved LOTR and really hoped this show would knock it out of the park. 

But even then I still House of the Dragon is the more enjoyable show to watch. If someone had to pick right now, I'd tell them to watch that one.

Rings of Power might end up incredible anyway, though. It has to do a lot more work when it comes to world building. Hopefully that pays off. For now, it seems to still be finding its place. It'll possibly be a lot more fun when you can binge it!"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I don't understand all these takes being penned about how Rings of Power being unpopular could hurt Prime memberships. I always sort of thought of Prime Video as a pack-in bonus. You got Prime for the 2 day shipping, not to watch Rings of Power.

Though that calls into question the wisdom of spending $1 billion on a show for a streaming service that is a pack-in bonus."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I really don't understand the complaints about ROP being slow. I think the pacing of the show is great, I'd like them to take their time, besides have they not seen the actual movies that are slow as hell, not to mention the books that are 10x slower. Makes no sense."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"As one person who has watched both - I like House of the Dragon more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I feel like it is because I know the story, characters, etc. I‚Äôm not as familiar with LOTR beyond the films so I can‚Äôt see the significance of different things. It feels less exciting and interesting.

EDIT: Meaning, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just as true the other way around. A LOTR fan is going to be more interested in the ring show. GoT was in such recent memory, I feel like it has an advantage."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"HBO is letting HoTD‚Äôs quality speak for itself.

Amazon is hiding negative reviews, attacking fans and cowering behind the usual curtain of ‚Äúism‚Äôs‚Äù that these big corporations do when they buy out massive properties and churn out substandard products by committee. Every excuse except for ‚Äúmaybe this isn‚Äôt connecting with people.‚Äù

Edit: Whoever decided that this comment was worth reporting me to Reddit care resources‚Ä¶.get some fucking help lol."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Both are totally different different shows, and I'm enjoying both for what each one brings."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Because so far, the story is slow and boring. I feel asleep watching episode 3 last night."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Why didn't they hire above average writers with all those monies?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I can feel the money dripping off the screen. The writing however‚Ä¶
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I think both shows are really great. Rings of Power is a bit of a slower burn, but it is absolutely beautiful. I have a feeling that it is going to build up to some absolutely epic shit before the end of the season, and at that point the amount of money they spent is really going to make a world of difference. I think the word of mouth when that happens will cause a lot of people to take a second look."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Not sure why you are all so weirded out by this supposed competition, they are both big budget fantasy series airing during the exact same season of television of course some comparisons and competition will happen."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. HOTD has not disappointed and is an incredible show thus far. Rings of Power is holding its own IMO.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"i think both shows are great, the only difference is that I have twice fallen asleep watching rings of power, where that has never been a thought watching any game of thrones including season 8. it‚Äôs just a much slower show definitely aimed towards tolkien enjoyers with a hard barrier to entry"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Not surprising.  I think that House of Dragons is offering a complete story experience while Rings of Power is a sleeper trying to get by on jump scare action sequences between snoozes.  That kind of sporadic pacing and casual engagement doesn't draw you in.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,The first episode was a snoozer. I didn‚Äôt bother watching anymore.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I loved LOTR and the Hobbit...and I wasn't one of the people that was critical of the latter stages of GoT either like many others were

But Rings of Power is really difficult for me despite trying. I generally like the actors, and loved the parts with Elrond and hos Dwarf friend. 

But I two problems. 
1. I just don't like how they decided to make some things look, especially some of the orcs...the worst part being that weird warg.

The orcs, wargs etc in Peter Jackson's movies were just perfect in my opinion. This just looks weird.

2. The story seems to be weirdly put together. Like there was too many cooks in the kitchen that couldn't agree. I don't feel like they know where they are going."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Reddit: The only place people like Rings of power lol.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Because it's boring
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I don't know why but I'm not feeling the urge to get into Rings of Power while I wanted to watched House of the Dragon. Maybe The Lord of the Rings tying everything up in a neat package makes me feel less the need to start something news in this universe. Or you know, maybe I just want dragons."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"It's not a competition, it's things like this that hurt fantasy and sci-fi, as everything is inevitably pitted head to head rather than just enjoying the ride. I'm loving both shows.

RoP has a lot to establish before it can get into its stride, it's a *very* different world to that found thousands of years later in LotR, the scene needs to be set, but then the pieces will move quickly and violently as there's a **lot** to get through. HotD is a lot easier to kickstart as it's *almost* a direct prequel to GoT and while the characters are different, the places and Houses and power struggle dynamic are nearly the same."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Rings of Power beginning to seem like streaming's **CLEOPATRA** (1963).
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Rings of power is a bit meh. Absolutely beautiful, but characters a bit meh. Don't think it was cast well in relation to most of the elves. They should look much different and shouldn't have to rely on ears to tell. 

Wtf was that warg"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"As it should. Rings is bland and the only thing interesting is the lore Tolkien created.

Only been a week and I barely remember the plot."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,*House of the Dragon drags Rings of Power‚Äôs bloody half torso from a cave.*
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Still can't believe that they are spending near 60 million per episode. With that type of money, this better be the most epic and awe inspiring show ever, but through 3 episodes it's giving very generic fantasy vibes, apart from the amazing landscape shots and some nice visuals. Show has a feel of CW esque or maybe even Scy fy style flavor with some hallmark movie network vibes."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,House of the dragon is so much better than rings of power
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"when the marketing main focus is on insulting the potential audience first and tolkien second, there's a fair chance a lot of people won't even give it a chance.

I did. I wanted to give it a shot, pretend it had nothing to do with Tolkien, put it on the level of the Shannara book (which at least had the decency of changing the names).

It was meh, at best. Bad acting (with a couple notable exceptions to just underline how terrible the others are), overall lack of personality and originality, inconsistent tone.

Overall, it's a generic fantasy, whose story is pretty much at the level of D&D: Wrath of the Dragon God but with a bugget several thousands times bigger"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Why did they release it at same time as  a major fantasy franchise like got??
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Oh no, so you're telling me that storyline, plot and decent acting DO matter? *shocked Pikachu face* who would've guessed it. I could see this coming the minute that actor proclaimed, this doesn't belong to Tolkien anymore, it belongs to us. No my little ray of sunshine, it does and always will belong to Tolkien."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,This show feels like an AI wrote the story and a bunch of robots are acting it out. The sets all look fake and the show just comes across as soulless to me. Hopefully it gets better.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I‚Äôm okay with weekly releases, but LOTR should‚Äôve been released all at once. It‚Äôs too slow for a weekly release. The episode don‚Äôt really end with a bang either."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,First episode was very dull. HoD did a better job of grabbing your attention and making you care about the characters.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"From the looks of it, House of the Dragon is a $1 million show"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Problem is we both know how it ends. And House of Dragons can get a helluva lot more darker than LOTR. Also, my mom watches(d) GOT and has no idea who Bilbo is. Shows how much a broader net HoD has."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,HotD has tits and gore for broader appeal.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,Idc. I like both shows and watch both.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"I‚Äôm watching both, and I like both.  But House of the dragon is a lot better.  It has better writing, better acting, and Caraxes is the coolest fuckin thing I‚Äôve seen in forever."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"It‚Äôs all trash 

Boycott shitty revamps"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,No doubt it will be canceled before 5 seasons.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Amazon is panic deleting thousands of 1 star reviews, which they had already approved (this is in addition to the ones that they didn‚Äôt even let go up in the first place).

This show is garbage"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,I expected greatness.....but so far its very mediocre. I've given it 4 episodes. Its watchable. Its just not the wonderful show I expected. üò•üò¢üò≠
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress: The Battle of Unato,"Well maybe you could have written a story more complicated than ""Mary Sue vs. the men-who-are-bad""."
Is,Imagine your industry being so shit that Twitch is the less toxic environment.
Is,"Grace Van Dien:
>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I‚Äôve worked on I didn‚Äôt have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,‚Äù Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>‚ÄúOne of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to‚Ä¶ like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,‚Äù Van Dien said. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my boss. And then I didn‚Äôt and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‚ÄòHow is streaming better for your mental health?‚Äô That‚Äôs how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don‚Äôt have my boss asking me to have sex with them.‚Äù

>Van Dien added that though she‚Äôs sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon ‚Äî and on her own terms.

>‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy here, and I‚Äôm developing my own projects,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I‚Äôm not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.‚Äù"
Is,That‚Äôs fucked but at least she‚Äôs still able to do something lucrative and didn‚Äôt have to throw it all away to avoid being Weinsteined
Is,Scumbags are getting too comfortable again as time passes the Weinstein stuff. Time to nip that shit in the bud.
Is,who was she on stranger things?
Is,"This person clearly forgot that her father is Johnny f'n Rico. 

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
Is,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it‚Äôs getting really hard to see past it.
Is,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
Is,She should name the projects and producers.
Is,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"
Is,"Was so mesmerizing in the few scenes she had in ST, such a shame there are so many shitty people who take advantage of nice people like Grace.

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
Is,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
Is,Good for her.
Is,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I‚Äôm happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don‚Äôt usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that‚Äôs just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Is,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Is,">‚ÄúOne of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to‚Ä¶ like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,‚Äù Van Dien said. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my boss.

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
Is,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Is,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Is,Chrissy woke up!!!
Is,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Is,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Is,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Is,That‚Äôs awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Is,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Is,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Is,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Is,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Is,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Is,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Is,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Is,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Is,‚ÄúStar‚Äù is used pretty loosely these days eh
Is,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Is,"More power too her. She‚Äôs doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I‚Äôll miss seeing more from her but she doesn‚Äôt owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Is,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Is,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Is,What‚Äôs sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I‚Äôd like to think we live in a world where they can‚Äôt hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can‚Äôt. I feel for her.
Is,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Is,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Is,"Understandable, have a great day"
Is,It‚Äôs horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Is,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Is,Why can‚Äôt people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Is,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Is,Y‚Äôall should watch the movie ‚Äúshe said‚Äù came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Is,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Is,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Is,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a ‚Äústar‚Äù?"
Is,Name them!
Is,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don‚Äôt even remember her character, let alone know who she is."

Is,No idea who this is

Is,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt still the case.
Is,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Is,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Is,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Is,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Is,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to ‚Äútalent‚Äù. 

The producers with ‚Äútalent‚Äù get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they‚Äôre ‚Äútalented‚Äù enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
Is,"Inaccurate title: ‚ÄòStranger Things‚Äô Star

Is,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
Is,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Is,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it‚Äôs the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody‚Äôs business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn‚Äôt mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone‚Äôs advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

Is,She needs to get her dad to kick some ass.
Is,The number of people defending the dude as just asking her out is pathetic.
Is,Chrissy wake up!!! I don't like this!!! Chrissssssy wake up. I didn't know who she was in Stranger Things from the picture without looking her up. Fyi she is Chrissy from S4. Too bad she has to deal with creep producers but it looks like she has been streaming on Twitch so at least she is enjoy still making content.
Is,Wait til she finds out about the people on twitch too
Is,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Is,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein ‚Ä¶ you of all people can somehow get away with it ‚Ä¶

Good for her honestly. She‚Äôs making money and she doesn‚Äôt even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you‚Äôre mad you‚Äôre just jealous because she‚Äôs living the dream."
Is,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Is,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Is,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Is,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It‚Äôs arguable she‚Äôs laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

Another Miss Oh,NYTimes just published an article about this situation if anyone is interested in further reading: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/world/europe/gary-lineker-bbc.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare
Another Miss Oh,Looks like the conservative snowflake storm continues on both sides of the pond.
Another Miss Oh,"Between this and the BBC choosing not to air one of the new **David Attenborough** episodes because it might **""upset""** the political right..."
Another Miss Oh,This comment section is almost as big of a car crash
Another Miss Oh,"I did appreciate the fact that they showed a movie about a plane crash. Sorry, unplanned landing in the Hudson. I applaud who scheduled that. If this carries in to next week, will they decide to schedule a film about a train wreck it car crashes?"
Another Miss Oh,"For the jokers who say ‚Äúthey liked it ‚Äú with any form of commentary, analysis or chit chat. You can watch highlights way before 10:30pm and save yourself staying up late to catch some politics crap that airs Sunday mornings."
Another Miss Oh,"American here, and not a football fan. This is the first I‚Äôve ever heard of Gary Lineker. And may I just say I frigging love this guy! What a stand up, admirable, decent human being. Go Gary."
Another Miss Oh,"There is nothing more British than wanting whichever celebrity has the most attention this week to become Prime Minister.
I look forward to whoever this happens to next week becoming PM"
Another Miss Oh,Gary lineker for PM! Wonder is he fancies a 1.1m pay cut?
Another Miss Oh,"As an American, it took me a bit of reading to make any sense of the bit of reading I was doing.

Edit: I actually don't live in a 'Murika hole at all. I just don't follow football often, and just haven't heard of a show that i may or may not even have access to watch. Not sure what's up everyone's ass here."
Another Miss Oh,"[Viewer number went up by 500k](https://i.ibb.co/qkpkLyG/Fr-A6mi1-X0-AMb8-GZ.jpg) lets see if it goes back to normal levels next week. 

EDIT: This is not a diss to Gary. I am on his side on this."
Another Miss Oh,"Isn't MotD without presenters just 'football'?...

...ahhh I see where you get 'shameful' and 'joyless' from then!

edit: Guess I should've known better than dissing football. Last thing you want to do is aggravate football fans!"
Another Miss Oh,The guardian is jokes
Another Miss Oh,People need to calm down a bit.  Yeah the programme is better in its usual format but missing the often asinine commentary and punditry for one week is hardly a disaster.
Another Miss Oh,Something tells me this guy never watched football before anyway.
Another Miss Oh,[deleted]
Another Miss Oh,"Missed the commentary but tend to fwd the analysis.

Look like it had been produced by an intern.

Fact based"
Another Miss Oh,Racism is bad
Another Miss Oh,"So they pay this cretin ¬£1.3 million a year and he's so popular that when his show airs without him on it, the ratings go up 23%. Come to think of it, it's ridiculous that a presenter whose show barely scrapes two million viewers gets over ¬£1 million in the first place."
Another Miss Oh,[deleted]
Another Miss Oh,"It really doesn't need Lineker, people are just used to him after 20+ years. People probably thought it wouldn't be the same with Des Lynam when he left. But it definitely needs a presenter and pundits. And even more so, it needs commentators."
Another Miss Oh,I preferred it.
Another Miss Oh,"Lineker and co (Shearer, Wright and Jenas) are fucking terrible. They‚Äôre so biased as well, it‚Äôs sickening. I would rather watch MOTD without their incompetent analysis and biased views, ideally with better pundits in their place. Mark Chapman is much better than Lineker."
Another Miss Oh,"It was great. No pundits spouting bollocks, just the football."
Another Miss Oh,[removed]
Another Miss Oh,Lineker is awfully close to wanker.
Another Miss Oh,I don‚Äôt get the all the love for linneker. Literally any football fan could do what he does.
Another Miss Oh,I'd accept soulless television if that's what needed to shut up Lineker. His progressive cosplay had long passed annoying.
Another Miss Oh,üòÅü§òüèΩ
Another Miss Oh,"I watched the World Cup final in 1990 in Norway without commentary, even Norwegian commentary would've been better than none. Some strike at the time."
Another Miss Oh,"As much as I appreciate the internet virality of both, neither compares remotely to the super league fiasco a couple of years ago. Absolute scenes"
Another Miss Oh,"Ah, almost forgot about piggate featuring David Hameron. I'm kinda nostalgic for the days when the prime minister's shenanigans were light hearted and humourous. As opposed to evil and illegal like today."
Another Miss Oh,Have you all forgotten the day the Cats trailer came out?
Another Miss Oh,Don't be revolting. It was only a blowy.
Another Miss Oh,Yeah exactly. You can watch the highlights for free on youtube shortly after full time. MOTD added a bit of personality. Without the presenters MOTD wouldn‚Äôt exist and it may as well be part of the sports segment of the 10 oclock news
Another Miss Oh,"I saw someone say ""it had all the goals"" like Match of the day doesn't always show all the goals. It's clear half of the people praising it have never watched it before."
Another Miss Oh,"Admittedly I haven‚Äôt lived in the UK in over a decade, but my memory of MOTD was that it was an institution because at the time it was basically the only way you could catch up on everything that happened in the PL because not every march was available to watch.

The idea that it‚Äôs preferable to render it down to a muted YouTube compilation is hilarious. Without the analysis and with the coverage for each match only lasting 3 minutes how do you enjoy it? How do you banter your mate about how shit his club was?"
Another Miss Oh,"> Amusing watching Conservative MP's acting like it was brilliant and preferable. 

‚öΩüçª‚öΩ How do you do, fellow plebs? ‚öΩüçª‚öΩ"
Another Miss Oh,Don't vote Tory
Another Miss Oh,U can watch highlights anywhere on the Web. Literally the reason to watch MOTD is the pundits
Another Miss Oh,">Maybe some people don't really care for the analysis, but most people absolutely want the commentary.

I really only watch for the analysis. Quite often I skip the actual highlights because I've watched the games."
Another Miss Oh,"tories don't watch the football.

they wank themselves to polo and horse racing."
Another Miss Oh,Also a bunch of other mouth breathing right wingers.
Another Miss Oh,[deleted]
Another Miss Oh,"> even more amusing seeing the guardian complain about bankers bonuses over the years , but stands in solidarity with gary leeching 2 million off the tax payers
> 
> just stick on some of the youtube influencers for 50-100k"
Another Miss Oh,It is because it was much shorter
Another Miss Oh,[deleted]
Another Miss Oh,"They do?

https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/viewing-figures-rise-for-match-of-the-day-without-lineker/"
Another Miss Oh,"We remember great moments in Football, and so often the commentary is a huge part of that memory. Like when fans weren't in the Stadiums, watching football on TV without commentary is missing a vital ingredient. 
  
Case in point: 
  
""AgueroooooOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"""
Another Miss Oh,"Ignoring the fact that he wasn't even bound by the BBC's social media code of conduct, seeing as he was a freelance presenter and not BBC staff. Now, the BBC won't let him work for them unless he agrees to new terms - he has to agree not to speak against the government in public."
Another Miss Oh,"Same, but without the paywall - https://archive.is/Ye6ED"
Another Miss Oh,I‚Äôm about as interested in supporting the NYT as I am Match of the Day at the moment.
Another Miss Oh,"It‚Äôs a weird situation. what do people think/want impartiality to be? 

I‚Äôm really confused that most of the country seems to think that impartiality is something to throw away as long as the journalist in question says something they personally agree with."
Another Miss Oh,"That wasn't true, as confirmed by the WWF who partnered with the BBC on the episode. It was always intended to be an online-only piece separate from the rest of the show."
Another Miss Oh,"Completely untrue. The series was always 5 episodes, as announced last summer. The additional film was a companion piece made by a slightly different group of people, acquired specifically for IPlayer and never destined for BBC1."
Another Miss Oh,You do know he‚Äôs a cheater & serial adulterer‚Ä¶??
Another Miss Oh,No one wants Gary Lineker to become prime minister.
Another Miss Oh,"Would he need to? BoJo and other PMs have had other jobs, MPs take~~bribes~~ salaries to lobby for companies"
Another Miss Oh,Most outward looking American redditor
Another Miss Oh,Controversy brings eyes. This is definitely not an example of ‚Äúall publicity is good publicity‚Äù though.
Another Miss Oh,"Depends what happens, if the presenters go back it will be higher I‚Äôd imagine. If they don‚Äôt, lower."
Another Miss Oh,I'll actually watch it now he ain't on it
Another Miss Oh,The guardian is instant karma. Which isn't to say they don't occasionally have a point but the way people take that and run with it is a bit much.
Another Miss Oh,How dare you. We must now pretend we liked the pundits and didn't think they came out with drivel and clich√©s.
Another Miss Oh,How dare you. We must now pretend we liked the pundits and didn't think they came out with drivel and clich√©s.
Another Miss Oh,"Look you can do the usual anti-sports spiel that‚Äôs so popular on Reddit but at the end of the day the husk of Match of the Day that was aired yesterday is a lynchpin to the slow but steady slide to the right the BBC are doing. The fact they haven‚Äôt backed down is a huge telling sign. 

But yeah. Sure. Footballs boring. That‚Äôs the lesson here."
Another Miss Oh,You can just watch the highlights of your teams game on YouTube 30mins after it finishes...
Another Miss Oh,I usually record it and fast forward the talking anyway
Another Miss Oh,"It's not ""idiots"". This situation is political in nature so this thread is about atacking the ""right"". Any response that doesn't attack the right will get downvoted by the PR agency hired for this hit piece. This has nothing to do with football or television."
Another Miss Oh,Ok Miss Universe
Another Miss Oh,"If MotD didn't have the pundits, analysis or interviews and was just highlight clips AND was uploaded online for me to watch at my own convenience I might too...

Oh wait."
Another Miss Oh,Of course the ratings go up. People stop to look at car crashes all the time
Another Miss Oh,Wait to see how popular it is 5 shows after he leaves. There's a novelty you can't ignore to it right now.
Another Miss Oh,"2 million *live* viewers. A usual timeslot of 22:20-23:45 is never going to bring massive numbers weekly, but they can catch up on iPlayer."
Another Miss Oh,"Why do folk keep spouting this shite, you might not like the individuals involved but they absolutely offer insights into games. 

From the brief MOTD highlights (and the camera angles) it's often impossible to see what's happened in build up to a goal say, or how an individual has performed over the course of a full 90 mins - the extra analysis very obviously adds to your understanding of a game.

And these aren't random bland media idiots giving their insight, all 3 you've mentioned there were world class strikers, the absolute best at what they did. If you think you can watch 3 mins of highlights and know as much as these guys about what's happened you are beyond deluded."
Another Miss Oh,"Yeah and funnily enough people involved with sports in the UK tend to have a lot of respect for a former England captain, enough that when you force him out of the door at the last second they aren't exactly willing to work for you... You won't get commentary or pundits willing to work on it till Gary's back."
Another Miss Oh,"We don't want to hear opinions thay differ from the hive-mind, thankyou very much."
Another Miss Oh,I think Lineker is great but I don‚Äôt think viewership would fall if he was replaced by Chapman

Another Miss Oh,Reach a bit further and you‚Äôll touch the moon
Another Miss Oh,The superleague was like a lads night out before everyone asks their mrs if it's alright.
Another Miss Oh,"Not gonna top Wagatha Christie for me, best 24 hours in Twitter history."
Another Miss Oh,Like the old farts in the conservative party know what a YouTube is
Another Miss Oh,Of course there are easier ways to watch goals and highlights (like Reddit) but Match of the Day is and will remain an institution
Another Miss Oh,God- shows how long it‚Äôs been since I watch news on the telly. Totally forgot the have a sports segment
Another Miss Oh,Kinda like TNT if they just got rid of their inside the NBA crew. Everybody watches for their chemistry and commentary
Another Miss Oh,"I'd argue it's always been a relatively snappy highlights programme as well - the pundits tend not to talk for too long about each match (especially later into the show), so it works well to briefly break up the action for a bit, even if it's just to grab another beer or whatever between games."
Another Miss Oh,"Absolutely, its the pinnacle of many households Saturday night TV"
Another Miss Oh,"Dara O'Briain called out someone like that who called it the best ""Episode"" in ages. Who calls MOTD ""Episodes""?"
Another Miss Oh,[removed]
Another Miss Oh,Which ones?
Another Miss Oh,"This certainly contributed. From what I can tell, viewing figures are an average over the course of the entire programme, so it makes sense that more stayed around for 20 minutes in a middle/late evening slot than would stay for the whole ~90 minute slot that ends close to midnight. Especially as often the games at the end of the show are the shite ones with little action, so lots of people turn it off by then."
Another Miss Oh,"You know the BBC isn't funded by the taxpayer, right?"
Another Miss Oh,"Of course they were going to be higher. Everybody, myself included, were morbidly curious as to what a MOTD looked like without presenters or commentary. I thought it was terrible, and that seems to be the general consensus from friends and online."
Another Miss Oh,You quote the spectators gossips columnist? Urgh.
Brothers,"My grandfather was a member of the easy company. He joined as a replacement just before they got to Bastogne. He wrote in a journal through the entire experience and I have memories of him typing up all of his handwritten journal entries onto a computer in the early 90‚Äôs. 

Stephen Ambrose used a lot of his personal reflections as reference material for his books. Unfortunately, he passed in 1996 but when the mini series premiered in 2001, HBO flew my grandmother, mother, and her sisters out to Paris to join for the premiere in Normandy. 

I am so extremely proud to be his granddaughter and wish I had more time with him to ask questions as I was only 6 when he passed. My husband and I took a trip to Bastogne and the Jacques Woods/Ardenne Forest in 2016 and it was incredibly emotional and surreal! The fox holes are still there and the energy is hard to describe. 

The series is so well done and I feel so lucky to have something I can watch whenever I want to remind me of everything he and his peers went through at such young ages."
Brothers,Band of brothers is one of the few series I‚Äôve watched multiple times. I absolutely love everything about it.
Brothers,"Want to see me cry like a baby? Play the interviews at the end of the last episode, ending with Major Winters ‚Äú‚Ä¶ but I served in a company of heroes.‚Äù üò≠"
Brothers,"The moment that sealed it for me was after the Bastogne campaign, where they‚Äôre all sitting in the church and listening to the choir. As the names of the dead and injured are read out, they start to slowly fade away one by one‚Ä¶"
Brothers,"‚ÄúMasters of the Air‚Äù about the strategic bombing campaign is airing on Apple TV+ this year. It‚Äôs the third in the trilogy produced by Spielberg/Hanks: BoB, the Pacific, and Masters of the Air."
Brothers,"I rewatch it every year, absolute masterpiece!"
Brothers,"Sobel may have been the asshole he was portrayed as in the show (though fwiw his family have come out and very publicly claimed he was not) but he did not deserve what happened to him in real life, suoer tragic"
Brothers,"It was a great example of something only HBO could make. Some stories are better told as mini-series as well, but they are so expensive to make that we just avoid making them in the US.

Netflix burned a lot of bridges the last 4 years when cancelling many of their series. It has become such an issue many folks won't give Netflix series a try as they don't want to get invested only to be left with no closure. They should move to doing mini-series for a while to regain trust and tell the stories other networks won't invest in telling because of no multi-season/franchise potential."
Brothers,Just thinking of the Bastogne episode makes me cold.
Brothers,"Watch Generation War next.  It's from the German perspective and hits even harder.  

Don't sleep on The Pacific either, obviously.  All three give their own unique perspective of the war."
Brothers,"I'm almost 100% sure that this is the case, but I can't believe this hasn't been mentioned: 

If you're a BoB fan, the podcast that came out at the 20th anniversary, is absolutely incredible. It enriches the experience for both new and old fans by an insurmountable amount.

I've been rewatching the show almost yearly since it came out but rewatching it with the podcast as a companion was a new level of appreciation.

Absolutely everyone of importance and nostalgia is interviewed, the host is sneakily good and intelligent and warm, he is able to facilitate such good conversations with cast and collaborator.

I CANNOT. Recommend it enough:

https://open.spotify.com/show/4kPks2or9xa26GdMRRu2lK?si=PvRdPyLoTJSsPQXbW8QvIA"
Brothers,Generation Kill is equally as good but in a completely different way
Brothers,"The thing that got me was the pre-episode commentaries by the actual people being portrayed in the show. It really shows the accuracy and perfection of the acting and the show production value.

I really need to watch BoB again. What a ride it was."
Brothers,"The opening sequence of Episode 2, with hundreds of airplanes in the sky at once, really made me understand the concept of ‚Äònations at war‚Äô at a deeper level, the sheer scale of the conflict and resources involved"
Brothers,"We need /r/television version of this:

After many years I finally decided to watch [insanely popular, well-reviewed film] and I just want to say that it definitely holds up after all these years! What really stood out was the amazing directing by [Academy Award Winning Director] spot-on acting decisions by some of the legendary cast including [Academy Award Winner], [r/Movies fan favorite], and [actor identified as ""underrated""]. The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same. If you're a fan of [Top 10 IMDB Film], or [Other Top 10 IMDB Film], or any [insert genre] films in general, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
Brothers,It probably *is* the most incredible piece of tv ever made
Brothers,Really going out on a limb here
Brothers,"most shows & movies have the disclaimer: ""Based on a true story""

BoB's disclaimer: ""This is a true story""

""The Pacific"" is just as incredible.  it doesn't follow the same characters throughout, but it does show the literal hell these extraordinary marines went through ( I salute ALL my Devil Dog shipmates!)

& I'm writing to Tom Hanks at least once a month to finish the trilogy, tell the stories of my shipmates in WW2.

plenty of source material: Pearl Harbor, Midway, Leyte Gulf, USS Indianapolis, Doolittle's Raid, the formal surrender on USS Missouri"
Brothers,"^^^this^^^^

I‚Äôve been saying this since I first watched it.  I‚Äôll take shit for this, but I truly believe that Band of Brothers should be required watching in high school.  We all take our freedoms for granted.  And to think that many of these brave young men even faked their age to be eligible for service."
Brothers,I just watched it recently and it was absolutely incredible. Although i‚Äôve heard that it may not be as accurate as it‚Äôs portrayed and maybe Winters wasn‚Äôt the all around great guy he‚Äôs portrayed as.
Brothers,"I hadn't watched it either until recently and echo your sentiment. I liked that they also weaved in some uplifting sentiments and the cameos from the actual soldiers which was touching. ""Uplifting"" framing in I watched it right after *Come and See* in the WWII binge, which was pretty brutal."
Brothers,This is not an exaggeration.
Brothers,"It never stops being good, it‚Äôs one of the few shows that is consistent over every single episode"
Brothers,First time I watched it I was on a mini R&R break in a random palace on the Green Zone in Iraq as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. I was hyped to say the least.
Brothers,"The episode ‚ÄúBastogne‚Äù always has me like ‚Äúf-ck that shit!‚Äù Frozen trees exploding from artillery impacts left and right, dude in the foxhole next to you getting a wood splinter though his throat dying choking on his own blood. Id‚Äôa noped outta there like a coward."
Brothers,Move to Generation Kill next
Brothers,"It is the best miniseries I've ever seen. And easily one of the best TV shows of all time. I think every American should watch it at some point in their lives, even if they have no interest in history."
Brothers,"It's truly special, one of the perfect examples of right people, right time, right medium, right network.

Basically all of those ducks had to get in a row, they did and it created magic. I'd have to think on it a bit, but if you argued it's the best television series ever, I wouldn't tell you your wrong as a gut reaction."
Brothers,"So fucking good.  I have watched it countless times.  I always remember the DVD being expensive for a long, long, long time.  One of the very few things media, movies, TV, whatever, which brings me to tears.  Especially when they come across the concentration camp.  Everybody's acting is top notch.  Whoever cast David Schwimmer as their lieutenant, wow.  It still surprises me to this day how good he was at being so unlikeable.  Now I want to watch it again."
Brothers,"Band Of Brothers is one I can watch over and over and over again.  Never gets old.  Wish there was more WW2 films that was filmed like this.  Even though Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg both did Saving Private Ryan, this just takes the cake."
Brothers,"I'm going to give the heads up that Pacific is not the same. It's really good and you will enjoy it, but it's not band of brothers and I think it's something to do with the source content being multiple books rather than 1 as in the case of band of brothers. 

Highly recommend the book, some subtle things in the show that are highlighted in the book (hinkel,eat ze armpit ya!)"
Brothers,"Salute the rank, not the man."
Brothers,"I Treasure a remark to my grandson who asked, ""Grandpa were you a hero in the war?""

Grandpa said, ""No.... but I served in a company of heroes‚Äù.

By Mike Ranney

I have watched this scene more times then I can say and it always makes me tear up.."
Brothers,"The YouTube algorithm randomly suggested an interview with Major Winters a few days ago - turns out Albert Blythe didn't succumb to his wounds from Normandy but rather he recovered fully and then went on to serve as a paratrooper in Korea.

https://youtu.be/vfhcwvsUkBY"
Brothers,One of the best ever. Check out Catch 22 on Hulu if you haven‚Äôt already.
Brothers,The book is also great.
Brothers,"Thanks for posting. I've never seen it, but I'm going to give it a go."
Brothers,Was thinking about picking up the vhs box set. Never seen it before.
Brothers,"Just started  a ‚ÄúThe Pacific‚Äù rewatch. If you haven‚Äôt caught it, it‚Äôs worth a watch."
Brothers,The pacific is a must watch for you then
Brothers,"A great series that has visually stood the test of time. Is it a perfect historical depiction? No, but its very close, and certainly much closer than a lot of what we get today.

What always floors me is that the musical and visual presentation of the series still fits and doesn't look dated at all. The washed-out, high contrast, gritty style combined with the lower framerates during action sequences really works well to keep the series in the same ring as modern CG movies and shows. Hell, it even sometimes surpasses modern film and TV by being primarily in-camera effects, and leans on CG very sparingly. It doesn't show its age because of that, and the style really embodies the ""1940's WWII"" feeling so it never feels out of place.

The same argument can be said about Saving Private Ryan, though I do feel it's visual timelessness is just slightly second place to Band of Brothers. Still incredible, but just not quite the same.

Again, it's not perfect. But it's pretty damn close!"

Brothers,"You‚Äôre not wrong, but man, I wish Reddit would find another show."
Brothers,"Yes, the show with a 9.4 on IMDb and numerous Emmys is pretty good. Shocking."
Brothers,Man just caught up with the TV discourse from 2001
Brothers,Ross and his friends at Easy Company
Brothers,Yea this post doesn‚Äôt say anything new or different.
Brothers,I‚Äôve actually been rewatching it and fully agree.
Brothers,I rewatch this yearly and discover something new every time. Amazing series
Brothers,the GOAT
Brothers,*the most incredible pieces of TV.
Brothers,We watched the entire series every Christmas season.
Brothers,Your weekend pass has been revoked!
Brothers,I‚Äôve always said it‚Äôs the greatest single season of any show ever. It just can‚Äôt be topped.
Brothers,I was a sobbing mess when the final credits rolled
Brothers,"If you like band of brothers, try ‚ÄúGeneration Kill‚Äù. Also excellent television, and I think a great counterpoint to BOB."
Brothers,"Oh def. It's saving private Ryan as a series but like full quality throughout. Great choice to watch.

Edit: not to say SPR isn't quality throughout, just that doing it as a series is a lot of time to be quality and they do it."
Brothers,From the Earth to the Moon
Brothers,"The Pacific is just as good, though more miserable. But it should be. The pacific theatre was hell on earth. 
Fully realized with Fat Man and Little Boy. 

Though I‚Äôve heard it put that war is worse than hell. The people in hell deserve it, but in war innocent people are killed and brutalized wholesale."
Brothers,it really truly is a cinematic masterpiece <3
Brothers,"Watch the Pacific too then. You‚Äôll love it. Although I watched pacific then BoB, and found myself catching things I learnt from Pacific, which made some scenes a bit less realistic in BoB.  

Also, just saw ‚Äúall quiet on the western front.‚Äù Wow. Def watch that too"
Brothers,"If you are a gamer, you would enjoy r/hellletloose. It appears the developers were fans of the series and used it for inspiration."
Brothers,"I loved the series as well. Back then, I had no interest in war movies or shows. I always viewed them as just action movies that were all about shooting people with nothing much happening. When I gave Band of Brothers a chance, I immediately understood the gravity of war from their points of view. I then branched out to other war stories and games and I learned that there's a lot of very interesting stories to learn about in them."
Brothers,I loved Damien Lewis (Lt Winters) in it. BoB made me watch Billions and Homeland.
Brothers,"Not one of, The One!"
Brothers,I will never ever forget the medic episode.
Brothers,"One of the best shows ever. I rewatch it every year. 

I live in Zell am See, the place where they go to relax in the last episode... Always makes me smile to know they were here at the end."
Brothers,"Band of brothers is something I take the time to watch every year. 

It is that good."
Brothers,Yeeeeah man absolutely fantastic show
Brothers,"Friend recommended it about 3 years ago, one of my comfort shows. Along with The Sopranos you cant go wrong.

War is Hell"
Brothers,Episode 9 is one of the best and most hard hitting bits of TV ever
Brothers,You'll be watching it again in a week. It's one of those
Brothers,"Band of Brothers shows the totality of war. The training, the preparation, the fact that soldiers don't like being left in the dark. The lengths they will go to to survive, and how respect is earned and lost in the field. 

There are few other movies that show this. Saving Private Ryan is one of those few. War should never be shown as pretty or noble, war shows the worst of mankind, and also humanity at it's best.

If you want to see another series similar to BoB, check out The Pacific. Also, a Swedish band named Sabaton does a lot of songs based on history and warfare. Check them out, as they have taught me a lot more about European history than my high school history ever did."
Brothers,This post reminds me that I'm long overdue for a rewatch of Band of Brothers as well as The Pacific. It has to be years at this point.
Brothers,Bastogne was the best episode
Brothers,They show clips from BoB in some Army schools as examples of good leadership and it‚Äôs assigned as homework to watch the entire series. It‚Äôs an inspiring and moving show.
Brothers,"The Pacific is equally good and made to the same impeccable standard, its about the US war in the Pacific Islands and conveys the same weight of human cruelty and perseverance. Band of brothers will always be the GOAT of these types of shows but I must say I think i prefer the Pacific"
Brothers,Chernobyl is right up there with it and is by the same people both are amazing
Brothers,"Now watch The Pacific, it's even better."
Brothers,I want to enjoy military tv series or movies but i cant... Because all the soldiers wear the same uniform and i cant tell who is who.
Brothers,I cry everything when I watch episode 9 why we fight
Brothers,"The top of my bucket list is to visit Bastogne to honour the memory of the men depicted in this mind blowing series that always hits me really hard when I watch it

To the men of easy company - thank you ALL for your service."
Brothers,We all experienced this the first time we watched it.  After you‚Äôre done you‚Äôre almost exhausted by the emotional rollercoaster and wonder if you can ever watch another show.  Very few others are as immersive as this series.
Brothers,"In my opinion, there are two mini-series' that exist that are perfect, and couldn't be improved upon in any way.  Band of Brothers, and Lonesome Dove.  Just gimme a bottle of bourbon and a blu-ray of either one, and you've made my weekend!"
Brothers,"Yes, it really is excellent."
Brothers,We have  watched it every memorial day for the last 15 years
Brothers,"Amazing mini-series, I rewatch it every now and then. You should watch The Pacific now! Just like Band of Brothers but a bigger focus on the horrors of war rather than brotherhood."
Brothers,"It was great Jimmy Fallon was really believable.

As I‚Äôve gotten older, and as the unfiltered stupidity of war comes out of places like syria and now ukraine, I have a hard time understanding the fascination people have with war media. It‚Äôs almost all moonshine."
Brothers,Literally just watched the last episode for the 20th or so time.
Brothers,"It is very good.  I also think that ""Das Boot"" is a masterpiece. (1981 or 1985 versions)"
Brothers,"Great show, I‚Äôve rewatched it more than a few times. The only part that takes me out of it all together is when Jimmy Fallon shows up in a Jeep and doesn‚Äôt even remotely try to act."
Brothers,Hot Take but I think The Pacific was the better HBO series
Brothers,To me it is a great show that belongs in history. Watching Americans portrayed as relentless good guys in 2023 makes me question all the history I have learned. How many My Lai stories were covered up to create this spot less victory?
Brothers,Just heard there is a new series coming out based on airborne troops
Brothers,"I mean it's good but it's not incredible imo.

If I was American maybe I would feel differently because of how patriotic it is but it's not all that tbh."
Brothers,"For the time, yes."
Brothers,Love to say insane things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of WWII‚Äù What on earth does that mean? What kind of person is a fan of war.
Brothers,"it portraits the war as something to admire not be disturbed by it ,it doesn't show the warcrime that are pushed apon all soldiers that have to fight"
Brothers,"That and chernobyl are the best things on hbo imo.

And they should be ashamed with the pacific. Literal ass pedaling as a sequel. So bad."
Brothers,"The book and author are great things to look into, it's also amazing that the story is basically true. And after you finish it, watch the Pacific War. It's not as good but it comes across as a more horrific war than B.o.b. 

I ponder what we have learned from their sacrifice. I'm an American, both of whose grandfathers were in WW2. And here we are lining up with Russia and China filling in the familiar roles for a terrible repeat for my son's generation. One of my gf. was in both wars, the other trained to go to intercept Japanese transmissions behind the lines but fortunately the war ended before they sent him. I believe Ukraine is destroying Russia before they become too powerful, can we avoid fighting China for world supremacy and to preserve democracy. Let's hope we do better this time."
Tiny House Nation,"For the most part that's what you get. You have to pay attention to when shows are in season and you'll get new episodes, but otherwise the bulk of cable scheduling is reruns. Either their own shows or syndication shows. And it's typically one show they play for a large block. 

Edit: really the only reason to have cable is sports, and/or if you want access to network series as they air. Or if the deal is attractive enough for you to say, 'why not? Sign me up.' 
"
Tiny House Nation,"(Re)learn how to channel surf. The only times I watch multiple episodes in a row is because something like Border Security might be the only thing I'm willing to watch during that hour, usually during the middle of the day. Sometimes I do just put on Netflix via my chromecast though. Or use RogersOnDemand which is a streaming service but for recently aired shows I may have missed or want to watch again. Also, you have to learn which channels play what at what times usually."
Tiny House Nation,"They may be playing a single show this weekend due to it being Memorial Day weekend in the US and Victoria Day weekend in Canada. Lots of channels like to due little mini marathons due to the low viewership of holiday weekends.

That aside, I have had cable for many years and have never seen any channel play one single show over and over at anytime outside what I mentioned above. I can only assume you mean they play a limited number of different shows and you were just being incredibly hyperbolic with your description.

Can you name another channel that does this outside holiday weekends/weeks?"
Tiny House Nation,"Sorry, this is what I'm talking about:

http://i.imgur.com/uXE4dp4.jpg

Also, Memorial Day is next week."
Tiny House Nation,"He said exactly what they do... they play a single show over and over for five or six hours at a time, generally playing a single show in the am and then another all afternoon until 8p.  Keep in mind these shows are basically just filler to take up space while they load up more commercials which is why the cable company is dead set on ramming their packages down your throat."
Tiny House Nation,"How many hours does each show repeat for in total? My guess would be that it's just these channels version of Sunday Block Programming, which tends to differ a bit from weekday blocks, which are usually more watched. Other than that, I'm not sure. Here in Canada, Food network and HGTV do that kind of block almost every weekend, but much less so on weekdays.

>Also, Memorial Day is next week.

Yeah, I'm Canadian and this weekend is Victoria Day weekend for us. I totally forgot the US holiday weekend is the one after us.
"
Tiny House Nation,"And I explained exactly why they do it. I asked for other examples as it isn't nearly as common an occurrence as OP would have you believe.

Care to provide some examples? "
Tiny House Nation,"For some channels, yes... however many within what I think of as the ""Discovery Network"" of SCI, Smithsonian, History, Discovery, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet, etc are definitely repeating during weekday Primetime.

http://i.imgur.com/8ziDI8j.jpg

This is also common among other shows famous for syndication- FX, TBS, SciFi (although currently they have B movies scheduled), Spike, Comedy Central, and others.

I'm really let down. I'm taking a good look, and I'd say somewhere around 75% of the channels offered on my package either show block programming during the course of the day and primetime. I'm thinking that it saves them a ton of money as it lowers the amount of different shows to air in syndication?

If the streaming sports channels weren't so horrible I would just cut the cord again, and with gigabit internet finally  here I might try it again. I just hope Verizon doesn't pull the shit Comcast did with HBO Go, forcing it to be viewed on their site.


"
Tiny House Nation,Look at [HGTV's schedule for the week](http://www.hgtv.com/shows/tv-schedule-2017.05.25.EST).  They're really trying to bring back the house flipping days.
Tiny House Nation,"Discovery always has hours of one of their Alaska shows on. Or Naked & Afraid. Science always has How It's Made. I used to watch HGTV when it would play Property Brothers for hours, until I saw every episode and got tired of it. DIY does blocks of Rehab Addict. USA always has on NCIS or Law & Order: SVU. TBS does blocks of syndicated comedies. And if they have a show in season that will be their primetime lineup. BBC always has blocks of Star Trek. Comedy Centeal does South Park all the time. 

I can go on and on but those are just off the top of my head and have nothing to do with it being a holiday. Reruns are the basic format of cable television, and then in prime time they have their network shows when it's in season. "
Tiny House Nation,"Yeah, block programming is used as a cost cutting method. I agree that it's a bit frustrating, especially given the amount you have to pay for a cable subscription nowadays. I still pay for cable myself, and I'm also considering just cutting the cord. I think it would help me feel like I'm at least getting my moneys worth, a feeling I have less and less each day with cable."
Tiny House Nation,"Yeah, that is atrocious. I'm not into shows like that, but now I totally see your frustration. Good lord, that is ridiculous. Maybe they think this will be a heavy travel week for Memorial Day weekend or something. Either way, that's just not right. "
Tiny House Nation,"That is called Block Programming, and isn't at all what the OP described.

OP described;

>all these channels like Science, HGTV, and even CN are full of a **single show** airing consecutively one after the other for **hours**.

Airing a single show would be a marathon, not block programming.

Tiny House Nation,"I heard an interview with one of the writers where they said they conceptualized the show in blocks of 3 episodes with a 2 episode finale and episode 7 being a sort of transition. 1-3 are about the fallout of cassian murdering those guards, 4-6 are about the heist, 7 is the fallout from the heist. 8-10 are the prison break and the last two wrap up all the storylines.  So your experience isnt unusual."
Tiny House Nation,Maybe the general public and Reddit just have different tastes? I loved Andor but know 0 people who watch jt
Tiny House Nation,"Andor had me in the first ten minutes.

When he accidentally killed that corporate security goon, I thought holy cow‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs a Star Wars first. An accidental killing? 

Star Wars for grownups who can appreciate nuance really appeals to me.

Sure, tastes vary‚Ä¶some people liked child Anakin, the love scenes on Naboo and Jar Jar‚Ä¶.but I wasn‚Äôt one of them.

Not even going to get started on the post-Empire movies‚Ä¶."
Tiny House Nation,"I probably would‚Äôve bailed after a few episodes like many of the others say they did, but since people I respected said it was good, I made the effort to finish it. And loved it. Sometimes you just gotta trust people I guess."
Tiny House Nation,Do we even know that people aren't watching it?
Tiny House Nation,"There's several reasons. 

1. Star Wars burnout is real and it's not considered a high quality franchise anymore. 
2. Despite popular opinion, people do in fact like Star Wars for Jedi's, Skywalkers, lightsabers, the force, the Sith, etc and taking that out of it to have a more political thriller style show isn't necessarily as appealing as some fans always thought it would be. 
3. It starts out slow so you add in all that and it becomes a turn off at the beginning for some people when you compound the above on it."
Tiny House Nation,The first three episodes of Law & Order: Star Wars was great though.
Tiny House Nation,Thanks for this because ep one was boring and now I know I gotta push through
Tiny House Nation,"Conversations like this really make me wonder just how far from normal people my tastes are.

Now, I was coming into this pretty hyped and had a vague knowledge that the show was antifa as heck, but the first three episodes were good TV. I had no problem getting invested in what was going on and really appreciated how layered the storytelling was. 

The warehouse shootout? Some of the best fight choreography in Star Wars.

I don't get the ""it was too slow"" complaint, like, at all. If ""dude accidentally kills a cop and has to murder his partner"" is a slow open for you people, what the hell do you consider fast?"
Tiny House Nation,"Some people don't understand what a proper setup looks like. This is it. It's meant to show you where he came from, who he is, and how far away from a revolutionary he is. 

Sure, you could cut the first part. You could make it more splashy, but the payoff later would not be better. 

You're not smarter than the best director in the star wars universe. You're stupider."
Tiny House Nation,"I‚Äôm not watching it for a simple reason. I watch shows with my wife after the kids are in bed, usually one episode a night. There are plenty of good shows that aren‚Äôt Star Wars shows. I am aware everyone says to ignore this but even I am having trouble getting by it and it‚Äôs a total no-go for her. We will probably get it it and hopefully love it."
Tiny House Nation,"This is kind of hilarious because I loved the first three episodes and the story it told. I loved the idea of a small scale story set on a single world in the Star Wars universe, a thriller that was unconnected to the ‚Äúempire‚Äù story of Star Wars I‚Äôd seen so much. Once I realized it was going to turn into another ‚Äúfight the empire‚Äù story I stopped watching"
Tiny House Nation,"I hadn't watched Andor because I'm sick of watching Disney shit all over every IP they scoop up, and in not giving those people anymore money. That's it. That's the entire reason. Fuck Disney is the entire reason. I"
Tiny House Nation,"OP I find myself largely in agreement with you.  When these first three episodes came out, we were already bombarded with ""Best Star Wars"" articles already so my expectations were high.  I did not like the constant flashbacks to villager Andor as it felt very plodding, a lot of it filmed in slow-motion for a dream-like atmosphere.  I found his abduction from this planet to be a very strange origin.  Andor spent a lot of episode 1 & 2 walking around town going to his friends and coworkers and telling them to cover for him.  These coworkers did not factor in to the later episodes so it felt like time wasted.  I did not like Syril Karn spending large portions of the episode looking at data related to Andor's presence and asking random staff members for more data.  I also couldn't stand the elongated half-assed speech Syril was giving in episode 2 prior to the planet landing.  It felt like they were going for some awkward comedy and it didn't hit."
Tiny House Nation,So many bad takes on this show lately ...
Tiny House Nation,"Like I told some clown earlier today on this subject: ""Nah, OP. Andor was subtle mature and awesome. I get it that you like space wizards more but Andor is for people looking for a deeper story in StarWars."""
Tiny House Nation,"Disney causing burnout because they constantly dropping shows and movies about foot note characters.

The next show will be about someone on a planet somewhere who was blowing their nose when Obi-Wan and anakin was there during the clone wars.  So the show will tell the tale of the reason why that person decided to blow their nose, or some really stupid shit like that."
Tiny House Nation,i dont watch it because i dont like star wars or sci/fi and to a lesser extent im turned off by the super-online nature of its fans
Tiny House Nation,Last I heard the numbers have been going up. Maybe I heard wrong. Or maybe you're not as insightful as you thought.
Tiny House Nation,"I have to agree with your comment regarding the first 3 episode issue. I tried to watch it during its weekly airing on Disney+. But I originally gave up after the 3rd episode. Then I kept hearing good things about it, and I thought the rest of the seasons episodes were a lot better."
Tiny House Nation,"I hated and almost dropped out of the first two episodes.

However, I strongly recommend to friends and family it‚Äôs worth pushing through. I feel like the first two episodes they are trying to bake some mystery or something that I care about into Andor and it doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs not interesting and I don‚Äôt really care. I care that a. He killed the corpo and b. He needs to get out of dodge. However once‚Ä¶ Luthen shows up I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs a guy I want to know more about. What‚Äôs going on with him is hugely compelling to me and made me watch more Andor immediately. Pretty sure I caught up to episode 7 or 8 the night I watched that."
Tiny House Nation,I‚Äôm not watching because of all the posts in this sub that can‚Äôt shut up about it.
Tiny House Nation,"I'm not watching Andor because the only thing I'm more tired of than Star Wars content is Marvel content. I'm utterly jaded. 

Also, Star Wars isn't good, but that hasn't stopped me from watching other shows, so really, that's just gravy."
Tiny House Nation,"‚ÄúNobody‚Äù is watching Andor because I‚Äôm sick of having to understand a catalog of back stories before I can figure out what the f is going on in each Star Wars story. I don‚Äôt know who the characters are and I don‚Äôt care because the writers are too lazy to even remotely sketch them out for someone who isn‚Äôt a super fan. 

Pedantic internet trolls have ruined story telling with their obsessive canon discussions of every possible show created. It‚Äôs an f‚Äôing fantasy ok? It can be whatever the f it wants to be.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on Baby Yoda. Don‚Äôt show me a baby Yoda week after week and then get mad at me when I point and say ‚Äúlook it‚Äôs a baby Yoda‚Äù."
Tiny House Nation,[deleted]
Tiny House Nation,I dont watch it specifically because of r/television and how they won't shut up about it.
Tiny House Nation,"No, it‚Äôs because I just don‚Äôt have time. And when I do have time I don‚Äôt want to dove into something we. I want to put something on so I can shut my brain down for the maybe hour of peace and quiet I get a day that is not sleeping."
Tiny House Nation,"I had a similar experience, though episode 3 did hook me in.

Andor is pretty unlikeable in the first  two episodes, just a grifter who gets other people to lie or cover for him, and has now accidentally murdered someone and is bringing the heat back home. And the connection between him and the jungle kids is not clear at all(to me, anyway)

Not saying it has to change, as the payoff is there. But I can see people needing a push from a friend's recommendation to keep going past the slow start."
Tiny House Nation,I‚Äôm not watching it cuz I was disappointed with Book of Boba Fett and Kenobi. I‚Äôll keep up with Mando but that‚Äôs about it.
Tiny House Nation,"Meh, it was the movies that burnt me out. Fuck star wars and disney."
Tiny House Nation,I fell asleep during the first episode. Maybe I was tired but I feel like that is a bad sign for a Star Wars show and I never went back.
Tiny House Nation,Andor is a perfectly average show.
Tiny House Nation,"With the exception of two episodes, Andor is a slow burn, well written snore fest."
Tiny House Nation,"Also, we kind of already know the ending‚Ä¶why bother watching?"
Tiny House Nation,"I agree with you. If the show had found a way to introduce Dedra and Mon Mothma in the pilot, it would catch people more easily. It's odd for a show to wait until the 4th episode to introduce the two best main characters. 

In fact, I'll go one step further and say that Mon Mothma should have been a co-lead of the series with her name and face equal to Cassian in the marketing. That would have better communicated to people what kind of show it is."
Tiny House Nation,"My friends who aren‚Äôt big star wars fans loved it. I‚Äôm the opposite and I got bored in the first 15 minutes. Of course, it takes time for some shows to ‚Äúhook you in‚Äù, so I‚Äôm planning on binging it sometime soon"
Tiny House Nation,"I agree that the season plays like two different shows. The first half is the a heist and the second a jailbreak but the first two episodes have a lot of character development that is low yield. The sister storyline doesn‚Äôt play out and the pseudo romance between the villains is just odd. 

Solid show but strange pacing choices."
Tiny House Nation,"I'm just not interested in the character, and the trailers screams ""generic Sci fi."" I may get around to it someday, but for now, I'm okay with not seeing it."
Tiny House Nation,"Of all the criticisms I've seen directed at Andor, ""It starts off slow"" is one of the most consistent and one of the ones I understand the most.  Yeah, I liked the start but it was definitely talky and slow."
Tiny House Nation,"Yeah, I especially love how his reaction made it clear that he was in so far over his head."
Tiny House Nation,"> When he accidentally killed that corporate security goon

Not just that ... guy walks into a brothel looking for his lost sister, gets shaken down by security goons, accidentally kills one, then murders the other."
Tiny House Nation,"I've always wanted a  Star Wars show or movie that would ignore the Jedi and The Force and focus on the world around it.  Probably because I grew up in the Star Wars drought between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, where if you wanted Star Wars you had to resort to reading novels. And they were full of this kind of stuff. 

I don't care if there wasn't a lightsaber fight or spaceship battle in the first few episodes.  It gave me the worldbuilding and character drama I've always hoped for in live action."
Tiny House Nation,"I think it‚Äôs at that point a realistic crime show that‚Äôs set in a star wars world. But that‚Äôs going to have narrower appeal than the later story arcs (4-6)(7-9) that go broader into actual, you know, Star Wars.

The show really kicked off for me in that episode 4 people are talking about."
Tiny House Nation,"A lot of people who were looking for a more grounded story set in the star wars universe got what they wanted. 

For mainstream viewers, it was boring because it didn't have any of the instantly recognizable characters or settings. We didn't have the force. Other than Andor and then Mon Mothma, every other character was new and had to be introduced. Unlike a movie where you had to tell the entire story within 1.5-2 hours so you only really get 20-30 mins to introduce the characters and their motivations. Instead,we get a long drawn intro to our three main stories: Andor with his path to rebellion and the rebellion from the point of view of the ground soldier, Deedra Meero and the empire's perspective, and Mon Mothma and the rebellion from behind the scenes. 

The long character and environment development is important to really have the huge payoff for the finale when all 3 worlds collide on Ferrix. 

This is so much different because the mainline movies are much campier and more action packed and less grounded character drama set in the star wars universe."
Tiny House Nation,"Sure, that's going to appeal to some people, clearly. But I'm sure the broader story that starts from episode 4 would have much wider appeal. It just takes so long getting there.

I especially hated the backstory on the Jungle planet. Could have been condensed to a couple scenes and if the rest is relevant, then save it for the future when it becomes relevant. Really kills an already slow show tempo in the first few episodes."
Tiny House Nation,"It was pulling between 400 and 600 million minutes of viewing in a week across all episodes released at the time.

In comparison a CBS drama like FBI pulls in 600 million minutes of viewing or 10 million viewers with Live+3 days and is for only a single episode.

Disney+ had over 46 million US domestic subscribers during Andors run (unknown total with password sharing).

CBS is available to just over 122 million households in the US."
Tiny House Nation,To your point number 2 you have to asks yourself if being a Star Wars story is more compelling or being a political thriller is more compelling. I‚Äôd say a good political thriller is more appealing at this point than another Star Wars story.
Tiny House Nation,"That's really all I wanted for this post! Hope you can push through to 4 at least. 1 and 2 are the weakest IMO.

If it's a burden, I think reading wiki and jumping straight ahead is also an option, though there is pay off to character intros in episode 2 much later in the season"
Tiny House Nation,"This right here. Genuinely shocked that anyone could find it slow. So much happens in terms of world building, character building, building and rising action. Just in the first episode too, nevermind the first three."
Tiny House Nation,ü§°
Tiny House Nation,That's an utterly stupid reason lmfao
Tiny House Nation,"Honestly, it‚Äôs part of what kept me pushing past the slow early bits. Now that I finished, i totally get why so many are making posts about it. I can‚Äôt recall a sci fi property with this level of quality."
Tiny House Nation,"If you think Star Wars isn't good then you'll likely think Andor is great, the show feels the least like SW out of any content produced on screen yet still has the core themes that the franchise began with."
Tiny House Nation,"I mean, based on your first paragraph you would love the show. No backstories needed besides that there is a bad empire fucking over the galaxy."
Tiny House Nation,"The great thing about Andor is that you basically don't have to know anything about Star Wars to understand it. My wife has seen 2 movies and some of Mando, and she loved it. Andor is a relatively unknown character and there isn't a single other central character that was previously introduced in any piece of Star Wars (other than Mon Mothma on a fairly forgettable scene)"
Tiny House Nation,"lol you are in luck. This show has literally nothing to do with any Jedis or lightsabers or Skywalkers. Nothing to do with Episodes 1, 2, or 3. And it takes place before Episode 4, and before Rogue One, so you don't need to see anything that takes place after that (Mandalorian, Boba Fett, etc)

Of all the Star Wars shows and movies it's probably the one you can jump into most without knowing anything else.

I'd even suggest people watch it before any other Star Wars tv show or movie as it sets the stage and the stakes for the entire rest of the universe before watching them"
Tiny House Nation,"You really don't need much background lore to get Andor.

I mean, there's lore there if you want it, but once you've accepted ""there's a fascist space empire"" you're good to go."
Tiny House Nation,"Sometime I think Andor fans are their own worst enemies. The insults at 'not being smart' enough to trust your own boredom in the first 3 episodes....yikes.

I completely share your feelings about episode 1, and I can assure you that Episode 4 onward is quite a different show.

The problem is that Episode 2 and 3 introduce characters that have payoff later, but simply are much less interesting than what comes after. Can you trust me about episode 4 and push past? If you like the shows I mentioned at the start of my post, you should.

If not yeah try reading the wiki and skipping to episode 4. If by the end of that, you're not at least intrigued to see more it's not a right show for you."
Tiny House Nation,"No, this guy's an idiot. The first three episodes make it work. OP is just a child.

The first three episodes leading to the conclusion of the third episode is great. It's just a lot of setup."
Tiny House Nation,I suppose you would also cut off your nose just to spite your face?
Tiny House Nation,How dare a tv subreddit talk up a great show.
Tiny House Nation,That's exactly why I gave up on Andor after I was bored with episode 1. It's much better than those shows. Consider reading the wiki for Episode 4 and seeing if that grabs you.
Tiny House Nation,Then you are essentially bragging about the fact that you have no business discussing this show and are just trying to piss people off.  And you are doing so in such a lazy manner that everyone knows exactly what you are doing and is just going to block you rather than take the fucking bait.
Tiny House Nation,"I happen to agree with your sentiment which is, ironically, the reason why supporting Andor is so important to me. 

A consumer's responsibility is to vote with his wallet. If we provide feedback to Disney that we don't want more of the crap that came before (prequels, boba fett, obiwan) but instead want more stuff like Andor, then we have a chance to turn the tide."
Tiny House Nation,"yeah, that's partly my point.  I was a huge star wars nerd in high school. The movies killed that interest for me, with the exception of Rogue One. So I had no reason to believe Andor would be that good.

It basically made up for all the crappy movies so far."
Tiny House Nation,"Yeah, that's exactly my point. Episode 1 and 2 are so dull, that I stopped watching. Episode 4 onwards are nothing like it."
Tiny House Nation,"Why bother watching Rogue One, or any of the prequels for that matter, using your logic?"
Tiny House Nation,Glad you don't run this show. You'd fucking ruin it.
Tiny House Nation,What you're suggesting would have felt so rushed and messy.
Tiny House Nation,"I mean to be fair without the first 3 episodes the rest of the show wouldn't be as good as it was, especially the finale."
Tiny House Nation,"Most importantly, it was meh, boring, nothing original and it looked like to be shaping to be the same crap as the other SW shows. Andor about to break into Imperial base, woo-hoo, never saw that happen before.

Then that break got implications."
Tiny House Nation,"It really gave a ton of nuance to the character we met from Rogue One, right off the bat."
Tiny House Nation,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt think the no Jedi thing hurt them at all. I really dig the birth of the rebellion stuff. Also, anyone who‚Äôs ever seen any Star Wars knows empire=bad, but you never really see how it affected main street‚Ä¶just normal folks trying to make a living and along come these goons putting their boot on everyone‚Äôs neck."
Tiny House Nation,I disagree with most of your post but do agree about that Kenari stuff. I assume it‚Äôs going to become relevant again.
Tiny House Nation,"I'm not really sure if that's good or bad since I don't really have a frame of reference. I think you meant CSI since I've never heard of a show called FBI, but it wouldn't surprise me if a streaming show wasn't as popular as that."
Tiny House Nation,"Think it‚Äôs mostly 2 and 3, but 2 isn‚Äôt talked about enough. I‚Äôm pretty entertained by most Star Wars offerings for what they already are, and didn‚Äôt really need a prestige TV offering to fill any gaps I felt in my Star Wars or TV fandoms."
Tiny House Nation,I'll push through. Prob will put it on later tonight lol
Tiny House Nation,"Wasn't interested before. Was DEFINITELY not interested after this sub kept trying to shove it down people's throats. Stupid or not, that's the secondary reason for me not watching it, internet stranger."
Tiny House Nation,"I mean, great. I didn't say anything about the quality of the show. Just why I'm not watching it."
What If?,"Plain and simple, they suck at world building. Time and time again they get an opportunity and they squander it. 

Fantastic Beasts for example. Could have been a really fun series about magical creatures and adventure of an interesting protagonist but they mucked it up when they did what they always do. They made it about Voldemort and the original film. 

Stop it. You have an amazing world that could be explored in so many different directions. Just live in that world."
What If?,"Sometimes it‚Äôs ok for things to end. HP had a pretty good series of movie adaptations, the second we started producing things outside the auspices of the original books it declined in quality significantly. I see no reason it would change for TV."
What If?,">I'm not sure it can really get much better.

I agree. Some movie franchises don't need to be rebooted/remade. This is just a desperate money grab for a heavily debt-ridden Warner Bros.-Discovery. This could really backfire on them."
What If?,"I think Wizarding World does have a show potential, just keep the main movie storyline out of it. This is just not rebootable. If they can do something like Starwars did with The Mandalorian, basically unrelated story of minor events that are happening in shady corners of the universe, i think they can make something work."
What If?,"I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with the movies we have right now and so many people watched them. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs potential to make a great show, but I don‚Äôt really have a strong hunger for it."
What If?,"They should do a four season back story about each of the wizards who founded Hogwarts, and then a final 5th season about the first year it‚Äôs accepting students"
What If?,"Harry Potter would make for a fantastic television show. A long form medium would allow for both a complete adaptation and an expansion of the source material (e.g., additional character development, seeing plot events that happen outside of Harry‚Äôs POV, etc.)."
What If?,[deleted]
What If?,That is up to JK Rowling. She has full creative control over the property and it would have to go through her. She seems to have an iron grip on it and would want to write and produce a show and I don't think she has it in her. She needs to pull a George Lucas and sell it so we can get new stuff.
What If?,They would've actually needed to give some character development to the trio's classmates.
What If?,"after seeing the shadow puppet bit in the deathly hollows, i am still disappointed they never did an animatix style collection. each story in a different animation style.

the story of the twins getting the map and causing hijinks 

Avatar level CGI, with lockhart's face obviously and poorly photoshopped over the real wizard in the story

the story of the 4 founders of hogwarts 

catching the 4 dragons for the goblet of fire

the quidditch world cup

guest lecturer Hermione Grainger on the history of witch travel, from broomsticks to port-keys, and all in between"
What If?,"No, there is no need or appetite for this.

If it *hadn't* already been adapted into a well liked and widely popular film franchise, then sure.  But it has."
What If?,"HBO Max has teased a Harry Potter series recently, so you're not the only one with that idea. Personally, I'd love to see the Wizarding World given the HBO treatment. Perhaps the show could follow a new group of students at Hogwarts leaving room open for the original stars to guest star or cameo as their characters. 

As for comments about poor world building, well, I agree, but that's why I want HBO to take over. If any company knows the importance of strong world building, it's the Game of Thrones people. J.K Rowling is a great idea person and brought life to Harry Potter, but HBO needs to take it the next step forward. Absolutely no reboot though. It needs to be a continuation with a new set of characters."
What If?,I don't see what a TV show could add that the movies didn't already
What If?,"The Harry Potter IP is a golden goose. Warner Bros can milk it for $1B+/yr just like Marvel and Star Wars, but they just don't have the competency of Disney to do so. Regardless of what format they pick it will be a failure. Just look at the Fantastic Beasts films or all the DCEU films and TV shows."
What If?,What if it just didn‚Äôt happen at all? I‚Äôd be very very happy
What If?,"I think that would be a much better plan, although I‚Äôd feel conflicted about watching it given how crappy a person Rowling has turned out to be."
What If?,"I have been saying for years that I can‚Äôt wait for the remakes to be made. The three main actors are just dreadful. Emma Watson just relies on her eyebrows to convey emotion and Daniel Radcliffe is terrible. 

The different directors make for a very inconsistent universe. The first few are just repetitions of ‚Äò‚ÄôArry Potterr‚Äô by every acting luvvie in the UK at the time. 

Please let‚Äôs have an epic TV series!"
What If?,"I would rather they instead just follow the lead of the upcoming game Hogwarts Legacy.

Make a series that takes place in the past so we still get that fun universe but zero overlap with the modern HP stuff that has already been done."
What If?,"If they ever did a HP TV series, I'd want it not to include any of the following: Harry Potter, Voldemort, some sort of world threatening event."
What If?,"Instead of re doing the movies In TV form, they should use the opportunity to create seasons that reflect things like: how snape became a death eater and then a secret agent for Dumbledore, how the order of the Phoenix came to be, the first wizarding war with voldy, etc. So, just give us more context to the world around us instead of recreating something that's already, by most accounts, pretty solid. I know there are lots of things missing from the books, and some things the movie only fans have to guess what happened (like.. it's a stretch when Snape sends his patrons to lead harry to the sword - if you don't read the books it's damn near impossible to truly understand this moment) but, for the most part, that's ok."
What If?,"I would have liked to see the entirety of the Quidditch World Cup on screen, but that's about it really. Somethings are better left undone."
What If?,"Put a fork in it it‚Äôs done. Look at all drama over the upcoming video game! It pretty much has everything fans want in a video games that couldn‚Äôt have been made during the films original run or previous games. 

The main sore spot is J. K. Rowling makes money off the games and she will off a tv series. Until she passes I think those trans activists and fans won‚Äôt support anything. 

Plus I think ‚ÄúHarry Potter and The Cursed Child‚Äù is canon and spoiler alert, deals with older versions already. Just let things be at this point"
What If?,"I absolutely don't think it should be rebooted. But if they have to do it I would 100% rather see it as a television show over another set of movies.

How about they make a Marauders show instead. Or a show following kids at another school."
What If?,"Just watch the Magicians. 

It‚Äôs more worth it anyways."
What If?,Which studio currently owns the rights to the franchise? I mean honestly I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt at least one cartoon and one live action series set in this universe already.
What If?,JK is a horrible human being who uses charity to launder her terrible beliefs. I‚Äôd just as soon the character of Harry Potter never have another outing in any shape or form.
What If?,"Just let it die. It was cute in its moment, but remaking it would just be a lessor copy and also JKR sucks."
What If?,i don't particularly want either tbh but yes a TV show would be more desirable.
What If?,If they're going to do it it *should* be a TV show. No sense in doing movies again when they were done right now too long ago.
What If?,Would rather they do an anime for it.
What If?,I am all for making a Harry Potter series that is literally just the books in episodic form. Book one chapter 1 is season 1 episode 1. Only 7 seasons with a varying number of episodes in each. Done and done.
What If?,Make it an animated show and it‚Äôll be the biggest win of the century
What If?,They'll do it eventually
What If?,"I know ‚Äúgritty reboots‚Äù are dumb, but i actually think a gritty reboot of Harry Potter in a more GoT style could actually be super cool"
What If?,"
I'd like to see the founding of hogwarts. The founding four, creating their houses. The greatest wizards creating the greatest school."
What If?,The films really aren‚Äôt great adaptations so I would be fine. The biggest hurdle would be getting mainstream audiences to get over the old cast
What If?,I ain't watching anything that'd give that TERF more money/support.
What If?,"Nah fuck Jk Rowling, she doesn‚Äôt need any more money."
What If?,"It'd end up the same as the Artemis Fowl movie. Too little too late, pathetically overedited, purely made as a cash grab and not because anyone actually gave a crap about the story. HP is over, man. Let it rest. Also that woman does not need any more money, she will only use it to harm people."
What If?,"I think it's a great IP for a children's show. Use magic as a device to teach kids about bullying, critical thinking, kindness, etc. Could even have episodes with ""Care for Magical Creatures"" teaching energetic kids to give their pets space and how to properly care for them."
What If?,"Would have worked way better with the characters and mystery elements being solved over time. Special effects would suffer.

Overall though, I'm just done with Harry potter"
What If?,"Please no. The Harry Potter horse has been beaten to death, just let it die already."
What If?,I want to see Harry being an auror (or however you spell it) in a grittier tv series!
What If?,I‚Äôd watch it.
What If?,"Maybe don't make it like Rings of Power, ok?"
What If?,No.
What If?,"Let‚Äôs platform some other awesome creators and writers instead. 

Really looking forward to the PJO show. I hope it‚Äôs given the budget, care, and marketing it deserved."
What If?,"Do we really need more Harry Potter content? I remember liking the books as a child, but I feel like in retrospect everything related to this franchise is pretty awful."
What If?,No longer support JK Rowling ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
What If?,JKR would still be a person with garbage tier prejudices and a terrible attitude.
What If?,">Am I crazy?

No.

Fantastic beasts (example) was structured like a tv show. I think it would have been better received if it was aired as one.

>Would you watch or even want it?

I haven‚Äôt seen the original series.

I won‚Äôt watch a reboot - I have a very low tolerance for child actor acting.  watch stuff with"
What If?,"I don't think an adaptation of the book series would do especially well. Maybe it would turn a profit but it wouldn't rake in the cash that WB would expect from a Harry Potter thing. Fans are really happy with the movies, very attached to the actors, they're not going to be very interested in a new screen adaptation that tells the same story. I think if the franchise fades into irrelevance in like, 30 years, we'll see another attempt at adaptation, but don't expect it any time soon.

Now, I do think there's some potential for stories set in the same universe. But they've been pretty bad about that sort of thing.

All this said, I'm not very interested in it myself. HP was something I enjoyed as a kid but I'd rather get new stuff. Adaptations of better stuff."
What If?,"It needs to be redone as a TV show. The movies are terrible if you haven‚Äôt read the books. They assume you have more context than what‚Äôs on the screen. If you haven‚Äôt read the books, the movies barely make sense. 

A TV show would allow them to flesh all of the nuance of the books onto the screen."
What If?,"I‚Äôd love to see a prequel series like ‚ÄúThe Marauders‚Äù that follows James, Sirius, etc with all their mischief and ultimately end with Wormtails betrayal."
What If?,"HP is dead and gone. JK Rowling made sure of that with her disgusting views on trans people.

Here's an idea: Someone write a new ORIGINAL story (and please don't be a bigot this time)."
What If?,"If they were gonna do anything, I‚Äôd hope for an animated reboot:)"
What If?,I think it would be dope if hbo did it. Could be 1 season per book. I'm curious how it would turn out
What If?,"I would watch it for sure. I thought about it too. Doesnt even have to be during the time of Harry. I actually would love a series from the HP world that showed how it all started. Would love to see for example the time period when the members found each house. The process of Salazar Slytherin creating the chamber of secrets, etc. would be pretty awesome imo"
What If?,"I‚Äôd be all for a premium show in this universe, just leave Harry Potter alone"
What If?,Endemic??
What If?,"Should be animated. Allows for more creative and flashy spells imo, and it'll be unique enough that it may not draw as many comparisons to the films"
What If?,"I've thought this since the third movie.

The thing is that a series would fit the episodic nature of the chapters really well and open up the opportunity to really delve into the best aspects of the books, the nitty gritty of the character interactions and events such as classes.

I don't trust anyone these days to make a faithful adaptation that makes the books justice honestly."
What If?,I've always said they should have made the books a tv show
What If?,"If it has to be rebooted I'd prefer a long form television series over another movie series. They did a great job incorporating the key plot points from the books, but as the books got larger lots had to be cut in the films. Even the philosopher's stone had a neat trial cut where Hermoine was essential in solving it.  


So if they did a TV series instead, it could be made fresh by adding that in as well as other sub-plots that there simply wasn't room for."
What If?,I wouldn't watch either regardless of format
What If?,"I think this is a much better idea, any movie would be harshly judged against the og films and would have to be much better than the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of them not the actually film. That‚Äôs really likely to fail but a tv show would allow more time to explore the entire book per season and could leave time for characters like peeves that got axed in the film but are important in the books. I think a deeper dive into the HP story could be celebrated by the fans. That is to say unless JK keeps trying to fight her fan base attacking influencers and saying dumb stuff that‚Äôs going to really mess up embracing a new version for many."
What If?,"Speaking as somebody who has never seen or read Harry Potter, this would do nothing to pique my interest."
What If?,"The movies were good enough and JK Rowling deserves to have her franchise fade away. HP has racist and classist undertones, and JKR herself is an abominable human being."
What If?,If HBO did it and made it darker with expanded universe stuff I could be into it but they'd need to publicly shame JK Rowling and swear she ain't making a dime off it till she supports trans people and apologizes for her dementia addled rants
What If?,I would enjoy seeing the American school of Ilvermorny.
What If?,No - it needs to be high budget
What If?,An HP reboot is just telling me that no one is making a good original series these days and Hollywood thinks bringing back things will create success.
What If?,"please let Amazon do it, the ensuing rage will be on a  worldwide scale, enough to give us a few years of quality journalistic entertainment"
What If?,"Frankly anything that puts a dollar in Rowling's pocket is off the table for me. I don't want to support people who are putting so much toxicity into the world and when its as simple as not watching or buying anything Harry Potter that is something I am finding it pretty easy to do. I grew up with Harry Potter too, I'm right in the demo of first generation readers, so there is definitely some temptation. But Rowling out there flaunting the fact that she has pillowcases full of royalty checks to cry into has made my resolve even stronger on this one."
What If?,Not interested in either until the Terfs hands are off the property.
What If?,"I‚Äôve been saying for years a Harry Potter show focused on Lily and James would be hugely successful. 

It really checks all the boxes:

* Slice of life at hogwarts. Back to basics. 

* Love story where they start off hating each other and grow to love each other. 

* Have the war with Voldemort looming in the background to slowly builds until it‚Äôs an all out war. 

* It takes place during the 80s. 

* Ends with Lily and James tragically dying. 

I honestly think it would be the biggest show out there."
What If?,"Were about to get the new game, so why need a show?"
What If?,"I‚Äôd rather they just make a series aimed at bringing younger fans in, and do little if any connections to the movies, shit even set a more modern setting and put it at Ilvermory so we can see a setting outside Hogwarts."
What If?,"With the number of movies there have been, it‚Äôs practically the same as if they did a 3 season or so series. Taken as total hours of content, it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing."
What If?,Just keep an eye out on when the copy right expires and expect a reboot for licensing reasons.
What If?,"I don't think it would ever possibly achieve the same level of success or capture the attention of a generation in the same way. 

*Harry Potter* can't be compared to the others, like *Lord of the Rings* or *Game of Thrones*. Not because it's somehow superior, but because of how unique it is. How things just happened to align in such a way, at just the right time. You have to realize, the release of this series just happened to perfectly coincide with an entire generation's growth from childhood into adolescence, and ultimately into adulthood. The release of the final entries in both the books and films coincided with that generation coming of age, but the massive appeal of *Harry Potter* as an IP did not diminish; in fact, it exploded, probably Warner Brothers recognized that this generation now had disposable income. 

Like *Star Wars*, *Harry Potter* has become a **brand**, and a lucrative licensing opportunity worth billions of dollars, sustained by the discretionary spending of millennials whose abiding nostalgia for Harry Potter is as difficult to quantify as *Star Wars* is for Gen X (but no less fruitful). 

Now, ***could*** a *Harry Potter* series be good, and successful? I mean, **absolutely**, especially with the right tweaks. The question is, **why**? Especially when the IP continues to be so profitable, despite recent obstacles like audience fatigue after several poorly-received spinoff films, not to mention JK Rowling herself becoming a polarizing figure."
What If?,[deleted]
What If?,"Depends on what audience it appeals to. If there‚Äôs a darker, grittier version of Harry Potter as an Auror for example that might be interesting. But it‚Äôs for kids, probably not."
What If?,What if we just kept it the way it is and don't fuck up the IP more than they already have?
What If?,"I did not like harry potter, for children imho"
What If?,"The problem with a TV show is anti LGBTQ JK Rowling will get royalties from the project, so no, it shouldn't happen."
What If?,You don't see the complications of booking ten year olds to full time jobs until they are adults?
What If?,"Nah, JKR thinks wrong"
What If?,"I'd still hate it, because it would provide joke-k-rowling with more money to fuel her hateful terf agenda. Yes, you read my username correctly and yes I hate it. In the years since I made this account I have grown and changed and even come out as a trans man. The magic of HP has long died for me because of its deplorable creator. I hope she soon falls out of any positive attention she may still receive."
What If?,Still not watching it until JKR is gone.
What If?,Sure as soon as JK sells the rights so she doesn't profit on it any more.
What If?,"What if a they made a good series based on a good existing or original IP instead.

Harry Potter is shit tier, and sjws would bitch and moan about it anyway."
What If?,"Nope. I will not participate in anything that puts money into the writer's pocket, and enough of the world agrees with me that I doubt any network in the industry would gamble on the project considering how strong the social push back would be."
What If?,It would have been much better.
What If?,Would be a lower budget mess with tons of filler and not much going o.
What If?,Too soon for a remake. The Fantastic Beast movies combined with all the weekend marathons are keeping it current. You could maybe get away with a show on HBOmax but I think the movie characters are too iconic still. An HBOmax show focused on different characters or a sequel series in the cursed child timeframe (but not cursed child) would be better.
What If?,"I would prefer if they re-made the series so that everything in the books actually makes it onscreen. I love the original HP movies but they often lack the content and context of the books due to movie budget/length constraints. 

Would be nice to see a more faithful adaptation in long form TV. Especially the Goblet of Fire. Where dat sphinx at?!"
What If?,Only if it was animated.
What If?,"A season per movie/book, but fuckn that means I need to sit through the Elf Liberation Front and I wouldn't wish that on anyone."
Abyss,Just to note here and its probably mentioned in the article but you need to watch the film Made In Abyss: Dawn Of The Deep Soul before starting season 2.
Abyss,I just caught up with it and learned season 2 is a hidive exclusive
Abyss,Such a great anime. Bring back megaman legend child hood vibes when me and the wife was watching it.
Abyss,"I was never able to click with this one. I didn't dislike anything in particular, just never found anything I enjoyed about it."
Abyss,"lmao this show routinely sexualizes the physical and traumatic abuse of children - when it isn't just regularly showing children in a sexual light. It opens with a preteen girl being stripped naked and tied up in bondage and routinely makes sure to tell the audience about whether or not the little robot boy has a boner and whether or not the little girl is pissing herself. It's a pretty disgusting series transparently written by a pedophile, and the content coming up in season two is worse by far than anything in season one."
Abyss,Kids look like those porcelain Hummels of children old white women like to collect
Abyss,Is it still a HiDive exclusive?
Abyss,"Disappointed to hear about all this fucked up stuff, the series sounds really cool"
Abyss,There are places on the internet where you can watch it for free. Any of the notable fansub sites will likely have it.
Abyss,Episode 10 I think is when shit starts hitting the fan.
Abyss,"This is true and people keep outing themselves in their rabid defense of it. It's always excuses and apologism and denial with this show, even though a simple glance at the author's twitter is all it takes to confirm that he's a freak who should probably be locked up somewhere.

But the show is still extremely good, and the disturbed mind of the author only adds to the fascinating and unique weirdness of it all. You just have to accept it for what it is, and decide if you can stomach it or not. Kind of like Game of Thrones, which is similarly disturbing and whose author also wears his fetishes on his sleeve."
Abyss,"i love how this is a fact that is stated every time this show comes up in discussion, and it is really easy for someone to confirm it themselves, that yes, the way it handles the portrayal of children is very disgusting, along with the source material. but if someone dares say the words ""anime"" and ""pedophilia"" in the same sentence, all of a sudden mysterious downvotes appear out of nowhere. (edit: would you look at that, right on cue)

i've seen the 1st season and i loved the scenery and the vistas. but for the love of god i couldn't keep up with it because i was feeling disgusted with the apparent morality of whoever wrote it."
Abyss,"So I thought you might be trolling because of the downvotes, but even positive reviews are mentioning the fanservice of 10 year old characters. It's amazing how much anime bullshit people just start to accept when they get into it."
Abyss,Thank you for the warning ‚ÄúBonezone420‚Äù
Abyss,Season 2 is. Season 1 is still available on Amazon Prime.
Abyss,"It‚Äôs very, very fucked up. It‚Äôs also great. They should let the author finish it in a cell lol"
Abyss,"Oh I know but I‚Äôd rather use legit streaming platforms because it‚Äôs easier.
I grew up with fan subs but I‚Äôm not going to pay for multiple platforms"
Abyss,"> . Any of the notable fansub sites will likely have it.

Small correction, they're just ripping the subs from the official source and rehosting it on their own website."
Abyss,"Yeah I just did a 30 min deep dive into this and visited the sub for the manga/anime and boy‚Ä¶I honestly feel SUPER queasy. Not only did some of the things that I read that occurs (particularly in the manga) make me want to throw up, but the defense of the fans left a really dismal feeling in me. Like pretty much everyone admits that the creator/author is a pedophile or has a weird fetish about child torture and sexualization but for some reason think it‚Äôs 100% okay. Like they really said it‚Äôs the author‚Äôs prerogative as long as no one in real life gets hurt. 

Brains are FRIED."
Abyss,[deleted]
Abyss,It's very true and made me stop watching while being a very interesting show
Abyss,"In the manga this anime is adapted from, the current arc they're airing contains panels that would very likely see it delisted from HiDive if it were actually aired. Basically a repeat of what happened with Interspecies Reviewers, but with an extra dash of pedophilia. So... significantly worse.

That being said, I'm going to guess that those scenes won't be adapted as I doubt Japanese television networks would allow it to broadcast.

Made in Abyss is a very interesting story and world aside from the author's fetishes, which do only show up occasionally, and I just skip that shit. Naturally I would prefer the author not include such things."
Abyss,"I genuinely wish I was; like a lot of people will say - the show has a really neat atmosphere and some cool ideas. I read the manga because of them, but it gets bad. And it gets worse. The point where I bailed was shortly around where season 2 will be starting IIRC - there's this moment where the girl eats some spicy food and just starts shitting herself, then all the other characters go off to have adventures. So for the next like three to five chapters it just keeps cutting back to this kid shitting herself.

Except the toilet's also a monster and so you're treated to unpleasant detail about how it's eating her shit and licking her asshole. The character is twelve."
Abyss,"You're welcome, ""Porterhaus""."
Abyss,">Oh I know but I‚Äôd rather use legit streaming platforms because it‚Äôs easier

In my experience, it's the opposite. Having paid for services like Crunchyroll, it's far more likely to experience interruptions mid-viewing since it's streaming as opposed to downloading from a torrent that while it might not be instant, only takes several minutes on a reasonable connection."
Abyss,how anime fans defend a show/manga that literally shows a 10 y.o. girl taking a shit in a sentient toilet while said toilet licks her asshole is completely beyond me. and then they come and say that they're being marginalized and discriminated against. gee i wonder why.
Abyss,I have gig internet. I don‚Äôt get interruptions. I‚Äôd rather sit and watch on the tv than on my laptop
Abyss,"Interruptions from Crunchyroll's end, not yours. When I had used their services (when they were first starting out), their servers couldn't properly stream with the influx of users. It might be better now.

&#x200B;

As for the TV part, I just cast my content to my TV to watch it there (if its worth watching on the TV at least)."
Abyss,That line up looks like a classic line up. Cowboy Bebop at 3 in the morning brings back memories.
Abyss,[deleted]
Abyss,I mean incredibly late but good i guess
Abyss,"Yeah... been reading the manga and it's one of those situations that I want to recommend it for the story, and then there's just... absolutely horrifying shit in there that makes me question if I'll even keep reading."
Abyss,The anime is incredibly tame compared to the manga
Abyss,"Normally, I can get past the loli/fetish stuff, but there is just so much of it in this story."
Abyss,"If you consider Nanachi's appearance fetish shit, then I guess the show is unwatchable. But the loli stuff that disturbed (complete wtf of a scene) me was a few seconds in one of the early episodes, other than that the anime hasn't given me sexual vibes. The manga however has some questionable things even later on."
Abyss,Yeah I tried reading the manga and couldn‚Äôt get past the naked underage-looking girls. Author has some shit going on.
Abyss,"Oh‚Ä¶there‚Äôs that shit in it too?

I saw that this was coming out on AS and started watching it (it‚Äôs been out a while, just not on AS).  I‚Äôm on episode 3 and it‚Äôs boring, overly expositional, and has annoying children that make my ears bleed.

Someone on another sub said it‚Äôs good, and I have no fucking clue what is good about it so far. Does it improve‚Ä¶ever?!"
Abyss,....I was thinking that I remember something sketchy about this manga
Abyss,AYAYAYA
Abyss,"Yep, it gets much better. I dropped it after the first ep then binged the whole thing afterwards when people kept praising it."
Abyss,"Its fantastic, would put it up there with  some of the best shows if not for the aforementioned scenes.

Those aside, I was able to get so into the story when some unfortunate things happened to a character i was actually physically sick. That was unfortunate for me but it is very rare for me to get that emotionally into a characters journey where moments can really affect me. Excellent writing overall and a very gripping story."
Abyss,To each their own. I watched like 7 episodes few years ago on the advice of the anime subreddit and it was dreadfully boring. I dropped it
Abyss,"I‚Äôm willing to give it another shot, but there better be a damn good heel-turn writing wise, because it‚Äôs so fucking boring.  It‚Äôs disappointing to hear that even halfway through the season I could still be bored.

Maybe someone can tell us an episode to skip to?"
Abyss,"Skipping is not a good idea. The slower start is very important to later understanding. 

There are two compilation films, Journey's Dawn and Wandering Twilight, which cover the series thus far. The first covers episodes 1-8, and does so in about 100 minutes. I would say watch that, then watch 9-13 in full format. The pacing is much better in Journey's Dawn."

Abyss,"I'll have to disagree. ""good tv"" as in, everyone talked about it and it blew up? ofc, but nothing else about that was good. I'm surprised I saw he has a movie coming out. I don't have an issue with people slapping others when they think they've crossed a line, if the other person is an adult and can slap back that is... but doing it on live national tv in front of a whole audience because of a few jokes is juust not it"

Abyss,i watch kdramas... so I thought that was gonna be that. i totally forgot soap operas were a thing. lmao there's even a whole ass days of our lives slap video.
Abyss,Yes and it caused him to quit acting due to people making threats against him and constantly bullying him online and in person.
Abyss,It's a parody about a movie that explores the consequences of what you're talking about. The joke here is that no lessons are learned in this version.
Abyss,people suck.
Abyss,"I didn't even click the link. I knew about the tv show, just thought it was that and yeah...don't ever wanna see a kid being hit in any capacity."
Abyss,"Along with true crime, they are popular with women most of all. I think there are a bunch of reasons. The shows confront something in society they fear, a legitimate threat they have to think about day-to-day. I am guessing it's cathartic watching it play out in the safety of their living rooms. I think ""You"" has the added element that Joe is not a bad looking fellow and he's also charming. You kind of see how someone could fall for the Ted Bundy type tricks. 

Also, my partner and I are big into horror and there was an article I read recently linking the enjoyment of horror with something called ""benign masochism"". Basically something that would be normally be unpleasant, in this case fear, feels good when you know you are safe. Another example is eating really spicy foods. I can see this being a factor with these shows too."
Abyss,"People are fascinated by what scares them. I kind of chalk it up to how men will watch war movies. The threat of having to go to war is a lot more real for men than women with selective service and such.

Being stalked or sexually assaulted or being targeted by a serial killer who hates women is more of a threat to women. So it's a more visceral fear to explore for then.

It's kind of odd because I hate to hear about that stuff. But I live with an elderly religious woman.  She can't handle cursing at all. Her daughter had to stop watching shows on HBO and such because she'll always complain about how much the cursing bothers her.  But half the time I go by her room I get to hear about awful stuff done to some poor woman being described by a narrator."
Abyss,"It's one of the darkest facets of human nature so the motivations fascinate us. Like most horror, it's a way to explore the emotions behind real fears in a safe way"
Abyss,"You is campy and funny as shit.

But i think the answe to the overall question of the post is that the darkness within humanity is a pretty interesting topic to explore.

It's the scarier type of horror because of how real it is.

The fact that normal people and lives are mostly (for your sake and mine) free of said darkness does raise some curiosity."
Abyss,"I watch the murder channel on occasion (ID Discovery) and it is quite literally mindless repetition of a formula. Content-wise, it's like a mystery and horror movie wrapped up in one."
Abyss,"> I've never seen these shows

You honestly SHOULD start by watching one."
Abyss,"Murder mysteries have thrived for centuries now because they remove the main witness, so a particularly adept sleuth is required to solve the case. Whenever a woman is the victim, she's usually a pretty girl and everyone knows she's not really being killed, so it's nice to look at the pretty girl."
Abyss,"As with all interests or genres, everyone has a different experience. But....

1 - they're telling about human nature
2 - cautionary tales, one can learn a lot about protecting themselves by learning basic commonalities of past crimes. A major lesson, IMO, is how girls are often conditioned to value manners / politeness over their instinct but that's to their detriment.
3 - personally, I was a young teen when a friend was murdered and then peripherally knew a few women that were victims of what was believed to be a serial offender. These events were all during formative years and tackling fears meant learning as much as one could. The murdered friend ended up as a case being unsolved for many years, so there was little real info in her case but much to learn from the global community."
Abyss,"When I watched ""You"" for the first time , it creeped me out. But I was also hooked to the show.
The Fall is the same. Paul Specter really made me feel disgusted, but it's a great mystery/thriller.

I think people love good thriller."
Abyss,"They aren't.  No shows are popular.  You are confusing ""do well enough to make a lot of them"" with being popular.

The most watched show on television is FBI which get 5% of the U.S. as viewers.  I'll repeat that, the most ""popular"" show on television only appeals to 5% of the population.

No shows are popular.  They just get enough viewers to be considered successful."
Abyss,"The same reason mystery and suspense novels have always been popular.

The human mind is primed to pay very close attention to Caution Tales about horrible things that happened to other people (even fictional ones). We've been learning from each other by listening to stories for thousands and thousands of years, and the thrilling, scary ones are often the most attractive and memorable."
Abyss,"Depictions of dangerous, murderous people have been popular since the Greek tragedies all the way through Shakespeare and into today. I don't need to watch TV shows about people who punch a clock and pay their bills; I'm already doing that. I want to see something more gripping and out of the ordinary and where the stakes are high."
Abyss,"Learning and developing life skills through entertainment is evident in many species.

After years of the media portraying women as victims it's not surprising that people are attracted to these types of shows. It could be a way to develop empathy or strategies for self defence.

I personally enjoy biopics that present the true story as though it was a fictional crime drama. This removes the real world bias and allows you to consider events or motivations that lead to the person acting in the way they did."
Abyss,"why are slasher films so popular and we root for the bad guy? It's because humans love to see the 'bad guy' in action and see how good overcomes him, or not."
Abyss,Humans are attracted by the Abyss !
Abyss,There‚Äôs a line where joe says something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be a good dad‚Äù as he does something insane cracks me up.
Abyss,I like the vibe of the show.  Always enjoy these types of isolated mysteries.  The acting is a bit rough though.
The Writer,"Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker worked in the first CEX tech/games trade in place. They started getting him to write cartoons for their adverts, which were published in PC Gamer, who asked him to do a few reviews too. Then he started his own tv review website, ended up writing reviews for other outlets, and several bunnyhops later, voila, Black Mirror. 

I think it's safe to say his background in games, tech, and the media circuit have all played a huge part in the show."
The Writer,David Chase growing up in New Jersey probably influenced The Sopranos. NJ doesn‚Äôt have quite the same level of impact in the show vs. the settings for True Detective and The Wire. But it‚Äôs still an interesting backdrop.

Definitely has a ton of NYC specific jokes that most people who don't live there would need to look up to figure out.

Like, Col Gentleman having a house on Christopher St, or having St. Cloud repeatedly yep 'PENIS' while they were traveling down that same street, or the various subway/tunnel references - 

* ""I'm not even at Grove St yet!""

And

* ""Don't take the Lincoln Tunnel! It's rush hour! Take the Triborough!""

The Writer,"Seth Macfarlane is from Connecticut and went to school in Rhode Island. He gets not just the southern New England accent but the cadence and way of talking. It's one of the few pop culture portayals of someone who says ""wicked"" but it feels authentic.

The Writer,"I've never been to Chicago but liked the way the city was portrayed in The Bear. Lo and behold, showrunner Christopher Storer is from there"
The Writer,The creators of South Side are actually from the south side of Chicago. So many Chicago-based shows are written by people who aren‚Äôt from Chicago and it really shows if you live there.
The Writer,"Jim Gavin, Long Beach, and Lodge 49."
The Writer,"Dana Terrace (creator of The Owl House) is also from Connecticut, and I can imagine growing up near a place called ""Sleeping Giant"" might have influenced the show."
The Writer,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea

I would include ""showrunners"" in this sentence, but I think this is what sunk Heroes more than anything. They saw how fans got attached to S1 characters, and decided they needed to keep all the fan favorites. And that meant not doing the anthology idea. Bad move."
The Writer,The only think the Writers Strike probably did was keep Peter's Irish love interest stuck in an erased alternate fascist future.  And then Peter basically never mentions her again.  Which felt like.... a weird choice.
The Writer,"The *idea* of Heroes was fantastic, it just didn't work to stretch over a 22-24 episode season and especially not multiple seasons.

Also, Breaking Bad is that old?"
The Writer,"You're right. The writers managed to hold things together for the better part of the first season but the problems were there. 

The plotting makes it very transparent that they're moving characters around like chess pieces. Character motivations will turn on a dime and not make any real sense. They'll forget they have the ability to do something when it's convenient for the plot."
The Writer,"The S1 ending was ruined by the network's last minute insistence that there be another season with same characters.  They weren't all supposed to survive.  S2 was going to follow an entirely different set of characters.   As a result, they had the S1 characters become too powerful too quickly, something they had to figure out how to undo in later seasons. 

Arguably, this is to blame as much as the writer's strike."
The Writer,"It all goes back to the decision making about what season 2 would be.  A few characters like Claire could easily continue for multiple seasons.  But it was just so obvious that many of them wouldn't work for long run.  The whole season 1 plot was stopping Sylar.  Then in season 2 he's back but no one really knows what to do with him so he meanders around looking for a purpose.  Ditto Hiro and Peter, two characters so completely overpowered the writers had to tie themselves in knots to keep them from being a deus ex machina every episode.  Hiro could have worked as a recurring character the way future Hiro was depicted in that one season 1 episode - just dropping in a couple times a season trying to fix something, but mostly failing to take all the variables into account.  Instead, it was just ""lets find lots of ways to temporarily depower him and keep him removed from the main plot but still on the show.  They even felt the need to bring Nikki back.

It's hard to blame it all on the writers as it seems pretty clear the network mandated that everyone return, but even then, that doesn't explain why the reboot season was so weak.  Every time there's a reddit post about what show declined the most in quality from beginning to end, Heroes tops the comment section (usually followed closely by Sliders, which kind of had the opposite problem in that it kept jettisoning cast members)."
The Writer,Heroes had no story after the origin.  And they committed the cardinal sin of making heroes too powerful without weakness.
The Writer,"I think the issue is that many people don't understand that scripted production stopped during the writers strike, believing establiahed tv writers were simply replaced with randos. (And season 2 of Heroes is bad enough that it kinda supports that.)"
The Writer,This is why ‚ÄòLost‚Äô has no reason to be as good as it was. Creating 24 episode seasons for a mythology series is almost impossible for a writers room.
The Writer,"They lost Bryan Fuller, who has a proven record of being fired and that ruining a show."
The Writer,"All the evidence you need is Heroes: Reborn

NBC gave him another chance with no real creative restrictions, and it‚Äôs even worse than the original was during the strike."
The Writer,"I am actually 50/50 on this. I do think it got worse by writers strike, but it was never going to be any great show either. 

I kind of see this more of a case like Prison Break, where it was meant to be 1 season. Then the show got super popular and they just ran with ""whatever"". Which would also apply to the messier final episodes of season 1. They needed to quickly map themselves to s2 with some kind of cliffhanger bullshit. Prison Breaks mediocre seasons were just more fun than Heroes though. 


But yeah, I did not ever think this would become some great show after watching s1. I thought it would be enjoyable adventure, with some interesting characters. But it wasn't even that."
The Writer,"100%.  The writers made the conscious choice to change the ending of 'Part Two' due to the strike so that part three was a fresh start rather than the second half of the virus storyline.  But that change was as much due to the poor reception of season two as a whole as anything-- if it was worth sticking with that story there was nothing stopping them from doing so.

The show was already bad by the time the writers strike happened.  The show was fundamentally flawed to begin with-- they created interesting and popular characters with powerful abilities that they did not have enough money to use to their potential on-screen, forcing them to rely heavily on copouts.  This was evident by the time the season 1 finale came around, and wasn't something they could fix without harming the show."
The Writer,"Honestly I think you give season 1 too much credit. It all felt very formulaic and rote. And nothing ever made any sense. It felt very JJ Abrams ""mystery box"". Like they billed it as ""look how smart and clever we're being"" and then in the first episode there's a solar eclipse seen from every spot on the planet all at once that never has any impact on anything but the logo."
The Writer,"I love the fact they saved the world and then had to save it from something worse

Nuke in Ny, then global plague and then i gave up mid way through season 3 but the glimpse hiro got it looked like the destruction of planet itself

Just should of let the cheerleader die"
The Writer,Heroes needed the story planning to the same degree that dark had. But it changed to much mid course.
The Writer,"The OP is doing gods work. Every single day (usually more than once a day) someone brings up the show Heroes. I‚Äôm just sick of all the real people who definitely exist trying to push their flawed narrative on me. It‚Äôs even more flawed than Sylar‚Äôs redemption arc.
I really hope the op takes down Kings next, that sacred cow is due."
The Writer,"I 100% agree. Even the first season was bad. The constant switching of main characters between good and evil was lazy writing. The powers coming from an eclipse but then also from a genetic mutation made no sense. The inconsistent powers thing was super lazy (Hiro can stop time, teleport, and time travel, but only when it won't actually help the plot). The Hatian just made things super boring by canceling out other people's powers. Syler was a great villain, but he was the only interesting character on the show."
The Writer,"Absolutely. Season two was actually not terrible, certainly not as great as the early part of season one and had a rushed ending, but certainly watchable.

Season 3 is some of the dumbest television I‚Äôve watched and it was completely unencumbered by the writers strike."
The Writer,I am still waiting to find out how saving the cheerleader will save the world.
The Writer,"If it ended after season one it would have been  legendary and talked about for years along with the likes of Firefly ( still have not seen that ).   I was a huge fan of season 1 , but stopped watching after one or three episodes of season 2.  I did not even realize there was a season 3 or 4"
The Writer,"the show was good during the introductory episodes, the easy part ; once the plot finally started it crumbled on itself"
The Writer,"""Save the Cheerleader save the World!"""
The Writer,They just *could not let go* of that fucking Sylar.
The Writer,"As a massive Heroes fan I agree. Many years later I went to rewatch the series and after three or four episodes I just gave up and that was during its peak first season. The entire series is just an endless carrot on a stick of mysteries. Every episode ends with a stinger question which is solved in the next episode or two only for a new question to be posed. If you know the answers to all the mysteries then theres nothing there. It's just straight up boring. If the writers strike was to blame then it would have picked back up after it was done. Yeah we could say they needed time to recover, but it had years to do so and it never did. 

Heroes was a flash in the pan relic of its time."
The Writer,"The biggest ""WTF"" moment I remember regarding the failure of Heroes is when Peter and his brother confronts Sylar in an office. It should have been a grand battle scene but then I believe Peter fucking slams door behind us and we never get to see the fight."
The Writer,"Thank you!  
The writers strike only affected the season 2 finale where the virus was supposed to get out and they had to quarantine the city.  
The ireland plot sucked, the founders story was half thought out and ultimately pointless. Bringing Sylar back was a mistake, at least straight away. Hiro would be too overpowered so they had to send him to the past. Nobody knew what was going on with Nikki. The new orleans characters were cool and then never mentioned again...."
The Writer,"I pin-pointed the exact moment the show jumped the shark - it's when HRG says his name is Noah. Last episode of season 1, right before they fail at killing Sylar, with his stupid spinach can. This was before the writer's strike so I agree with you."
The Writer,Pushing Daisies was ruined by the writers‚Äô strike
The Writer,Heroes was one of those shows that did build up well and payoff poorly.
The Writer,"You mean that in one of the first episodes when high schooler Claire goes to a party one night, falls and gets a stick jammed in her head and ‚Äúdies,‚Äù wakes up on an autopsy table with the Y-incision done, pushes her chest back together and sneaks out of the morgue and shows up in the early morning hours at home by seemingly just being a few hours late was bad writing all along? No way!"
The Writer,Exactly. I remember the finale was such a let down
The Writer,"Ending was fine, the problem was bryan fuller leaving"
The Writer,The season finale for the first episode of Heroes was one of the most disappointing finales I ever remember watching.
The Writer,"you're 100% correct.

Heroes didn't even have a fully solid first season.  the first half was great: introduced a variety of characters with interesting powers discovering themselves and struggling to leave their mediocre lives to get wrapped up in a phenomenal adventure.  by the mid-season finale, we had the whole SAVE THE CHEERLEADER, SAVE THE WORLD mantra - and it was great!  suddenly our separate heroes were starting to cross paths and threads pointed towards potential team-ups and stuff -- similar to Stephen King's THE STAND.  --but then they all went back to their lives... the world had been saved.  the end.  ...and then shit started dragging on.  ...the second half of the season was lukewarm and directionless -- and that finale was the most disappointing episode of tv in history; you're right, two superpowered dudes just punch each other a bunch and one turns into a bug and escapes while everyone else just stands by and watches.  ...yawn.  


i watched half of season 2 and gave up.  fun characters, fun ideas, but just a meaningless show with no direction.  sleepy showrunner?  (i've little respect for jeph loeb)"
The Writer,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea, and had no plan.

This. Although I don't think it was the writers who gave up on it, but rather the Network requiring it.

Even worse was keeping the Villain. He shouldn't have returned and they ran out of things to do with him pretty quickly."
The Writer,That's the secret.  Heroes was never good.  Not the first season.  Not any season.
The Writer,"The Writers Strike didn't make them constantly fudge the rules on healing and brain injuries.

It didn't cause them to write a plot where an eclipse gave people powers, even though they already established that wasn't what happened.

It didn't make them forget that Peter could walk through walls, and didn't need to rip a safe open with telekinesis."
The Writer,Well thought out and spot on
The Writer,"The ending of s1 where he gets away was bullshit and it was doomed from the start

there was clearly no plan and they were just doing more seasons for the sake of it"
The Writer,"Totally agree. Tim Kring is one of those writers who has great ideas, great plot concepts, but then has absolutely no idea whatsoever on how to resolve those plots.

His follow up series with Keifer Sutherland (can't recall the title) had a similar lifecycle. Great high-concept, intriguing plot threads.....that never got resolved, the story became so self-referential it was literally up it's own arse, and the audience walked away.

I have a similar take on Lost but I won't hijack your thread for that. It'd be good to see more of these kind of threads in here, well reasoned arguments that go against the grain."
The Writer,"> Heroes was a flash-in-the-pan BAD show

This is the correct take. Tim Kring makes nothing but shit. The first season of Heroes was an absolute outlier."
The Writer,I agree. Season 1 was a ton of fun to watch. But the finale was a big let down. And seasons after the writer's strike still sucked.
The Writer,"In my opinion

Season 1 &2 were mostly Perfect

season 3 had a Great start but the ending was just nothing special >!WOW Surprise Sylar again the main Season Finale Villain!<

Season 4 with the >!carnival !<was  a really good idea but the writers got carried away and did a lazy job   I don't mind the Bad Guy and the Story  the >!whole past of the  Founder of the Company and Carnival  !<but the implementation was bad"
The Writer,"It remains that the writers‚Äô strike marked a big shift in character motivations, plot threads, and quality. The whole pandemic thing suddenly went away, Peter completely forgot about the Irish woman that he left in the future, and many characters just felt very different. Sure, maybe the show wasn‚Äôt as good as it‚Äôs first season. But without the strike, I feel it may have remained fairly enjoyable for me as the quality petered off instead of dropping off a cliff like it did."
The Writer,">other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Breaking Bad season 1 ending was famously impacted by the strike.  You cannot just use 2 of the most popular shows possible in the era as your comparison baseline."
The Writer,It suffered from JJ Abrahams mystery box syndrome. No one cared to develop what‚Äôs inside the box.
The Writer,"The writers strike made a bad problem *worse*.  


Heroes was never supposed to last beyond the first season.  They changed the ending to keep key characters alive and allow another season when it proved popular enough.  Problem of having way overpowered characters remained.  Those characters were nerfed to make writing less challenging but there was no recovery happening."
The Writer,"Honest question but how old were you during the writers strike? Your post reads like someone who looked up the stats of a great athlete from before they were into sports and decided they knew everything about that player.

Did you have this opinion back then? I feel like seeing it happen in real time versus binging the series and deciding 15+ years later what happened is different."
The Writer,Did this really needs its own post?
The Writer,[deleted]
The Writer,"Wasn't this the show that started with an eclipse visible everywhere on earth?

So, in effect, flat earth?"
The Writer,Lost started spiraling season 4.  IMO its when it really became clear they might know what they are doing and are just throwing out more mysteries that won't be solved.
The Writer,"No

Season 3 wasn't perfect, but it was a million times better than season 2, which ridiculously bad."
The Writer,"The movie ""Push"" is what Heroes should have been.  Do a time jump and have people on the run and in hiding from Govt. orgs all over that want to weaponize the people with powers, as it is all out in the open now."
The Writer,"I quite enjoyed heroes. This is why i never bother with reviews of movies or tv shows. 

100% of the time (yes 100%) i see someone bash a show or movie it's always something I've seen and everything they blabble on about is their opinion and their opinion only. I wish other people would do the same. Maybe some of these obscure movies and shows will finally get some love."
The Writer,"Nah. I was there. that show was alright for season 1. Writer's strike, and then it completely shit the bed."
The Writer,"The few episodes of season 1 were not great, but they had so many ideas, characters and storylines floating around a pile up was bound to occur.  Especially if it makes it seem like was destiny or something.  Having time travel in a story can be a dangerous thing, I have seen done badly so often."
The Writer,This was a show that needed to be one and done. Maybe it was possible to get another few episodes out without tanking the premise. But in the end it was a closed story from the start.
The Writer,I rewatch season 1 every so often and it really does fall apart in the finale.
The Writer,"Was the first season good?  Seriously, I remember it being just okay. Haven't seen it since in first aired, but I just remember a lot of lazy storytelling and the cheapness... iirc the finale was during a prom and had 5 people in the whole thing.  Their budget for extras must been nil."
The Writer,I have tried at least 4 times to get through the show but hit a wall around season 2 episode 4 I came to the conclusion that the show just want for me.
The Writer,I think the show would have been excellent if it had to work with 10 episode seasons.
The Writer,"Agree it wasn't all the strike, that couldn't have helped though.

Seems like more an issue of direction.  When they decided to keep all the characters that became popular, things got messy.  Plus, going full fledge time travel will always break plots."
The Writer,"I just rewatched the first season and pretty much agree with this. I loved Heroes because it clearly came from a love of comic books and comic characters. I even like the seasons past season 1 just because they‚Äôre silly, melodramatic, and take themselves far too seriously. After watching the ‚Äúgood‚Äù season again, it did have all the things people seem to dislike about the the later episodes, just with slightly better writing. It‚Äôs not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it was, but I still love it for what it is."
The Writer,"Yeah, the WGA strike didn't ruin it, it just cut the 2nd season massively. If they had a good idea they could've just continued with what they were going to do.


If they had stuck with the anthology idea, sure - but they didn't



The WGA strike **did** fuck over Pushing Daisies, though."
The Writer,It‚Äôs not like season 1 was that great
The Writer,The average redditor doesn't seem to have any clue what the writer's strike was and how it affected television.
The Writer,"I watched the first season, it started great, but towards the end it declined quite rappidly. Keep people dead, regardless their popt. 

And can somebody please explain to me why the cheerleader needed to be saved?"
The Writer,"Excellent post, and I agree 100%. 

But you forgot to list the most important point of evidence: the writers' strike occurred at the end of the writing of season 2 and before season 3, and **not** between the production of seasons 1 and 2 as most people who spread the myth believe."
The Writer,They should have stuck to their original plan and killed off all the season 1 characters in the finale
The Writer,Thats debateable but it did change the path of the season and who knows what different stories could have come from that
The Writer,"I never watched Heroes, but you have a very well written argument, so I believe you."
The Writer,"I don't remember it in a lot of detail, but I thought season 1 was really great.  I don't recall being too disappointed in the last episode but I don't recall being blown away either.  I don't think I even made it through season 2 it just got bad and uninteresting after season 1."
The Writer,"Heroes should have ended at end of S2, everything else was unnecessary."
The Writer,S1 was good....S2 did indeed feel like the SAME shit. After that I just lost interest. You could just tell that they had no real overarching plot from season to season.
The Writer,"I liked most of the show tbh, it wasn't the greatest but probably gets more hate than it deserves. Maybe just because there was less content then."
The Writer,Even season 1 had cracks in its plot. Remember the nuclear guy who everyone thought was going to blow up the New York. He was shot by Company agent who was working for people who were plotting for nuclear detonation in New York. Then why did company agent tried to kill the key person for the plot?
The Writer,I think what really hurt them was losing Bryan Fuller.  When he came back for a couple of episodes in season 3 those were just so much better than the rest of the episodes.
The Writer,"> While the second season WAS disrupted by the Strike, other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Wait, I'm sorry, in my mind Breaking Bad and Heroes are from two completely distant and separate eras of my life and my brain is having a really hard time wrapping itself around this."
The Writer,Save the cheerleader save the planet.
The Writer,"I think it would be a whole lot better if it debuted today, to rival ‚ÄúThe Boys‚Äù and was just 8 - 1 hour long episodes per season."
The Writer,They only had one season in the can. After that they were scrambling when it became a hit. so many shows fall into the sophomore slump
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"When I say streaming has taken the soul out of TV, these are the little things I'm talking about."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,Oh boy...
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"The whole Friday Night Death Slot always seemed so unnecessarily cruel to me. 

I get that if a show isn‚Äôt getting the ratings the network will take it out of its timeslot for something that can pull in those numbers, but, like, instead of outright cancelling it they put it on a time they know it‚Äôll fail? Seems like a foregone conclusion that if you move a show to such a time no one will watch it, so it‚Äôs more like rubbing salt in the wound than anything"
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"I like a self-referential ad. I've never seen it but apparently ABC made a promo for Moonlighting, a show notorious for missing air dates because of production running long, that showed network executives impatiently waiting for new episodes to arrive."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,i miss not being able to sleep and kind of watching late night TV only to be startled awake by the end of programing test screen with the tone comming on
Crime Diaries: Night Out,[deleted]
Crime Diaries: Night Out,The lower expectations on Fridays weren't always bad. I think The X-Files changed the game when I was a kid and Friday tv changed from the death slot to the nerd slot. You got more niche shows that wouldn't have a chance at other times.

Crime Diaries: Night Out,"But also shows were historically often moved there to be gotten rid of. The OG Star Trek had its budget slashed and was moved into a timeslot no one saw for Season 3, so surprise surprise the quality went down and it was swiftly cancelled. 

It‚Äôs almost like the execs are trying to make a show bad on purpose (by diverting the funds elsewhere) to set it up for failure and turn fans against the show. which is how so many great series were sabotaged by their channel. You can see that, right?

Hence why ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô and ‚ÄòUS Network TV‚Äô are often sadly a contradiction in terms; everything has to cater to the lowest common denominator, which is the reason why everyone has become so dumb and we have all these problems now. Oh well"

Crime Diaries: Night Out,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,[deleted]
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"I‚Äôm not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor‚Äôs ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That‚Äôs still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It‚Äôs kind of hard to get into movies when you‚Äôve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"I‚Äôm not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and No√´l Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,Times change.
Crime Diaries: Night Out,[deleted]
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn‚Äôt get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn‚Äôt until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton‚Äôs James Bond but also couldn‚Äôt take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn‚Äôt require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."

One is small and occupied/kept afloat by the same 10 guys who are there (almost) every night. They even have holiday parties at the bar with just those guys and their wives/families. I went there once and it was like walking into a slightly less depressing Moe‚Äôs Tavern.

The other bar is the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù bar where generally people in their 20s go. There is a dance floor but no one ever dancing. No live music, but a juke box that people rarely use. And a couple pool tables. And always, always full of smoke. They really only open on Friday‚Äôs and Saturday‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only time they get any business.

Real life is shitty and doesn‚Äôt look, sound, or feel like most things on TV. They‚Äôre selling the audience an escapist fantasy where they can see pretty people do awesome, stupid, interesting, dramatic, cliched things. 

Most people don‚Äôt want to watch sort-of-6-but-small-town-solid-8 people make awkward conversation at a sticky bar leading to depressed, shitty choices."
Crime Diaries: Night Out,"You often need a way for various characters in shows to interact in a natural way. The small town bar trope exists because it‚Äôs cheaper and easier to have one set of a central location where all your characters could believably interact with one another and have both private and public conversations. 

A bar allows you to have characters share information with one another/the audience that they normally wouldn‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt disclose. It allows you to use many various tropes that will further the plot easily. Like [‚ÄúDrowning My Sorrows,‚Äù](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Drowning_My_Sorrows) [‚ÄúIn Vino Veritas,‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas) and many more. 

Generally in a small town in the USA/Canada you have a market and some stores, a local diner/restaurant (along with some chains), a movie theater, schools, a bar (or bars), some type of amphitheater or assembly hall, churches, city hall, etc‚Ä¶ A bar is the single location that works best where ALL your characters could have an excuse to be at during various times and is a location where you can have ‚Äúsecret‚Äù conversations, private conversations, and public discussions/proclamations/speeches with all your characters. 

A school or church or most anywhere else, wouldn‚Äôt make sense for [a drifter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter) to make a natural appearance and espouse dialog that furthers the plot. 

There is also usually a TV in the bar which allows you to further the plot and bring news from outside of the town via [‚ÄúCoincidental Broadcast.‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast)

You also get to use the [‚ÄúRecovered Addict‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict) and  [‚ÄúOff The Wagon‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon) tropes to enable [‚ÄúCharacter Derailment‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment) and other tropes and divulge to the audience some tragic backstory or important plot details. 

The bar is usually used as a window into the outside world and way to get information from the rest of the world to the townspeople."

It's where everyone went to hook up and get laid. It was the only party place in town, so you never had to wonder where everyone was.

It's nice that you brought up New York Undercover, I didn't know it was streaming.  I know BET was airing reruns recently and I watched a few episodes.  I used to watch it back in the day, I think I stopped around Season 3 or around there.  It was a really long time ago, so I can't really elaborate on what exactly changed, but I know I wasn't enjoying it as much as I used to so I stopped watching.  It was a very unique show for its time, in that the two main characters, detectives were minorities and their captain was a woman.  And it felt natural, it didn't feel like they were pandering.  It had that Dick Wolf feel like Law and Order, but it had a more gritty, on the ground quality since it was just about the cops.  I'm just giving my really basic assessment; again, I hadn't watched it in a very long time until recently, and only a couple of episodes at that.  Malik Yoba and Lauren Velez seem to have had pretty decent careers, I still see them in stuff to this day.

Undercover,"SNL.  They had the hottest actor currently in the world, Pedro Pascal, and bombed in all live skits with him."
Undercover,"Exclusive for a dub of a show, but the original DiC production of Sailor Moon ended up suffering a loss of quality rather rapidly with even the original English dub's voice actors outright stating that they agreed with fans that the dub was completely rubbish. In fact, the show's second voice actress for Setsuna/Trisha/Sailor Pluto, Susan Aceron, even said that it was a mistake that she was cast to be in that series at all.

There's actually a known and stated reason for this, however, as given by Roland Parliament who was the voice of Umino/Melvin and the show's second ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) director in his autobiography *Sailor Moon Reflections*.

In short, the first voice of Sailor Moon, Tracey Moore, was also the show's first ADR director but was so heavily overworked that she suffered from burnout and quit thirteen episodes into the show's production (episodes 1-11, 15 and 21), so when she quit she was replaced with Roland.

They tried to keep her in the role by replacing her as ADR director with castmates who had smaller roles in the show. But because of clashes with a producer at Optimum Productions, Nicole Thuault who also heavily clashed with Moore while she was the ADR director, Parliament was fired from the role as ADR director as well as his replacement John Stocker, who played Rei's grandfather in the dub.

When Optimum completed their original recording sessions for the show, DiC decided to stop licensing the show and left them stranded. But Cartoon Network and YTV wanted more episodes dubbed so they paid for it themselves and ordered the adaptations directly. All 77 remaining episodes... in four months. Optimum couldn't get most of the original cast for a number of reasons - some of the voice actors hated the conditions and refused to come back while at least one of them outright couldn't due to being on maternity leave.

After this, Thuault decided that she might as well take on the role as the show's ADR director instead. This was despite the fact that despite being a producer on the show's English dub, *she didn't fucking speak English* and in fact needed a translator on-site to help her communicate with the cast and crew. By the way, did I mention that Optimum was based out of Ontario?

So, the ADR director wasn't able to properly quality control the recording, they had to adapt 77 episodes of the show in four months and most of the original cast was gone. They only had four hours to record each episode and took were only allowed to do two takes for each scene/episode and decided to use the one that wasn't shit. Quality dropped immensely, the seasons adapted were widely hated until the entire series was re-dubbed by Viz and it proved to be such an old shame that the DiC dub will never be rereleased again.

And for added hilarity, when they were doing the translation of the scripts into English, because of a stupid term of the contract that they were using, they weren't adapting the original Japanese scripts of the show but the earlier French dub produced in Paris.

Oh, and here's something funny I wanted to bring up as well. They had to make some changes to the show to appease US censors, mainly because the show could actually get somewhat violent for US audiences. One pair of junior high school students were expressly a pair of lesbians in the original Japanese version which was turned into them being cousins in the English dub... but they didn't fully remove all of the pretext, so it made them look like teenage *incestuous* lesbians instead."

Undercover,Ive never seen a show drop as hard as game of thrones
Undercover,"Biggest drop in quality I've seen in a show was Man in the High Castle.

The first two seasons had some really incredible writing.  The alternate historical worldbuilding felt really thoughtfully crafted and rich, the tone and setting were suspenseful and engaging, and the character writing was generally fantastic.  I've heard some criticism that the main couple characters felt a little bland but I feel like that was intentional and in a way fits with the bleak scenarios they are in.  But regardless, any lack in Juliana's character is easily made up for by an astounding cast of deeply written and rich characters (friends and foes) around her.  I know I am absolutely not alone in saying that John Smith had the potential to be one of the greatest television characters of all time if they had stuck the landing - his story and how it was told was truly one of the most engrossing and compelling stories I've seen in film.

And then it feels like between seasons 2 and 3 the entire writing team got scrapped and replaced.  Season 3 kinda just felt like it had lost a bit of an aim and was missing some depth, but was by no means unsalvageable... And then season 4 jumped the shark, flew right off a cliff and landed in an absolutely crushing disaster of a dumpster fire.  Gone was any sense of historical basis and every single carefully crafted and compelling character arc took a major random turn into stupidity and pathetic oblivion."

&#x200B;

And then the reboot happened..."
Undercover,"It's less about the ""real life"" thing and more because they had no idea how to write an interesting show about Frank as President and Season 3 became bloated and boring. There were a *lot* of comments on this very sub about how people had trouble paying attention to Season 3."
Undercover,show was trash even before all the spacey stuff happened. season 3 was already dumb as fuck
Undercover,"Yup, at the season 3 finale."
Undercover,"I was about to tap out during mid season 3, but I wanted to see how it wrapped up as I didn't remember details. 

But yes, jarring to say the least."
Undercover,"Two non white cops with a female boss. Characters using racial slurs to help drive the point of the episode home (for example white kid accused of bombing black churches). Pretty edgy for the time but it was Fox, after all. 

One thing the show portrayed was a strong, black man that was an attentive father. It often bucked stereotypes but sometimes would fall victim to some obvious preaching. 

Then maybe halfway into season 3, the show became more generic, and lost some of the ""urban"" feel. I'm as white as they come, but grew up in an area where I was the minority. 

Another thing that stuck with me was the subject matter. Lots of kids being killed on camera, and other brutal crimes relating to children either as victims or perpetrators. 

Lastly, it made NYC look just as dirty as it really was at the time."
Undercover,"Oh I've seen it, multiple times. While I agree with what you're saying, that debate has had its day in the sun."
Undercover,"I didnt like the second season, but felt the 3rd was pretty good"
Undercover,Ugh. That one really annoyed me. It was my introduction to sci-fi and I immediately loved it. Recently watched the series again as well.
Undercover,Fell off a cliff mid season 1
Undercover,Hot take.
Undercover,"*opens mouth to bring up* [*Mario Kart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w)

*closes mouth*"
Undercover,no u
Undercover,first season was amazing and incredibly popular.  then the writers strike hit.
Undercover,"There is a a behind the scenes documentary on YouTube about it.  There was an edict tfrom the network during season 3 to tone down the urban feel of the show.  At the same time, the two leads basically demanded more money before the start of the season. Cooler heads prevailed but everyone on the show was shocked when they got that final script and seeing that Eddie was being killed off.  Keep in mind, the ratings for the show were still strong.

The killing of Eddie Torrez essentially killed the audience.   Eddie/JC were the show. And it is especially frustrating when you realize how unneeded it was. In the storyline they had already written his character off by having him have to move to a different precinct.  And, he didn't die in a multi-episode arc or from a meaningful villain like Ice-T.  It was a random villain of the week that blows him up.

Audiences were pissed, and within a few episodes of season 4 it was clear they weren't coming back. The show was canceled pretty quickly into season 4."
Undercover,"Yes, I believe New York Undercover was part of Fox's Thursday night bloc, which were all shows with a (mostly) minority cast.  I believe it was Martin, then Living Single, then New York Undercover (since Fox's prime time slot was just two hours, and still is today).

Your view on what changed about the show sounds about right.  I can't point to anything specific (that time/memory thing yet again), but it started feeling ""samey"".  A part of television since its inception has been shows about cops and the law, and so many of them seemed to hit the same exact note.  New York Undercover appealed to me because it felt so fresh and raw compared to the other cop shows airing at that time.  My theory is that the ratings were flat and the consultants at the network wanted to boost them up, so they ""retooled"" it and took away what made it fresh and raw and different.  Again, something you see to this day."
Undercover,Absolutely. It does make you wonder how much bigger a deal stories like yours would have been if social media had been a thing much earlier.
Undercover,"Yeah, there was a point where everyone literally stopped caring about the infectious plague currently in their research station cause the writers were already on the next idea lol"
Undercover,"It‚Äôs true, it was just different the cops weren‚Äôt white, that was all it had going for it, and I watched it every week"
Undercover,I also loved the chicken wings commercial
Undercover,"There's nothing wrong with Saturday Night Taped but Saturday Night Live is broke.  

I love Update, but even it's writing is getting worse."
Undercover,"Don't let the writers off that easy. The strike is why the season was only 11 episodes long, not why those 11 episodes were bad. Scripted TV shut down for a few months, they didn't replace their writers."
Undercover,"Yup. I remember how he died but was surprised at the fact he'd have to leave the precinct due the marriage. Ok fine, so leave, don't show him on screen. Made no since. Something similar happened on SVU where Rollins quit the force to become a professor. In reality she didn't get the money she wanted, so they wrote her off. 

People underestimate Latin/Hispanic support. This was a prime example of that."
Undercover,"Well, name another cop drama that showed 90s NYC for what it actually was? Nothing about this show was pretty."
Undercover,"Me too, but not a live skit."
Undercover,"And it continued to be crap in the following seasons. 

The writers strike maybe made the downfall quicker but it was inevitable. It's clear that season 1 was the only one they really had figured out a story to tell. After that it was just milking it and making shit up as it went along."
Undercover,"That doesn‚Äôt make it good tho, accuracy doesn‚Äôt equal quality"
Undercover,Magnum and Higgins hooking up... that is just wrong on so many levels.
Undercover,Premiers Sunday Feb 19th on NBC
Undercover,"There's a new Magnum? And, they cast a wimpy Mexican guy for the part? This is just sad. Bring back Tom Selleck!"
Undercover,"We had an Undercover Boss thing when I was in the Navy.  They had a Rear Admiral come onboard and pretend to be a Seaman.  So yeah, the Navy will waive peoples age to an extent.  But this dude was clearly old af and he carried himself like an officer.  Everyone knew day one who he was anyway lol"
Undercover,Only good thing about it is we got Matt the radar technician
Undercover,[deleted]
Undercover,"I'll leave out the name of my company but my CEO went on... 10ish years ago. 

At the end of the episode he ""learned"" about a few (crazy minor\small issues) and said we need to fix it!

There were no changes to the actual day to day work, if anything we just outsourced more jobs. He gave some scholarships to like 3 employees, of not even out company, but franchisees within our company. 

In general it was a total puff piece with a real aim to bring more awareness to our brand and paint the CEO in a positive light."
Undercover,"It is basically the same shit in every single episode. 

Every worker they shadow has some kind of problem that they need help with. They always have a sob story that is supposed to make the audience feel sympathetic to the worker and then at the end of the show CEO gives away free shit to the worker to make them appear as a generous and benevolent CEO. Rinse and repeat. 

The only time when the show is actually entertaining is when one of the workers is a cunt."
Undercover,"**Classy** propaganda :  [Undercover Boss Rewarded His Waitress with a Breast Augmentation, whilst  another waitress was fired.](https://people.com/tv/undercover-boss-one-waitress-wins-a-boob-job-and-another-is-fired/)"
Undercover,My CEO did it and got in a lot of trouble with the feds because he was doing jobs he was not cleared to do (proper background checks/training etc)
Undercover,My favorite moment of Undercover Boss is when the CEO of a Hooters knockoff company brings out one employee and fires her because she told him that she just worked there for the money and that being a waitress at a breasteraunt wasn't her dream job.
Undercover,"My biggest complaint about the show is that like 2 or 3 people get things, but the other hundreds or even thousands of employees that have very similar hardships get nothing.

Especially when these hardships are caused by low wages and long hours, which they typically were.  So it's an opportunity for some CEO to throw pennies at one person and get good PR.  There's also zero accountability regarding their follow through.

I'm not saying they need to massively increase wages for everyone, but very rarely did they put things in place to help all of their employees, not just the saddest cases that were obviously selected by the producers."
Undercover,"I had no idea that my 3,000 employees who work 6 days a week at $10 per hour couldn‚Äôt afford food for their families. Fucking show is delusional and pisses me off so much."
Undercover,"I worked at roto rooter during the RR undercover boss.  he started crying saying he did not know how dirty or hard the job was.... let me put that another way, he did not know cleaning sewers was dirty work.  So either the show is bullshit, or the CEO of a large multinational corporation is clinically retarded."
Undercover,"If anyone has ever seen the UK and US versions, the differences are very stark.    

The UK one seems to be more about management tier people actually learning the consequences of their decisions and trying to make actual changes to improve the working conditions of the people below them. There are a few ""hero"" moments, but that isn't the norm.    

The US one by contrast is just the CEO jerking off about how generous they are, how great the business is to work for, and how the little people should be grateful for the table scraps. They often do an Oprah ""you have a car, and you have a car"" thing at the end for three or four ""hero"" people they met, while never attempting to address the working conditions, pay, or benefits that would actual help all their employees.       

For example... [UK version (end scene)](https://youtu.be/NuRv9acbG8E?t=2196):     

 - Upgraded poor equipment.   
 - Added compensation of leads/sales.     
 - Improved backup/support/staffing (to improve safety).    
 - Improved CCTV to protect bouncers.         
 - Improved training.    

[US Version](https://youtu.be/SaePFkSeGr0?t=1883):    

 - Improve company growth (????)    
 - One employee gets to meet with her own manager to discuss productivity goals (????)    
 - Her pay will now be based on her manager's goals (rather than relaxing the overloaded employee, or making any assurances, they're just going to dangle a carrot)."
Undercover,"Whose the new guy growling at everyone and screaming at wheelchair Simon to 'work faster you lazy piece of shit'.

The bald guy? He just transferred here, his name is Beff Jezos."
Undercover,It's literally nothing more than a PR campaign with ads
Undercover,The Hooters episode should have ended with a very public firing or a very public lawsuit.
Undercover,I like how American bosses act all smug when they give some extremely loyal worker for example some paid maternity leave when this is mandated by law in the whole developed world.
Undercover,"Yes.  


I worked for a company whose CEO did it and also wrote a book.  


And one of things they really brought up on the show was an employee lead/sponsored program to help other employees pay for life events.  


You know what really helps employees? Paying them well enough so they  don't have to depend on other employees  sharing their meager wages they were guiltted  in to sharing...And he had the balls to tout it as a benefit, fucking pathetic."
Undercover,"Having worked at a huge corporation for many years I can't even think about watching the show. It's basically the multimillionaire CEO who plays golf everyday finds out that not having paid family leave isn't 100% wonderful for an expectant mother. He offers her a week off. Much jubilation is had and CEO is now a saint. 

3 months after the show the mother is laid off and CEO gets a billion dollar bonus."
Undercover,"I worked for the airline that was featured on the show. (Frontier Airlines and their scumbag CEO Bryan Bedford)

Mr. Bedford eventually went on to become CEO of another airline I ironically ended up working for. He bankrupted it within 5 years and ended up giving himself a ten million dollar bonus for it.

He is still acting CEO, bleeding the company dry and posting jesus shit on the company website."
Undercover,"This show lost me in the first episode. 

They have the CEO of Waste Management tagging along on a truck with a woman who ends up using a coffee can as a portable toilet to make whatever quota or route they have.  Where it lost me was them having this special needs child reading a letter to this woman about how special she is to them, blah, blah, blah.

Don‚Äôt fucking insult my intelligence with your contrived bullshit set to tinkly Affected with Muscular Dystrophy piano music."
Undercover,"Worker: ""Oh no I can't pay my bills, and took out a second mortgage on my house, I have 3 kids.""

Undercover CEO: ""I see these issues and will fix them""

Worker: ""There is hope!""

CEO: ""Here is a $20 gift card to target""

Worker: ""I am saved"""
Undercover,"It's a fantasy show where CEOs play dress up, pretend to ""work like a commoner"" and because they make such a big deal of giving a minimum wage worker a $5,000 bonus, they further the lie that if you just keep working hard good things will happen to you. 

Almost no one actually gets a raise, workers who have the work ethic someone should have if they are getting paid minimum wage generally get fired, and the CEO pushes whatever trendy agenda on TV that their company is doing great things. Win-win-win for already stupidly rich people."
Undercover,"My relative is a direct subordinate for one of the CEOs featured on that show.

To date, my uncle has racked up tens of thousands of dollars in unreimbursed expenses to do his job, is forced to cash his checks the second they're issued for fear they will bounce, and the CEO flaunts his collection of luxury cars.

But he gave like eight grand to a cashier at one of their locations.  So it cancels out everything."
Undercover,I think most people know the CEOs and owners only go on there for PR purposes. How the author got teary eyed is another question.
Undercover,Shows like Undercover Boss are so putrid they make the commercials look more interesting than the show which must be why sponsors buy ad spots
Undercover,You get so caught up in restoring the galaxy to its rightful state that you miss what is going on behind the scenes. I'm looking forward to having some real talk with some real folks.
Undercover,"New show idea:

 Cut the CEO off from all their resources and make them live, for a year, off the lowest wages the company offers working that job. They get 1000 to start for finding an apartment and some other startup expenses. If their bank account ever hits 00.00 they lose the company. If they quit to find another,job they lose the company.

Bet none of these coddled little trust fund kiddies could hack it."
Undercover,"I mean no industry ""leader"" would ever participate on the show if it wasn't going to give them some good press.  
It's like the road shows on Food Network. You really think Bertha's cat poop kitchen would let those people into their kitchen if for network was going to shit all over products?   
These ""shows"" are all just commericals."
Undercover,"One of the lessons Undercover Boss unintentionally teaches is that in order to be the CEO of a company, you should need to have worked there in a non-management position for a non-negligible amount of time. Instead, you get people who have MBAs which taught them how to ""be a CEO"" and nothing about the actual companies they're running. (Which is why these people are always so damn incompetent at jobs that are supposedly ""entry-level"" jobs that pay a fraction of what their own salary does.)"
Undercover,"Every problem the American worker has in that show is based off of an issue a European doesn't normally have to suffer through. 

""I dont have enough funding for education.""

""Medical bills have me bent over a barrel!""

""Minimum wage has me working 3 jobs to feed my kid.""

The billionaire graciously sheds a tear and waves his magic credit-card wand and changes their life forever. He looks benevolent and generous, the worker is grateful and overwhelmed with emotion.

It seriously makes me sick."
Undercover,"I worked at one of the companies that was on an episode a couple years ago. The producers came to our store and interviewed us and said that we wouldn't be on the show because our lives weren't ""sad enough."" 

The actual episode was a shitshow. The CEO ended up being shocked that a pizza delivery guy smoked weed. Oh my god! Literally nothing changed after the episode in the company either."
Undercover,Have they ever had a show with real union members in it?
Undercover,Used to enjoy the show in the early years but the so called disguises were so ridiculous - every episode - they could not have looked more unnatural and fake - stopped watching - couldn‚Äôt take the absurdity
Undercover,"Every episode of undercover boss is the same.

I'm a multi-millionaire and the greatest asset in my company, but I don't know how a mop works and can't make a sandwich.  But now I see the error of my ways, and I'm going to promote someone to manager for an extra $0.83/hr and send someone and their spouse on a weekend vacation."
Undercover,"A few years ago the company I worked for was on an episode of Undercover Boss. It may have just been the worst episode in the show‚Äôs history. The CEO let one of the maintenance guys build a small garden... and he gave one of the caterers a new spatula, so she can better mix tuna. I kid you not. Pretty much the entire organization was ashamed when the episode aired (except for senior leadership, of course, who were exceedingly proud). 
In retrospect, that should have been my queue to leave that place. But I was a fresh grad and needed the work experience. I stayed another 2 years, and oh boy the stories I accumulated about those people."
Undercover,"I have an idea for a show: Undercover Employee.  

A regular employee is disguised as an auditor or a VC firm and has meetings with the CEO.  They get to look over all the books, see what figures and perspectives they are presented, and what the CEOs opinions are behind closed doors.  Then the employee gets to take findings back to the other employees to let them know how day to day CEO life really is.  

A billion people would watch, it would simply be flipping the script on the CEO, and is no more unfair or disingenuous than the original program."
Undercover,https://youtu.be/UHyoDV1fsA4
Undercover,"Alternative show idea.

Take any low level employee to do the same job in Europe and at the end ask them if the want to go back to that ""god blessed"" country."
Undercover,Having to work your ass off just to make ends meet is no different than unpaid slavery. Change my mind.
Dead to Me,"After reading the earlier article about Christina, I‚Äôm wondering if they just got extremely lucky with how they ended season 2. Her not being able to move around well makes perfect sense in context"
Dead to Me,"Finally, I cannot wait for the conclusion of the series. >!I won't be surprised if James Marsden character is a triplets.!<"
Dead to Me,"I can't wait. It's a very good show. And with this news about Christina I wanna appreciate it more. I'm definitely gonna binge this cause I'm not gonna binge 1899 (which releases in the same day). 

This is certainly a crazy month for Netflix. Dead to me, 1899, Crown, Inside Job, Dragon Prince and hopefully Wednesday and Blockbuster are good/great too."
Dead to Me,I misread that as Dead Like Me and was very confused and excited for a minute
Dead to Me,I'm very much looking forward to this show. I love the two leads and it's been a very long wait for new episodes now. I'm eager to see how it ends.
Dead to Me,Shoutout to Christina Applegate!
Dead to Me,Woman on the right is smoke
Dead to Me,Is this worth watching?
Dead to Me,Linda Cardellini looks like she could be related to Jenette McCurdy
Dead to Me,I am excited but I also hope there will be a good ending.
Dead to Me,Would never see that coming
Dead to Me,Too bad there was never a movie for that show.
Dead to Me,Same!
Dead to Me,Hell yeah.
Dead to Me,Too bad there was a movie. It wasn‚Äôt good.
Dead to Me,"No, there was never a movie.  There. Was. Never. A. Movie."
Dead to Me,Fair point.
Dead to Me,She already went through a lot damn it man
Dead to Me,"Applegate:

>‚ÄùThere was the sense of, ‚ÄòWell, let‚Äôs get her some medicine so she can get better. And there is no better. But it was good for me. I needed to process my loss of my life, my loss of that part of me. So I needed that time.‚Äù

>‚ÄùThe powers that be were like, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs just stop. We don‚Äôt need to finish it. Let‚Äôs put a few episodes together.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòNo. We‚Äôre going to do it, but we‚Äôre going to do it on my terms.'‚Äù

>Applegate also said that she had put on 40 pounds and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt walk without a cane‚Äù but hopes people are able to overlook her physical appearance.

>‚ÄúIf people hate it, if people love it, if all they can concentrate on is, ‚ÄòOoh, look at the cripple,‚Äô that‚Äôs not up to me. I‚Äôm sure that people are going to be, like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt get past it. Fine, don‚Äôt get past it, then. But hopefully, people can get past it and just enjoy the ride and say goodbye to these two girls.‚Äù

The final season of Dead to Me releases Nov. 17th."
Dead to Me,"Christina Applegate seems like a legit nice lady and she's always fun to see on screen, it really is a bitch that some people get more than their share of shittiness like that."
Dead to Me,This is heartbreaking I feel for her so much. She struggled with breast cancer and now this it's horrible. She is an amazing actress and made this show so great. I hope she will be able to continue to do what she loves. The show is very enjoyable and I am glad she was able to finish it! I commend her that could not have been easy at all.
Dead to Me,"I had no idea about this. Absolutely awful for her, but very selfishly I‚Äôm glad we are getting another season of this great show. Jen and Judy‚Äôs friendship is one of the most well written and believable on television"
Dead to Me,So sad to hear about the diagnosis. I loved her in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead as a kid.
Dead to Me,"Christina Applegate is an actress who should have had a much better career than she had.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs had a great career but she should be part of Hollywood‚Äôs A-list elite rather then on the periphery of it.

I think her career has been subject to some unfortunate timing and creative descissions when they have tried to give her her own vehicle.  But still, even in bad projects she‚Äôs been involved with, she is the highlight and shines.

Wish her the best."
Dead to Me,Let's give a quick shout-out to Christina Applegate
Dead to Me,"Some of those quotes are devastating. Dead to Me is an incredible show, probably the most impressive mix of comedy and tragedy that I‚Äôve seen and Christina and Linda are both so good in it. It‚Äôs going to be sad seeing it end along with knowing that this is probably the last big project Christina Applegate will be able to do."
Dead to Me,Aw man. Selma Blair and now Christina Applegate?
Dead to Me,"This makes me not feel good :( I hope things get better for her. I know there‚Äôs no cure for her condition, but she‚Äôs such a wonderful spirit, just sucks."
Dead to Me,"Nobody says FUCK like her. 

She to me (being the same age) has always be gorgeous and funny. 

She is so underrated, she held her own in Anchorman, look at that cast. 

Few celebrities I feel bad for, for her, she has my total sympathy"
Dead to Me,"Let's give a quick Shout out to Christina Applegate for her commitment! *YES*

But seriously bringing people joy and laugh could be a great way to lift up the mood and motivated her to fight for cancer.  Hope she's doing well."
Dead to Me,This is so sad.  I had no idea.  I'm really looking forward to the third season of 'Dead to Me' but I suppose it will be bittersweet.
Dead to Me,[deleted]
Dead to Me,I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that Christina Applegate is a fucking gangsta.
Dead to Me,"Fuck, she's been through a lot already, and now this?"
Dead to Me,This is really depressing news. I have a friend with MS and it‚Äôs no joke.
Dead to Me,"This is heartbreaking news! I absolutely love her in everything I‚Äôve seen her in. Definitely an underrated actress, so smart & talented. One of my fav movies is the Sweetest Thing and Cameron Diaz is the big name in that movie but Christina steals the movie for me, the dressing room montage with the pretty woman scene-the best!"
Dead to Me,"currently re-watching Samantha Who? on Hulu & it‚Äôs amazing‚ú® if anyone is wanting some more Christina Applegate in their daily lives, highly recommend!"
Dead to Me,Wishing her nothing but the best.
Dead to Me,After everything she has MS? That is bullshit. I have family with MS and it can be terrible. And she's finishing this fantastic series on top of that? Damn I respect her even more. I hope for the best for her.
Dead to Me,Why did they hide it? Could they have written it in to the character?
Dead to Me,"Wow.  I haven't watched this show, but her commitment to it definitely makes me want to."
Dead to Me,"She‚Äôs so ridiculously talented, intelligent, graceful, beautiful‚Ä¶ the list goes on, and life doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about any of that. The only choice to what life dishes out, is to continue it with dignity and on our terms. She‚Äôs a Fucking Queen."
Dead to Me,"Oh man!  She is a cancer survivor and now she has MS.

Hang in there Christina, hopefully they can manage your symptoms enough for you to continue working."
Dead to Me,im glad she is doing this. giving her audience closure. and also ms is a difficult and expensive disease. we know enough about us health care so extra money will be helpful in her condition. not that she would need it.
Dead to Me,Good for her. Do it your way!
Dead to Me,"Glad to see that she‚Äôs staying positive, she‚Äôs had some tough challenges."
Dead to Me,Does the universe have it out for her? Wtf.
Dead to Me,Let's hear it for Christina Applegate
Dead to Me,The only one I really liked off of Married.  Although I liked the parents better on other shows later on.
Dead to Me,I love Tits mcGee
Dead to Me,"For whatever reason, I feel connected to her, and empathize with her situation. 

Feel like she simultaneously got dealt a great hand and a shit hand. 

Aces and Eights."
Dead to Me,"I would have understood if they didn‚Äôt film season 3 but after the cliffhanger from season 2, I‚Äôm so glad they did. Christina Applegate is amazing"
Dead to Me,Damn. She is a real oneüëè
Dead to Me,"A true professional. 

A shining light from her industry."
Dead to Me,Let's give her a quick shoutout
Dead to Me,"Nothing but pure respect for Christina. I'm so eager for S3, I know she's said she probably won't watch and worries over how the fans will perceive the changes her body has gone through due to MS, but I believe the fans will rally and give her nothing but love and support."
Dead to Me,Just dropping in to say that Christina Applegate is one of my favorite people in Hollywood.  I wish her nothing but the best.
Dead to Me,What a bad ass. It sucks to see good people get dealt a shit hand.
Dead to Me,"She has MS? Oh, no!"
Dead to Me,"She is such a gem, I love forward to seeing this cane and all!"
Dead to Me,I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about this. Wishing her all the best.
Dead to Me,Had no idea she had MS.  She‚Äôs amazing.
Dead to Me,After reading all the great reviews about the show I can‚Äôt wait to watch the show. It sounds like she has a real approach to life and that‚Äôs so refreshing. Big respect ‚ù§Ô∏è
Dead to Me,Dead to me first season was fantastic. I need to catch up. Hope her the best üôèüôè
Dead to Me,"As long as she doesn't turn out to be the third twin of her dead husband, I can accept everything."
Dead to Me,this is the first I've heard of this diagnosis. poor woman that sucks.
Dead to Me,Really happy that they finished the show.
Dead to Me,Hey let's give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate!
Dead to Me,She has been acting my whole life. I hope she finishes well and takes a well deserved rest.
Dead to Me,"I‚Äôm glad she can live off residuals and investments enjoy her life before she get too sick. She made it. We talk about her, it‚Äôs done. Famous, wealthy  and good at her job. Take a break. I‚Äôm nobody."
Dead to Me,MS is pretty hardcore.
Dead to Me,As long as it doesn't have the other girl randomly crying throughout the season. It seemed like overacting.
Dead to Me,"Wait..I thought the show got cancelled?

Edit: why am I getting downvoted? I was deeply disappointed when I heard it was cancelled. I didn‚Äôt know they were finishing up one more season"
Dead to Me,I wonder if she had mono when she was younger
Dead to Me,[deleted]
Dead to Me,"Wait, is Christina Applegate alive? Or am I thinking of Brittany Murphey"
Dead to Me,Dead to me. Everyone cries. 10x per episode minimum. Stopped watching that show.
Dead to Me,40 pounds? Try 60 (me) üòÅ
Dead to Me,"I‚Äôm not really ‚Äòceleb crazy‚Äô but I‚Äôve always enjoyed Christina Applegate and followed her career. Really hate hearing this, to be honest. Sucks that bad things happen to good people."
Dead to Me,Man that's a such a shame she was diagnosed with MS. I've been a fan of her work since she was on Married With Children.
Dead to Me,I had no idea she had MS as well.  That‚Äôs crazy that her and Selma Blair have it.
Dead to Me,"By all accounts, one of the nicest ones in the industry... nobody deserves what she's dealt with but certainly not her."
Dead to Me,"I have a friend who had MS and went for controversial surgery in Mexico, where they used her own stem cells to replace her bone marrow. I was super dubious  but it actually worked for her. I was happy to be wrong."
Dead to Me,"What had happened to her? I'm sorry I'm a bit outta the loop

Edit: I just saw another comment mention had a fight with breast cancer. Man that sucks"
Dead to Me,No kidding. She seems like one of the good ones. I feel horrible for her.
Dead to Me,How can you not love that woman.
Dead to Me,[deleted]
Dead to Me,[deleted]
Dead to Me,Wow.
Dead to Me,Think this is probably a huge reason why the upcoming Married With Children revival is going to be animated instead
Dead to Me,Ms diagnosis feels like something erasing who you are or were. It doesn't happen gradually either. Flares spike you and it's the inflammation that causes the damage. Took me a year and a half to even feel a tad normal again which was just a small vacation of relief followed by always feeling like being hung over. Even cognitive thought was taxing.....I hate ms
Dead to Me,MS is a terrible and frightening diagnosis.
Dead to Me,"I really didn‚Äôt like Dead to Me (mostly because I saw every twist coming a mile away and it just felt goofy), but I LOVED Applegate in it. She‚Äôs so good at playing bitchy- I love her appearances on Friends as Rachel‚Äôs selfish horrible sister haha."
Dead to Me,"Honestly, she doesn‚Äôt seem that nice to me. Just real as fuck and above the bullshit. I respect her a lot - that‚Äôs better to me than being nice (which I mostly interpret as fake these days). She actually seems super antisocial in the interviews I‚Äôve heard from her. Love her for entertaining me on TV my whole life."
Dead to Me,"She was secretly the star of Married with Children. Nailed every line, made every motion funny, extreme talent on display."
Dead to Me,"I'm right on top of that, Rose!"
Dead to Me,One of my favorite movies
Dead to Me,"I think part of her career trajectory can, for better or worse, be tied to how well she played Kelly Bundy. Another classic case of being so iconic and great in a role that people were reluctant to see her as anything other than the dumb, slutty girl."
Dead to Me,She really held her own in Anchorman and I don‚Äôt believe her role is talked about enough with all the other hilarious performances.
Dead to Me,"I think Kelly Bundy overshadowed the real Christina, and it hurt her- I don't think she was taken seriously for a while after ""Married With Children"" ended.  The fact that she's got some real comedic chops was a revelation to a lot of people (myself included).

Add on to that the loss of her mother to breast cancer, then her battle with it, I think she was out of the game for a while.

It's too bad- she's a very funny, charming and likeable actress."
Tuca and Bertie,I loved season 1 and 2. It's such a creative and wacky show.
Tuca and Bertie,"The marketing for this show when it first came out was abysmal, never gave it a chance given the vibes it was giving off"
Tuca and Bertie,"After Bojack Horseman I was excited to watch T&B but then adult swim cancelled it after the first season, glad it‚Äôs getting the recognition it deserves. Super fun show with visual humor and character arcs, looking forward to season 3"
Tuca and Bertie,I gave it a chance but the show wasn‚Äôt for me.
Tuca and Bertie,"Am huge Bojack fan. Bojack is a fantastic show, this show is not as good but is still a great watch."
Tuca and Bertie,I guess I found it a bit dull but there‚Äôs way worse shows on adult swim.
Tuca and Bertie,Such a great show! Would love to see more seasons‚Ä¶
Tuca and Bertie,I tried but this show is not good.
Tuca and Bertie,SO FUNNY I'm obsessed!
Tuca and Bertie,Since when there are 2 new seasons? I swear I read the other day that season 2 isn't gonna happen.
Tuca and Bertie,"I couldn‚Äôt really get into season 1, but season 2 was great. I‚Äôm really excited to watch season 3. I‚Äôm happy it got picked up by adult swim."
Tuca and Bertie,So no oculus vr support?
Tuca and Bertie,This show is NOT funny at all but you would never know the way the fake woke media seems to suck its dick‚Ä¶.they act like its the greatest thing ever made and its literally the dumbest fucking show on adult swim.
Tuca and Bertie,Season 3 started yesterday
Tuca and Bertie,The marketing is still abysmal and I have to convince people the twerking birds show really does have a lot of heart and funny jokes.
Tuca and Bertie,"Dunno why you're being downvoted; it was. All the marketing made me go ""ugh yuck no way will I watch that"" but when people I trust were like ""give it a chance"", I watched the whole thing straight through twice. (Over 2 days.) They had no idea what they were selling, and thus did it very badly."
Tuca and Bertie,I hate Tiffany Haddish. I wish she Tiffany Hadn‚Äôt been in it.
Tuca and Bertie,[deleted]
Tuca and Bertie,pretty dumb you're getting down voted
Tuca and Bertie,"Netflix passed on a second season in 2019 but Adult Swim picked up the show shortly after, S2 dropped last year and the 3rd has just started this week."
Tuca and Bertie,Is it as good as Bojack? I just finished the fourth season recently and it's probably my favorite adult animated show that I have ever seen.
Tuca and Bertie,"Yeah there is reason beyond initial launch that I haven't gone back to watch it, I roll my eyes at every promo that comes on AS, seems like crass to be crass, childish, humor with a pinch of ""adulting"" life so hard just to really sour the whole thing"
Tuca and Bertie,"I dont dislike her personally shes alright, but i think her VA is quite terrible."
Tuca and Bertie,"I had no idea who she was until I saw Jo Koys standup. She was just a drunken mess onstage‚Ä¶which clearly carries through to her real life. She‚Äôs not funny, just a sad broken person."
Tuca and Bertie,"My bad was unaware, glad it got continuous thank you for the clarification!"
Tuca and Bertie,They were right to cancel it‚Ä¶.it sucks‚Ä¶.bad
Tuca and Bertie,Nuanced takes are not allowed. Everything is a masterpiece or garbage.
Tuca and Bertie,"Ah, sick! Thank you!"
Tuca and Bertie,It's more of a sitcom than a drama compared to BoJack.
Tuca and Bertie,"T&B leans into the animal world and cartoon zanyness a little more than Bojack. For example in the T&B world their are plant people that live along side the humans and animals (and there really are not that many humans at all). 

The main characters are not as depressing as Bojack and the main relationships between Tuca, Bertie and Speckle are actually fairly healthy and positive which is pretty rare these days and in my opinion its very hard to write an engaging show like that.

The show has just as many deep themes and does a great job of walking the line between funny and conveying more serious emotions, just like Bojack did. 

If you like Bojack, there is no reason to not give this show a shot. I personally have enjoyed it a little more than Bojack and I really loved Bojack a lot."
Tuca and Bertie,"Bojack is more like bourbon - it hurts good. This is more like a brunch mimosa, it‚Äôs high quality and fun."
Tuca and Bertie,"I adore Bojack for its unique way that it walks the line between clever humor and gut punching realness, especially about depression, anxiety, and trauma. That being said, Tuca and Bertie overall is much lighter, especially the first season with only one episode (9) getting into some real shit. The second season there‚Äôs a lot more Bojack realness, but there‚Äôs never any moments that hurt your soul like Bojack can. It‚Äôs also definitely a lot more silly and chaotic then Bojack, but also has solid commentary on mental health. I‚Äôd say check it out and if you don‚Äôt like it then that‚Äôs ok."
Tuca and Bertie,No.
Tuca and Bertie,Bojack Horseman has some of the most ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô characters in any show I‚Äôve ever seen. Which is pretty amazing considering the main character is a horse and his best friend is a dog.
Tuca and Bertie,"The second season is even better, I cannot stress this enough. And they kept the continuity going.

Now the AS seasons are streaming on HBO Max, it‚Äôs worth a second look."
Tuca and Bertie,"I thought her work in S1 was a bit rough at times, but from S2 onward it's been a bit better imo.

Doesn't hurt that Tuca has gotten a good chunk of the dramatic arcs that lets Haddish use a bit more range too"
Tuca and Bertie,[deleted]
Tuca and Bertie,So it doesn‚Äôt rip your heart out and stab it while it beats in front of you?
Tuca and Bertie,Speckle is a treasure and I was gearing up to be SOOOO pissed at Bertie for the arc she started to have with Pastry Pete. But the way they brought the Pastry Pete story back around was really satisfying.
Tuca and Bertie,"Can't wait, just need to finish up the final two season of Bojack first."
Tuca and Bertie,Honestly I just like it because of the female main character focus. As a wayward thirty-something the first season was great. I haven‚Äôt watched the rest because of the move from Netflix but I do want to watch more!
Tuca and Bertie,9 was hard hitting. But they really built up Bertie little bits through each episode to land at the Jelly lakes trauma and how it‚Äôs affected her whole life. I need to go rewatch.
Tuca and Bertie,That's fair.
Tuca and Bertie,Christmas has come early baby! The theme song just slaps and I never get tired of it.
Tuca and Bertie,SEX BUGS INTENSIFIES
Tuca and Bertie,Thank you adult swim for saving Tuca and Bertie! I really liked this episode and it was well goddamn worth the wait! I‚Äôm so glad it is back! This will keep me sane now that Bless the Harts is going off the air.
Tuca and Bertie,Tuca and Birdie ^(Tuca and Birdie) Tuca and Birdie!
Tuca and Bertie,"I watched the first 2 episodes of season 1 on Saturday, and that shit is WILD. Love Tiffany Haddish, Ali Wong, and Steven Yeun in everything else they've done"
Tuca and Bertie,"First time watching this series (although I have heard of it before) and overall I found it cute and enjoyable; I'll probably stick around for the rest of the season. 

Unfortunately I'm not sure if it'll gain much attention here as it really doesn't strike me as the kind of show reddit would enjoy. Oh well."
Tuca and Bertie,Wowoo soo happy to get to watch!
Tuca and Bertie,It's great that someone saved this awesome show!
Tuca and Bertie,Is this related to Bojack Horseman at all?
Tuca and Bertie,So good. Loved the premiere and can‚Äôt wait for more
Tuca and Bertie,Eeeeeee shiiiiieeet yes!
Tuca and Bertie,[deleted]
Tuca and Bertie,I don't think I've ever seen a show on Adult Swim that failed catch me as badly as this. And I suffered through Assy McGee
Tuca and Bertie,"Oh, awesome! I love this show and I thought it was cancelled. Yay!"
Tuca and Bertie,Totally forgot this premiered yesterday.  Will have to watch tonight.
Tuca and Bertie,I feel like I have to be back in college or college age to appreciate the humor.
Tuca and Bertie,"I‚Äôm a really big fan of the first season, I liked it.
I thought Bertie‚Äôs story war good and Tuca‚Äôs was fun if flawed.

But does anyone else think it felt ... kinda cheap?

The first season was so detailed and animated, and here all of the backgrounds feel so empty, the camera is so zoomed in all of the time you can‚Äôt see anything.

Also I‚Äôm kinda sad about Speckle, he had the whole arc last season about learning that he is also  important, but here he is very sidelined and they‚Äôre still living in the old house, IDK."
Tuca and Bertie,Awesome! I can't wait to not watch it
Tuca and Bertie,"1) For some reason, this show reminds me of the Problem Solverz so I don't think I would watch it.

2) Also, seriously a sitcom? AGAIN? 

Don't we have enough adult sitcoms? 

Family Guy, Simpsons, America guy(Or whatever), Futurama, Rick and Morty...etc

Why do we have all these adult sitcoms and barely any serious adult animated show? The only serious shows I see right now is Invincible(Which honestly has one of the worst animation I have ever seen) The only companies I see that are interested and investing in animated serious animated shows are DC and Marvel(With Disney + shows currently airing...etc) which are superheroes things. 

And the problem is that most of these adult sitcoms aren't even funny, they are mostly built around an Alcoholic guy abusing his family with all the kinds of dysfunctional relationships. I can't believe kids channels get awesome shows like Avatar, Korra and Gravity Falls...etc while older audience get the sitcom shit.

/rant over."
Tuca and Bertie,"I arrived at this sub due to my google voyage.  So sorry im late.

Tuca & Bertie reminds me of the old USA cartoon, Duckman.   Ignore the dark animation of Duckman, but every character on T&B reminds me of Duckman's dolt of a son/nephew.  I cannot remember.  Then I was shocked to read that not even 2 weeks ago:

&#x200B;

[Everett Peck, Creator of ‚ÄòDuckman,‚Äô Dies at 71](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/everett-peck-dead-duckman-creator-1235167423/)

&#x200B;

thanks reddit for this wildly tragic coincidence.

R.I.P. Everett Peck"
Tuca and Bertie,[removed]
Tuca and Bertie,"Fuck Reddit, this show is great."
Tuca and Bertie,"It's animated by the same team afaik and created by a producer of bojack, but story wise is completely separate."
Tuca and Bertie,"What is this, a crossover episode??"
Tuca and Bertie,Lmao audience reviews are so susceptible and prone to review bombing it means next to nothing anynore.
Tuca and Bertie,"I don't think critics have an ""agenda"" but I do think they'll more often reward something doing something unique than something just doing it well.

The use of critics isn't to slap all their opinions into a washing machine and kick what comes out, the use of critics is to find one whose criticism works with your tastes.

Even if a good critic doesn't like something you should be given the information to make up your own mind.

I feel like people are too obsessed with the idea of objectively bad or good media and try to back up their tastes with hard numbers.

Also most of y'all don't understand what rotten tomatoes is. It's not a measure of how good or bad something is, it's a measure of how likely someone is to enjoy them.

So 90% means there's a 90% chance you won't despise the movie.

Thats why marvel movies rank so highly, they're easy to enjoy but rarely super dark or challenging."
Tuca and Bertie,"I've never seen Bojack Horseman and started watching Tuca and Bertie first. I checked the audience reviews and noticed how different it was from the critics. I'm glad I gave the first few episodes a watch, it was very lighthearted, wacky, and fun, which was just what I needed. 

I'm guessing because it's different and not as serious as BH, people who were expecting something similar didn't like it."
Tuca and Bertie,"Honestly as long as they dont keep pushing mr pickles spinoffs im happy with anything else, at least tuca and bertie actually has a plot"
Tuca and Bertie,Assy's voice was so consistently funny that it *almost* made the rest of the show worth watching
Tuca and Bertie,I have a feeling this show made little sense to anyone who didn‚Äôt see the first season.
Tuca and Bertie,It was! But then adult swim picked it up and it‚Äôs back!
Tuca and Bertie,So worth it!
Tuca and Bertie,I made it through about 10 minutes of the pilot. It was not for me.
Tuca and Bertie,We all have that moment when we feel.out-of-toych woth comedy
Tuca and Bertie,"Haven't seen the new episode yet but I'm curious how much they're going to reference season 1 directly seeing as adult swim can't broadcast or really monetise it.

I'm wondering if this adult swim season will be a very soft reboot of sorts."
Tuca and Bertie,"I feel you. Every shot in the first season was so rich and packed with jokes and little bits of worldbuilding, every frame felt personal. This episode felt... Blank.
Also, I miss the tiddy building :'(  I hope they'll bring back the intro.

Nevertheless, I'm super psyched to have more Tuca and Bertie. Really rooting for this show ü§ûüèª"
Tuca and Bertie,"The animation did seem more limited, but may also be a side effect of them working on the season in a pandemic over Zoom?"
Tuca and Bertie,Tuca and Bertie isn‚Äôt about an alcoholic guy.
Tuca and Bertie,[removed]
Tuca and Bertie,"Seriously- I heard people hating on it when it first came out but after watching it I'd say it's just as good as Bojack,  if not better given it never delves into straight-up misery porn like Bojack did at times."
Tuca and Bertie,"the shows creator, Lisa hanawalt, was the main character designer on Bojack"
Tuca and Bertie,[deleted]
Tuca and Bertie,Critics love new shit. They see everything so another comic book movie has a high bar.
Tuca and Bertie,Isn‚Äôt Momma Named Me Sheriff still on
Tuca and Bertie,"I should maybe go back and rewatch it, because I don't remember at all what he sounded like. 

Mostly shocked to find out him and Teddy from Bob's Burgers share a voice actor."
Tuca and Bertie,"I stopped the pilot at about the same point. I tried it again and made it to 15 minutes before I had to shut it off again. I read it gets better, but three episodes in I've probably laughed once.

I am glad it got picked up again though. BoJack did some great things with animation and I hope this show will too. I just won't be there to see it."
Tuca and Bertie,The pilot is rather poor but the rest is great!
Tuca and Bertie,"Honestly, the pilot was terrible compared to the rest of the season. Still won't be everyone's thing but it improved substantially after that."
Tuca and Bertie,"Yeah,I cracked up when it went from the cast credits right to the end, I was wondering what they were gonna do about it"
Tuca and Bertie,"I said most, not all.

It's still a sitcom."
Tuca and Bertie,"You bring up some interesting points, I would dismiss a lot of the awards stuff though, they're so political that success in them is almost wholly disconnected from the work itself.

The Wire for example I don't think got any award recognition"
Tuca and Bertie,Boy I hope not. I haven't seen it air in a while now but honestly who knows. Adult swim hasnt had much lately aside from rick and Morty and tuca and bertie honestly. They canned your pretty face and im still mad about it lol
Tuca and Bertie,It did take a while to pick up but I think three episodes is fair. It's definitely a show that isn't for everyone.
Tuca and Bertie,"Personally, it is odd to me when people love Bojack, but not Tuca and Bertie. Because both shows share a lot of similarities, only Bojack is a little bit more grounded, while Tuca and Bertie is a lot more playful in its style and a little bit more cartoony. But overall both shows feature likeable characters with relatable problems, the same kind of silly humor and both bring some emotional depth to their storylines and tackle serious and topical issues."
Tuca and Bertie,"I actually really liked the animation, but like you, I didn't laugh. And there are great animated shows that don't have great first seasons, but I could tell right away I wasn't going to enjoy this one so I just cut out early."
Tuca and Bertie,"Tuca and Bertie is more deep than you think. On the surface you can‚Äôt see it but when I watched it, I liked some of the serious tones.

Bojack is also a sitcom but it‚Äôs one of the best modern cartoons imo."
Tuca and Bertie,"They got final space and primal

Lazor wulf was just cancelled"
Flinch,Well at least we know who to blame. Sorry to hear the next captain America is also going to be a disappointment.
Flinch,What ? What a dumb conclusion. You certainly did not read the article
Flinch,"Strongly agree. The series was a disappointment with terrible dialogue and bad character motivations.

I agree with the sentiments expressed in this thread:    
https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/mxo5ll/spoilers_the_falcon_and_the_winter_soldier_was/"
Flinch,"Huh? I read the article. My point is that the writing on this show was not good, so if this guy was responsible for the writing then it doesn't bode well if he's writing the new captain America."
Flinch,"Agreed, although I did enjoy the penultimate episode quite a bit."
Flinch,"Oh ok. Well. Thats your opinion. While I think the finale was rushed and A bit dumb, everything until there was wonderful. Absolutely amazing. But thats me"
Flinch,the writer for episode 5 is co writing the movie
Flinch,And that was largely a matter of them having to cut out a subplot.
Flinch,"While everything before the finale was great, the finale was so idiotic, dumb, stupid, with zero character consistency, but more seriously, problematic and politically tonedeaf, that it turned the series as a whole into a steaming pile of crap. The finale made the show irredeemable."
Flinch,Good to hear!
Flinch,I Just cannot agree with you at all. Like...nah.
Flinch,It has been a long time since I watched Idiocracy but wasn't a show with a premise like this part of that movie's dystopian future?
Flinch,The trailer looks like one of those game shows they have playing on TV in dystopian sci-fi movies.
Flinch,"Ouch, my balls!"
Flinch,Stupid game shows are nothing new.
Flinch,It reminds me of these shows they use in films or series just before something big happens. Zombies. One is the killer. Something like that.
Flinch,"My wife and I watched the first two episodes, and enjoyed them very much. Looking forward to the upcoming episodes."
Flinch,The traffic stop scene was brilliant.
Flinch,"It was rad. I didn't actually expect it to be as great as it is. And this is just a side-note, but the guys that they cast as young John Lithgow and young Jeff Bridges are fantastic. Some of the best flashback casting I've ever seen. Young John Lithgow sounds exactly like him. Really psyched to watch more of this."
Flinch,The Dude is eternal.
Flinch,"What a long career he's had.

I remember seeing him in several TV episodes of ""Sea Hunt"" from the late 50's alongside his father."
Flinch,"Its from Robert Levine and John Steinberg, the guys who made Black Sails, so its gotta be good."
Flinch,Did he get his rug back?
Flinch,"Just finished reading the book. While the book was a pretty standard thriller novel, I think the show has potential to be better thanks to how good Bridges and Lithgow are."
Flinch,Just watched the two available episodes last night. It‚Äôs really superb. Beautifully filmed as well.
Flinch,"Haven‚Äôt seen this show but I‚Äôm glad to hear that they‚Äôre not going ‚Äútypical badass guy‚Äù route. I much prefer action movies that accurately portray what weight differences, age, size, and gender can change up in a fight. Iirc Atomic Blonde (didn‚Äôt see it, just a couple fight scenes on YouTube, might be thinking of the wrong movie) did a good job of showing Charlize‚Äôs character fighting men bigger than her, how she had to rely on momentum to counter her opponents, and was unable to simply overpower them. 

Matt Reeves‚Äô Battinson-verse seems to be going this route, too. Bruce is incredibly capable and well trained, but if he ends up going against a larger opponent I could see him struggling some, especially with how Matt showed he‚Äôs not invulnerable or ‚Äúthe perfect combatant‚Äù to counter everything perfectly, and he still gets beat up a bit. 

Obviously Daredevil and Punisher did a good job of this as well, showing Matt become exhausted over the course of his fight scenes, shows how brutal Frank has to get in order to overcome the odds of fighting multiple people, some of which are far bigger than him. Obviously there‚Äôs still some ‚Äúmain character plot armour‚Äù going on but at the very least the don‚Äôt show their protagonist as some untouchable god."
Flinch,[deleted]
Flinch,Watched this last night. Bridges and Lithgow are amazing.
Flinch,"I‚Äôve been watching. Amazing show and who doesn‚Äôt love the Rottweilers? Lithgow and Bridges best actors ever.

However, Lithgow plays a nutjob a little too convincingly. Scares the shit out of me: The Twilight Zone, Dexter, and now this."
Flinch,"I saw this on a lark and was just plain floored by the first episode.  Nearly everything was excellent - script, acting, lighting, editing, choreography, plot, music, even the foley work was excellent.  It ruined my evening because I then had to watch Obi-Wan and Ms. Marvel and the contrast was absolute."
Flinch,Reminds me of no country for old men and grand torino
Flinch,It has a lot of emotional depth on top of a great foundation
Flinch,Why did he allow the dogs take off and allow himself to be zip tied?
Flinch,Against all odds.
Flinch,Episode one was fantastic
Flinch,I just watched the first two episodes and loved it!
Flinch,"Whereas I realize Jeff Bridges has won multiple awards including an Oscar, he is still I think grossly under appreciated as an actor.  That guys talent is immense."
Flinch,"Are you employed, Sir?"
Flinch,"this show is based on a book by the excellent thriller writer thomas perry.  and this critic gives all the credit for the show's quality to jeff bridges?  don't get me wrong, i love jeff bridges, and think he does an amazing job.  but if you're going to keep raving about how this story rises above the genre, spare at least one sentence for the source material."
Flinch,"The best shows are always the ones that come out of nowhere.

Who doesn‚Äôt love John Lithgow as an adversary?

The only thing I‚Äôm hesitant about is OF COURSE the main character had to bed a beautiful woman by accident.  It just wasn‚Äôt necessary.  The relationship could have just been a divorc√©e renting a room to a peculiar old man and a platonic friendship spawning from that.

But. All that is overshadowed by the themes of male vulnerability, people reflecting on their past choices and the idea of ‚Äúam I the villain?‚Äù Occupying your mind.

It‚Äôs so good.  And it‚Äôs not a remake or a superhero thing."
Flinch,Your Revolution is over Mister Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost!!
Flinch,Watched the first two episodes last night. Very solid so far.
Flinch,"Is this a limited series or new ongoing show?  

Bc if it‚Äôs a new show then I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll watch bc it might just get canceled. I‚Äôm very wary of starting new shows nowadays bc after getting invested they pull the plug (ex: raised by wolves cancelled by discovery üò¢)."
Flinch,Loved him ever since Sea Hunt.
Flinch,The acting and cinematography are very good but what really stood out to me in these two episodes was the writing. I'm a sucker for great dialogue and this show has it in spades. Excellent stuff so far.
Flinch,When he imagined killing both officers and the female interest I knew this show he no boundaries.
Flinch,Jeff bridges ages like a fine scotch!
Flinch,"They had a hell of a chance to make a killer spy show.... but it seems 4 episodes in,  this ones action filled trailers were all from the first episode. It's now scene after scene of talking.  Talking like no real humans talk at that.  This could've been a major HBOMAX series, instead I feel like I'm watching USA network. BOOOORING! the plot makes no sense! Why would a spy on the run pick up the baggage of some woman he just met? Not what an ex government killer would do. And to top it all off the guys daughter works for the man who's in charge of capturing him and the CIA has no clue. They can find him on a random cops body cam from somewhere in America (out of thousands of traffic stops) but can't figure out his daughters secretly under their nose? I could go on but I'll spare you.  I'm out on this one.  What a waste of a great idea with some great actors.  Pretty disappointed."
Flinch,I might wait until all the episodes have aired before I watch it. It seems like it'll be worth the wait.
Flinch,"Everyone here making Big Lebowski references but when I read this title, specifically ""capturing the vulnerabilities of his aged character"" all I could wonder was: in this show is he doing that better than he already did in True Grit?  

I haven't watched it yet, I've been sort of on the fence, I hear a ton of podcast ads for this show but I've historically been pretty disappointed by things that got such a prominent ad blitz on podcasts."
Flinch,Watched the first episode last night and it was very‚Ä¶ standard thriller. Not very interesting but people here are raving about it.
Flinch,"overall the first two eps have been quality, but there's a tad too much expositional soliloquy going on (from all the characters) that i'm finding a bit off putting"
Flinch,"I really enjoyed the first episode. I can already tell I‚Äôm going to love the characters. 

The only thing I can‚Äôt stand (and I only bring it up to see if anyone else noticed this too) is it already feels like they do unnecessary things just to take up time. For instance the fight scene against the younger CIA guys went on 5 minutes too long at least and it was really just them rolling around wrestling, not particularly interesting or cool. We all knew the dogs were going to save him from the start of the fight, why did they wait 5 minutes to do it?

I don‚Äôt understand this new need to just take up time for the hell of it on all streaming shows. Just cut the time! Who cares??"
Flinch,"Dumb show. Shut it off after he let his Rottweiler dogs out of the car, and they take off up the road while he gets his ass kicked. The dogs only return at the end of the fight, after he whistles for them. Why didn‚Äôt he use the dogs immediately? Stupid show."
Flinch,"Releasing shows one episode a week is really going to kill streaming services.

We are in the ‚Äúage of access‚Äù and these production companies are trying to stop that from happening."
Flinch,How many 3somes does he have?
Flinch,"Ugh, weekly releases. Pass. Might check it out later when it is actually really released."
Flinch,Aren't like half of all action leads at least middle-aged? This doesn't seem that innovative
Flinch,"gotta love... macho old as fuck boomer propaganda.    


""so brave"" that they're showing how vunerable oldz are"
Flinch,He is the same character in every role.
Flinch,[removed]
Flinch,These are the same showrunners as percy jackson correct? Interesting
Flinch,The ol' Jackie Chan routine.
Flinch,Missed opportunity to call it ‚Äòthe old dude‚Äô
Flinch,Really enjoyed the first 2 episodes. I have been recommending it to coworkers and friends!
Flinch,I felt like he did an amazing job of what the title described here in the movie crazy heart. excited to watch this one
Flinch,Actually 73 is great haha
Flinch,"""Mr Chase! How many men have you shot?"" 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7jggCcfyjE

Great show so far! And I keep picturing Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn."
Flinch,Loved the first two episodes of this and excited to see what will come.
Flinch,">First was concern about whether the dogs are going to be okay. No comment on that

Well that's not very reassuring"
Flinch,"I'm enjoying this but I don't like the music/score, it's like max ritcher in a Jason Bourne movie"
Flinch,Good dogs!
Flinch,"NGL, I am really surprised how well Jon Watts directed the first 2 eps, esp. since I didn't fully love his Spider-Man work. If this is how he directs when he doesnt have many cooks in the kitchen, I will be very excited."
Flinch,Jeff Bridges character is John Wick
Flinch,"Love the show but I wish Jeff Bridges would take the cotton out of his mouth, evidently to make him seem older looking than he is.  Looks like the Godfather and very distracting.

Otherwise good except they seem to go out of their way to have him make very stupid decisions.  Who the hell would shoot an assassin ONCE *and then not check if he was dead*? If he's a trained soldier like we're supposed to believe, he would have gone over and put one in the guy's forehead before leaving.

Or maybe they want us to believe he's lost his touch?  Not to mention why TF would he get involved with this woman in the first place?  Makes no sense to me except to further complicate his life - but not something he'd rationally do."
Flinch,His love interest sucks!  His dead wife was a badass.  Zoe is a trainwreck.
Flinch,Can you summarise what you both liked so I can see if my missus is interested lol
Flinch,I flinched when that happened!
Flinch,I rewound it 2x because I couldn't believe how great that scene was.
Flinch,Holy fuck did that get me.
Flinch,"I was like..... Stay calm, stay calm, it will work out.....  OH SHIT, whew..."
Flinch,Jaw dropped when that happened. Great scene and I can't wait for the next episode now.
Flinch,"i literally just said this! granted lithgow and bridges are icons so probably a lot of actors have studied them, but the young actors portraying them are doing a wonderfully nuanced job. also >!the scene with his wife in the bathroom was gut wrenching!<"
Flinch,"Agree, my wife was confused whether they de-aged them with cgi or if it was young actors. Really good show, and it began the conversation of getting dogs."
Flinch,"FX‚Äôs record is absolutely sterling. Between that‚Äôs and Bridges, I‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs awesome."
Flinch,">  Young John Lithgow sounds exactly like him

When he first started talking I thought they were redubbing his lines with Lithgow.  I'm still not convinced that isn't the case. The resemblance in voice is uncanny."
Flinch,"I completely expected it to be as great as it is, because the showrunners are Steinberg & Levine, the guys who did *Black Sails.*"
Flinch,Incredible to believe he‚Äôs been acting on screen since the 50‚Äôs !
Flinch,That‚Äôs like your opinion‚Ä¶ (and mine)
Flinch,And here I am switching professions every 3 years.  Should have gone into acting for the stability.
Flinch,That's why it was on my radar from like years ago. And it did not disappoint in the first 2 eps so far. Solidly recommend this to anyone.
Flinch,That explains a lot.  Black Sails was SO good.
Flinch,That rug really tied the room together‚Ä¶
Flinch,Atomic Blonde is crazy good. Watch it!!
Flinch,"I was blown away that Jon Watts, the guy who directed the MCU spider man movies, did the first two episodes. it's absolutely nuts what he's capable of when he doesn't have to work within marvels confines. I hope he does some more non mcu stuff soon"
Flinch,Yep me too
Flinch,Lithgow‚Äôs a great nutjob in De Palma‚Äôs Blow Out too
Flinch,"I just gave up on Obi-Wan... Maybe I'll continue some other time but honestly why torture myself. 

It's so bad. It's like they put the most prestigious IP in film history in the hands of college movie majors."
Flinch,">Reminds me of no country for old men

Cool! I'm 100 percent in!

> and grand torino

Hmmm... Maybe not 100 percent."
Flinch,But I would have paid $5 for him to say something about Rooster Cogburn!
"Roswell, New Mexico",What decade is this again?
"Roswell, New Mexico",Not roswell!! It's my guilty pleasure show. But yay o. Charmed
"Roswell, New Mexico","Riverdale lives on, somehow"
"Roswell, New Mexico",I had yet to give ***4400*** or ***Naomi*** a try - I always wait to see if a show gets a second season.  I guess I simply do not have to bother with them.
"Roswell, New Mexico",I was hoping Roswell could stay since it's relatively cheap to film
"Roswell, New Mexico","Wow, being sold off has caused an all out bloodbath at CW. I don't watch any of their shows, but they are usually good at giving their series a sendoff of some kind."
"Roswell, New Mexico",Dynasty likely to get bought by Netflix
"Roswell, New Mexico","I guess now that both CBS and the WB have decided they want to pull out of the money losing CW, it's time to actually worry about ratings for a change."
"Roswell, New Mexico",Kill Legacies you bastards!
"Roswell, New Mexico",Dynasty was a loser.
"Roswell, New Mexico",There was a 4400 remake? Good riddance.
"Roswell, New Mexico","I remember a time when we had nothing but new shows to get excited about and reboots were very, very rare."
"Roswell, New Mexico",I‚Äôll miss Roswell. Sucks it did not get a chance for a proper wrap up.
"Roswell, New Mexico",They just did.
"Roswell, New Mexico","Why do you want to take enjoyment away from other people when it has zero impact on you? What a miserable, horrible personality."
"Roswell, New Mexico","Your comments right before this one are about how people should stop talking about elden ring. What a miserable, horrible, hypocritical personality."
"Roswell, New Mexico",they didn‚Äôt know the truth of wrong from right
"Roswell, New Mexico",I'm surprised every time I see that Roswell High got two adaptations.
"Roswell, New Mexico",That show got roundhouse kicked out of the way
"Roswell, New Mexico","""Westerns sure seem to be popular, we should do one too..."""
"Roswell, New Mexico",I wonder what will replace Walker next year?
"Roswell, New Mexico",I'm obsessed with the first series.  Couldn't get into the sequel.
"Roswell, New Mexico","That scene with Liz and Max in the first series with Sarah McLachlan playing in the background was magic, even though the series itself turned out to be quite cheesy."
"Roswell, New Mexico",There are disappointingly few round house kicks
"Roswell, New Mexico",I see no resemblance between new walker and old walker. Just in name
"Roswell, New Mexico",Because there isn't. Maybe that's the only IP Padelicki could film in Texas
"Roswell, New Mexico","Season 4 of Roswell? Wow. Didn't know that was a thing. Is it a continuation or remake of the 90s show? Does it tie into it in any way? Used to really like that show for some reason. Maybe it was the Dido theme song or my love of William Sadler, really underrated character actor."
"Roswell, New Mexico",Is Roswell a remake of the old show with Shiri Appleby. Is it any good?

"Roswell, New Mexico",The dad from coroner got fired for using the N word.
"Roswell, New Mexico","Adaptation of the book series Roswell High, rather than being a remake of the 90s version. It follows them as adults rather than teens, thankfully."
"Roswell, New Mexico",It's all the drama from the original tv show cranked to 11. I don't think there's an episode without a massive emotional argument. My wife and I watch it for how ridiculous the whole thing gets.
"Roswell, New Mexico","She actually directed an episode in season 1, and the actor for max guest starred in the show"
"Roswell, New Mexico","Theyre both adaptations of a book series. And I personally think it's pretty much, season 2 was a bit rough because of an issue with the showrunner but she got fired and the show got back better."
"Roswell, New Mexico",Saw th e first few episodes. The original WB show probably wasn't that good though. The reboot is heavy on woke crap.
"Roswell, New Mexico",Any news on Legends or Batwoman?
"Roswell, New Mexico","Not yet. Probably around the week of May 9th-14th.

"Roswell, New Mexico",">CW Gives Series Orders to ‚ÄòCharmed,‚Äô ‚ÄòRoswell

WhatYearIsIt.png"
"Roswell, New Mexico",I'm still really really bitter about secret circle having been canceled years ago so hopefully charmed or the other fantasy one will tickle that fancy.
"Roswell, New Mexico","Given the nostalgia factor, I can see the Charmed and Roswell, New Mexico having two seasons, three tops before getting cancelled. And that's pressing it. The rest, dead in the water. "
"Roswell, New Mexico","I watched Roswell back when it was on the first time round, and I can't remember a damn thing about it.  I wish I could say any of those shows interest me.  "
"Roswell, New Mexico",I just talked to someone who was a huge Charmed and Roswell fan back in the day.   They didn't seemed excited about either being rebooted.  I bet this ends badly.
"Roswell, New Mexico",Not gonna lie I spanked it to Charmed a few times during my teen years
"Roswell, New Mexico","God, I really have a bone to pick with the CW. I used to watch a few shows on there every week. Now I only watch Supernatural and that's when the season comes on Netflix for me to binge.

They decided to pass on Wayward Sisters to go with Charmed, the reboot that literally no one wanted? And the sisters are college age (I'm assuming) and the description actually states ""toppling the patriarchy,"" so I immediately know what the show is going to be like. I will be surprised if the ratings for this show allow it to go past one season.

And they are really milking the Vampire Diaries universe shriveled and dry. I already think that Hope is just the child of Klaus that NEVER should have existed. I can't bring myself to actually watch a show about her.

Somebody needs to buy out the CW stat."
"Roswell, New Mexico","Why is it called Roswell, New Mexico? No one is ever going to call it that. "
"Roswell, New Mexico","I was kind of interested in *In The Dark* until the specifically mentioned her balancing her ""colorful love life"" 

Nope. "
"Roswell, New Mexico","Does the charmed description really say ‚Äútoppling the patriarchy?‚Äù. 

Oh boy."
"Roswell, New Mexico","I'm still bitter about the Tomorrow People, still can't believe worse tv shows have gotten more seasons."
"Roswell, New Mexico","kaley cuoco was actually in a season or two of charmed as a young teenage witch if I remember correctly, and with BBT wrapping up I thought maybe it was going to switch her over to that but looks like the timing isn't quite right"
"Roswell, New Mexico","I was thinking that Roswell had been rebooted already, but I was thinking of Star-Crossed. "
"Roswell, New Mexico",'In the Dark' sounds like a clusterfuck waiting to happen 
"Roswell, New Mexico",Yawn! Bore! Change the channel!
"Roswell, New Mexico",It is Katherine Heigl‚Äôs Year
"Roswell, New Mexico","Agree. I‚Äôd love a good, slightly noir, magical/supernatural drama with an unreasonably attractive cast. 

Used to be a big fan of TVD & The Originals but with all the body swapping and people coming back from the dead, it was just too much. "
"Roswell, New Mexico",The Secret Circle! I still cannot believe they cancelled that one. I am going to give Charmed a chance and hope that they do not cancel it like they did The Secret Circle. Man I still cannot believe they cancelled that. 
"Roswell, New Mexico","I could see Charmed lasting a while, but Roswell might only be a year."
"Roswell, New Mexico","As long as their partnership of sorts with Netflix continues, they would have to be Valor in terms of dreadful to be canned. "
"Roswell, New Mexico",You really wanna bet against Charmed? Dynasty got renewed despite dreadful ratings. Charmed will follow the same path.
"Roswell, New Mexico","> I can't remember a damn thing about it

I remember the theme song:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79px4WAWhN0"
"Roswell, New Mexico","It was my absolute favorite show when I was in high school, and after a rewatch, it only partially held up. That show had some truly great moments, and I'd be interested in a reboot, but it'd honestly be hard to beat the cast from first time around. 

Shiri Applebee and Majandra Delfino (prob super spelled that wrong) are both great, Colin Hanks is perfect, and even Katherine Heigl is at one of her better moments. Not to mention the 15 year old me had a giant crush on Max.


Ok, now I'm nostalgic "
"Roswell, New Mexico","I watched most of Charmed the first time round and outside of telling you the actresses and recognizing the guy who was later on Nip&Tuck, I couldn't tell you thing about it."
"Roswell, New Mexico",I remember brody aliens with healing hands and that's it.
"Roswell, New Mexico",Doesn't matter what they think. The reboots happened because the owners of those IP wants revenue instead of it collecting dust in their vault. CW's shows would've been all canned if they solely depended on ratings. You know that Dynasty got renewed right despite getting the lowest  TV rating on all networks? CW' Netflix deal will get Charmed renewed. 
"Roswell, New Mexico",You really wanna bet about Charmed? FYI Dynasty got renewed. Also that TVD spin\-off already landed a deal despite not even airing or having a pilot. The true testament of Vampire Diairies branding. Wayward couldn't even land the same deal. All the noise coming from Wayward are from vocal female minorities that only makes a sub fandom of SPN. Puny hence the lack of confidence  from the network.
"Roswell, New Mexico",Not to be confused with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_(TV_series)
"Roswell, New Mexico","Nothing says toppling the patriarchy more than hot, bra-less witches!"
"Roswell, New Mexico","Judging by some of the dialogue they've managed to shoehorn into Riverdale, CW stands for ""Capitalist Wokeness.""

They've figured out that social consciousness is what The Kids are into nowadays, but (outside of Crazy Ex Girlfriend) their shows don't take the time to explore the issues they name check in any meaningful  or nuanced way. They just throw in some social justice-y buzzwords here and there to go like, ""See? We're 'with it.' Go buy some merch!!"""
"Roswell, New Mexico","Well, Charmed was always very much pro feminism. Poor Cole got burned time and again for things that didn't even get the sisters a sideways glance. "
"Roswell, New Mexico",Its charmed?? It's always been very feminist 
"Roswell, New Mexico",They could never afford her lol
"Roswell, New Mexico",I believe this idea was on the table at the end of Charmed run. It didn't pan out though. I do not think Cuoco's character was as popular as they thought she would be. 
"Roswell, New Mexico",Is BBT wrapping up?
"Roswell, New Mexico","Well, she is in Season 8 of *Suits*."
"Roswell, New Mexico",">  I‚Äôd love a good, slightly noir, magical/supernatural drama with an unreasonably attractive cast. 

Good news, [The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7569592/) is coming soon.

I have to wonder if Charmed got picked up because of that."
"Roswell, New Mexico",Just how bad was Valor? I never watched an episode. 
"Roswell, New Mexico","julian mcmahon can only play one character

arrogant prick. 

"
"Roswell, New Mexico",The guy from N/T is onThe Runaways now. 
"Roswell, New Mexico","I remember having a huge crush on the brunette non-alien but besides that, I remember nothing about it.  Pretty sure I watched the whole thing, too..."
"Roswell, New Mexico",It‚Äôs a reboot of that show. 
"Roswell, New Mexico",Who are now forty and well past their sell by date for that kind of show. 
"Roswell, New Mexico",I thought it was 'Cuties Welcome' because of the attractive young casts of their shows.
"Roswell, New Mexico","I could have sworn the article I saw while just browsing down facebook or somewhere I saw read ""renewed for final season"" but I didn't look into it.  I'll try to find that out.

edit:
> Asked if he was approaching next season as Big Bang‚Äòs swan song, showrunner Steve Holland tells TVLine, ‚ÄúUntil I hear differently, yes.‚Äù The EP, however, is quick to note that an official decision about the show‚Äôs end date has not been made. ‚ÄúI know we have next season, but I don‚Äôt know what happens beyond that,‚Äù he opines. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not my decision to make.

"Roswell, New Mexico","It is literally NOT a reboot.  A reboot means that it's a redo of the original show, which this one absolutely is not.  This is a re\-imagining of the book series in which the original show was based on.  The only similarities between the two will be character names and a minor few plot points.  They had to change the name of it possibly for overseas branding and also possibly for legal reasons \(since the people involved in the new show have no rights to the original show or anything created for it and that may include the name\).

"Roswell, New Mexico","Yes and now people won't need to say ""Roswell, the reboot"""

Babar and the Adventures of Badou,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I would give anything for this.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Please god
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,yes please
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I would be all in
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Yes! Do it! :-)
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"You son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I live for this show.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,And Billy Drago :(
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,You didn‚Äôt like it? I thought it was a blast
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Same
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Just don‚Äôt have it on Starz
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Same!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,You don't know Jack
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Sho Nuff!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,You love to hear it
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).

Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Clowns hate tangelos
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,One of Cartoon Network‚Äôs best and a true shame the whole series isn‚Äôt on DVD.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Scrape and lick.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Please pass the egg salad.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Loved billy‚Äôs relationship with his adopted spider son
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you love me dad?! I‚Äôll be anything you want me to be!‚Äù](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Loved it
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Definitely a favorite of mine
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Honest to God I can remember being a kid and seeing a billboard with this on it. It confused the hell out of my Dad at the time I know.

Babar and the Adventures of Badou,Yeah I agree but at least it‚Äôs on HBO Max
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,That's pretty much just Richard Horvitz's real voice
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"I love Dracula. He's not just Black, he's *Black*.

Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"Actually, there were lots of great episodes, thinking about it. Underrated great show."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,"> And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized.

While not untrue, Billy and Mandy really stands alone in this era and all Childrens TV animation. Only comparable stuff was on Adult Swim."
Babar and the Adventures of Badou,The single bumper clip of Mandy quoting the tenets of satanism would have unleashed a firestorm of bad press if released today.
Witchcraft Works,"I might give it a go.

It's set in Liberdade in Brazil, home to one of the largest Japanese population, hence the Japanese themese in the story. I always wanted to visit that district but wasn't able to."

Witchcraft Works,"Jesus christ, just how bad was ragnarok that you gave it a lower rating than fucking Luna Nera???"
Witchcraft Works,Oh I didn't know that. Lol this makes sense for some reason.
Witchcraft Works,"> I gave up on the very 1st episode because of the amateur camera work.

Lol yea I mentioned this in the post. I don't know wtf was going on with the camera in episode 1 but it does get better though.

Not recommending that u give it another shot if you didn't find anything appealing though. Im glad I'm not the only one who noticed, maybe I'm not such a bad critic afterall. üòÖ"
Witchcraft Works,"I've only season the first season but diablero pissed me off so much. It was good at first but the characters just grew so stupid. I don't wanna spoil but they only managed to stop that thing that happens by pure fucking luck. Like, they literally gave zero fucking shits about what was happening, like, no urgency at all. I was practically screaming at my phone for them to actually do something and hurry the fuck up. And like, the priest was the most boring character ever and there wasn't any real reason for him in show because he basically did nothing, useless tbh."
Witchcraft Works,it was [this bad](https://streamable.com/cl2co).
Witchcraft Works,"i can't, lmfaoooo


And isnt that his sister, wtf???"
Witchcraft Works,"Sorry, but I couldn't possibly disagree with you more. IMO this is the probably worst Agatha Christie adaptation I think I have ever seen. And no, Rufus Sewell and Kaya Scodelario are NOT excellent -- I'm a big fan of both but even they can't save the incomprehensible train-wreck that is the script. And, worst of all, it is mind-numbingly dull. My advice is simple: Do not waste your time."
Witchcraft Works,"Pretty big typo: It's ""Agatha Christie"", not ""Agatha Christine"". :-P"
Witchcraft Works,"I've only watched the first episode so far.

I haven't a clue what's causing all of it, which is a good sign. It's all pretty creepy.

The main guy Rufus Sewell is really really good. I'm definitely gonna watch the second half."
Witchcraft Works,"Thanks for the review. I'd be curious to get a take from real Christie devotees. I've read a couple and seen lots of adaptations and my feeling is that this style of mystery storytelling has not aged well. And there seems to be something going on with the estate that rights can be bought so readily and so cheaply. Though I'd guess it's a situation similar to that of Stephen King - if you've got such a vast library of content, you're more willing to give some stuff away. The result with the latest run of Poirot et al movies/series has, in my mind, been dull, dull, dull."
Witchcraft Works,"No way was this an 8.  Not horrible, but not an 8."
Witchcraft Works,I'm guessing you read the book? üò∂
Witchcraft Works,All the new adaptations of Agatha Christie besides for And Then There Were None have been horrendous imo
Witchcraft Works,my bad i was half asleep when i typed this up. üò©
Witchcraft Works,I gave up after 3-4 episodes when it was on SyFy.    It's the low rent version of Supernatural which is a TV show in their universe as well.   I wanted to like (especially with Mario Van Pebbles) but didn't for basically the reasons you stated.
Witchcraft Works,I kinda liked the show though it had a lot of confusing stuff. I kept watching till the finale episode and it was such a huge mess. It was kinda hilarious just how bad it was. It felt like they gave up on the show so they said fuck it just escalate everything to super weird levels of nonsense and random shitty effects! I'd recommend watching the last episode just to be amazed at how bad it got.
Witchcraft Works,"I saw this randomly on Netflix, reading the description, it looked interesting so I watched the first episode. It was ok. I thought things will get improved as they build their mythology. But things just got worst. 

They have no solid mythology and the stories and character development came from nowhere. Plot points are not connected fluently. It was a mess of a TV show. It was so bad but I kept on watching till the end. The only really interesting bits were when they got trapped in a clock but it was still a mess. And the episode where they got stuck in a time loop.

This is the first time I'm glad a TV show got cancelled. Lol "
Witchcraft Works,"A few episodes in, I remember thinking : ""This show about a black family is the whitest shit I have ever seen."" I was one thousand percent sure it had been written and directed by white folks. 
Google proved me wrong and I still don't know how to feel about it."
Witchcraft Works,"I almost forgot about this show until your reply showed up. Never actually finished it, and sure aren't finishing now with Jack Ryan and Ozark out."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,[deleted]
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I know Boruto gets a lot of hate, but is it actually any good?"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Spoilers, but back when Naruto was about Ninjas

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWARF7DmM4"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"This was one of my favourite fight scenes in the anime, up there with Madara v Shinobi I alliance, Naruto v pain, and my personal favourite, Madara v Guy "
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Is Boruto canon or is a ""shit, we gotta keep making this series cause $$$""?"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"If anyone can sell me on naruto and Boruto in less than 2 paragraphs, I‚Äôll be all over it.

I just have no idea what it‚Äôs about but it does seem interesting."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,That is some generic villain design. Animation is great tho also its a repost.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Ok so about 80% of this was amazing animation and the rest were so many partical effects the screen may as well be blank.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It's another dimension, Naruto gets kidnapped by an alien and taken there so he can drain Naruto of the Kyuubi, Sasuke (who can also move between dimensions) takes Boruto and goes there to save him."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Good, because this time instead of the usual dumb but always 100% noble and good hero you get a protagonist who's more complex and flawed."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It's not, unless you're a hardcore Naruto fan."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I went and saw the movie with my friends who were going because what the hell why not, and it was pretty meh. Naruto was this bland near-comatose bureaucrat in adulthood, and the fan-service was basically just simple statements of who ended up marrying who or who was who's child to massive applause."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,[Boruto has plenty of moments that are just as ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù as that.](https://youtu.be/aURXgCKrHuw)
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,wow.. what a scene. I didn't think I'd cry again after so long.. I really need to rewatch this arc. 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Ninjas who create lightning balls in their hands
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Sasuke vs Naruto's final fight should be up there as well.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It‚Äôs canon. Kishimoto doesn‚Äôt personally draw the manga anymore (can‚Äôt blame him after 15 years of drawing weekly Naruto chapters) but he‚Äôs still heavily involved. He‚Äôs written two of the show‚Äôs arcs so far and supervised/contributed to the rest of them.

And while it‚Äôs undoubtedly a continuation, the series has put in an obvious effort to separate itself from Naruto. It builds on Naruto‚Äôs world-building while also exploring themes and types of character arcs that weren‚Äôt present in the original. 

It‚Äôs not a perfect show (neither was Naruto), but I definitely enjoy it. I really appreciate that it‚Äôs trying carve out its own identity."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Fully canon, hasn't reached the manga yet afaik."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Fun, unique and fleshed out world with ninjas who despite that are very grounded characters. Great, and emotional main story, too, will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. This will be clear right from the first episode.  
  
Watch the Kai version though, which cuts out all the filler."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It seemed to drop frames during some of the particle effect stuff, like it's struggling to render."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Though I agree with everything you said and also enjoy the show, it does still suffer from having a lot of silly/low impact filler episodes. The current Cho-Cho arc in particular comes to mind, its not a bad plot but could have been done in one episode if written better."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I know one time my dad used his shadow clone to come to my baseball game, same thing happened! I was heartbroken."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Every pre time skip arc is so amazing... Gaara vs Lee is so good
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Yeah but the underlining story is about ninjas being used as emotionless tools of war.... Naruto time skip became about about two star crossed lovers finding each other again. Buroto is about who the fuck knows what.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Yeah an amazing fight but the ones I listed are my personal favs 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Cool, I might catch up then...I just wanted to know if it was actual canon or Dragon Ball GT ""damn, we gotta make more"" canon."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Are the story arcs more complex, and writing better? Your description sounds really similar to Avatar:TLAB's evolution into The Legend of Korra."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,How much of the anime is generic filler bs? If it doesnt have fillers I might give it a shot. Im super bored atm and dont have anything to watch.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Ahh so kinda like the new dragonball Z version that cuts out the annoying filler stuff.

Ok I‚Äôll get started with it. "
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Is there an actual Kai version, or is that just a recommended viewing approach?"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Kai compresses like 800 episodes into 70 odd? 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Potentially a problem with youtube
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,And that‚Äôs why I put grounded in quotation marks. At its core it is a grounded conflict (child hurt by a parent who‚Äôs never around because of his job) that still takes place within the world of Naruto.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Boruto's main theme is basically human vs machine, and whether the ninjas will embrace tech, or fight it.  
  
A more unique and flawed protagonist also allows the main character's story to be about learning to fully embrace the original ninja ways, this character development is basically spoiled to us in the first scene of the first episode.  
  
There's other themes going on but it's mainly this two. Naruto is magic balls, Shippuden is mountain sized magic balls, and Boruto is magic balls with tech thrown in."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I would say at its best Boruto is more complex and nuanced than Naruto, but it isn't consistent in that fact and has some big dips. A comparison to Avatar kinda fits, but I would say both incarnations of the Avatar show are superior to their Na/Boruto counterparts. Boruto does look at societal issues more, but with nowhere near as much depth and nuance as Korra."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Oh and also I forgot to mention that the soundtrack is one of the best things about it. It's legendary, super good.  
  
I once went on the anime reddit and somebody asked which are the best anime soundtracks, and I said Naruto. Mostly everyone agreed, you know I thought they would say some other anime or something."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/91wdjv/naruto_kai_ultimate_subbed_edition/
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Yeah, the Kai eps are up on the Naruto subreddit I think."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"70, but they're ranging between 1hour and 2 hour episodes.  
  
Which makes sense because each episode adapts a manga volume afaik."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Holy Jesus. There was **that** much filler? 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Yeah, TV Tokyo does this sometimes (it‚Äôs called ‚Äúghosting‚Äù) when a scene has too high of a frame rate. Something about Japanese broadcast regulations. It‚Äôll be fixed on the DVD release."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Yes I was admittedly be a dick because I thought it was funny.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Nah, overall it's something like 200ish 20 minute eps in the first (120-130+ being canon) & then 4-500 in Shippuden (don't know how much filler), but the Kai eps are cut together so if they'd still be 20 minute, there'd probably be a lot more than 70+."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,There are non canonical episides inserted in there? How does that work? 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,The Kai version? The Kai only adapts the manga and the manga only
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I have seen qhite a lot of popular anime, but i have to tell you, attack on titan is by far superior. That show is just 10/10"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"While we're on the topic of anime, I started rewatching Fullmetal Alchemist (the 2003 series) and I just got to the Nina episode and I'm not mentally prepared for it... This is one of the few times I actually have a hard time getting myself to watch an episode of a fantastic series because of how tragic the episode is."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Thanks for the recommendation! I‚Äôm surprised you gave My Hero Academia such a low score. What I liked about it is that side characters had a chance to shine, unlike some other popular animes  where the side characters disappear. But I see where the main storyline can be repetitive !"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"great recommendations. 
You should probably check out the great pretender on netflix, its really good!"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,If you love sports anime also check out Run in the Wind. Its more of a drama show with Sports as a backdrop than a sports show. But it is surely worth a watch.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"If you have time to check it out, try these three sports anime. HAIKYU, Kurokos basketball, and Chihayafuru. That last one, is probably my fave anime at the moment."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"You'd love Assassination Classroom on Hulu. The English dub is actually really good.

My only issue with NHK is the whole Manic Pixy Dream Girl shit."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,will definitely check out 1 or 2 of those when i get the time. admittedly i've never seen a sports anine before.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Very feel good, but unrealistic at the same time. It's generally for a teenage demographic, I feel, but I still love them; this is coming from someone who doesn't even play sports in real life."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,At the rate the comic is going they're not going to have *any* canon for at least 3-4 years.  It hasn't even finished the parts about the movie yet.  
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Why? Just let this thing die. Both the Naruto manga, and anime, ran on longer than they should, why can't they just let it be?"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Oh no they're continuing to flesh out a universe with thousands if not millions of fans around the world! How dare they!

Also the Naruto manga had a storyline it followed well, it only went on for about 10 chapters too long because they had to shoehorn in Kaguya, one of the worlds crappiest villains, to set up The Last movie"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It was good to see her again, even if it was goodbye..."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"The season is pretty good. Not perfect (too dark, still don‚Äôt like all the cursing, so much time on M‚ÄôTalas Prime) but holy shit does it feel like they‚Äôre actually doing something with these characters and the plot is pretty compelling. 

Also need to commend them for giving Crusher more to do than she ever got in 6 seasons of the show and 4 movies."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Anyone remember season one of TNG had a few conspiracy episodes in it that were connected (with the little bug creatures that had infiltrated Star Fleet)? Then it was all dropped by season two (which introduced The Borg). Wonder if this is going to come back to that?
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I enjoyed the first couple seasons of Picard well enough, but this season has been on another level.  The pacing is good, nearly every problem that's raised in one episode gets solved the next, and some of the legacy characters are getting better writing in some scenes than they ever got in TNG.  The confrontation between Beverly and Picard a couple episodes ago was top notch; I felt like they both had very valid points of view, and revisiting the relationship of Picard and this cameo character was something I didn't know I wanted, as I watched them come to a new understanding of each other.  If this is the kind of writing Matalas and his team are doing, I'll watch the show for as long as they'll make it."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Wait for it..... ""WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A CONSPIRACY THRILLER?!"""
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Its interesting that they're leaning so heavily on DS9 for this season when little bits of plot and dialogue suggests that the writers haven't actually watched DS9. Like in this week's episode where Riker says the Maquis aren't the enemy anymore. Which is technically true, but an odd way to phrase it since the Maquis were exterminated by the Jem'Hadar. They're not the enemy anymore because they're all dead. And Riker's statement that Changelings can only do surface details but not the deeper changes, which is just straight up not true. Maybe it's just that Riker is a complete idiot?"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Been loving this season minus the ¬´¬†we‚Äôre old¬†¬ª moments between Picard and rikee
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"It was more like a poorly written complete rehash/ripoff of the first season TNG episode ""Conspiracy"". These guys don't have an original thought in their brains."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I was hoping for Jem Hadar and Vorta

Instead they give me Ro Laren?!"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"> so much time on M‚ÄôTalas Prime

Especially with Raffi, who just might be the *worst* spy in the entire galaxy. 

Seriously, though, it really has been a significant improvement on season 1 (and miles better than the total dumpster fire that was season 2, but that's hardly a high bar). There have still been some odd bits (like that whole conflict between Picard and Riker on the bridge of the Titan; Picard's insistence on fighting a more powerful and better-armed opponent instead of escaping, even long before it became clear that escape would be all but impossible, was so weirdly out of character than I genuinely thought he must have been replaced by the Changeling for a while there), but for the most part it's been an interesting and coherent storyline and some good character moments."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Did Terry Matalas name the place after himself? Lol. I will say I think he‚Äôs doing a much better job and actually understands TNG
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Apparently Terry Matalas [considered it but went with the Changelings instead](https://collider.com/star-trek-picard-season-3-episode-4-spoiler-interview-showrunner-terry-matalas/?newsletter_popup=1): 

>	I do like the conspiracy bugs, I did consider for a hot minute, the conspiracy bugs. The issue with the conspiracy bugs is they kill their host. So that would mean anyone that you saw with a bug in them was dead, and you wouldn't be able to do the paranoia thriller that you wanted to do if it was somebody you loved, that meant they were dead. So there [were] about three storylines I couldn't do without killing legacy characters."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Also the TNG bugs kind of reminded me of the mind control bugs from Wrath of Khan.  And the special effects looked like Red Dwarf.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Agreed, I thought the first two seasons were dumb, watchable TV starring a bunch of familiar faces. Meanwhile S3 feels like a better continuation and use of legacy characters than anything from the first two."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Ik season 2 was criticized a lot but matalas will always get benefit of doubt from me after 12 monkeys
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"I mean, Voyager came back with a ship full of Maquis and presumably a lot of them are still around.

And Changelings couldn‚Äôt replicate things like blood. Sisko‚Äôs dad figured that one out."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,I get the sense this season is an apology to fans for not involving TNG in the Dominion War.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,you might appreciate them more when you get old
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Don't forget that they also ripped off the plot of Wrath of Khan, another episode of TNG where Picard had a secret badboy son, and that DS9 episode where changelings already infiltrated Starfleet. 

This is Sci-Fi. Show me something new."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,That might be why it's better than the first two sessions
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"He did, but it was first mentioned on an episode of Enterprise."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Matalas left season 2 like 3 or 4 episodes in to work on season 3. Akia Goldsman handled the rest of season 2.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"A ship *half* full of Maquis.  Some of us were *not* Maquis.

-On behalf of Tuvok"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"But Sisko's dad also pointed out an obvious workaround, and given the times that the Founders faked blood screenings (Way of the Warrior, for example), it's not like they'd suddenly forget that."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"and wouldn't you know it, that was about when the quality took a nosedive straight to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

I'm glad that Akiva Goldsman seems like he's gonna be busy with the I Am Legend sequel for a while."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Think we‚Äôre talking about different things. My point was that it‚Äôs been canon that they couldn‚Äôt do anything more than surface deep, hence why Sisko‚Äôs dad made a comment that he‚Äôd just suck up someone‚Äôs blood if he were a changeling."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Can we just give Frakes his own show?
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Can we just stop with the dark sets and the GD swear words? It‚Äôs Trek, not BSG."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"""we brought back some people you recognize"" is becoming a pretty predictable gambit of a franchise losing the interest of its fans"
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Maybe Patrick Stewart can act like Picard this time.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Wasn't it great when Dr. Crusher straight up murdered a guy already incapacitated? So much like her character.
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,Maybe it could have found its magic by hiring good writers this time.

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"> Star Trek: Picard‚Äô Season 3 Finds Its Magic by Reuniting the ‚ÄòNext Generation‚Äô Crew  

Not in the first episode, that's for @#¬§! sure."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"Honestly it sounds like a snoozer.  Troi and Riker appeared on the show previously and their presence really didn't help.  And what's true of them is true of most of the original TNG cast - they're all perfectly fine actors but not exceptional or charismatic enough to really make a difference - the exceptions IMHO being Patrick, Brent Spiner and to some degree Michael Dorn.   Sure, seeing the old cast again I'm sure will lead to some great nostalgic moments, but in the end it all comes down to writing and the writers on this show haven't proved they can deliver more than one or two good episodes per season.  I'll watch, but I've got low expectations."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,"No.. no, it doesn't."
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations,That is TBD.

Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Hah I was he same. It‚Äôs a little like La Brea which has been renewed for season 3. So they‚Äôre doing something right I guess :)
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"My Mom tried to get me to watch Big Sky with her. I lasted about 4 episodes. She got mad because I would tell what the major plot points were going to be at least 20 minutes before they happened. About 5 minutes after they introduced John Carrol Lynch's character, I told her that he was the Big Bad, and he'd betray one of the good guys by the end of the first episode. When he shot Ryan Phillipe, Mom just glared at me."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Actually to be fair, S1 was good. S2 still had Brian Geraghy (which since move to 1923) who is very good. There are some interesting side characters including the Marshal and the girl from Sopranos.

I stop at S3 after a few episodes. Could not continue."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I liked it! But it is like Lifetime Movie so
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Of course it is terribly written, it is a David E. Kelley show."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"I liked the first season.

It is what it is which is a network crime drama which cable and streaming do better."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Is it worse that Devs? That‚Äôs the worst acted and written show I‚Äôve ever witnessed.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,hahaha! The ONLY reason I didn't see that coming is because I've never seen him as anything other than like a wholesome dude in stuff.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"If you thought season 1 is good I can only imagine how terrible it gets from here. There are moments that are redeeming but the longer this season goes on the worse the writing gets. Episode 1, fucking great. I was even telling a friend how the only thing separating episode one from an HBO show is the lack of extreme violence and vulgar language. And then all the cliche's started. And one liners. And horrible acting choices. This US Marshall is a copy of Sons of Anarchy's Lincoln Potter except awful. The only reason i'm going to keep watching is because I think Jensen Ackles is an exceptional actor who got stuck in network tv for far too long and I want to get to his season."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I think the good stuff he's done isn't held back by cable television.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Way worse
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,You clearly haven't seen Zodiac. He's fucking terrifying in that.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure, That scene from Big Sky with John Carroll Lynch covered up the surprise of his scene in the very first episode of The Glades. I saw the obvious plot points but thought that surely it won't happen again. I was looking forward to him being the cop partner of the main character. There is no way he is a corrupt law enforcement who wants to kill the main character in this as well. Well he actually was.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I always see him as Drew Carey's brother. Hahaha
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Wow. That‚Äôs impressive.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I HAVE! Completely forgot about that it‚Äôs been a while.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,EXACTLY!
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I lost interest many episodes ago. Been a rapid downhill descent ever since John Carroll Lynch left the show. Him and Brian Geraghty are just such amazing actors.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"God, I am so here for Jensen, evil!Reba, Cassie, and Jenny. Can't wait for season three!"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Love this damn show
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Without naming names, I rather lost interest the beginning of Season 2 when someone shot point blank  in the head survived."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"I stopped after Episode 2 of S1...just wasn't captured by it. 

Is it worthwhile to watch?"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"so like...hypothetically, could I start watching this show at season 3 and not watch the first two seasons"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Wasn't that in season 1?
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"No the first 5 episodes of the show were probably the best. After that the mysteries got dumber and you found yourself rooting for the villain characters more then the protagonists of the show. 

Bringing in Jensen Ackles I think is a last ditch attempt by ABC to get people to watch.

Surprised David E Kelley was used so much to promote this considering it‚Äôs pretty mediocre and not as high quality as the other shows he‚Äôs a producer on."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"I like it a lot but it shouldn't be a broadcast show. It's too long. They could have probably made 4 seasons out of the two seasons and I would have enjoyed it more.

And binging does not help that feeling lol."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"You could because there's a new mystery every season but after Jensen joined, I binge-watched the show from the beginning and loved it."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I was wondering this exact same thing
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"The very end, then season 2 the person was still alive. (if we are talking of the same person who I didn't want to name as...spoiler)"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh... I know who you're talking about now. Yeah that was just odd.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"I don't really care about the article, but that graphic has me on edge for some reason"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Not high at all. The only reason these shows are getting huge deals is because they were made before streaming and are super popular with people who use streaming. Nowadays I bet every series, even the shitty one season before canceled shows, have streaming contracts made before a second is even filmed."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"I mean those massive deals of Friends, The Office and Big Bang are just numbers, they're passing money from one hand to the other in the same company, shouldn't really count. 

But to answer the question, probably not higher than those as those are massive hits especially in continuous rewatching and there's not really any show that can correspond. Dramas aren't the same thing in that ""confort TV"" style so I don't think they'll reach those kind of deals (also people don't rewatch dramas from 10-20 years ago so much)"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"The only one of these that made a deal was Seinfeld. The others were same party transactions that only made public a ""deal"" for PR and legal purposes.  Ugh."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,They wont.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Is this English?
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"These ""Tell you when to laugh"" shows are bullshit nowadays.  Real shows that nobody acknowledges are shows like Sunny in Philadelphia."

Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Reminds me of Hanging Balloons by Junji Ito.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"There will be a sitcom that takes tBBT's place. But yeah, it's hard to syndicate sequential dramas/shows. Friends mostly works fine on shuffle. Breaking Bad (or even The Good Place) doesn't."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Still have to pay all the profit participants based on the amount in the deal. So even if it is a deal with a studios own streaming service, they have to pay the producers, actors, writers and directors their back end money based on these crazy rich deals.

And they can't sell them to their own services at too much of a discount or you'll get the creatives crying foul like the actors/producers of Bones did with FOX."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,You're right. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia gets absolutely no recognition at all on Reddit. Or anywhere else.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Laugh tracks, which most people cringe and results in a viewer not watching, is actually still effective i.e. **One Day at a time** and shows of past it actually doesn't tarnish great sitcoms of some of the best **HIMYM**, **The IT crowd**, **Friends**, **Seinfeld**, **Frazier**, etc.  Though, I personal hate them in cases like **Sports night** with Sorkin against it as it slowly faded, and the best shows in comedy imo don't have laugh tracks; **Community**, **Entoursge** , **Louie**, **Superstore**, and the ones that led to this groundbreaking new perspective of producing sitcoms that are superior in not using them like the pioneers that paved the way; **The office**, **Parks and recs**, **Extras**, **The office UK**, **New Girl**, **Happy endings**, **Eastboujd and down**, **Vice principals**, **Enlightened**, **Arrested development**, **30 Rock**that only evoled into shows today like the mentioned  **Superstore**, **Brooklynn 99**, **Veep**, **The good place**, **Sirens**, **Scrubs**, **IASIP** et cetera.  But I believe **Rescue me** (a comdram) really started the dark comedy leading to **Louie**, **Atlanta**, **Getting on US**, **Masters of none**, **Fleabag**, **Baskets**, **Better things**, **Party down**, **Curb your enthusiasm**, **Brockmire**, **transparent**, and a lot of great British comedy's that I think may need an acquired taste"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,He looks like a sleepy Billy Crystal here
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,think it might be brooklyn nine nine tbh - it‚Äôs pretty popular (worldwide - not just in america like the office) and theres 6 long seasons with not much continuity so it‚Äôs the perfect show to replace bbt (and is less shit as a bonus)
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,">Still have to pay all the profit participants based on the amount in the deal

Yes, this is the reason they do it, its all about not getting sued over imputed fees

They sell it to themselves in a deliberate unfair auction, for them its just one pocket to the other, so even if they up the price another $100M to beat a competitor their ""real"" cost of that $100M bump is only a couple million in points to the profit participates, while the other companies need to shell out the whole $100M in comparison

There is no ""real"" deal that takes place its just some legal protection, accounting, and shuffling of funds."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Sup

It's a mess, and the final product likely is going to be...well, worthy of the kind of movies the Russo brothers make for Netflix.

Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Madden was tremendous in Bodyguard. He needs a proper drama role.
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Why is she holding her arms out like she's got those Black Widow wrist taser things on?
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"> When head of Amazon Studios Jen Salke came to Joe and Anthony Russo with an unusual idea for a TV show, they were intrigued by the potential to do something brand-new. 


> **Salke imagined an action spy show that was the first-ever global TV series, with a main show and then local offshoots around the world, starring local talent.** It had never been done before, but that‚Äôs what the Russo brothers liked about it from the start. ‚ÄúAnthony and I have reached a point in our careers where the ambition is the compelling part of the approach for us,‚Äù Joe Russo tells Vanity Fair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for new ways to tell stories.‚Äù

> Through their production company, AGBO, the Russos embarked on a years-long journey to bring Citadel to life. **The Amazon series stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas as elite spies who work for Citadel, a spy organization that has no allegiance to any country.** As seen in Vanity Fair‚Äôs exclusive first-look images, **the high-concept, action-packed spy thriller is set after the fall of the spy organization, when the two agents must attempt to piece together what happened. One of the main problems: Their memories have been wiped.** ‚ÄúThis is secrets on steroids,‚Äù showrunner David Weil says. 

> **With standout supporting performances by Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville, this ambitious new series will premiere its first two episodes on Prime Video on April 28.** It‚Äôs a big, bold swing‚Äîand it‚Äôs actually just the beginning, **with spin-off series already deep into production around the world.** ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just creating a story, we‚Äôre creating this world that‚Äôs spanning countries and continents,‚Äù Madden says. ‚ÄúThat can be daunting, but also super exciting.‚Äù"
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"Good concept, lots of potential, but I'll go out on a limb and say that the two leads are actually the bad guys who contributed to the fall of the titular organization."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,"This will be a hit like gray man and the other cop/military/detective shows on amazon but I hope it's good. While the spinoffs from other countries ideas sounds good on paper .....its all a bit much.

The Gray man was a waste."
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,Seriously how much more money does Jennifer Salke have to burn before Bezos fires her ass? Does she have blackmail photos on him? Did he get drunk at a party and touch her inappropriately or what?
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Flying Island: The Sky Adventure,I just want a second season of the bodyguard. So I'll begrudgingly watch anything with Madden in it to scratch that itch

Angel N Devil,[deleted]
Angel N Devil,I think the ending to The Americans was really well earned and cathartic.
Angel N Devil,You could make a strong case for *Gravity Falls*.
Angel N Devil," Black Adder goes forth ending was great and quite sad , perfect ending"
Angel N Devil,MASH
Angel N Devil,Angel
Angel N Devil,"Star Trek TNG.  All Good Things.  

The last was easily one of it's best episodes."
Angel N Devil,"Since the finale was technically Parts 1-4, I'll go with Avatar: The Last Airbender"
Angel N Devil,Newhart
Angel N Devil,The Shield
Angel N Devil,Six Feet Under. Absolute perfection.
Angel N Devil,"Justified. That finale really had me at the edge of my seat, good stuff"
Angel N Devil,"Top three for me:

* Six Feet Under
* The Americans
* Star Trek, The Next Generation"
Angel N Devil,"Star Trek The Next Generation

The finale "" All Good Things"" was widely regarded not just the best episode (2 part episode) of the show, but significantly better than the ""Generations"" movie"
Angel N Devil,Not sure how many fans the show had but 12 Monkeys has an amazing finale that wraps up every loose end you thought the show forgot about. The finale elevated the show from good to great IMO.
Angel N Devil,King of the Hill nailed it pretty damn good.
Angel N Devil,St. Elsewhere
Angel N Devil,"Lucifer

Vampire Diaries.

Person of Interest"
Angel N Devil,"The Shield's double feature can hardly be beaten, at least in American television. It's basically the apocalypse where everything burns to a crisp yet someone is unlucky enough to survive and sit on a pile of corpses, looking shellshocked"
Angel N Devil,I got to say the Atlanta finale was brilliant
Angel N Devil,Black Sails
Angel N Devil,Buffys is amazing but I‚Äôd say body is the best
Angel N Devil,"Twin Peaks. For the original series, anyway. The finale is a masterpiece of subjective storytelling that basically blows away everything that came before it."
Angel N Devil,Arguably Breaking Bad. Some prefer Ozymandias though.
Angel N Devil,The final episode of Blackadder Goes Fourth is widely recorded as being the strongest of that season if not all Blackadder episodes
Angel N Devil,‚ÄúChuckles Bites the Dust‚Äù is generally thought of as The Mary Tyler Moore Show‚Äôs best episode but the series finale is amazing.
Angel N Devil,"Not the series finale, but succession‚Äôs season finales are consistently the best episodes"
Angel N Devil,The Sopranos.
Angel N Devil,Lost
Angel N Devil,"This one take 

https://youtu.be/U8Amun7SpJ8"
Angel N Devil,None. Television endings are notoriously bad. I can't think of a single example of one that is considered the absolute best episode.
Angel N Devil,"Recently, The Devil's Hour."
Angel N Devil,Also perhaps the best finale of all time.
Angel N Devil,"I will disagree. It was one fine, but not as good, from beginning to end, as many other episodes. The whole part with Hawkeye's breakdown was weird and would have been fine as a standalone episode. But very jarring as the beginning of a finale. The final send-off was also just fine to me."
Angel N Devil,"Smile Time wasn‚Äôt the finale, though"
Angel N Devil,I love that ending so much that I completely ignore the continuation of the comics even if Whedon said it was canon. Angel died fighting a dragon and that's it!
Angel N Devil,Was also gonna say this but wasn't sure if if was the most popular episode. Definitely a creative ending!
Angel N Devil,Yes
Angel N Devil,"Seriously it has *the* perfect ending for the main character. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and Six Feet Under had great endings but The Shield could not have ended any better."
Angel N Devil,"Came to say this although the thing about the shield imho is that it goes on for 7 seasons and you can't find one fucking weak episode in all of it. Its consistency of quality is beyond belief. There are parts I like less (the whole thing with Tavon and the Decoy Squad is the least interesting bit of the series for me), but it's a matter of taste, it's not actually worse per se."
Angel N Devil,"Nah.

Season 5 finally is comfortably better."
Angel N Devil,The Shield is one of the top three finale of all time
Angel N Devil,"I haven't seen The Americans, so I put The Shield in that slot"
Angel N Devil,This is the correct answer. Never seen a show crush an ending like that.
Angel N Devil,"Now I am going to have to go back and re-watch 12 Monkeys, I think I quit in the 4th season. Not that I didn't enjoy it, just got distracted by other things."
Angel N Devil,"That was an unusually satisfying ending.  Hank and Bobby, just grilling"
Angel N Devil,"That St Elsewhere finale was unlike anything if ever seen before or since.

It took the entire show, said ""nope that's not what you thought it was""

It was a huge gamble, I loved it"
Angel N Devil,Big fan of POI's ending but I don't think the finale is definitively the best episode of the series. Show had a lot of standouts.
Angel N Devil,I need to do a rewatch of Person of Interest but I remember thinking the loop episode was the best one. Show still had a phenomenal ending though.
Angel N Devil,"Personally I remember thinking "".exe"" - the second last episode of Person of Interest - would have been a better finale. Absolutely phenomenal show throughout though."
Angel N Devil,"Ooh screw  you man, I was so excited to say The Shield. And I am so jealous of you depicting it so fucking perfectly."
Angel N Devil,"Great show!

What‚Äôs so good about that ending is that no one can say for sure what *really* happened. The creators of the show said as much. Very smart and fits the themes of the show. 

Truth is just the official story being told by the victors. ‚ÄúAs time goes on, it matters less and less.‚Äù"
Angel N Devil,I prefer Crawl Space and Face off
Angel N Devil,Not even remotely the case.
Angel N Devil,"For me it‚Äôs the best, but while most like it, I‚Äôve seen few put it at the top."
Angel N Devil,While I will agree that the Sapranos ending was good-I don‚Äôt think there is any universe where it is considered the series‚Äô BEST episode. Just my opinion tho.
Angel N Devil,I was actually surprised to find that show enjoyable. I went into it thinking I was going to hate it but was very wrong.
Angel N Devil,After the Fall is really great and definitely worth checking out though.
Angel N Devil,"Co-Pilot is objectively the worst episode of the entire run. It simplifies character motivations in such a way that it actually makes the rest of the show worse. The Shield is a masterpiece, and it's one of my favorite shows of all time, but I skip that episode on rewatch or when showing it to others."
Angel N Devil,"I found season six (the one with the Armenians) a little drawn out, as if they were prepping everything up for the grand finale in s7 and stretched that storyline in not very exciting ways, but still great tv"
Angel N Devil,"The Shield is great but personally was never a fan of Julien's character or his subplots and that was before the actor who played him got convicted for murdering his wife.

I also think that as great as the finale was, the season finale for S5 is the most memorable episode of the series. It's the episode that changes everything and it was incredibly shocking at the time."
Angel N Devil,">you can't find one fucking weak episode in all of it.

Yeah you can. The majority of the show was mediocre. It lives on from the strength of it's finale."
Angel N Devil,Exactly what I was going to say! Not enough people have seen it to know the ending. Pretty niche show and a lot of people stay away from time travel/sci-fi. Best. Finale. Ever.
Angel N Devil,"Did you watched special?

https://youtu.be/SOr4CkHiVK8"
Angel N Devil,"The whole thing is great, though. It's a real contender for most underrated sci-fi show of all. People just love the movie so much that they can't imagine that the show could compare, but they don't understand that the show has a much larger and more complex story that it wants to tell and it tells it exceptionally well. One of the most incredibly brilliantly plotted time travel stories in any medium. They literally thought of everything."
Angel N Devil,Absolutely  :D
Angel N Devil,"Yes, agreed. I will forever be in awe of meticulously they had to plan everything. I mean every damn question answered. Not one dangling thread."
Angel N Devil,"I watched two episodes of this show, but simply couldn‚Äôt do a third. I‚Äôm not sure what it is - I like Emmy and think she does a great job in this, the supporting cast is good and i like the style of the show. There‚Äôs just something so empty about the whole story. 

I know almost nothing about the real story here, but Angelyne just seems like such an empty narcissist, contributing nothing to the world and feeding off those around her. There‚Äôs nothing likable about her, at least in these two episodes.  She just wants something to happen and she manipulates people until it does. And there doesn‚Äôt even seem to be a point to it - she‚Äôs just a lady on a bunch of billboards. I get that she‚Äôs a part of LA culture, and maybe the final episodes redeem it, but man I was just having a hard time caring."
Angel N Devil,I actually really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny. Emmy Rossum did an amazing job. I didn't even realize it was her. And forgot it was her! She really became the roll.
Angel N Devil,"It's not bad 
But before I researched the casting, I thought Amanda Bynes was playing the older Angelyne ü§£"
Angel N Devil,"I‚Äôm so disappointed by this show. I was looking forward to it for a while. Emmy isn‚Äôt bad, but she didn‚Äôt really capture the true Angelyne."
Angel N Devil,"I‚Äôm just starting this series so I don‚Äôt have much to say but I do have a sort-of connection to Angelyne. My Dad and Grandfather ran a business near Los Angeles in the mid-90s and Angelyne showed up a lot at the office. My Dad didn‚Äôt like her but apparently my Grandfather was all over her. 

Not much else to say, just thought that was interesting."
Angel N Devil,Emmy Rossum? I'm in.
Angel N Devil,I enjoyed this limited series even though I only finished 2 episodes.  Her backstory was so fascinating.  The sound track is superb too.
Angel N Devil,Just saw the trailer. Emmy Rossum completely transforms into the role. Looks great.
Angel N Devil,"It's not bad 
But before I researched the casting, I thought Amanda Bynes was playing the older Angelyne ü§£"
Angel N Devil,"Just finished last night, loved it! Emmy was incredible."
Angel N Devil,"Wow!

Let me introduce myself, as I think it's important to know that I never knew a thing about the icon 'Angelyne' before yesterday morning. I'm from the Uk, I was a teenager when 'Moonlighting' hit our screens, and it quickly became my favourite TV show. David Addison was probably my first role model that I chose for myself. And Maddie was a perfect foil. But that was nearly 40 years ago, and I haven't watched it since. Until two days ago. After suffering vertigo from the pilot episode, I settled in. 

Within 50 seconds of the second episode, I saw it. That unmistakable image that had always quickly grabbed my teenage attention, before letting go completely. It took me until episode 5 before I remembered I was on the internet and maybe, after all these years, I could find out who she was.  I don't think I ever believed it was a real person, at all, so when I searched 'Moonlighting opening credits blond' I fully expected that I would need to work harder to solve the most important mystery of my teenage years.

But the internet is a wonderful thing and I was soon overwhelmed by pink. Hundreds of images, some of Lady Gaga looking like the girl in the image. Some of Emmy Rossum as ""Angelyne"" in 'Angelyne', and some of this \[first impressions\] Bimbo Granny Failed Pornstar, called Angelyne. A connection was made, and so I investigated this Angelyne and discovered she was the ""Billboard Queen"". Clearly the most likely candidate.

So, intrigued by the memories of a hormonal teen, and the image of a Bimbo's shattered dreams to match those of said teen, I set aside 'Moonlighting' and began my amazing journey into the life of an undeniable icon.

I was enjoying it. I had forgotten I was watching a ""bio-pic"". It felt much like any other TV show. Maisel, Schmidt, Crazy Ex. But when we  were introduced to contemporary Angelyne, I was jarred back to reality.

Rossum is beautiful, and only plastic surgery can make a woman as ugly as the woman in the pictures I had just seen. I checked back and yes she was ugly. No. Freaky. In that Hollywood way. I joked to myself that Betty White would have been better in the role. But this was only the first episode and it was engaging enough for me to continue.

What then unfolded was quite incredible. I won't describe it as nobody can, besides Angelyne herself, and I compel everybody to allow her to do so. I didn't leave my prejudice at the door, so I can't expect anybody else to do that, but be prepared to drop them early.

What I will refer to is my own discovery of, what I assume is another US icon, Wally George. I couldn't help but check out if the interview was real, and by god, was it ever? All I'll say is that nobody can pretend to be shocked by the existence of Donald Trump. That tiny segment is probably the biggest vindicator of everything Angelyne is. 

By the end I loved her and can now view those pictures with a brand new perspective that allows her beauty to shine through.

The biggest tribute I can pay her is to say ""Sure she's a phoney. But she's a REAL phoney"""
Angel N Devil,I just found out about this lady last week and now I learn about this
Angel N Devil, r/Angelyne
Angel N Devil,"Emmy was awful.

Sydney sweeney is the right height,etc and a better actress."
Angel N Devil,So is Angelyne a witch?
Angel N Devil,The last episode goes into her childhood which makes it make more sense why she is that way.
Angel N Devil,maybe would be better as a film?
Angel N Devil,"They really did a good job capturing her current interviews. She‚Äôs so rude and deflects, doesn‚Äôt answer any questions and just lies about everything."
Angel N Devil,There was an emptiness to those times that hollywood filled with fake glamour. Her character is a reflection of that. There's actually a lot more to this than I expected.
Angel N Devil,Piano zamora
Angel N Devil,Wow I didn‚Äôt realize Emmy played the older Angelyne too!! Kudos to the makeup department!
Angel N Devil,I knew it was Emmy but super agree I kept thinking during older Angelyne scenes that she looks like Amanda Bynes
Angel N Devil,lmaooooo if only
Angel N Devil,And she looks amazing in it from the trailer
Angel N Devil,"Emmy produced the show, hence she played angelyne."
Angel N Devil,"Agreed. Her voice and mannerism weren‚Äôt the right casting and just because you produce something doesn‚Äôt mean you should star in it. I felt like I had to abandon halfway through the first ep. Also, I love these types of stories so I wanted to like it and Sydney would‚Äôve killed it"
Angel N Devil,"Well, that‚Äôs cool, but I kind of wish that kind of stuff was peppered in throughout. Oh well, maybe I‚Äôll pick it back up and finish one of these days."
Angel N Devil,It explains why she is the way she is. The part its missing is why anybody cares about her?  There are literally millions of attention worse out there why she is any different isn't ever addressed.
Angel N Devil,Boobs
Angel N Devil,I really enjoyed it :)
Angel N Devil,"If you‚Äôre not interested, don‚Äôt watch. Simple."
Angel N Devil,Why does anybody care about Jennifer Lawrence?
Angel N Devil,Is this like the writers strike that happened in 2007?
Hong Kong West Side Stories,Well duh. Can‚Äôt offend one of their biggest markets

Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Disney, the Nestle of television."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,South Park had a whole episode about this a couple seasons ago and they were spot on

Censorship sucks."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,Clearly profits over principles

Hong Kong West Side Stories,Disney is both completely morally bankrupt outside of the United States in a blanket search for profit and yet thinks it's the in the front lines of the culture war at home. Bizarre stuff.

Hong Kong West Side Stories,"I like how China just man handles the entertainment industry. And creatives just say, ""thank you sir may I have another?!"""
Hong Kong West Side Stories,One of the biggest reasons I‚Äôve no respect for Disney is how much they suck the CCP‚Äôs cock
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Remember when USA corporations used to uphold our values of free speech? 

Yeah, me neither."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"I mean, it's not only Disney who does this. The entirety of Hollywood slobbers all over China's knob. When was the last time you saw China as the actual bad-guy in a Hollywood movie? Their global PR presence is so good that most people never even realize it."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,Cowards
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Companies are contributing to perpetuating racism, slavery, etc by doing this censorship crap. Humor is a way to talk about an uncomfortable, sensitive issue without making a big deal about it. By eliminating comedy as a source of expression, they confine these discussions to always being negative and strained."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,And push crazy theories on the proud family
Hong Kong West Side Stories,So youre saying Disney is part of the problem because they are complicit in the forced labor of Uyghyr Muslims in China?
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Ahhh yes, Disney. The country that panders to the west, while cutting out almost all that pandering in China."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,Disney removes episodes of shows in the US as well‚Ä¶
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Years ago there was an episode set in Brazil where they satirized us. It never aired here.

It should come as no surprise that companies will avoid content that might be sensitive in a country because that would cost them money."
Hong Kong West Side Stories,Disney would happily enslave every last one of us if it would make them an extra dime.
Hong Kong West Side Stories,"Imagine the things Disney would start banning if say Evangelicals became the biggest consumers of their products.

Don't ever for a second think these companies care about you or your pet cause because they don't."

To bypass this, Selma (who is very single) has Homer act as her husband while Marge acts as Bart and Lisa‚Äôs nanny. The episode was eventually banned in China for the unflattering references to the country and currently isn‚Äôt available to stream on Disney Plus in Hong Kong, either.

Street Food,"The Peru episode better have Fried Guinea Pig on a stick! It‚Äôs a common one to see, and a popular one too.

Street Food,can't wait for the pandemic to end and start travel and eat all the amazing food again!

Street Food,"The problem with these shows is just like finding recipes online. 

90% of it is filler that you don‚Äôt care about when you just want to see the food and how it‚Äôs made. 

The big difference is these shows you can‚Äôt scroll past the bs and instead have to watch it all."
Street Food,Cool
Street Food,They're not food network cooking shows dum dum
Street Food,"I also thought this show was hammy and formulaic, but it was still a fun watch. Excited to see what Latin American street food looks like."
Street Food,ouch
Street Food,"They‚Äôve got a point though. I just finished it. It was a show about people, not about food. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting a Flavorful Origins-style doc. The title should be more representative of its narrative. Like ‚ÄúFood Stories‚Äù or ‚ÄúStreet Chefs.‚Äù"
Street Food,Ok ok ok. I can dig.
Street Food,"I've watched every other food documentary on netflix - im sure i'll watch this too!  
Theres no such thing as too many food documentaries "
Street Food,chef's table is one of my favorites. This seasons episode with Sean Brock is amazing!
Street Food,"Sounds good to me - I have far more interest in the chefs who strive to make amazing food available to the masses than the ones who put insane amounts of time into making food into edible art.  
"
Street Food,Ew
Street Food,With Trevor James?
Street Food,We should make a master list. Because I'm right there with you.
Street Food,I basically use netflix as a documentary haven. They have some great stuff. 
Street Food,"He's also great on Mind Of A Chef. I think he hosts season 3. He's first introduced in the first season with David Chang (also awesome host). 

Also, check out Ugly Delicious for some more Sean Brock in later episodes. "
Street Food,I love the fact that they are making their version of planet earth called Our Planet - with david attenborough and everything!
Street Food,"Ugly Delicious is great as well. And Salt Fat Acid Heat.  Also Cooked, as has already been mentioned. Netflix has some fantastic food shows."
Street Food,Add Jon Favreau food truck show to the list. All of these shows are food porn at its best
Street Food,Ugly delicious is also quite good. The first episode is the worst of the series so you might not want to start with that one.
Street Food,"Chefs table has a lot of great cinematography, but I wish it focused more on the food and less on how hard the chefs life has been.

I don't particularly care about how you grew up poor, but I am interested to understand and watch your process for creating and serving amazing food."
Street Food,"It also helps that Netflix is streaming those shows in 4K HDR. If you own a good TV, the food just looks awesome."
Street Food,"""Cooked"" is fantastic too. You should add that to your list of you haven't watched it yet"
Street Food,Agree! 100%
Street Food,David Gelb is behind both. He also did a pretty famous documentary called Jiro Dreams of Sushi (also on Netflix). It's great if you haven't seen it.
Street Food,"My favorites so far have been Ugly Delicious (stoked for a new season) and also Somebody Feed Phil. I actually got to use one of Phil‚Äôs suggestions, which is the first time I‚Äôve ever been to a place I only saw on a TV Show."
Street Food,Was about to upvote you for Ugly Delicious but I thought SFAH was absolute trash.
Street Food,I found the fried chicken episode the worst - very cringy and overbearing especially if you aren't American.
Street Food,"I don't like Chef's Table anymore to be honest. It used to focus on demystifying the cult of technical, Michelin star cooking with chefs as rock stars and food as a challenge. I thought it was brilliant, engaging and insightful.

But to me it only really works with that kind of restaurant and cuisine. I just don't find the more rustic food and cooks they focus on now really worth spending time dissecting, which is probably why they now pad it out with life stories when they used to shine a light almost exclusively on the food with the chef's journey being complimentary to this."
Street Food,I've seen it on there but I haven't checked it out yet. Will do for sure though.
Street Food,I have seen that one actually. It's a really good film.
Street Food,"I'm really excited for this. Love the shooting style of Chef's table, but combining that with a more human doc experience, this could be great."
Street Food,Loved the first episode
Street Food,"Schitt's Creek definitely fits into this category too

(Also, Ted Lasso, not Tom)"
Street Food,"Grown men who use the word ""wholesome"" unironically is pretty creepy for some reason, no idea why this word came back into every day vocabulary"
Street Food,Add Netflix After Life and The Kominsky Method to the list.
Street Food,Kim's Convenience is the same
Street Food,Pretty sure that's your issue...
Street Food,"Okay, see you!"
Street Food,"Yeah I'm just wondering why it came back, I thought it was reserved for grandparents complimenting their grandkid's finger paintings or Christian women putting their kids to bed at 7pm with a warm glass of milk or something. How long have you been using the word for, I'm just curious."
Street Food,"Few years. People used to use the term ""Christian values"" but these days that's a term widely associated with bigotry and a general Karen-type hatred for anyone not exactly like themselves, so... gotta say something. 

What would you use instead?"
Street Food,"I don't know, 'feel-good' or light-hearted' or something, I guess they're all synonyms but the word 'wholesome' does have those Christian-values connotation IMO"
Street Food,It's hard for me to imagine Christianity as wholesome. Their faith is based around the torture and gruesome 3 day public execution of their God and they believe everyone will be tortured for all eternity if they don't get in line. I mean... It‚Äôs *metal AF*... but I wouldn't consider it wholesome.

Street Food,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Street Food,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Street Food,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Street Food,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Street Food,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Street Food,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Street Food,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Street Food,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Street Food,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Street Food,üôÇüíï
Street Food,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Street Food,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Street Food,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Street Food,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Street Food,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Street Food,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Street Food,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Street Food,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Street Food,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Street Food,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Street Food,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Street Food,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Street Food,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Street Food,I don‚Äôt hear it
Street Food,It's more line delivery than the actual voice. They have a similar cadence to how they speak when they're acting.
Street Food,I found Shipka incredibly endearing as Sabrina and Dunham is just... grating.
Street Food,"True.  
  
By the way did you notice how Kiernan kinda looks like a female version of Jake Paul?"
Street Food,"Holy crap!!! I have been saying the exact same thing! It's been eating me. Like, I even searched to see if they were cousins or something. It's definitely the delivery, like someone mentioned, but her voice and even the way she holds her mouth remind me sooo much of Dunham! Let me also follow that by saying I LOVE Dunham! And I'm loving Shipka!   
I'm so glad someone else out there feels the same!!"
Street Food,Don't be cruel. 
Street Food,Then I am losing my mind
Street Food,Nor do I.
Street Food,Idk she kind of looks like a grown up Sally Draper to me. 
Street Food,"I can‚Äôt unsee It now, thanks"
Street Food,Thank you! It was killing me all day!
Street Food,My wife and I searched that too!
Street Food,[deleted]
Street Food,yeah man! now everytime i look at her i see Jake Paul!
Street Food,Such a good show. I started in the original Channel 4 days and have been hooked ever since.
Street Food,"Say what you want about drake, but I can‚Äôt be mad that he used his clout and money to bring this show back from the dead. I‚Äôve loved the Netflix seasons, and can‚Äôt wait to take in the final one next year"
Street Food,everything is great except the newest season was p weak. enjoyed the ending tho
Street Food,100% agree. Great show.
Street Food,"Love Top Boy. Glad it got renewed for a third and final season. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how they wrap it all up. Definitely one of the best Brit shows and probably one of Netflix‚Äôs best shows as well. 

I think the creative team really made good use of the extra cash and runtime available to them after the Netflix switch. They made an excellent show even better!"
Street Food,"I watched the first episode and thought it was mediocre.   Not even close in any way to the wire.  It‚Äôs better than a lot of crap on Netflix for sure, but I would say 6/10 at best as far as episode 1"
Street Food,"watch Summerhouse first. the show is nothing like the wire but summerhouse is a lot more gritty, realistic and generally better than the Netflix show. if you like the gang plotlines in the wire you'll enjoy it"
Street Food,You‚Äôve lost it mate. Top Boy is fantastic start to finish. Absolutely one of my favourite shows.
Street Food,I see a lot of stuff with that title.
Chambers,"The question posed by Mike, ""Do you want to work in a dark spaceship?"", is quite insightful. It makes me wonder why so many shows have such dark and dramatic lighting that it seems like the characters are living in perpetual darkness. I find myself thinking, ""Why don't they just turn on a light?"""
Chambers,"I'm glad they're happy with it.

I absolutely loved episode 4 and I really wish this was the first season.

Imagine if we had 3 seasons like this instead of 1."
Chambers,"It brings me joy to see Odo's image on Shaw's datapad, but I am saddened by the passing of Ren√© Auberjonois. His portrayal of Odo in the Star Trek franchise is considered one of the most outstanding performances in the series."
Chambers,Jonathan Frakes is the one responsible for both the acting and directing of this show.
Chambers,This show finally seems to be living up to what we wanted it to be for the first 2 seasons.
Chambers,"Well, compared to seasons 1 and 2 I‚Äôm happy we finally get some decent trek. Yes there are faults, but there‚Äôs some greatness too. I like it this far."
Chambers, Mike‚Äôs tone immediately set me on edge for what I was about to experience in this video
Chambers,"With all the praise this season gets, I'm inclined to give it a shot. Do you need any knowledge from the later half of S1 or S2 to enjoy this season?      
(I roughly know the plot of S1 but have no clue what happened in S2.)"
Chambers,"What a fucking shame that this is how it ends....

Season 1 and 2.....Jesus Christ I wish I could delete that out of my brain."
Chambers,"Nervous that like these hack frauds said, episode 4 was pretty much the end of a movie. A good movie. But next we've got Lore and Moriarty and who knows what else. Glad we got these 4 great episodes, but I'm bracing myself"
Chambers,I am liking Todd Stashwick as Captain Shaw but it's a damn shame they basically copied Sisko's backstory for him
Chambers,Why haven't they released a re:View for SNW?
Chambers,conspicuously missing from ~~/r/star_trek~~ /r/startrek
Chambers,I'm surprised they like it as much as they do. I get major The Force Awakens vibes from it so far. It's fine but very pandering.
Chambers,I'm glad they mentioned the look of ships. It just doesn't look like Star Trek at all but some generic sci-fi. It's like their all ships are in power saving mode. It bugs me to a point where I just can't watch it.
Chambers,"Does anyone else get just a little sick of hearing that **BWAOW** sound effect every time the Shrike appears on screen?

I feel like I have heard that sound 10 times in 4 episodes"
Chambers,"These guys can get fucked.  If you like the show, then you dont need a chorus of dittoheads echoing their shitty opinions on what Trek should be."
Chambers,This show is just so bad. Watching it makes me feel embarrassed for Patrick Stewart.
Chambers,It was fun watching them talk about Nightmare on Elm Street but watching Mike talk Star Wars has the sad tone of a parent telling their kids that they're getting a divorce.
Chambers,"I've been thinking about that for a while. At first I thought it's to simulate submarines but then you go to videos like [Smarter every Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXXMJAU6vY8)'s videos on a nuclear submarine and the place is decently lit for most rooms. Because why wouldn't it be? Imagine being impaired in what you can see when you have to push buttons on a submarine, where any mistake can end every life on the submarine."
Chambers,Dark spaceship with high platforms and no railings.
Chambers,I still question why these ships have no seat belts.
Chambers,"RLM said in the video that it could be because the lighting in full while making sense also looks cheap. I kinda guess it does, but TNG etc. makes it look so fun and comfortable place. This is just like a mirror universe where they don't even have enough energy for lights."
Chambers,"I figure the light is how the audience sees it, not them. Plus, Picard is filmed like a movie and the movies were always darker."
Chambers,"I don't know why Mike doesn't mention The Orville more often. It is exactly the type of show he wants New Trek to be, lighting included."
Chambers,"Hold up, these guys are actually on-board with this one? The guys that finished the last season looking like they just got back from World War I? The guys so shaken by what they'd seen this franchise churn out that they almost wrote off Strange New Worlds entirely? (or maybe they did write it off entirely, I haven't really been paying attention.) The only people on the planet that hated the last two years of this show more than I did? They're giving it a positive review?

...Shit man, that's all I needed to hear. I might have to actually watch this season.

That's the review you put on the fucking *poster*. ""The guys from Red Letter Media actually kinda like it."""
Chambers,"This is practically a reboot, and I'm completely fine with that. A few light references to events from S1, but that's pretty much it. It must be tradition to hold off on actually getting good until the third season for anything pertaining to TNG.

This is unexpectedly great. I'll agree with 'cautiously optimistic' because the second season did drive off a very steep cliff after the first two promising episodes. But the writing, directing, and overall tone here is so much more cohesive. It feels right, even if it's a jarring departure from the first two seasons. I'll take it."
Chambers,"Episode 4 was the best episode of any Nu Trek, in my opinion. It was a return to form. The ending was classic Trek all the way. As someone who has really struggled with the new stuff, this was really awesome."
Chambers,Maybe they need to make MORE seasons!
Chambers,"Completely agree, the scenes with him and Armin Shimerman are some of the absolute best Star Trek ever produced.   
Ascent, which is basically just them two for an entire episode, is an amazing episode.   
Perfect example of frenemies."
Chambers,And amazing for his age.
Chambers,You can completely skip s1 and 2. Matalas has said you can watch s3 without those junk seasons. Worst case you'll miss the meaning of a quick line or two but that's w/e
Chambers,"Season1 was fine, had a few cringey moments (dressing up as a pimp, borg cube being poorly utilized, Brent Spiner playing yet another Soong, Romulans with Irish accents living in France, holographic interfaces, etc) but I enjoyed it.  

Season2 was just dumb.  First Contact meets Voyagers Futures End, with Momma Drama that didnt need to be told.  Plus an ending where they just phoned it in instead of making it 10-15 minutes longer."
Chambers,I feel like fans watching will be bracing themselves until the last second of the season finale
Chambers,"Mike mentioned it in passing, he really wasn't into it."
Chambers,"uhh that community was banned. you're thinking of the one without the _.

You know, the subreddit that seems to be run by Paramount and suppresses anything negative said about new trek, but allows you to be negative about old trek?

I wonder if when Reddit goes public if suddenly these kinds of arrangements will have to be disclosed so we can get the truth of it"
Chambers,I think they've just had their expectations adjusted enough to be positive whenever it beats those expectations.  The bar has never been lower for star trek.
Chambers,Mike loved TFA though
Chambers,"Yeah, it feels like this season has a lot more fan service compared to previous seasons. It also feels like it uses a lot of elements and tropes from most of the previous Trek films, TOS ones included. The end product of this first four episode arc did become surprisingly enjoyable, but all the callbacks and homages reminded me of the Lower Decks episode that tried to parody all the Trek films."
Chambers,"They've been mostly positive on this season... Looking at season 2 can you blame them for being skeptical? I don't rely on Mike and Rich for their opinion, I rarely watch half in the bag because yeah they bag on most of what they end up watching. I watch best of the worst and enjoy their re:views because they mostly review stuff they like."
Chambers,Agree. I don‚Äôt get the obsession with these guys. They aren‚Äôt even good reviewers
Chambers,"Why would you watch a show you don‚Äôt like, let alone spend time discussing it on social media?  Weird."
Chambers,Health and safety nightmare!
Chambers,And flamethrowers mounted to the walls.
Chambers,Ever since Trek 2009 I've lamented current star trek production design. Lets have a brewery be the enterprise engineering section. What we could lose gravity and never be able to get anywhere in there? Eh who cares cheap location....
Chambers,i think Generations was darker in order to make the sets look OK on the big screen.
Chambers,"And to think, all it took was a showrunner who... watched and cared about Star Trek. Who'd have thunk?"
Chambers,Idk about Rich but Mike hates the dialogue in SNW. He can‚Äôt get past Starfleet officers not speaking the way they did in the 60s and 80s-90s.
Chambers,"The first two seasons were watchable TV, as someone who only casually grew up on VOY and TNG reruns. It was ‚Äúif you squint hard enough you can get that nostalgia hit‚Äù TV.

But god damn if these last four episodes don‚Äôt highlight just how awful the first two seasons were."
Chambers,"i thought lower decks was solid from the start, and it did reference tng plenty"
Chambers,"I'm actually really enjoying it, I hated season 1 except for first episode. I completely ignored season 2, are there any episodes in season 2 that are standouts/worth seeing without watching entire season"
Chambers,"I loved this episode, but I‚Äôve seen this ‚Äúreturn to form‚Äù comment on the structure of the episode with reference to reconciliation and teamwork against an unimaginable force and terrible odds posted in a few different ways, without any reference to the Discovery season 4 season end.

spoilers:

>!I‚Äôve yet to see any parallels drawn between this story and the conclusion of the 10-C arc. The Discovery crew put aside their problems and came together in a similar crew-based hackathon in the last episodes and had this wide-eyed moment of wonder at the extraordinary expression of life in the 10-C - after they reaffirmed federation values and interpersonal trust!<

Picard has been phenomenal, but to say this is the first time this classic Trek structure has been explored in the modern era just isn‚Äôt true. 

They‚Äôre both different stories with different stakes and execution that hit differently, but the parallels are clear."
Chambers,"Cheers, gonna give it a try then."
Chambers,"> Brent Spiner playing yet another Soong

My headcanon post-S2 is now that the entire Soong family is actually a series of clones. Megalomaniacal scientists not wanting to let their genius die and all that."
Chambers,"And then, in the last second.

""Computer, Arch"" and Admiral Lorca leaves the holodeck, two armed security guards in Mirror Section 31 uniforms are outside."
Chambers,"That's incredibly surprising, I thought it was fantastic"
Chambers,"I‚Äôm actually banned from that subreddit. 

That was after regularly contributing for *ten years.* I won a Hulu contest on that subreddit. I had a comment explaining the ‚ÄúRiker Lean‚Äù get confirmed by Wil Wheaton, leading it to show up at the top of Google results for quite some time. 

I‚Äôm not saying that to brag, because it‚Äôs quite silly in the scheme of things ‚Äî but just to get across the fact that I was in there posting and commenting every single day. 

Then, boom. Banned. Tried talking with the mods, got an incredibly rude and condescending response. 

And lest anyone think it was due to political leanings, the other two subreddits I‚Äôm banned from are r/Conservative and r/ProtectAndServe."
Chambers,/r/DaystromInstitute/ is the fan-maintained Star Trek subreddit iirc
Chambers,yes my mistake.
Chambers,"> You know, the subreddit that seems to be run by Paramount and suppresses anything negative said about new trek

Or, you know, is just run by fans who actually enjoy the franchise and don't want to hear the constant drumbeat of people shitting on every single new show? The way that some in the fandom have done going all the way back to The Next Generation itself?"
Chambers,">reminded me of the Lower Decks episode

I see this as an absolute win!"
Chambers,"Sure, half of their review of S3E1 was them reminding everyone how much they hated S1 & S2.  The review itself is 2 minutes longer than the actual episode, which should be red flags for most people."
Chambers,What sort of stuff do they like?
Chambers,"I think Orville is a horrible show, but I watched all the episodes because I don't want to be one of these assholes who claim the show sucks, having only watched one or two episodes.  

So many people will shit on New Trek, yet cite vague details that could be applied to a number of different shows.  It makes you wonder if they even bothered to watch the show they claim is horrible."
Chambers,"Let's be fair, star trek 2009 lighting is so bright, especially the bridge. I almost had to wear sunglasses to watch it."
Chambers,I bet they pushed Stewart out of the writers room too.
Chambers,the same show runner also was in charge of season two. Seasons 2 and 3 were filmed back to back.
Chambers,"> He can‚Äôt get past Starfleet officers not speaking the way they did in the 60s and 80s-90s.

Thus, sadly, summarizing a large portion of the ""fandom."" If it's not exactly the same thing they've always seen before, it sucks."
Chambers,"The first couple episodes of season 2 might be worth your curiosity. They had a level of production that was reminiscent of the TNG films and this first arc of season 3 episodes, and they set up some interesting ideas. However, the rest of the season fell apart after they time-traveled and fumbled around in Los Angeles for nearly the rest of the season. The story dragged after it split into way too many side plots to juggle at once, which made the episodes a chore to get through. In the end, all those interesting ideas and potential from the first episodes were squandered by very unsatisfying conclusions to them."
Chambers,"Too little too late with Discovery, Im afraid"
Chambers,you should still read the summaries for those seasons on Wikipedia or memory alpha. There are a couple things that are important -- like the fact that Picard is actually an android now.
Chambers,"Ah, the ol Rusty Venture"
Chambers,He felt it was too quipy to be good and admitted it's his problem. Rich seemed more on board.
Chambers,"pretty good in my opinion, except the fantasy kingdom episode (the acting was terrible in this .. like abysmal) and the one with Jesse as the hammy overacting pirate."
Chambers,"i got banned from there because i said i was unhappy they retconned Spock to have a learning disability. I got a ""BE NICE"" message from the mods with my banning.

Now you go on any new episode of anything on that sub and its like  'THIS IS TEH BEST STAR TREK EPISODE EVER"" and that's all the comments. and a bunch of (deleted)s from people you'll never see again."
Chambers,"I got a lifetime ban because I said something like ""Picard Season 2 was written badly"". Hah. I'm still right."
Chambers,Yep that sub is heavily censored. Wish their was an alternative
Chambers,"I thought that one was actually about star trek lore, theories, science and explaining the events of the shows."
Chambers,praise the echo chamber
Chambers,"There were two on season 2, Goldsman was there too and supposedly did most of it from the third episode on."
Chambers,"Everything else about season 2 aside, I liked that last exchange between Q and Picard."
Chambers,"> like the fact that Picard is actually an android now.

Even that hasn't been important at all so far, other than providing context for a throwaway line or two that would otherwise be rather baffling. Not sure if it will mean something in later episodes, though."
Chambers,"> like the fact that Picard is actually an android now.

Not an android, exactly. They transferred his consciousness into a manufactured body because his brain abnormality was killing him. But he's still human, still mortal, and exactly how ""synthetic"" any of him is, including his brain, is an unanswered question."
Chambers,"I don't know if I am banned, but all my posts were suddenly deleted for ""untruthfulness"" after I referred to the Bajoran Maquis as terrorists :D"
Chambers,"yes it takes a methodical and yet religious approach to canon. Unfortunately the new shows have polluted the canon because random characters will say shit like ""oh yeah the mirror universe people are assholes because their subatomic particles are evil"" and it goes in memory alpha."
Chambers,"Yeah, fuck all those people who (checks notes) actually enjoy what they're watching!"
Chambers,"you're right, I had actually forgotten that Akiva Goldsman was very involved with writing S2.  His name is conspicuously absent from any writing/directing credits for S3, thankfully."
Chambers,A lot of the plot points from season 2 were from the current season 3 show runner
Chambers,"there was some speculation about Vadic's (and her boss's) motivation for capturing Jack Crusher and that they really wanted some of that sweet sweet Picard DNA... to which one might ask, why not just grab Picard?  He's right there!  But he doesn't have any DNA anymore because he's an android.

Who knows if that is anything close to the truth but that is something that was discussed."
Chambers,"Don't they call him positronic?  In ST terms that means android.  My memory is vague though, never rewatched Picard season one.  When Soong makes the body, it's hard not to assume, admittedly."
Chambers,"> after I referred to the Bajoran Maquis as terrorists :D

Considering that the Bajorans and the Maquis are two completely different groups..."
Chambers,Fuck people who want to silence and banish those who don't.
Chambers,"I think Shaw called him that derisively, but you have to wonder how much would Shaw know for certain."
Chambers,"I only say that to differentiate them from the actual Maquis

Obviously many Maquis members were other species, even a lot of humans."
Chambers,"Yeah, everyone should have to listen to people brigading their discussions, shitting on everything that they enjoy, and making it impossible to actually discuss the show at hand!"
Chambers,"I think Jurati might have called him that in the first episode of Season 2, when Picard is on the bridge of Rios' ship."
Chambers,"Fuck discussion and criticism, circle jerks only forever!"
Chambers,"Gotta love people who can't distinguish between reasonable criticism and ""I HATE THIS AND I INTEND TO MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE ENJOYS IT EVERR!!!""

Here's a free hint: if you don't like a TV show, don't watch it. There's SO MUCH television available these days that there's really no reason to try and sit through anything you don't enjoy. And there's even less reason to shit on other people because they enjoy something you don't."
Chambers,"> Gotta love people who can't distinguish between reasonable criticism and ""I HATE THIS AND I INTEND TO MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE ENJOYS IT EVERR!!!""

aka the mods there"
Chambers,"Gotta love you making straw mans

someone pointing the flaws out are not shitting on it."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Good, one step closer to this dreadful era being blissfully over.  I turned off the last special halfway through and just decided there and then not to watch this shitshow again until Chibnall and his grubby handprints are gone from Doctor Who."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Not expecting anything good from the shitshow this became.

I used to love Doctor Who. Still pissed."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I‚Äôve been desperate for the Sea Devils to return and I am so sad it is happening under this dreadful showrunner
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Has Chibnall or anyone ever acknowledged the reception to his run of the show? I haven't watched any of his run and now I don't really want too. Is him being replaced a sort of acknowledgement that it's been a shit show?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Is Chris Chibnall still show runner for this, or is this going to be a much needed Doctor Who episode?"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I am not looking forward to this at all.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,who is the current Doctah?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,This has been known for a while
The Legend of the Blue Sea,[deleted]
The Legend of the Blue Sea,[deleted]
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Funny thing is I thought that special was the best episode all season.

The others were borderline offensive."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I'm rewatching the show at the minute, currently at the start of S3. It's been so emotional and nostalgic seeing the likes of Rose, Sarah Jane, Donna, K9 etc. 

I stopped watching in 2015, think it was Capaldi's seconds season? The show just went off the rails and lost all momentum. Never got back into it and after all I heard of the Chibnall era I thought it best to leave it. 

But with the next era soon to start I thought I may as well catch up on it. I'm hoping with no expectations that the last few seasons are better than they're made out to be."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,">Is him being replaced a sort of acknowledgement that it's been a shit show?

Probably not, Chris Chibnall only did 3 seasons of Broadchurch as well, and that was a huge hit, ratings and critical wise."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"This will be a Chibnall, but thankfully he only has two episodes left. This one, and the Jodie regeneration ep in autumn. Then he hands the reigns back to Russell T Davies whose first episode will be the 60th anniversary"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Same I've never liked you! :p
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Maybe there have been leaks but this is the first official announcement.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Assumed rather than known
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I would advise jumping into the RTD 2.0 era *without* watching a recap actually. There's shit in the last two seasons that massively rewrites established lore. You're better off not knowing as RTD will probably ignore it.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"You probably don't even need to do that, most of the time when the showrunner leaves, the next series is pretty much a completely clean sweep"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"No one will be able to properly explain what‚Äôs happened the last two seasons.

The entire thing makes no fucking sense at all.

You‚Äôre better off going in blind and pretend the Chibnail era never happened."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I stopped when Jack came back‚Ä¶ and wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know, I just know that RTD isn‚Äôt touching Jack (or Mickey for that matter) when he comes back, if he was ever thinking of bringing them back, at all.

I feel for Jodie, she got the short end of the stick, and hopefully Big Finish really lets her shine, ‚Äòcause‚Ä¶ this is just sad.

Doctor Who has it ups and downs, but never this bad."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"When his first season was airing I was dating a guy and every week we used to watch the show together because we had initially bonded over loving Doctor Who. When he dumped me to date a girl he met at a party (but told me instead that ""it's not you it's me, I need to grow emotionally before I can be in a place to be in a relationship""), I was so relieved that I didn't have to watch anymore because it was SHIT."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Capaldi's final season, at least some of the episodes, are some of the best Who has. I recommend getting through it. His arc is pretty good and each season kinda works on how he's evolving."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Nah man they're really awful. I watched pretty religiously since New Who came out, and couldn't make it past Jodie's first season. She's a great actress but her supporting crew is pretty medicore and the stories are just bad, not to mention internally inconsistent. If you thought Capaldi dealing with a T-rex under the Thames or whatever was bad, hoo boy. Wait till you meet Benni."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I watched ten minutes of first episode of capaldi's second season

realise I didn't care
and then never bothered to catch up"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"So, basically, I‚Äôm just not going to expect any Dr Who until maybe late next year, if not longer."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"How many living Doctors and companions can you squeeze into a TARDIS without turning its outside into a clown car?

Edit: I wasn't sarcastic. I'd pay to see it."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Do we know who the new doctor is yet
The Legend of the Blue Sea,[You just made an enemy for life.](https://youtu.be/NwhTqTiOkG8)
The Legend of the Blue Sea,This hurts. There was so much in the latest season that could‚Äôve been great and ended up in shit. Got me hooked then kicked me in the two front teeth
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I think the part where it got booted off the air for sixteen years as a result of JNT's mismanagement is (to use an overused but accurate in this case term) objectively worse.

Like we can fuss about how much we like the quality of the show or the implication of the BBC breaking with 43 years of constantly moving forward by rehiring an old showrunner, but considering Doctor Who has more series ordered after Chibnall, I don't think he's damaged it THAT bad."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"> Doctor Who has it ups and downs, but never this bad.

Hahaha

Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.

Ahahahahahaha

You're a man with a short memory. Go watch the movie and about a dozen nonsensical unwatchable classic stories."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,[deleted]
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Totally. I think people have rose tinted glasses for the early season and severely underrate Capaldi's last two seasons.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I need to go back through it. I watched capdis first season and then completely stopped save for a few here and there during his second, but I just lost track. I watched jodie‚Äôs first season and thought it was ok, but bailed early on in the second and have just completely lost interest ever since"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Nah, I thought Sasha Dhawan killed it as The Master."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,If Capaldi dealing with T-rex under the Thames was bad then Doctor Who was always bad? Remember the fart jokes aliens in like the first season of the revamp?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Not to mention blaming all of those things on their ‚Äúsexist‚Äù fan base.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yeah, they really need to fix the spacing issues Chinball has created. Too long between content."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yeah pretty much, the 60th (which as far as we know is RTD's comeback episode) is in November 2023. :)"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I think you're fine until you get Colin in there.  Considering he's the only one who ever fixed the Chameleon Circuit (however briefly), there's a chance he might do it again."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I've seen the movie, plus all of Classic Who that isn't missing. It has never been this bad."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,How much of Peter Capaldi's run have you seen?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I dunno; I got a creepy vibe when he made her kneel before him in a submissive way, like he was expecting a blowjob or something.  His whole attitude in many later appearances seemed like he wasn't so much facing his old adversary but kinda rapey.  The whole dynamic was creepy.  But that may just be me."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Maybe it's just the balance has shifted then. There's less Waters of Mars or Don't Blink quality episodes and more and more things that are poorly acted or written, without much payoff. I did like the Demons of Punjab episode which was probably the only one I'd call good from that season. I didn't even watch the latest season so maybe it got better. It probably doesn't help that I didn't really like the companions either, although I generally liked Graham since he was the only one who really had contrast to what the doctor was."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yeah, they've never done that"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Source?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Oh it definitely has. You just have better perspective on the older things thanks to time. This take is the equivalent of ""SNL used to be funny"" in a way. Everyone wouldn't shut up about how bad Capaldi's seasons were while airing and now people like them. Same cycle as always. This apocalyptic worst thing ever stuff is just regurgitated memes in a bubble."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,[deleted]
The Legend of the Blue Sea,">  The whole dynamic was creepy. But that may just be me.

I think it was just you, but I was neither a rape perpetrator or victim.  Its totally the Master's personality to be an unhinged narcissist/megalomaniac, so making the Doctor kneel would certainly be consistent with his personality."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Am not sure balanced shifted (talking 'bout Capaldi era here), Deep Breath feels fairly grounded despite ""giant t-rex"", kinda like Rose still has plastic Mickey. Listen (the 4th episode of Capaldi's run) feels more mature than Waters of Mars and Blink, Dark Water (the finale of Capaldi's first series) got complaints because it was too morbid (a bit reminiscent of Classic Who's most popular run) but it's not far away from the finale of s1 either. While you also have Mummy on the Orient Express and Flatline which are clever and more relaxing stories. Excluding few episodes, series 8 is ""Who on point"". Regarding the new series, there are some good stuff. Demons is good, but I still feel like it suffers from some editing problems and underwritten main characters. Moffat era had some of the strongest editing and directing in Who, you can really feel the downgrade after series 10 because the production crew was shook up. More inexperienced directors, editors, script editors and it shows."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"That's good to hear. At least you have seen it. I have found in the past that a lot of people complaining about his run didn't bother watching past series 8. I really liked series 9 and 10 overall and find them to be very underrated (as far as reception on Reddit is concerned).

IMO, the most consistent series in the New Who was Series 5. I have found most other series to be quite hit or miss episodically, in true Dr. who fashion."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yeah, he got to shine once they finally got rid of Clara."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Honestly, I hated when it went from focus on The Doctor to being The Clara Show, but looking back from what we have now, that stuff is far more watchable.  And I did like quite a few Clara moments.  But man, the writing made her overreach herself and  it became annoying to me.  But yeah, that ending with her and Maisie Williams flying about in a Diner TARDIS...wtf?"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"If there is one thing Doctor Who is good at, it is looking good. But hopefully these last few specials will give Jody a worthy exit, because her run has been mostly bad with only a few good episodes, and none of it was her fault. This trailer looks fun, but we'll see. Most of the stories by Chibnall seem to have a interesting premise, but they never manage to follow through."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,">""Thats impossible""


Evidently not, I do hate when the Dr says that by now they should know better"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I want to like this. I love me some swashbuckling and Chinese pirates sound like a cool setting. And I keep hoping that the show will win me back and deliver on what I thought the 13th Doctor‚Äôs run could be. 

But‚Ä¶ this trailer just doesn‚Äôt look promising to me. It doesn‚Äôt convince me there‚Äôs a cool adventure to be had. It doesn‚Äôt even hint that the characters will be more compelling or at least more fun than they‚Äôve been so far. I know it‚Äôs just a trailer, but if this is the best they can put together to sell the episode, I‚Äôm not optimistic."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Well I love pirates but I haven't seen Doctor Who since Jodie's first season. Have the companions gotten any better or are they still dull and forgettable?
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Looking forward to her regeneration.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Looks fun enough. Honestly though, I've got a whole season and some to get through first to catch up, and it's mainly on the hopes of starting with a new Doctor (and more importantly, new writers).

Always has to be said it wasn't Jodie's fault, but that first season was baaaad."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I‚Äôm doing a rewatch and I‚Äôm still not at her episode just yet
The Legend of the Blue Sea,is she still the doctor? jesuschrist.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I still feel the need to talk to a therapist about the episode where the moon is an egg. I know a lot of things make little sense in this show, but that episode was torture."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"The production design has come leaps and bounds since Jodie joined. The writing, not so much."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I'm a huge classic fan, I quit her run at the second series. The only Doctors I've enjoyed in the modern run has been Eccleston and Capaldi and John Hurt was good too. Not a fan of Smith, Tennant or Whittaker at all."

""How impossible!?""

""Two Minutes!"""
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yaz is still Yaz, underutilised, no depth, around to ask questions. 

Dan is genuinely funny though, a fish out of water type who just goes along with whatever he's presented with."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Its rough...She is a LOT better but a lot is lacking. It stinks cause I think the argument can be made that she would be a good doctor is the writing is better.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Only 2 episodes left of her
The Legend of the Blue Sea,But it's okay because the thing inside the egg immediately laid another egg exactly the same size and now that one is the moon. All wrapped up nice.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Now that is an outside the mainstream take, I respect it"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Literally the only Doctor Who I have ever watched was Eccleston's season and loved it. Couldn't get into it with Tennant and gave up like 2 episodes in. I've seen bits and pieces here but whenever I think about trying out the other doctors I just remember how good Eccleston's season was and get bummed lol. I did like BBC Class a lot though and I think everyone else hated that.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"I mostly mean the days from Matt Smith and on. The show started to become a lot more cinematic around that time, even more so during the Capaldi days. No more weird farting aliens in very obvious suits. I agree that the first few series of the reboot are a lot worse, they looked even worse then some CW shows."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"erm, historical characters have always been side characters in Dr Who, show is about him/her, not them"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,">Seriously, who signed off on that Rosa Parks episode? One of the bravest women in all of time and space reduced to a side character in Dr Who.

Unless she becomes a companion, this was always going to happen. The episode is called ""Rosa""."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Hmm might watch it for Dan then
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"He was the highlight of the last series, Flux, for sure."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Anime Watchers: What gap??
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Absolutely love this show, it‚Äôs just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Undone was the shit
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It‚Äôs ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be ‚Äúadult‚Äù with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Easily one of the best animated shows I‚Äôve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It‚Äôs amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Huge gap??
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
The Legend of the Blue Sea,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
The Legend of the Blue Sea,"It is‚Ä¶ okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn‚Äôt call it bad, but I really can‚Äôt suggest it to anyone who isn‚Äôt a fan of the stream."
The Legend of the Blue Sea,This show is so amazing

The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"The Fast and Furious movies had a release a few years back with the first 6 movies broken up into 18 chapters that played like TV episodes.  Actually really works to watch those movies in a binge format like that.  They called it  [""The Fast and Furious Saga""](https://www.fandangonow.com/details/season/the-fast-and-furious-saga-season-1-2015/MSE91373BE6723BB03117C39253810E16B4C)"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Das Boot. 

Kieslowski's Decalog had two episodes re-cut into two features."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"It is fairly common in Portugal, actually. Movies will sometimes be recut (and we're talking actual recuts here: there's often new scenes compared to the movie version, but other may not be present) for TV. Some of the movies I remember getting this treatment were Manuel de Oliveira's *Amor de Perdi√ß√£o,* Ra√∫l Ruiz's *Mist√©rios de Lisboa* (Mysteries of Lisbon: this one has an whole subplot that only appears in the TV version, if I'm not mistaken) and Jo√£o Canijo's *Sangue do meu Sangue* (Blood of my Blood) and *F√°tima* (Fatima)."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Ballad of Buster Scruggs did the opposite. It was supposed to be an anthology show and they cut it into a movie to try and squeeze some awards out of it.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"The Godfather movies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Saga"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,There was a Cruel Intentions movie that did the exact opposite and went from TV to a movie cut.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"This happens in Poland. The original Polish Witcher series was shown in the cinemas as a movie (very disjointed) and then in TV as a much better TV series. The same is true for our historical movies, such as ""With Fire and Sword"" or ""The Deluge""."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Twin Peaks Season 3 is essentially an 18 hour mindfuck movie
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Fanny and Alexander I think as well.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,That rumor was actually quashed by the Coen brothers. It was always a movie.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Just as a reminder to anyone interested in this, it's not much new content, just a few extra scenes (like 2 or 3) that were in the roadshow version, much of the ""extended"" content is just the credits for each portion"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I've looked but can't seem to find the below confirmed:

&#x200B;

Is there any new footage (besides credits) than **wasn't** in the roadshow version already? If so, what it is and how long?"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Not one of his best, but enjoyable nonetheless and I will check this out."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Did Quentin Tarantino approve this? He's been quite critical of Netflix in the past.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Wow I thought we were going to get Django Unchained: The MiniSeries since he stated before he intended to release that. 

I didn‚Äôt know this had more content. Will gladly watch. 

But I really want that Django extension as it‚Äôs a far more enjoyable movie IMHO."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I felt like it lasted a fucking lifetime as it was, as much as I love a lot of his work he can't half drag a story out. 3hrs 20? Even Kurt Russell's moustache couldn't keep me compelled for that long."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Hmm...I'm a huge fan of his work but I can't see any reason to extend this.  It's just an OK movie.  Loved the visuals and set and all that but the story was, IMO, weak compared to his other efforts."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Haven't seen the movie yet, it's on a long list of things to watch, but I can definately watch an episode a night for like 4 days. Sold!"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,It was too long to begin with.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,This movie is already so bloated. Should have just been 90-120 minutes
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Will the new footage explain why [Spoiler](#s "" Warren doesn't seem to know about the cellar despite knowing every other possible detail about Minnie's haberdashery? "") The movie had me on board until this stupefying moment."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Wasn‚Äôt there also talk of releasing an Django Unchained miniseries like this? I remember QT being stating he‚Äôd like to see an extended version released around the time DU was in theaters.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Does anyone have a timestamp for the new footage?
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I won't watch this, but the hateful eight was a fantastic movie. That ending was perfect."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"""extended"". i couldnt even stay awake for the absurdly long released version."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Just give me that Inglorious Basterds miniseries instead
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,HARD pass.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,[deleted]
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,A movie that was 2 hours too long turned into an even longer mini series...
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,How gory was H8 in theaters?
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"The movie's dialogue was so drawn out it bored the fuck out of me, so naturally why not extend it to a miniseries."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"So don't know how to feel, this movie was a hit when it came out a few years ago and I went to see it. For me personally it was a huge disappointment as it was mostly all talking (kinda expected TBF) but not for that long, and then everyone dies because the guy who you suspect right from the start turns out to be the guy who poisoned the funniest guy in the room. Then they take an extra hour just to decide what to do! I for one won't be adding it to my Netflix especially if it's just 45 minutes of extra credits!"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"This is a movie that I am pretty sure I will love as a miniseries. I mean, the movie itself was great, but sometimes I have a hard time sitting and paying attention to deep meaning movies, unless I'm high. I am also the kinda guy who can watch a movie for the first time and just shut it off like 30 mins in and come back to it later when I want to watch more. My wife hates it, so now this will be a nice middle man lol."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I wasn't a big fan of the film.  I found it good, but not what a Tarantino film is to me.  But I do want to see the scene again where the priceless guitar is destroyed and the reactions."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Glad to see Netflix is doing their best to support Harvey Weinstein's legal fees. Fighting the good fight per usual!
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"ugh, why?  what a shitty movie."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,This says 45 minutes of new content. But I was at the roadshow and there was nowhere near that much removed content (and pretty much nothing of importance). So they must be some freaking long credits.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,This movie was dog mess.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,if tarantino directed it even credits can be good
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,No.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Unpopular opinion, but I think this is the least watchable of all his films."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I mean I‚Äôve watched pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, Django, inglorious basterds, both kill bills and hateful 8, all on netflix so he can‚Äôt hate it that much."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,He‚Äôs actually flirted with the idea of doing a miniseries before though so it might be part of that.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"He has, but he's also mentioned that he'd be open to making a miniseries or two after he finishes his ten movies, so this might be his way of testing the waters for something like that"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I have a feeling we won't see his stuff on Disney + anytime soon...
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,A Django miniseries would be nice. He could add back in the back story of Scottie and Broomhilda he had to cut. I was bummed when that section was scrapped from the final version.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Hateful 8 to me is a masterpiece, Django is average at best"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Right? The original already feels like an extended cut. Why draw it out even more?
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I really liked it more than the theatrical version.  A lot of new dialogue that gives more background to the characters.  It's more details.  It felt much more like a play than the theatrical release.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,It's just Tarantino being Tarantino. He has so much material that he wasn't able to put in the theatrical cut so he wants to put it and get it out of his system.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"It was a good movie, maybe suffered by not as good editing as his previous movies"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"""I was promised Once upon a Time in the West"" and I got ""Agatha Christie in a Locked Door murder mystery.""

&#x200B;

Once they hit the cabin, the movie really loses a lot of that ""PANORAMA!!!"" love letter feel."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I love QT. Dogs will always be in my top 3. Hateful 8 is my least favorite QT film.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"if you aren't already aware, it is worth noting that the script for *Hateful Eight* leaked before filming began and Tarantino almost scrapped the production before making changes to the story"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Agreed. Weak is a good way to describe it.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Tarantino hasn't made a good film since Inglourious Basterds. I was really hopeful for OUATIH but the trailer doesn't look very interesting. I could be wrong though, it really didn't show us a lot."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"If Hateful Eight was Tarantino's first movie, I wouldn't consider him a director to pay attention to. His worst movie by far."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I'm all about letting scene's ""breathe"", but the dialogue in this movie is so stilted and paced that it's difficult for me to maintain my attention. The feature cut is easily 60 minutes too long.

Hey Netflix, instead of the Tarantino marathon, let's get the Aaron Sorkin supercut."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I mean, it's not out of question that he could have just not expected someone to be hiding down there for three days."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I've seen a video on a extra or something asking him about that. He said something like he doesn't have a director's cut because he did it right the first time. Hateful Eight he wanted to do something special that old movies like Ben Hur did. It was shot in 70mm it had a overature and a intermission and they passed out programs to the audience if you went to the theatres that were retrofitted with 70mm projectors.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I‚Äôve never been so conflicted by amazing set design and scenery and actors and the pace made it just unwatchable and I love 2001 (slow pace)

The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Its credits
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,This comment was dog mess.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I'm still going to go with Death Proof on that one.

Even if he uses a loophole so he can pretend it's not really one of his feature films.

And I actually also kind of enjoy that one."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"The pacing was so weird. It was unpleasant to watch despite the all star cast. I love westerns, Tarantino, and nearly every actor in the movie. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was wanting it to be over 30 mins into it."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I agree. I did not like it at all.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,The flashback to what happen at the haberdashery was a better film.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,[removed]
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,At this point I don't think he has much of a say about his old movies being on a streaming service.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Ya don‚Äôt say.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I wanna know more about the woman in the mask.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Django is quite a bit better than average but I do like Hateful Eight more.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,[deleted]
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,To me Hateful Eight was a bore in the first half
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Hmm...ok thanks.  Maybe I will check it out.    
I do like QT's movies so this was somewhat of an anomaly to me."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I totally agree. The theatrical cut did not do justice to the roadshow version. People are saying it‚Äôs *just more lines of dialogue* as if every line of dialogue in QT script isn‚Äôt important and necessary to character and world building. The extra lines make the film better!!
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Good point.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Yep I was aware of that.  However, I have a hard time believing this was responsible for a ""less than stellar"" movie from him.  OR perhaps it just didn't work for me but others love it."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Django Unchained was great imo
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I disagree - I thought Django Unchained was outstanding.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I don't know, I've heard some pretty awful stuff about Death Proof but I've never seen it."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"To me it is.  He is clearly very suspicious about the people in the haberdashery and  the missing whereabouts of Minnie and co.  Yet, he never thinks to look in the cellar.

I mean, even if he didn't know there was a cellar, he would at least assume there could be a cellar and maybe it would be a good idea to check it out.  But, Tarantino makes it very clear he knows this place very well.  An out of place candy on the floor catches his eye and sends up red flags.  Why wouldn't he see if Minnie is down there, dead or alive.  His level  of suspicion does not match his absence of curiosity.  I was going along with the movie until this cheap shot of a twist."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,I went to one of the 70mm showings and considered leaving at the intermission. I wish I had.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,GDAY MATE
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"My god, could you even imagine?"
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"please tell me Netflix isn't advertising credits as ""content"""
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,An it's only in the US ( Or just not in Canada at least )
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Is there a source for that?
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Death Proof is weird. The beginning and end portions are great, but it meanders so much in the middle that it's hard to sit through."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I love how art is so different for people. I've watched the film many times and each time the quality of entertainment that I get is the very same as the fist time I watched it. Excited for his film but I gotta be honest, the trailer was kind of underwhelming."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Jackie brown was great. Probably his most underrated film, and last classic film he‚Äôs made. Though I really did enjoy hateful eight. I just kinda cringe when he goes reservoir dogs at the end. Cool everyone dies. Siiiiick."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"I don't remember much about her from the script other than she doesn't have the bottom half of her jaw. A scene he had to cut because it was in the Broomhila section, really made me sad. He ripped it straight from Death Rides a Horse and it's awesome."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,Neither are close to his best work imo. He peaked with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"Maybe the story is better, but Django has some weird pacing issues that I didn‚Äôt think existed in Hateful Eight."
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,It was more suspenseful this way.  I'd normally agree with you but I also love the idea of a western in a cabin in a blizzard with things like stew and coffee and big blankets.  It's a very cozy tarantino movie for me.  It's possible it's not the most exciting movie he has made.  You might argue I just really like the aesthetics.  Check out the first part maybe and see if it makes a difference or not.
The Hateful Eight: Extended Version,"It had some really cool moments, but IMO it suffered tremendously from pacing issues just like Hateful Eight. I have nothing against long movies, but with Tarantino's latest installments it's felt to me like there's no one in the writing room or editing room who's willing to tell him to simplify things a bit."

Then for over two hours, they take turns going in and out of there taking huge mud pies and over flushing. Then they go in there TOGETHER and you hear a bunch of ScRoUnGiNg around and then you hear a bunch of YELLING and on of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friends foot stuck in the toilet. And he says, ""help him, you gotta help him!"" and when you go in there to help him, he just pulls it out easily, and laughs 'cause his foot wAsN'T stuck. It wasn't stuck at all he was just faking it. And then they get REALLY serious, they say, ""IT'S TURBO TIME!"" and they both start running around the house as FaSt as they can and jumping over the couches. But when YOU try and jump in, they yell at you and they say ""YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE TURBO TEAM, DON'T RUN, DON'T RUN WITH US, WE'RE THE ONES WHO RUN! UNTIL YOU'RE APART OF THIS TURBO TEAM, WALK SLOWLY!"" 
So, you go and lay down to be by yourself and read your art books. But then the next day you went into the bathroom and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunked and you said, ""how could that be? There's no way they could have shrunk the toilet"" But then you saw in the trash, a receipt from Home Depot for a toilet, the exact same size as yours but with a JoKe HoLe ThAt""S JuSt FoR FaRtS. They replaced your real toilet with a fart toilet! And now you can't take a dump in your house 'CAUSE YOUR TOILET CAN'T SUCK'EM DOWN AND YOU FEEL SICK TO YOUR STOMACH!
Has that ever happened to you?!?"

I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson,"I‚Äôve struggled to articulate why I find this show so funny, but the best way I could describe it is that all the jokes and characters are coming from a place that just barely makes sense. It‚Äôs teetering on the edge of nonsense.

I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson,"This genuinely gave a reason to keep going, there is no joke here. I used to be a piece of shit."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Not certain whether this is a really adorable kids show or a really dark adult animated show; regardless, I am intrigued."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Looks cute.
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"They‚Äôve made a show about a bear who lives to eat pancakes and sweets and take naps. 

He‚Äôs my Patronus. "
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,The stop motion style is so cute and unique I have to give this a look. Stop motion animation is pretty rare.
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,I love Rilakkuma pls plspls be good
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Dafuq
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Looks insufferable
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Probably just sweet slice of life since it is basically advertisement for the dolls. Then again this is from Japan so everything is possible.  
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"More like a ""oriented towards Japanese women in their 20's and up"" show. They eat this stuff up. "
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Whatever it is, I'm watching it."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"I think it's supposed to be a ""relax show"" you just watch it to de-stress and nothing much happens, just relaxing music, characters, etc... sort of like a warm bath for your brain."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"> advertisement for the dolls

Didn't know there were dolls. Kinda bummed that it's not some cutesy horror thing, but I also can't wait to watch a cutesy slice of life show :D"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Again who knows. This is Japan where they promoted (and keep) promoting shows as being cute, going as far to have the first 3 episodes being slice of life only to shock their audience when shit hits the fan by episode 4."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"They sell the dolls at several stores here in the U.S. Hot Topic, Barnes and Noble, FYE, Books a Million. They're all over the place. "
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Is this a reference to a specific show?
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,A bunch of shows really. 
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,stop motion animation right? automatically sold! are there other stop motion shows i'm missing out on?
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Yellow chick is god
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,I can't wait!! ‚ô°
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Sold!
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Imagine if this series was a ‚Äúslow television show‚Äù

Like they have in Finland, I think, where a channel would show a 4 hour scenic train ride in its entirety.  

I hope it‚Äôs very little plot/dialogue, just half hour sessions of adorable-ness to mellow out to 
"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,A stop motion show?! Lol woah. Looks adorable.
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Would this even be considered an anime???
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,I miss the late 90s/early 2000s when stop motion movies were popular. 
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Currently there‚Äôs *Buddy Thunderstruck* on Netflix
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,I assume you've seen all of the Wallace And Gromit short films. 
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,i've seen a good many. they never made it into a tv series right?
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,">	Rilakkuma and Kaoru seems to be another production in a wave of shows from Japan that are affectionately referred to as ‚Äúiyashikei‚Äù, a Japanese word that can be translated to ‚Äúhealing‚Äù. These shows often involve little to no conflict, and place emphasis on the little delights in life - with the aim being to relax and soothe the viewer

It is a very easy and comfortable show to watch. It‚Äôs a very melancholy show. There is conflict, which is often not solved but instead diffused. I like the show quite a bit."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"I enjoyed this show. It‚Äôs very offbeat. Any other slice of life, relaxing watches like this?"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,I freaking love this show
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,[deleted]
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,love this  so much... oh sweet melancholy!
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Going off of the first episode alone, I really like it. But I thought this would be a genuine crowdpleaser and it‚Äôs not. The tone is really weird, and for a show about 3 cute stuffed animals Kaoru gets much more screen time. 

Lana Condor is also a weird choice for Kaoru, at least in the English version."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Aww. I remember reading about this on /r/television but I wasn't aware it dropped today / yesterday. I'll definitely check it out on Netflix for sure. Looks good from the trailer.
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"Yup. I'm happily surprised, as my favorite anime genre is slice-of-life and I'm an older woman so a lot of what Kaoru is ruminating on resonates for me.  The trailer really didn't convey the type of show or its tone.  And anyone expecting bouncy kids' stuff or raucous furries (ala *Aggretsuko)* are unlikely to find this what they wanted.

I'm loving it. And I'm kind of caught watching it not just for story/characters and the emotive aspect, but also the sheer skill of the animation (Kaoru's little dance on the way to the hanami picnic was breathtaking to me given how hard that is to do with a puppet; for CGI, you expect that kind of grace; stop motion not so much) and the extraordinary level of detail on the puppet/prop/set builds.  Also, the lighting is just beautiful.

I'm not a huge anime fan, so I think the only Japanese *stop-motion* animation I'm actually familiar with are those old Rankin-Bass holiday specials, so it's a slight shocker to me to realize they're (of course)  pulling off Laika-level production value for a tv show these days. :)"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"I legit could not and still can‚Äôt hear Lana Condor in Kaoru‚Äôs voice at all. She sounds like a completely different person, like maybe a mom in a breakfast commercial or something"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"It‚Äôs like a Japanese slice of life show. Not really a genre I like and the main character looks really creepy. Disappointed, but I guess I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be great, I just wish it had any kind of suspense (which would make this watchable for me)."
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"I went subbed, not dubbed. :)"
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Weird.
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,Seriously.. 2019... 
Rilakkuma and Kaoru,"""A first look at the cute creatures of the new Netflix show, Rilakkuma. Rilakkuma is a mysterious bear who turns up to live with Kaoru, a seemingly ordinary young woman, in this stop motion teaser. Besides Rilakkuma, Kaoru also lives Korilakkuma (a small white bear cub) and Kiiroitori (Kaoru's pet bird), and they have adorable, surreal, and amazing adventures. ""


Judging by that synopsis Rilakuma sure seems like a sexual predator. "
Lunatics,"A total puff piece, but kind of an interesting take from Hawke about finding his character‚Äôs identity. 

Unfortunately, as this is a D+ Marvel Show, he will 100% turn out to be an evil villain that Spector will heroically defeat by the end."
Lunatics,"Normally Moon knight has 3 different personalities besides being a Moon Knight on the comics. I think that they are not going to do that route. Thats a bummer. 

3 personalities: Mercanary,  taxi driver, billionaire businessman."
Lunatics,Thought D+ was a grade and got a little sad bc I was looking forward to it. Took me a second to realize you meant Disney+ lol
Lunatics,Some people have speculated his charecter might turn out to be dracula which means moon knight won't kill him because they'll want to bring him into the blade project
Lunatics,He has at least 2 from the previews. Maybe the third is reviled later in the story.
Lunatics,Unless its a Tyler Durden situation.
Lunatics,I HIGHLY recommend Strangers With Candy.
Lunatics,Princess Caroline the Cat on Bojack Horseman is one of the most down to earth and relatable characters she plays.
Lunatics,"If you believe her brother's side of the story, her eccentricity is just being adapted for the small screen.  

Like that time she [wore a fat suit](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/99/transcript) to upset her father by making him believe she had grown obese (he deserved it, though).    "
Lunatics,I've loved Amy's work for almost twenty years; so glad to see her getting the recognition she deserves!
Lunatics,The woman is an American treasure.
Lunatics,"Her whole family is all sort of lunatics. Her brother David Sedaris, writes some beautiful books about their family, especially their younger brother 'The Rooster'."
Lunatics,"Awe.  She and her brother David are the best.

Truly very funny, talented, and genuine."
Lunatics,"Wasn't really feeling *At Home With Amy Sedaris*... until the ""Grieving"" episode. I haven't laughed that much in a long while. Patty Hogg is a genius creation and I would watch a show based entirely on her. "
Lunatics,"Her Letterman appearances are as classic as Norm's Conan appearances (also, Norm's Letterman appearances)"
Lunatics,She stole the tv.
Lunatics,Her new show is phenomenal. Find and watch it. 
Lunatics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m-HNFiCepI
Lunatics,"Amy Sedaris is probably one of the funniest people in show business.  Bold, ridiculously quick, risky and seems to make every effort to downplay her looks instead of relying on them.  A genuine talent.  "
Lunatics,At Home With Amy Sedaris is the only good thing that happed to me this year.
Lunatics,‚ÄúMy bacon strip is sizzlin‚Äô!‚Äù
Lunatics,Isn't she princess Caroline? She the best! Always leave on her feet.
Lunatics,David Sedaris is one of the only authors I can remember listening to and really enjoying myself.  That man is just damn funny and have appreciated Amy since Strangers with Candy.
Lunatics,"I have followed her career,  she is one of my favorite actors."
Lunatics,My dream is to be adopted into the Sedaris family. 
Lunatics,I love her character in kimmy schmidt. She fits right in. 
Lunatics,Amy Sedaris is GOAT
Lunatics,She is just fucking awesomeness 
Lunatics,"I have her cook book, and I also subscribe to her instagram. 

Amy, you're one cool lady. "
Lunatics,"My sister was in a movie with her when she was a kid and she was the best. She was super weird, but also very kind. My sister was 14 and she took her and the other young actresses under her wing. She made everyone in the cast customized granny panties. She was as adorable as you'd expect."
Lunatics,Her brother is pretty interesting as well.
Lunatics,Her new show had me crying I laughed so hard. So good. 
Lunatics,I love Amy so much. She was always insanely nervous on talkshows but it was endearing. 
Lunatics,She's exactly this on Kimmy Schmidt. 
Lunatics,Amy Sedaris is the only person I can (and do) imagine replacing Carrie Fisher as Leia.
Lunatics,She's my favorite thing about the movie Elf and she's barely even in it.
Lunatics,She is one of my celebrity wives
Lunatics,"Can't believe they didn't mention The Heart, She Holler in this article"
Lunatics,"> _BuzzFeed News Reporter_

Now THERE'S an oxymoron "
Lunatics,"That shrimp Christmas tree, though."
Lunatics,"I just want an hour long show of Amy and Megan Mullally laughing.
I don't know what it is, but but when I hear either of them laugh it makes me ridiculously happy!"
Lunatics,"She's so pretty, she should be on a Christmas card!"
Lunatics,STRANGERS WITH CANDY is one of the greatest tv shows ever made. i miss that show so much. Amy rules! 
Lunatics,She's fantastic in Unbreakable 
Lunatics,"Amy Sedaris is awesome, but seriously fuck buzz feed. Don't support thier trash."
Lunatics,I genuinely - as a Brit - only know her from the laundry adverts.
Lunatics,I'm half surprised Buzzfeed isn't accusing her of wearing 'mental unhinged face' 
Lunatics,I find her characters so irritating that I'll occasionally turn off my TV and sit in the dark for an hour or two to get away from her commercials.
Lunatics,Don't post buzzfeed. 
Lunatics,"The thing she‚Äôs making in the picture is something Rhett and Link made in their morning show Good Mythical Morning, and they cite a magazine from the (50‚Äôs?) where mayonnaise and gelatin where repeat offenders.

Lunatics,Show is unbearably moronic...nothing she has ever done will make you laugh

It's one of my favorites."

Lunatics,I haven't looked at cake the same since that show aired!
Lunatics,It's unbelievably good. 
Lunatics,My favourite show of all time!
Lunatics,Please no.  I'm still pissed that Strangers With Candy lasted as long as they did and Upright Citizen's Brigade got cancelled after the third season.
Lunatics,"You know what I really like about that character?  No matter how bad things get or how bad she's feeling, when her phone rings, her game face is on and she's here to make you a star.  Ever single time."
Lunatics,"Pretty much looks like Princess Caroline irl. She also played Fritz Howards' sister from The Closer.

Edit: deal with it lol"
Lunatics,"I didn't know PC was Amy Sedaris, *and* after googling to check, I've also learnt that she's Mimi in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. "
Lunatics,Princess Caroline = feminist icon.
Lunatics,"Came to say the same. I love her work with Princess Caroline, the animation and script are great, but her interpretation is that makes the character believable."
Lunatics,[removed]
Lunatics,"My favorite Amy story, as told by David: ‚Äú...I'd been riding the Chicago El with my sister, Amy, who was getting off two or three stops ahead of me. The doors opened. And, as she stepped out of the crowded car, she turned around to yell, ‚ÄòSo long, David. Good luck beating that rape charge.‚Äô‚Äù"
Lunatics,"I have ALWAYS. loved David on TAL...I guess I never put it together that this was his sister.

My favorite part of the transcript, I literally belly laughed...

When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn't tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones.

When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches.

Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I'm in love. Can you believe it? I'm finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great."
Lunatics,"This is from the SantaLand Diaries, when David was an elf at Macy's:

>My sister Amy lives above a deaf girl and has learned quite a bit of sign language. She taught some to me and so now I am able to say, ‚ÄúSANTA HAS A TUMOR IN HIS HEAD THE SIZE OF AN OLIVE. MAYBE IT WILL GO AWAY TOMORROW BUT I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO.‚Äù"

Lunatics,Did some *more* time.
Lunatics,*Stoled* ;)
Lunatics,"If you haven't read her book, *I Like You, Hospitality Under the Influence*, on which the show is based, do yourself a major favor and read it. There's an audio book version too that she reads and it's hysterical."
Lunatics,"""HELP!"" gets me every time"
Lunatics,Such a messed up and beautiful show

My Dear Boy,"I dislike what they did to Eric - they made him into a complete idiot. 

I also dislike they wrote Angelia out the episode before series finale. 

Those are two things that tarnish the show for me."
My Dear Boy,"Fun story, the first episode I ever saw was actually the final 10 minutes of the finale. About 10 years ago, I was just flipping through channels and came across it. It seemed interesting, and luckily for me, the very next episode the channel aired was the first episode. 

Ended up watching it all over the course of the next few months, and I loved seeing the journey. It felt like a very true-to-real albeit goofy coming of age show."
My Dear Boy,"I wasn't a big fan with what they did with the finale personally. I didn't like that Angela got written off an episode prior but at least she got an entire new episode as a goodbye. The actual finale was at least half a clip show with the one nice moment at the end.

And while that moment was nice, there were plenty of similarly nice moments with the kids and Feeny in the rest of the series. There was the scene where Shawn sticks up for Feeny in their junior years when kids trash his house and nearly drive him to retirement. There was the time when Eric got into college (when he was still an actual character)."
My Dear Boy,"One of my favorite shows of all time.

I'm loving reliving it through the new podcast with Danielle, Rider and Will."
My Dear Boy,The final scene for sure cant be beat.
My Dear Boy,Grew up on the show and it is one of my favorites. I still do a rewatch every few years. Ending was a nice wrap up.
My Dear Boy,"Pod Meets World started a few months back, cant recommend it enough if you want to hear old stories on the show. Lots of old TV Casts are doing these ""lets rewatch our old show and recap"" podcasts, but i really think PMW is the best one yet."
My Dear Boy,"For those that haven't watched it:

While it's aimed at a younger demographic and rife with fan service, Girl Meets World brings back a LOT of characters from Boy Meets World. There is a lot of closure provided too, among several of those characters. The finale wasn't as good as BMW's, but I still felt like it stuck the landing."
My Dear Boy,Cory was an unlikable whiny little worm of a character.
My Dear Boy,Yeh this is one of those shows that I‚Äôll show to my kids and hope they‚Äôll like it.
My Dear Boy,Wasn't the finale a clip show? That's a very lazy way to end a series. The final scene is iconic of course.
My Dear Boy,"OP never saw ""Six Feet Under"", and it shows.
:)"
My Dear Boy,"I watched it so many years ago that I barely remember the finale, maybe am due a rewatch

But I remember the finale of Girl Meets World, I liked it."
My Dear Boy,"Not my era but Jos√© did a great retrospective 

https://youtu.be/PX_fkmJAG7E"
My Dear Boy,"Both The Wonder Years and BMW are like the Catcher in the Rye of TV. 

The continuity was almost non-existent in Boy. It fixed problems in 22 minutes. The college years were bad.  

It is what it is."
My Dear Boy,"Mr. Turner just disappearing off the face of the earth also is a pretty low point for me. 

I don't know if there were behind the scenes reasons for the departure, but it is such a whiplash to see his accident and how emotional Shawn is over it to just never be shown again.

They do make a joke about it when Minkus shows up and says that he and Mr. Turner are just on the other side of the school and points off set.

I felt those middle seasons where the peak. The kids were old enough to have some real drama and they didn't get go overboard on some of the characters like Eric yet."
My Dear Boy,"What really gets me is the way they retcon Corey & Topanga's relationship like the were in love since kindergarten.  She starts off as a ""freak"" that he wants nothing to do with.  I'm pretty sure he ends up cheating on her even when they do get together.  Boy Meets World last couple seasons is the epitome of unearned ""tell, don't show"" storytelling.  Bummer too because that first season is full of heart.  Watching Eric's stupidity as a kid was great, watching him morph in to that as an adult was tragic."
My Dear Boy,"Idiotic and mildly psychotic too, haha. It was kinda strange, but at the same time, Cory wasn't a huge source of humor, nor was Shawn. So, I can see why the writers thought it was a viable direction for Eric. Eric was pretty one-dimensional and boring early on."
My Dear Boy,"Reminds me of Stargate SG-1. I had been watching loose episodes here and there since 1997 but I never sat down to watch a full episode until like 2011. The episode was really good and it went above and beyond to make me want to watch more, so I could see what happens next.

Turns out, it was the last Episode of Season 10, which was created in such a way that was meant to continue in Season 11... but then they cancelled the show.

I had binged the first 8 and half seasons before I had figured that one out."
My Dear Boy,This is why I love reddit. I didn't even know they had a podcast. I'm subscribing right now lol.
My Dear Boy,Yeah same with Ross and ted mosby
My Dear Boy,It's had a few very brief flashbacks but isn't really a clip show.
My Dear Boy,">  I'm pretty sure he ends up cheating on her even when they do get together.

Yeah, he spends all night talking to a girl at the ski lodge (Lauren?) and then kisses her.  He and Topanga fight about it, and then she says that he should date her.  So he does, he hates it, and tries to go back to Topanga.  Then she breaks up with him (rightfully so), because she didn't need to date someone else to remember that she loved him.

They spend, what feels like, an entire season getting back together.

I'll be honest, it's a great couple of episodes, but it's way out of character for Corey.  He's just not the cheating type.  The whole thing just felt super forced."
My Dear Boy,"I kinda disagree that they retconned the cory/topanga relationship. To me a retcon would mean they pretend all that stuff never happened, and moved on. Boy meets world didnt do that. Yes, in 6th grade, he thought she was weird. But they do explain why he thought that way (cause Eric called girls icky and embarrassed cory. If cory has a defining character trait, its that he hates the idea that he could be average or even dorky. So Shawn and Eric making fun of topanga is more than enough to sway Cory at that age) and that he didnt think that both before and after that period. And honestly, in 6th grade he was clearly fronting a bit. In topanga's first episode, she kissed him and he gave her his hat. Later in the season he would go on a date with her. They also call back to her weirdness on multiple occasions through boy and girl"
My Dear Boy,I agree and they sprinkled in some episodes where Eric was not a total dumbass here and there. Im glad they made his character not a total joke in girl meets world.
My Dear Boy,The retcon confuses me especially since I started watching HS episodes first
My Dear Boy,"Have you read the theory about why Eric turned into an idiot? 

https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r1hp0/did_eric_matthews_character_in_boy_meets_world/"
My Dear Boy,"Haha, awesome!

Pod Meets World"
My Dear Boy,"Having recently watched the series again, it‚Äôs more than just brief flashbacks. There are montages of moments between every set of characters with major relationships."
My Dear Boy,"I just went back to Disney Plus and skimmed through the two-part finale. The first part is almost all clip show, and the second is about 50% clip show. So it's definitely more than very brief."
My Dear Boy,"In the first season however Topanga didn't know who Eric was. She got a crush on him when he spoke to their class and was surprised he was Cory's brother.

If Cory and Topanga were that close as childhood friends, she would know who his brother is. And same on Cory's side. He didn't know she had an older sister."
My Dear Boy,I haven't seen it in years. I guess I misremembered. I thought most of th esecond half was new footage. Oh well.
My Dear Boy,"I got the impression what they were doing was more of the subtle way one re-writes their own memories, something everyone apparently does without realising, in subtle ways every time one recalls something."
My Dear Boy,"ehh, minor details. I'm not saying the plan from her first appearance was this story. You don't have to know where youre going in a show from the word go. I'm saying they wove together what happened in 6th grade and what happened moving forward in a way that worked.

Nebula is kinda my point. If you retcon something, to me it means you pretend it never happened. they never talk about nebula again, she doesnt come to visit ever, not in girl meets world, she's just gone like she never existed. that's a retcon.

But other than minor details, they never had to pretend what happened in 6th grade never happened. They call back to those times any time they need to explain the story, or when topanga needs to find a way of thinking she fell away from. Those times existed, they didnt just disappear"
My Dear Boy,"It was less of a clip show than I remembered and more of a clip show than you remembered, so we were both mistaken! Cheers!"
My Dear Boy,I'll drink to that and then pee on a cop car!
My Dear Boy,"one of my favorite running gags this season - every woman ends up blonde in the hollywood adaptation.   First stormfront, and now Deeps wife as well."
My Dear Boy,Billy Zane you da bomb in the phantom yo!
My Dear Boy,The scenes with the Deep are the best. In the earlier season when he tries to escape with his dolphin I hurt myself from laughing.
My Dear Boy, The world-building in this show is just spectacular.
My Dear Boy,My favorite part was when it cut to the cult leader just chugging Fresca.
My Dear Boy,All I can think about is poor Timothy
My Dear Boy,They got Lex Luther
My Dear Boy,"What's the deal with Billy Zane anyway? 

I only ever see him in these cameos."
My Dear Boy,"I think they chose to right title since their alternate titles were ""Killer Clownfish From Outer Space"" and ""Call of Duty (COD)"""
My Dear Boy,The Deep is my second favorite character behind Homelander.
My Dear Boy,I wonder if The Deep could drown Homelander if he could keep him under water long enough.
My Dear Boy,"The clip they showed in  the show was better - this just added bloat, slowed the pace, and didn't add any joke or plot."
My Dear Boy,Blondes test 5 points higher in key demos.
My Dear Boy,Phantom like a motherfucker
My Dear Boy,"Oh man, in some alternate universe Billy Zane played Holden McNeil"
My Dear Boy,Except for ‚Ä¶ that scene
My Dear Boy,they are too sad
My Dear Boy,What is with the Fresca? I don‚Äôt get it
My Dear Boy,That was hard to watch. Did not like that.
My Dear Boy,He has been one of the kings of cameos since Zoolander.
My Dear Boy,B list actor who gets memed on a lot. Seems to have a good sense of humor about it
My Dear Boy,"Taking a lot of small movie roles to pay his divorce bills, starring in doomed TV shows, and mostly a lot of stage work on Broadway and off. He's a busy guy, he's just not in super mainstream media these days. He is also an independent film maker."
My Dear Boy,He had a pretty decently sized role in the MacGruber show.
My Dear Boy,Phantom and Titanic.
My Dear Boy,His absolute best role is in Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight.
My Dear Boy,Wouldn't it be hilarious if after all the planning and scheming to try and end homelander the thing that finally does him in is choking on a piece of food?
My Dear Boy,Pretty sure congresswoman head sploder is gonna be the one to do it because she could do it without him knowing she's there
My Dear Boy,*Taste clusters
My Dear Boy,Timothy!
My Dear Boy,"It's just a tongue in cheek reference to ""drinking the Kool-Aid"", Jonestown, etc. The writers wanted them to eat or drink something ""culty"", as cultists do, and Fresca was the first thing that popped into their head. No particular reason other than the fact they thought it was funny."
My Dear Boy,"I see it as a joke against something like the Church of Latter-Day Saints, where alcohol, coffee, and other beverages are forbidden but sodas are sometimes allowed or at least in a gray area. Fresca is a silly version of that."
My Dear Boy,I guess it would be weird if you did enjoy watching that.
My Dear Boy,He‚Äôs a cool dude
My Dear Boy,"He was doing a bunch of really bad cheap projects for years there but he's come back with some good parts in mainstream stuff recently: The Boys, Macgruber, even True Story with Kevin Hart."
My Dear Boy,Thanks!
My Dear Boy,"Dude had the funniest line in Titanic - ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"""
My Dear Boy,someone here has never seen The Phantom
My Dear Boy,Everyone knows his best role is White Dragon
My Dear Boy,nah.  she was the first ally he secured because of this.
My Dear Boy,"No thanks, just had lunch"
My Dear Boy,He was also in Twin Peaks where he was nowhere near as cool as James.
My Dear Boy,Silly Zane
My Dear Boy,"I really do love The Rehearsal and where it ended up going, but I wish there were more episodes like the first one where it was a self contained rehearsal with Nathan going over the top in all his weird ways"
My Dear Boy,‚ÄúUse the weapons he uses‚Äù when Nathan is pretending to be that guy in his apartment is a line that always makes me laugh
My Dear Boy,The scene in the first episode where Nathan is confessing and it cuts back and forth between the real and fake guy? Absolute perfection.
My Dear Boy,"most creative show I've seen in years

hard to put into a genre"
My Dear Boy,"It was a masterpiece. Beautiful work of art. Every episode a painting. Loved it, but very different vibe than Nathan for You."
My Dear Boy,"Amazing.

And the show has stayed with me for months.

I can‚Äôt wait for season 2.

It was just so creative, refreshing and tragic. Some of these people were really helped"
My Dear Boy,Nathan is insane and I love it
My Dear Boy,"> A few episodes in it became a bit challenging to tell who was an actor, who was not an actor, who was an actor but was not acting‚Ä¶ which I‚Äôm sure was completely intentional.

Mystery solved Scooby: 

> watched all 6 episodes back to back **while coming up on an edible that was a lot stronger than I had expected.**"
My Dear Boy,"Me, with daddy issues, watching the child actor episode of The Rehearsal: haha I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm totally fine don‚Äôt worry about me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so fine."
My Dear Boy,"I absolutely love NFY and was very excited for The Rehearsal but truthfully ended up hating the direction it went the last several episodes. 

It went to some weird and frankly *mean* places. If Fielder was trying to make a broader point about something it was lost on me."
My Dear Boy,Really great first 3 episodes for sure
My Dear Boy,"Waiting week to week was annoying 

Jealous of your binge"
My Dear Boy,I think this was the original plan for the show but Covid forced their hand into needing film at a remote location so they leaned into the farmhouse situation
My Dear Boy,"I read they were planning to but the guy with the gold digger ghosted them, and it made them rethink their strategy."
My Dear Boy,"I think it would have gotten stale. Plus it would have depended entirely on the participants, not everyone would have had such a natural intriguing personality as Korr. Nathan has said before how much they filmed for Nathan for you that didn‚Äôt get used so I imagine they‚Äôd be filming for much longer for the rehearsal."
My Dear Boy,"I really like that first episode, but it would have become very similar to Nathan For You if they followed that self-contained episodic formula. I think the best part of the Rehearsal is how often it leaves you in disbelief and makes you question what is actually real. It starts as a sort-of standard reality show and morphs into something else entirely."
My Dear Boy,"Everyone says that.  But some believe in writing you can't just stay at one level and repeat.  They believe you have to escalate with each act, even to the point of absurdity.

For a skilled writer like Nathan Fielder, I'm not sure he'd be satisfied with producing dozens of fun, but self-contained ""rehearsal"" training episodes.  He'd want there to be many and larger narratives, with season-wide and series-wide arcs, and complexly woven foreshadowing, all leading to a fecal mastication denouement."
My Dear Boy,Very much my only complaint
My Dear Boy,I popped when I saw the keyblade.
My Dear Boy,It was so surreal. Incredible stuff.
My Dear Boy,I fully agree. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it
My Dear Boy,Haha
KO One,Because its better than the other stuff on Cartoon Network. OK KO was beloved by animation fans but viewers couldn't care less about it. This was due to the show not getting any reruns. Because Teen Titans Go and Gumball are the only shows they air nothing else gets an opportunity. Trick Moon could have been a great show but CN only air the 2 moneymakers. The network is screwed the moment TTG ends because then it will become a zombie channel only airing reruns.
KO One,"I could said the same thing about Learning with Pibby. At least with Trick Moon, I actually loved the pilot through and through. Pibby? Not really. The concept may sound ""interesting""(for a lack of better word), but the cliche fanservice crossover aspect, try-hard dark and gritty nonsense, and this whole Creepypasta thing turns me off. I really don't understand why it gotten so popular."
KO One,[removed]
KO One,"Cable TV in general is dying. Most people get their content for streaming. CN could care less about ratings on the linear channel, because the views they'll get from HBO Max streams will even it out.

In any case, TTG and Gumball reruns have loosed up considerably, there's still plenty of other decent shows on CN right now such as Craig of the Creek, Mao Mao, and Victor and Valentino. I don't see why Trick Moon should be hailed as this masterpiece when in reality, it was a mediocre pilot for a neat concept."
KO One,[removed]
KO One,[removed]
KO One,Why is this a thing? What kind of marketing strategy is this?
KO One,I remember when they used to air non stop Looney Toons 
KO One, I usually don't join in on the TTG hate train but this is fucking bullshit
KO One,At least some of the episodes are The Night Begins to Shine series. I love that song and the mini series looks actually kind of cool.
KO One,And that's different than the current schedule how?
KO One,I miss the Regular Show :-(
KO One,"It's interesting how absurd the saturation of the show is, especially compared to the past. I have a feeling this will all crash down upon them, because this will just kill off show people WANT to watch and drive away people from coming back to the channel. Now I don't hate the show, and infact have a bit of a soft spot for it, but good god you need to at least reel it in."
KO One,Cartoon Network is dead to me
KO One,"This is the week I cancel cable.  95% of the time, my kid will watch youtube or netflix.  Occasionally i will watch cartoon network or comedy central for 30 mins to an hour at night as Im winding down for bed, but its not worth the cost anymore. Ive already seen TTG more than I care to admit. We sure don't need an entire week of it after its already been re-ran into oblivion. "
KO One,"It's Cartoon Network, so if you told me they did it because Teen Titans Go is so popular this is something that will be popular with their base, I would believe it, but if you told me they did it because people will hate it and Cartoon Network thinks that's hilarious, I would *also* believe that."
KO One,"To be fair, the episode this miniseries is based on is amazing, and I'm expecting the miniseries to follow suit.  If the rest of the series was as good as this then there would be no complaints. "
KO One,Is this such a big deal? It's a kid's channel.
KO One,"Could it be they're blowing them out before it's taken to DC's new streaming service?  Isn't August also when Netflix is losing their DC animated series, too?"
KO One,"Sounds a lot like TLC and The ""History"" channel. The same shit over and over and over and over..."
KO One,Teen Titans Go is great dont see the problem at all.
KO One,Bring back real Titans
KO One,"well, at least they won't run Diary of a Wimpy Kid 100 times, though it feels like they did earlier in the year. the stupid thing is when they started advertising the new movie I was pissed because they changed the cast, I don't even like that movie franchise yet I somehow gave a shit. "
KO One,"Don't turn into nickelodeon, cn."
KO One,I chose a book for reading
KO One,I remember when Cartoon Network aired one episode of powerpuff girls episode over and over again for one day. 
KO One,"Is teen titans go! The show I'm thinking about with Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire and such? Or a spinoff?"
KO One,Yeah and r/stevenuniverse is flipping out 
KO One,And when their ratings tank and they claim they do not know why we can laugh in their face.
KO One,A bad one.
KO One,It's for kids. They don't pay attention to when things are on and will watch the same thing dozens of times. This is also the reason that most animated shows have 65 episodes and that's all. Kids don't care about reruns.
KO One,"Let me just say this: I was recently babysitting my nephews for a few days last week, and Teen Titans GO was the only thing to get them to stop and chill for long periods of time. And lucky me, it was on all the time. "
KO One,"And Boomerang, which was the old-school cartoon channel for me growing up, has just been converted into CN2."
KO One,Looney Tunes has 25 years of varying shorts with different characters. Teen Titans Go has a little over 100 episodes and only 4 years of content with the same characters. 
KO One,"They once did bugs bunny A-Z on cartoon network. 1 week straight. Nothing but bugs bunny.  You could tune in for liek 2 hours a day, and not hit a repeat. There is a TON of material"
KO One,I'm more on the CN business hate train tbh
KO One,"Im home all day and i just keep a lot of shows on in the background, TTG is on all the time as is."
KO One,At least the current schedule shows Gumball
KO One,I can see more creators competing to work on Adult animated series rather than kids if this type of behavior from CN and Nick continue. 
KO One,"Feel free to nitpick, but I don't think Mr. Pickles is a kid's show. 

On a more serious level, they're the only place on cable really for sort of crossover appeal animation shows where they hit the weird gap between kids and adults. The only real counter example I can come up with are when the Avatar shows were on Nick, and they kind of screwed the pooch with that. Adventure Time is I think the most prominent example for Cartoon Network, but I'd put forth Regular Show and Samurai Jack as examples of it too (there are more). Hell, given the popularity of Adventure Time and the other shows that came about as a result of it finding quality people (IIRC Steven Universe), they owe a lot to those kinds of shows.

This isn't to say that shows like Teen Titans Go don't have a place on the network, they most certainly do. Just that Cartoon Network doesn't exactly have a history of the greatest sense for business. Their most recent success came off the back of an imo few rather poor years during the CN Real period from like 2007 to 2011 roughly. I believe it was that ridiculous Boston Bomb scare that caused a boardroom shakeup and ended up really hurting the channel. They killed Toonami, only to find out that people actually missed it and brought it back in 2012. My point here is that I'm not entirely sure this may be the best way to go about getting viewers to the channel long term. They've done well for themselves, but I wouldn't rest on my loins so comfortably if I were Cartoon Network since failure isn't that intangible for them."
KO One,"You know. You're the only one to say this theory, and could be plausible. As of second week of August, CN somehow got original Teen Titans back. Something is fishy."
KO One,"Well, which one do you recognize?

[The original](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/TeenTitansTogether.png)

or [the reboot that's currently on air](http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/tvbanners/9843808/p9843808_b_v8_ag.jpg)"
KO One,"They tend to flip over everything though, especially scheduling stuff."
KO One,"I don't get this line of thinking. When I was a kid, I'd get home, turn on Ducktales, see Magicka deSpell chasing a Beetle Boy through a crowd, think ""Oh, it's this episode again"" and turn it off.
"
KO One,Why does everyone think kids are all brainless 4 year olds that magically transform into aware adults at age 18 
KO One,Then why make new shows? Why not rerun old ones? 
KO One,"But this isn't a show for babies where that *can* apply (i.e. Why Sesame Street covers the same topics over a one week span). TTG is TV-PG and features lots of black comedy, random humor and mean-spirited behavior. It's a weird mix of Spongebob and It's Always Sunny. But even a diet version of that is something I wouldn't show someone under the age of 12. Steven Universe and others are much more appropriate for CN's prime demographic. "
KO One,That's because Boomerang is a streaming service now.
KO One,I mean.....it's not really for you though.... it's like complaining about bob the builder or hatchimals 
KO One,"Mr. Pickles is an Adult Swim show, not Cartoon Network. They're two separate networks that share a channel which changes over at 11pm."
KO One,Oh. Ok. Who the fuck decided the reboot was a good idea?
KO One,"""Beagle Boy"""
KO One,My 9 year old sister will put Ttg on the tv through Netflix and watch it until someone forces her to do something else. She's seen every episode multiple times and doesn't give a shit 
KO One,"Some bozo 7 year old is going to turn on the TV, see Teen Titans, watch it for a bit, and go do something else. This network is not for adults or anyone else that gives a shit what's on."
KO One,I don't think they think high schoolers are that brainless. But kids under 10 are pretty easily entertained and will watch reruns 
KO One,Because they still have different interests. And they need a little variety 
KO One,Please don't place Always sunny anywhere near the abomination that is Teen Titans Go
KO One,Kids under 12 don't get any of that stuff and don't care. They will happily watch a colorful show with fart jokes and a plot that they don't understand.
KO One,And actually worth the $40 a year in my opinion. They add new content every week. The Jetsons will be added soon.
KO One,"If you can air a show about an elvis presley impersonator who wants to get laid, two kids who are friends with the physical embodiment of death and a show about little girls who beat up bad gus you can't complain when you get a diverse viewership"
KO One,"> They're two separate networks that share a channel which changes over at 11pm.

Yeah, since they're controlled from the top down by the same people controlling the other networks (CN, Adult Swim, and Boomerang IIRC) they're not really ""separate"" entities. Closer to Siamese twins than brothers if that makes sense. And with his use of ""channel"" he runs into some trouble if he lets his kid watch ""Cartoon Network"" all day and shows that are inherently not for kids show up."
KO One,"On its own it's half decent and has a lot of references to DC heroes, but it is nothing compared to the original show. Totally different tone and presentation."
KO One,">watch it for a bit, and go do something else

Now, wouldn't you have a better shot at capturing viewers more often if the kid could at least have a hope of catching a different show the next time? Wouldn't the kid just get bored of the channel after tuning in two or three times and catching the same show?"
KO One,"A lot of reddit users severely underestimate the processing power of preteens. Like I don't expect an 11 year old to appreciate the comedy stylings of Bob Newhart, but it's a huge disservice to say all kids that age care about is farts. Obviously they do like toilet humor, but to say that's all they understand is ridiculous."
KO One,[deleted]
KO One,"But those shows were still geared towards kids, below high school age kids I'd say. Powderpuff was more geared towards girls and the others towards boys, but still. Teen titans go is probably about as goofy as johnny bravo "
KO One,I think my knowledge of cartoon network is outdated
KO One,"> On its own it's half decent

On its own, it's dumb comedy that teaches children horrible morals (like the episode where the moral was ""knowing stuff makes you a bummer) with a team of superheroes who constantly hate and abuse each other."
KO One,"Have you ever met kids?  They'll watch the same movie a dozen times in a row.  When I was a kid I watched Who Framed Roger Rabbit at least twice a day, despite not being entirely clear what is was about.  More Teen Titans is unlikely to disrupt them.

Also, binging is a thing, grown adults will happily watch the same tv show for weeks, how different is this, really?  If they were playing the same episode over and over, that would be one thing, but I'm assuming they're just going to cycle through the entire series."
KO One,I'm sure the people running the network know more than us about what works and what doesn't.
KO One,To make it fresh I assume. 
KO One,"Yeah, the show is a real dumpster fire. It's [an occasionally self-aware dumpster fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N74D9xl0b-A), but is overall a tremendous disappointment to fans of the original."
KO One,"Kids stop doing that after a while though. There's binge culture, yeah, but people move on. Even in a YouTube culture, people won't binge *the same* content over and over. It needs some variety once in a while. "
KO One,[deleted]
KO One,"You say that, but there are people who have gone through the entire Harry Potter series like 7 times."
KO One,"Yeah... Well that's just like, your opinion, man."
KO One,You should be a hit on r/unpopularopinion
KO One,r/stoplikingwhatidontlike
KO One,"I would say it matches up pretty well with the cheesy, unrealisticness of the original star wars movies. Not better, not worse"
KO One,"The show is a scifi take on the old White Hat cowboy show like the Lone Ranger.

It never was meant to be some gritty violent drama, it is on Disney + not HBO. Go watch Blade Runner or something if that is what you are looking for.

I personally love the show, it is a throw back to the good old network shows like the A Team or Knight Rider, just set in the Star Wars universe and is presented with a ton of fun Easter eggs for the Star Wars fan.

And if the show was just meant to sell Baby Yoda Merch, you would think that they would have had all that sweet Merch ready to go for Christmas... Oh wait, they didnt have it ready to sell because they kept it a secret so they could have a fun surprise that wasn't ruined by corporate greed? Well that is the opposite of what you claimed?"
KO One,If it's just to sell Baby Yoda merch then where is my Baby Yoda merch?
KO One,[deleted]
KO One,But...but...BABY YODA!
KO One,The series is very predictable and very repetitive when it comes to a star wars story line. The 3rd episode is the best it's gonna get. Which wasn't bad but nothing amazing.
KO One,I would argue any show deserves the hype it gets. Hype is driven by people and if people like it then it deserves it. Jus because you disagree doesn't change how others view it.
KO One,[deleted]
KO One,"When you have been forced fed  Garbage for years  that they insist  is Starwars, it lowers expectations.
Mandalorian is ""good not great"" but by comparison to  recent starwars films it is the single  greatest  show ever  created."
KO One,"> in the scene where the Jawas are looting his ship, Mando snipes a couple of them from the ridge and they just sort of poof into dust

That was the moment where I turned to my SO and said ""So this is how they'll be doing bloodless violence"", but really, this is all to be expected. Aside from the western-style meandering, plot-wise, pretty typical Star Wars. You want gritty and realistic? Let me point you to The Expanse."
KO One,"I have yet to hear a single person actually explain why they like the show other than ""OMG BABY YODA SPAGHETTI WESTERN!!!"""
KO One,Oh just give it a rest.
KO One,You sure do know a lot about Jawa culture and society.
KO One,"He's not an assassin, he's a bounty hunter. ""no disintegration"" goes back to ESB, There is a hard PG-13 rule for Disney+, but you come off like the buckets of blood guy from shortpacked.

Honestly, I was more surprised at the casual murder in the prequel trilogy.

With the Jawas, they did their best to kill him back after the disintegrator rifle scene, and he survived, so they wrote it off. They're weirdly pragmatic thieves."
KO One,"After yesterday's episode, yes it fucking does."
KO One,"Does not deserve the hype.....

People hype something they like...usually. That doesn't mean you, or the next person MUST like it also. There's probably something out there you love, and most hate. We all don't agree on everything, why should tv be any different?"
KO One,"Hol up.    

You serious?    I thought for sure this was a they had us in the first half post."
KO One,[deleted]
KO One,Watchmen doesn‚Äôt deserve the hype yet bots and losers promote the crap out of it every day.   At least Mando is fun to watch
KO One,Most things don‚Äôt.
KO One,"NOOOOOO you can't just dislike something that i like ur a heckin party pooper you must be fun at parties xD

i'm not capable of forming original thoughts so instead ill ZING you with the epic quote from my favourite movie ever (the big lebowski, if you couldn't tell, you cretin)

IT'S LIKE UR UM...OPINION MAN AND LIKE UH UR WRONG BUT UH I ONLY SAY, UH LIKE, THIS, WHEN SOMEONE UH DISAGREES, WITH, UH ME

KO One,Aye it's a big old wet old fart and Disney didn't even manage to profiteer off the baby Yoda hype with plush toys for Xmas lol
My First First Love,"""All the OGs are back!""

""Lizzy Caplan not returning for the revival"""
My First First Love,no lizzy caplan hurts but glad most everyone else is back. love those guys.
My First First Love,"Cautiously optimistic about this, and even if it's bad at least it's a reminder that Adam Scott's Severance hair is not his normal hair."
My First First Love,"Just watched the original series this month in preparation. It‚Äôs great. So disappointing it got cancelled, I could‚Äôve watched four more seasons at least. So fun, consistently fresh, great chemistry between the cast, totally worth a watch."
My First First Love,Are we having fun yet?
My First First Love,"the next article 

>MILF Manor: Meet the 8 middle-aged moms looking for love in TLC's new dating show

HOw are you supposed to satirize a culture that insists on being this ridiculous? It satirizes itself faster than creatives can put out content."
My First First Love,"I don't want you serving them two jiggers.
https://youtu.be/8rChLGkUcPw"
My First First Love,Not interested in this. I'm only into hard Sci fi.
My First First Love,Will episodes go to Hulu the next day?
My First First Love,"For my fellow Adam Scott lovers, he just appeared on today's episode of the (fantastic) podcast Pod Meets World, with Danielle Fischel, Rider Strong, and Will Friedle. It was delightful to listen to."
My First First Love,So excited for this show to return! Probably one of the most underrated live action comedies! Now just need a trailer! üò©
My First First Love,I am too busy rewatching 300 to make time for this
My First First Love,Soup or Crackers?
My First First Love,"Spoiler alert please! 
  
What don't you understand? It's crystal clear. Ron Donald r/television‚Äôs Do's, okay? The 4 P's, 1 B and one N. Politeness, Professionalism, Perfectionism, Proactive, Be on time, No Spoilers."
My First First Love,No Lizzy Caplan in the Party Down revival makes me sad. Inside Job getting cancelled also makes me sad.
My First First Love,"Glad to see Ron's giant hog is going to make an appearance, even if it's only on the side of the van."
My First First Love,James Mardsen is a great addition.
My First First Love,I was only excited for this to see some more Lizzy Caplan
My First First Love,"Eh, Garner to replace Caplan is a downgrade in my opinion.  Is Rob Thomas still involved?"
My First First Love,"I love this show so much and I‚Äôm so happy it‚Äôs coming back. I still watch it at least once a year. 

I‚Äôm def going to miss Lizzy, but holy shit, Constance is back!"
My First First Love,"As someone who has worked in banquets, catering & events as side gigs through many years, this show is so fucking spot on‚Ä¶ its even funnier when you‚Äôve been in the industry! Same cast basically, I have high hopes for this recharge!"
My First First Love,Call an ambulance!
My First First Love,he needs to party down to the Severance set and get that shit done and out. i need season 2 in my life.
My First First Love,No Lizzy= hard pass
My First First Love,Bring back the GUTE
My First First Love,I'm watching the original for the first time now. I was bummed out was only two seasons because I'm really digging it. Glad to hear about a revival. Dayd about no Casey.
My First First Love,"Holy shit, Ron hadn‚Äôt aged a fucking day"
My First First Love,I thought this thing had already premiered. It feels like it‚Äôs been talked about for years in production
My First First Love,Awesome. Love this show. Criminally underrated
My First First Love,Dude fuck yeah!! This show was so good
My First First Love,I hope this means that Scott has already finished filming Severance season 2 and we‚Äôll get to see it soon.
My First First Love,Yay! More Party Down is something I get behind.
My First First Love,Omg this made me so excited. Can‚Äôt wait for this!
My First First Love,"Damn dude, not having Lizzy really sucks. Such a massive part of the show"
My First First Love,"Lizzy Caplan was the star of it imo, not super interested to watch without her back"
My First First Love,"No Lizzy Caplan, no show. üëé"
My First First Love,[deleted]
My First First Love,"No Jane????  No Lizzy??? üòû Still Ken, Martin and Adam. üòä"
My First First Love,"Apparently, Lizzy Caplan was 'too Jewy' for the show."
My First First Love,[deleted]
My First First Love,"Ooooh, I hope it‚Äôs me this time!"
My First First Love,"Oh man this is one of my favourite shows! Not happy Lizzy Caplan is a huge blow though, wish we could have the whole original cast!"
My First First Love,"No , these are sun eggs !"
My First First Love,no lizzy ? ‚òπÔ∏è
My First First Love,"I didn't even know they're reviving it! I watched the series for the first time last year, and was bummed when it was so short!"
My First First Love,"Ha, I used to watch this. Will have to give it a go."
My First First Love,"Yeah, me. ü§§"
My First First Love,I fucking loved party down.
My First First Love,IS THIS REAL? Is party down really coming back? Don‚Äôt tease me I can‚Äôt take it
My First First Love,Is this worth watching
My First First Love,That was such a good show.
My First First Love,"Maybe it's just me, but I'm not really annoyed at all that Caplan isn't returning. I always found her character to be the weakest on the show."
My First First Love,I hope this is as good as the original.
My First First Love,adam scott‚Äôs hair for a 49 year old is magnificent
My First First Love,Wait‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs no Lizzy Caplan??
My First First Love,"The thing that made Party Down great is, if they could make a great joke within the universe of the show about why someone was replaced, and replace that actor with someone who was also great as an actor and a character, it just works."
My First First Love,That is *deeply* disappointing news
My First First Love,Fucking savage.   I'm glad she'd had some success of late.  She deserves it.
My First First Love,"I am equal parts ecstatic that this revival is happening, and gutted that Caplan won't be in it.  She is a **critical** component of S1."
My First First Love,"Specifically:

>With Henry's on-again, off-again love girlfriend Casey (Lizzy Caplan) not returning for the revival

This was dictated to an infant who had 30 seconds to type it up"
My First First Love,"I really hope they play it off as ""well, she hit a big break and left everybody behind"". 

Show Henry watching a clip of her on some project she has had and just being super jealous."
My First First Love,"I always thought she was the heart of the show. 

A dark, black heart but one of the main reasons I watched the show."
My First First Love,Is Jane Lynch back?
My First First Love,"She‚Äôs my favorite actress so yeah that is a huge downer. I‚Äôll still give it a watch but don‚Äôt expect as much.. 

Which my expectations are kinda tempered anyway because I‚Äôm kinda not sure I really see the point I mean the show was pretty good but didn‚Äôt feel like it was begging for more"
My First First Love,"Also, Megan Mullaly's character, Lydia, wasn't added until season 2 so she isn't really an ""OG."""
My First First Love,Maybe she will show up for an episode. I‚Äôll miss her too.
My First First Love,[deleted]
My First First Love,"""Your outie pours pleasing drinks at parties."""
My First First Love,Yeah it took me at least 3 episodes of Severance to stop seeing him as  Tig Notaro's doppelganger.
My First First Love,"Your outie attends many parties, and is well known by many of the guests"
My First First Love,"Thing is Adam Scott had already left the show for Parks and Rec so if it did come back, it wouldn‚Äôt have had him. Kind of OK with how things worked out."
My First First Love,"[Did you ever see the mini-reunion they had on the TV show Childrens Hospital?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzyo9bP_es8) Worth a watch to see most of the Party Down cast reunite for it. Adam Scott was in an earlier season as a different character and so was Lizzy Caplan, but only Lizzy Caplan could return for this reunion scene."
My First First Love,What's it on?
My First First Love,I‚Äôve been rewatching it for the first time since about 10 years ago and it holds up so well. My only complaint is a bit too much ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gay‚Äù humor. I do not miss that about the 90s-2010s era.
My First First Love,"I felt it stopped being fresh after a little while since it was just so formulaic. Which is by design too so not a lot of ways around it, they constantly cater weird parties. Losing a cast member just means replacing them with another employee to cater wacky parties"
My First First Love,I did too!
My First First Love,I watched it for the first time recently. It's so good.
My First First Love,Come on say it

My First First Love,they date each other's sons to make it even more OTT
My First First Love,"Wow, the last several years I‚Äôve mixed up this character and his character from Silicon Valley. Forgot the hard sci-fi thing was from party down."
My First First Love,Yeah I love the dragons
My First First Love,Martin Starr's Roman is pound for pound one of the best characters in comedic tv history (in my humble opinion).
My First First Love,I'm stoked for that *Terror Bird* reboot.
My First First Love,Write down on this piece of paper how many times you've seen 300.
My First First Love,:(
My First First Love,"She apparently had a conflict. Hard to get a cast like this all in the same place and time for a shoot, so it's understandable."
My First First Love,"If you're looking for more Lizzy Caplan, I can't recommend Fleischman Is In Trouble enough. She's excellent in it."
My First First Love,What does Matchbox Twenty have to do with this??
My First First Love,"Not sure, but hope Nick DiCintio is"
My First First Love,What are you referring to?
My First First Love,Huh? How so?
My First First Love,Jane is back.
My First First Love,Roman was great I look forward to more of him. While I love Gilfoyle 6 seasons was enough.
My First First Love,It‚Äôs just you.
My First First Love,"I don't really care, I like both Party Down and Lizzy Caplan, will still watch it without her. It's just a poorly written article."
My First First Love,"Yeah, perhaps I'm alone with this, but the writing was so strong in Community that I didn't mind main characters were replaced with others. Don't get me wrong, I'd have loved for the likes of Pierce and Troy to be there until the end, but I also found plenty to love in Elroy and Frankie and even professor Hickie."
My First First Love,Yeah but Jen Garner?

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Dining Together,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Dining Together,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Dining Together,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Dining Together,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Dining Together,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Dining Together,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Dining Together,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Dining Together,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Dining Together,üôÇüíï
Dining Together,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Dining Together,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Dining Together,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Dining Together,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Dining Together,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Dining Together,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Dining Together,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Dining Together,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Dining Together,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Dining Together,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Dining Together,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Dining Together,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Dining Together,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!

Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Wise Mans Grandchild,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Wise Mans Grandchild,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Wise Mans Grandchild,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Wise Mans Grandchild,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Wise Mans Grandchild,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Wise Mans Grandchild,"I miss opening credits. I get why they've faded out of use, but nothing gets you more pumped than exciting music over energetic clips from the show."
Wise Mans Grandchild,MacGyver was like a god damn one man A-Team
Wise Mans Grandchild,[Dear God I'm stuck on a glacier with MacGyver!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PdY3L-JYzk)
Wise Mans Grandchild,I LOVED watching reruns of this when I was a kid. I'm afraid to rewatch as an adult though. Does it hold up?
Wise Mans Grandchild,RDA automatic upvote from this SG1 fan.
Wise Mans Grandchild,Airwolf‚Äôs song was the best of all of them
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Binged the year-long marathon as a kid in the early 2010s, loved it"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"I miss a good opening credit theme, plus MacGyver was great! The premise of a guy who uses (generally plausible) science and engineering ingenuity to get out of situations instead of using guns and violence was a lot of fun to watch! But perhaps it works better in a world before computers and smartphones were ubiquitous..."
Wise Mans Grandchild,I am old enough to realize that no one under the age of 30 knows what I am talking about when I use Mcgyver as a verb
Wise Mans Grandchild,Fun fact: in Brazil the theme song was replaced with Tom Sawyer
Wise Mans Grandchild,Even better [without the music!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ArMS3MSQwc)
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Miami Vice intro da best!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEjXPY9jOx8"
Wise Mans Grandchild,I‚Äôve been learning some 80s theme songs on guitar. Two standouts for me Magnum PI (by the same guy who created the Airwolf song) and Night Court.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"MacGyver was always one of my favorite shows, he did an amazing job as Jack O‚ÄôNeil in Stargate SG-1 too!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"The episode with the ants was *chef‚Äôs kiss*.
The one with the shooting was heavy (called ‚ÄúBlood Brothers‚Äù)"
Wise Mans Grandchild,We used to watch this every Friday during my automotive studies class in highschool
Wise Mans Grandchild,Entire intro doing all this cool stuff and then at the end is him squeezing past an automatic gate lol.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"I loved watching MacGyver with my dad, when i was a kid.

Thanks for the reminder."
Wise Mans Grandchild,"OK, now I understand how I get this and Quantum Leap mixed up all the time. But, MacGyver is much better."
Wise Mans Grandchild,I proudly made this into a ringtone in 2008 on my Sony Ericsson.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Probably THE childhood-defining tv show for me growing up. This show was so big in Taiwan, RDA actually visited a couple of times to do promotions and stuff and people literally lost their minds. I think the occasion was only eclipsed later by the likes of Michael Jackson and Tom Cruise.

Also one of the first shows that the tv station first started to do multi-language tracks with live broadcast, so you can actually turn on the original English voice as opposed to the local dub. Took a few episodes for kid me to grapple with the fact that MacGuyver did not in fact speak fluent Mandarin. Show helped taught me English after that.

Ah the memories."
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Been watching SG1 again recently and remembered this intro randomly whilst washing the dishes, started singing it to my partner and realised the middle part sounded a bit like the chip and dale rescue rangers theme song."
Wise Mans Grandchild,This just made me super nostalgic.  My college girlfriend got me the macguyver box set for my birthday one year
Wise Mans Grandchild,Man O'Neil was busy.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"When my 11 year old was a new born,through trial and error, I found the A-Team theme would send him to sleep"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"[Magnum PI.](https://youtu.be/LBIgXhiOpeQ) That helicopter drop in with the guitar riff. Then at 0:17, TS peelin out like a boss!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,Was it my imagination or did Henry Winkler produce this show?
Wise Mans Grandchild,I loved the intro to ‚ÄúThe Rockford files‚Äù.
Wise Mans Grandchild,Had such a crush on him in the 80's. (And I was a married woman!)
Wise Mans Grandchild,"God bless Col. Jack O'Neil, his career in SOF in the 80s as seen in the documentary 'MacGyver' prepared him to lead SG1 in the 90s and aughts."
Wise Mans Grandchild,Sledge Hammer!!!  was one of the better intros
Wise Mans Grandchild,"When I got my hair cut into a mullet during the pandemic, I showed my barber a picture of MacGyver"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"I always had this recurring joke of singing the MacGyver theme if I quickly passed through a closing door without touching it. Found out my wife did it too, after I met her. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"For a moment there, this theme reminds me of the Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers theme. Always has."
Wise Mans Grandchild,Airwolf‚Äôs intro still beats them all.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"MacGyver was always one of my favorite shows, he did an amazing job as Jack O‚ÄôNeil in Stargate SG-1 too!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,MacGyver was gay you know
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Hated the show, from what I saw of it.  But that intro song is really great!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,The pilot episode was Smithee directed does anyone know why
Wise Mans Grandchild,Nothing makes me chuckle more than Henry Winkler showing up on the credits.
Wise Mans Grandchild,They must have sold 10 episodes before shooting this intro to have that much footage for it.
Wise Mans Grandchild,All this guy needed to build a rocket was a toothbrush and a screwdriver
Wise Mans Grandchild,man this theme got me so amped... Macguyver could do anything...
Wise Mans Grandchild,go back and watch the intro to Airwolf. notice anything weird ?
Wise Mans Grandchild,"MacGyver is a man of focus, commitment, and sheer will... I once saw him kill three men in a bar... with a pencil, with a fucking pencil."
Wise Mans Grandchild,Watching the intro to the show its not hard to understand how RDA's knees got so messed up while filming this absolute classic of a show.
Wise Mans Grandchild,You should have included a link to iTunes to make it easier for us to buy it.
Wise Mans Grandchild,liked him alot in SG-1 never watched much MacGyver
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Old times , I remember  , !!"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Richard Dean Anderson composed that title song."
Wise Mans Grandchild,My first crush üíì
Wise Mans Grandchild,"The best intro was Knight rider, hands down"
Wise Mans Grandchild,"For me, It was when he created alien technology and spoke another language.. wait"
Wise Mans Grandchild,My two favorites were Hardcastle & McKormick and Greatest American Hero
Wise Mans Grandchild,"This was on when I was in college. Every Monday half my dorm would get together to watch the intro. We had a Rocky Horror-esq set of comments, laughs, and primal screams we‚Äôd perform while watching it for stress relief. Thanks for reminding me of those fun times."
Wise Mans Grandchild,Glad it took this to make Macgruber
Wise Mans Grandchild,So many memories of watching reruns of this show on the USA Network.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"I used to watch 'The Pretender' a lot as a kid, but i think it was less mainstream. Man, i love(d) that show.

Wise Mans Grandchild,Airwolf in 3... 2... 1...
Wise Mans Grandchild,"In some scenes, I see Tom Brady. Straaange"
Wise Mans Grandchild,There should be a subreddit solely for awesome intros of the 80's...
Wise Mans Grandchild,I really liked this show as a kid.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Am I the only one who hears ""Chip and Dale"" anytime I hear the McGyver intro"
Wise Mans Grandchild,Any reason why this is being posted
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Great intro. Wtf was the Phoenix Foundation, though?"
Wise Mans Grandchild,[4K upscaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaYjIUgDPBU)
Wise Mans Grandchild,Anime still does it. It can be some of the best parts of a show.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Westworld/Dexter are a couple of more recent great ones imo

Totally different style but hey, things change."
Wise Mans Grandchild,Most are bland and forgotten. Why waste the time and money.
Wise Mans Grandchild,"Some shows on streaming services still have good opening credits IMHO, particularly The Peripheral on Amazon, which I just love because of the music. It's certainly not the same as in the 80s or 90s though, because they don't have the ""energetic clips from the show"". Plus the nostalgia effect makes the older ones cooler, too.

Also, for a few shows you can find alternate fan-made opening credits on the YerTerbs! [This has to be the funniest one ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjvEdXDYgY4), of course most people have probably seen it by now but just in case anyone missed it, I have to share it again..."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Fox was really weird around then about green lighting these interesting, unusual, atypical types of shows and then doing everything in their power to kill them upon launch. I always got the impression that either there was a regime change where a bunch of people approved the shows and then left, or there was just a ton of tension between the execs who approved projects, the schedulers, and the people in charge of marketing.

Remember when *Family Guy* came back, and Peter led off with this long list of shows, saying something like ""We can only come back if all of these were cancelled?"" There were some real gems in that list."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"> Years later, the actor pitched a new live-action take on the character, which Amazon debuted in 2016 but with Peter Serafinowicz as the lead. (This version lasted two seasons.) ‚ÄúI really did wish we got to do it,‚Äù laments Warburton of not reprising the role.

I wish the [2016 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick_\(2016_TV_series\)) lasted a few more seasons. It was great. Amazon dropped it after two seasons and while the creator was shopping it around the actor's contracts all expired"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Never before in the history of everything was there a better casting choice than the pairing of Patrick Warburton as The Tick.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I really loved this show. Sad it‚Äôs gone.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,We need Batmanuel now more than ever.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,The Tick was absolutely BRILLIANT! I was so gutted when it got cancelled!
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Then Amazon did it again.

The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Don‚Äôt fight like a girl, Janet, fight like a *wo*man!"

INCONCEIVABLE!"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"
Loved the 2016 amazon version, didnt even know it was rebooted."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,**SPOOOOOON!**
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Patrick warburton was the perfect tick. This was a great show and ahead of its time.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,To think the animated series had more seasons than the live-action shows.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Sonnenfeld has put up some amazing TV. The Tick, Pushing Daisies, etc. It's hard to grasp how easily something like a live action The Tick could have gone horribly wrong and disappointed everyone. It's a bummer it wasn't able to have the run it deserved, but at least everyone involved can be proud as hell.

*Spoooooooooooon!*

**Edit:** As a side note, lookup the film *An Honest Liar* which he produced about one of my personal heroes -- The Amazing Randi who used his knowledge as a magician to out charlatans and frauds. Fantastic documentary."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"It's hard not to love this show, but we can also objectively see why network executives could have a problem with it as it was definitely some great fringe television. Sad, isn't it?"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Who puts gum on a roof?!?
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,The only thing I liked about Nolan's Batman movies was that the mayor was BatManuel.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,This was such a good show with so much promise.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"One of my favorites. Me and my wife watch it every now and then, I really wish it went on at least 6 more episodes. Patrick Warburton will always be the best Tick to me."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"""No dude, I'm telling you, Falco died! 'Amadeus, Amadeus?' He is a dead person!"""
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I have yet to give the reboot a chance, I‚Äôve mourned the original series for so long."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I loved this show! Fox let a lot of good series die that had so much more potential
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Any show where you can have Patrick warburton verses a toilet for an episode is gold
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"This show had the perfect tone & production design, really felt like a live action comic book/cartoon. Didn‚Äôt really get that from the newer show."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I really loved the cartoon, but was disappointed by the live action show.  Maybe it was just a matter of expectations, because I wasn't expecting it to be a sitcom."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Ah, the casualties of Big Bismuth chum!"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I‚Äôve never seen this show. Between The Tick and the lady on the right, I would‚Äôve SWORN this was the cast of the Big Bang Theory in costumes at first glance. It looked exactly like Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco. Then the guy in between them looks like Johnny Galecki with the glasses on lmao"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"They forgot that the best way to deal with Fox is to do what you want, let them cancel you, get super popular offline, sign a better deal with them, bad mouth them in your first episode back. Rinse and repeat if you're a legend"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Newer Tick was great at least.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I was a huge fan of the animated series and was really looking forward to this version when it premiered back in 2001. I last two episodes before I stopped watching. Other than the casting of Patrick Warburton, ""The Tick"" just fell totally flat for me. It had little of the fun or energy of the animated series. I still don't get what this version of the show was going for."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"From what I remember, the team fucking blew all of their money on mundane shit like entirely cgi'ing out the suit's seams among other things.  I think Fox realized this was going downhill and put a cork in the leak."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Every Sci-Fi show ever made by FOX: join the club...
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Why don't they just revive the animated show? It would be perfect for Adult Swim or a streaming service
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Fox murdered a lot of good shows.  They cancelled family guy and firefly.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,The newer Tick with Serafinowicz was much better. And cooler. Got mad when it got cancelled.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"This is one of the biggest tragedies in tv history. The show was phenomenal, and was only getting better. Amazon screwed us all."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,If they would have done the villians it might have lasted.  I guess they didn't have the money for it.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I loved the Tick cartoon.  Hated this show.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Isn‚Äôt Fox‚Äôs MO to cancel anything that is popular?
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Keep in mind that Fox programming is also a reflection of the political environment and what subtext Fox wants to push.  Bill Clinton wins presidency in 1992 election.  Better make people not trust their government!!  X-Files premieres in September of 1993.  The government is lying to you!!  The government is conspiring with aliens!!  And they ALWAYS make sure to show Bill Clinton's portrait in Skinner's office.  

Bush ""wins"" in 2000.  Time to use any means necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks.  Oh and an added bonus: Jack Baurer would've fixed everything in the first hour if weren't for those pesky regulations and government bureaucracy.  Also, torture is totally cool.

The health care debate roars back to life.  Better start a show showing how the American Healthcare system is the best in the world.  On the show House the best and brightest minds solve medical mysteries, conduct expensive tests at the drop of a hat because every instrument is available all the time with no waiting!  In one hour the patient goes from dying to cured and no mention of the hospital bills.  Oh, except for the **hospital's** bills.  It can't make enough money to stay afloat!  American health care is just *too cheap to make a profit*!  Added bonus: painkillers are an awesome super-pill that let's House save lives!  

Now, I used to watch and enjoy these shows.  But as the FOX mask slipped and the conglomerate became more brazen with pushing ideology I started to notice that it wasn't only Fox News that was doing this.

Edit: corrected a year"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,They have been trying to make that damn show live action since the 90‚Äôs and it doesn‚Äôt work. Go back to animated!
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"It would have been hard to outdo the cartoon when the budget doesnt really constrain creativity in a cartoon.  Maybe drawing something more complex would take a little longer, but not totally impractical to do in live action. It would have been better if they continued the cartoon with these actors doing the voice work."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"But they are really great at spreading misinformation, or is it disinformation, or maybe it‚Äôs just bad information‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say Fox is pure garbage and call it a day."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Who cares about the tick? I just want to see the [flea](https://muchalucha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flea) !
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,What ever happened to the Amazon show? I heard they were doing a season 3 then nothing.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I've enjoyed every iteration of The Tick and look forward to the next series when the copyright is up and someone needs to put out a new show or lose it.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I loved this show at the time! Nestor Carbonell carried it with his Bat Manuel, imo. üòÇ"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I‚Äôd watch the Tick if they had to get mundane office jobs, like ‚Äúthe incredibles‚Äù meets ‚Äúthe office‚Äù but live action. With a few implied superhero action sequences that are met with eye rolls by other office workers who are over all of it."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I thought ""Batmanuel"" was an improvement on Die Fladermaus which is a pretty esoteric joke"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"So they had a ‚Äúkids‚Äù cartoon animated like the comic book that was really good and fun to watch. I remember being a kid during the cartoon show airing and then being a teenager when the live action show was being promoted, if I recall they even had a super bowl ad for the show, the live action show debuted and I lost all interest after the first episode. I was young and just moved on to something else."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I watched cartoon  the tick back in the day ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell you just by looking at this one picture I soundly watch this. Just saying
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Another great show sees an early demise due to people's inability to let the creative juices flow and push a couple envelopes. I enjoyed this show very thoroughly and laughed more while watching it than while watching any other show in probably 5 to 6 years at least.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Still the best version of the Tick.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,SPOON !!!!!!!!!
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs fault
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"This is my favorite version of The Tick and I think about it often, such a great show. Larry Charles + Patrick Warburton is all you need."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I loved this version to me he was the true tick!
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,That Tick costume is almost perfect
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,still wanting that Danger Boat spin-off
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Ah, another treat from the orient! Mmm! A secret message, from my teeth!"
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,[Relevant clip](https://youtu.be/0oMTmtN7lHI)
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I always got the feeling that the people in charge of greenlighting new shows and the people in charge of setting the schedule had VERY different ideas of what kind of network they were running.  It couldn't have just been a regime change, because it happened over and over again for years.

Then it turned into a self-fulfilling cycle.  An interesting new show would be announced and people would get really excited until they realized it was on Fox and decided not to watch it because it would just get canceled halfway through the first season. And then it would get canceled halfway through the first season, citing low viewership."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I spoke with Nestor Carbonel (Batmanuel) right after the cancellation, and he said that the Tick was killed by a regime change at Fox. The leadership during the development and pilot phase had been incredibly supportive, and then there was an executive shuffle and the new programming head killed everything that his predecessor had developed. He said the show had been incredibly fun to shoot, and really found it's rhythm before the end."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,I feel like once X-Files took off they decided that scifi stuff would be their niche. So they just kept greenlighting high concept scifi shows hoping another would take off.  If it wasn't the next big international hit by the end of the season it was canned. And nothing really made it.
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"There's also a huge number of shows that get greenlit, have one season, and are totally forgotten by everyone. I mean, at one point they made That 80s Show and a show about the Geico Cavemen. 

Tosh.0 did it as a weekly gag (""we'll be back with more [cancelled show here]""), and finally ran out of cancelled Comedy Central shows near the end of their run."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Greg the Bunny was the SHIT! I still laugh at many of the episodes. Favorite is still the pot brownie one
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Yeah, Fox is famous for green lighting, then destroying a lot of shows with great concepts. Poor marketing, constant time slot changes, direct meddling. It almost has to be a Murdoch considering how long it has been going on."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I heard the original draft for that list that Peter goes through was much longer but they had to cut it, like, in half for time. I think it's mentioned in the DVD commentary."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"One thing that is different with Fox is they have less prime time programming than other broadcast channels. The local news starts earlier on Fox. This came about when Fox was just starting out and it incentivized stations to broadcast the new channel (nationwide programming is less profitable than local programming). They have never changed course on this as it would be very unpopular with the affiliates even though they are one of the big channels now. 

So with less prime time slots, there‚Äôs less room for error and less room to give a show multiple seasons time to grow and gain an audience.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, still a lot of mismanagement and opportunities (and not just fox) but I would guess Fox is faster to make a change because of fewer prime time slots."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"The people green lighting the shows aren't the same people scheduling the shows, so unfortunately that often plays a part of it."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Either Fox‚Äôs process was broken, or it was hellish by design.  It‚Äôs like big corporate sales. The sale rep gets you in the door and then hands off to the rest of the company who finds out how shitty and/or complex a sale it was.

Fox was an upstart in the late 80s and 90s and I‚Äôm sure they had a group greenlighting everything and then after that it was just a meat grinder to find out if anything would stick. Even then, their incessant meddling in schedules and constantly changing time slots was incomprehensible but could be just to see if a screenwriter could take the abuse. Honestly I think the Fox TV organization is just like the Fox News corporation; basically just dis functionally functional, filled with whack jobs and egos who somehow make the company profit.

Telling that the entire network is now sold off to Disney minus the two areas that still make Rupert money."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"The thing is that *all* networks do this, not just Fox. 

It's just that Fox was more willing to take bigger risks, so when they cancel it gets more of a reaction.

The reality is all these ""interesting, unusual, atypical"" shows tend to be *a lot* more expensive to produce than your standard reality show or sitcom, so the expectation for viewership is higher...which means the chance of it getting cancelled is *also* higher since that threshold is different."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,Ah Greg the Bunny came to mind before I even finished reading this post lol
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Shame we'll never get those shows and casts back. And for all those still hoping...

The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"Fox has always been about giving people a chance but refusing to pay for it. Thats why they were always successful because bombs dont hurt them and hits do way better. Its good business but it also leads to lots of bad decisions that affected entertainment like Family Guy, Firefly, Futurama, Brooklyn 99, Arrested Development, and many more critical darlings."
The Helpful Fox Senko-san,They always wanted to play it safe.  In order to get Logan made Hugh Jackman had to take an enormous pay cut.  They simply didn't believe an R-rated superhero film would work.

The Helpful Fox Senko-san,"I have been a willing participant in every televised version of this show. Each is it‚Äôs own valid, very well done creation with a fantastic ensemble cast.
Nestor Carbonel as Batmanuel is still the best character variation in any of them, with some of the best lines bar none.
And while I loved Jackie Earle Haley‚Äôs performance as a slightly more fleshed-out Terror (the drums!) Armin Shimerman‚Äôs performance and delivery was also amazing in the 2001 show.
‚Äú I‚Äôm gonna fold ya into my wallet and spend ya on a whore!‚Äù"
Sarazanmai,Ikuhara is insane. I love that man
Sarazanmai,I feel like that title belongs to FLCL
Sarazanmai,Bit early in its run to say this.
Sarazanmai,furi...... kuri......?
Sarazanmai,"Dude this way weirder than FLCL. Have you seen this show? 

https://youtu.be/X84o2BaXYjg"
Sarazanmai,*laughs in [Dead Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBd7A_IvgU)*
Sarazanmai,fleeklee!
Sarazanmai,FLCL has more weird in it's pinky than that whole show.  That was just regular anime levels of weird.
No Good Nick,I‚Äôve never even heard of this.
No Good Nick,I guess he was No Good.
No Good Nick,"I thought this show was pretty interesting. It starts off rough, but the characters grow into themselves. I actually liked part 2. And the show handled the son's coming out moment very well."
No Good Nick,"I actually really liked it. Quick to watch since no episodes were more than a half hour, and you don't see too many family friendly mystery/comedy/drama series.  I'm glad the finale answered most of the season's questions so it ended pretty great."
No Good Nick,"The show was a very Christian-focused show and not very popular with audiences. Nothing of value was lost.

I could only make it one and a half episodes before I turned off this drek."
No Good Nick,"This show was weird. It had a more serious, mature tone but the jokes were sitcom Nickelodeon style jokes so the audience was never clear. I watched a few episodes and it never really meshed."
No Good Nick,I can't watch shows with laugh tracks/prompted audiences. I wish they would leave this behind.
No Good Nick,"Bummer, I loved her in Sabrina in the '90s. Maybe now she can guest on the reboot?"
No Good Nick,"I watched it last month and it was such an odd show. It was made in the style of a Disney Channel tween sitcom with the same kind of jokes, goofy trope characters, unrealistic storylines, and the whole ‚Äúthe main character is a teen living a double life‚Äù premise, but it also had some mature themes and pretty dark moments. It was interesting to watch but I have no idea who the target audience was supposed to be so I‚Äôm not really surprised it got cancelled."
No Good Nick,"Netflix really needs to focus on quality not quantity. 

See: Amazon"
No Good Nick,what else is new at netflix
No Good Nick,I liked it.
No Good Nick,So this sounds like Sneaky Pete but for kids based on the one sentence summary on google
No Good Nick,And here we see netflix being no better than traditional television.
No Good Nick,I have given up trying new shows on Netflix. I wait until there are at least 3 seasons to give it a try.
No Good Nick,SOP for Netflix
No Good Nick,"I almost started to watch this show. Oh well, on to the next one."
No Good Nick,[deleted]
No Good Nick,"Same, this one wasn't on my radar at all."
No Good Nick,She
No Good Nick,Its a girl
No Good Nick,Uhh it wasn't THAT Christian focused.. I mean the son was gay
No Good Nick,You only watched one and a half episodes yet you already concluded that it‚Äôs a Christian focused show....wtf?
No Good Nick,"It's a style of comedy. Kind of a call and response with the canned laughter being the response. They design it from the ground up like this. I don't care for it, but there are a lot of people who only find this style funny. If they took out the laugh track it wouldn't work which is proven with all of those youtube videos where someone stripped out the laugh track from Friends episodes or The Big Bang Theory. Even without the long pauses for laughter those jokes really wouldn't work otherwise."
No Good Nick,She needs to get Clarisa Explains It All rebooted.  This time see plays the mom
No Good Nick,[removed]
No Good Nick,"Don‚Äôt, Santa Clarita diet got 3 seasons and it ended on a huge cliffhanger and got cancelled anyway....bye Netflix, hello Disney+!"
No Good Nick,Cancelling shows that aren't getting viewers? Seems SOP for most networks.
No Good Nick,was targeted to children thats why. wasn't bad but for adults very predictable
No Good Nick,"It wasn‚Äôt Christian at all, really. Family-friendly ‚â† Christian"
No Good Nick,Huh? When did he come out? I watched about half of it and didn‚Äôt remember anything about him being gay.
No Good Nick,I think I heard that was happening actually
No Good Nick,Because Disney+ won't cancel any shows. Ever.
No Good Nick,"But the thing is the Focus On The Family organization is basically the American Taliban so anything ""family friendly"" gets the side eye."
No Good Nick,"Towards the end, Even had a kiss with a male classmate"
No Good Nick,And like Disney+ would have totally greenlit a show like that to begin with and would have given the show 3 seasons.
No Good Nick,"> basically the American Taliban

Except for, you know, the bombings, executions, and other killings.  

Focus on the Family may be ridiculous,  but when you resort to hyperbole by comparing them to a terrorist group with a large body count, all you do is ultimately paint them in a more sympathetic light for people who *didn't* know about them and are generally put off by bullshit."
No Good Nick,Wow glad they handled it well. I just drifted away from the show during the gap and I‚Äôm leaving Netflix for Disney+ so other content was a priority. Maybe I will try to watch the rest before Disney+ launches...
No Good Nick,Damn what‚Äôs that say about you for watching this dumpster fire long enough to find out
No Good Nick,"The ""coming out"" scene was pretty funny too 

https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1159158049795219456?lang=en"
No Good Nick,">I‚Äôm leaving Netflix for Disney+

WHHHYYYYYYY?!?"
No Good Nick,that he/she likes a show that you don‚Äôt. What does it say about you being an asshole just because of a tv show lmaooo.
No Good Nick,"That was great, thank you for sharing that"
No Good Nick,I guess that person didn't hear that Disney+ already cancelled their new Muppets show that was planned?
No Good Nick,"It fits me and my family better than Netflix. I hate that Netflix drops the shows all at once so we just end up not really using it much. We mainly watch friends/office and random kids shows. Disney will have great kids programs and friends/office is on tv enough that we will be fine. 

If Netflix went to a weekly model and normal seasons of programs I would stick around. This drop the whole thing at once just doesn‚Äôt work for how I enjoy content. I like watching tv and talking with folks. I can do weekly drops bc I watch 1 episode a week I don‚Äôt want to watch it all over a day or 2. I enjoy watching a show over 3 months."
No Good Nick,... I didn't know that was supposed to happen and now I'm instantly mourning it.
No Good Nick,That‚Äôs odd.
No Good Nick,"There were two Muppets shows. First one was in development, the creators had creative differences, were offered to run the show different, left.

Second one is still going on.

Edit: Why are you booing me? I'm right!

https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-muppets-disney-plus-short-form-series-1203312841/

Muppets Live Another Day was cancelled. Muppets shortform is still going on"
No Good Nick,[deleted]
No Good Nick,What‚Äôs odd?
No Good Nick,What‚Äôs an odd reason?
No Good Nick,"Meh. I can see where he is coming from. Netflix drops maybe 1 show and 1 movie i find interesting every month, sometimes only every second month,  and after binging it there isn't really much for me on Netflix and I just or end up not using the service."
No Good Nick,That you'd stick around if it released episodes weekly.
No Good Nick,So you'd rather they string you along to bleed the most money out of you rather than just unsubbing when you don't have anything to watch?
No Good Nick,"I would watch the show if it‚Äôs released weekly. I don‚Äôt watch any Netflix show bc it‚Äôs dropped as a group. I don‚Äôt enjoy watch tv without having a group to talk about it with and I enjoy watching a single episode and moving to something different. 

Right now stranger things drops on Netflix and lots of people sit down and watch the whole thing in days if not hours. No one is sitting around lunch talking about stranger things and theory. I don‚Äôt like watching tv completely alone. 

I like watching a show weekly and listening to a podcast, talking at work, talking on reddit. So to me weekly drops is better and Netflix doesn‚Äôt have any good content. It gets used for old episodes of stuff and sometimes a movie. I haven‚Äôt watched any of the shows bc their is so much better content out to watch. 

Like I watch all the DC CW shows and non of the marvel shows. I hate all the DC movies and have skipped most of them but I watch every marvel movie. The weekly drop with conversation is what I enjoy more than pure content. Disney should have good content and it‚Äôs a weekly drop which means it much more likely for me to watch. 

I also didn‚Äôt say Netflix was dead or Disney+ will kill it. I see Netflix as something you get 1 or 2 months a year with Disney+ something you have for the year. You get Netflix when you are sick or Christmas break so you can veg out and you have Disney+ as your monthly service. I also know lots of folks that like the binge model it just doesn‚Äôt work for me."
No Good Nick,"I do enjoy the weekly format more for some shows, yes."
No Good Nick,[deleted]
No Good Nick,"I think it‚Äôs odd to watch tv alone and binge it. Just saying odd doesn‚Äôt add anything to the conversation and doesn‚Äôt make a point. 

So can I assume you sit around alone and just watch tv? You don‚Äôt have friends that you enjoy talking to and you just sit in the dark? That‚Äôs concerning man."
No Good Nick,[deleted]
No Good Nick,"Now that‚Äôs a reply we can discuss. It‚Äôs has more than just calling me odd. 

I enjoy shows but part of that enjoyment is talking over the show for me. I like thinking over the show and trying to figure out where it‚Äôs going. I enjoy talking with friends about where it could go. I like reading blogs about it. For me it‚Äôs not just the show it‚Äôs picking a few shows to get into. The binge model is just about getting as much content into my blood stream as I can in a single sitting. 

Now the binge model did help get seasons shorter and tighter but streaming services are starting to do the shorter season weekly so that‚Äôs a win. I like the 8ish episodes and watch it over 8weeks. Have different stuff starting every few weeks so something new is rolling in as something is ending. I watch stuff that isn‚Äôt conversation worthy also but it‚Äôs mainly on while I‚Äôm working or just getting ready for bed so that stuff is kinda randomly picked and it‚Äôs mostly stuff that the wife and I both enjoy. It also mostly happens to be non-serial shows. 

I also don‚Äôt view tv as a non-social activity. It can be social if you discuss it and enjoy it with folks. What do you view as a social activity with friends that‚Äôs better than chilling and talking about this weeks episode of Ballers, Silicon Valley, Arrow etc? 

I don‚Äôt try to stay culturally relevant on my shows. Lots of shows that are popular I dislike. I couldn‚Äôt get past the first episode of breaking bad, didn‚Äôt watch past the first season of game of thrones. I also don‚Äôt watch any of the Netflix shows that people consider great like season 2+ of Stranger things or well any show. I only watched Stranger Things bc a group of us watched it weekly together over lunch at work. 

I also didn‚Äôt call you friendless it was an illustration that you weren‚Äôt adding anything expect odd. With that limited info I could make assumptions. I‚Äôm sorry if you were offended."
No Good Nick,"I think the easiest way to look at why a weekly drop is better. 

1.	It can add a layer of enjoyment for some folks
2.	doesn‚Äôt hurt the binge watchers
3.	increases water cooler talk about a show which should increase viewership

If you don‚Äôt want the layer of conversation than weekly doesn‚Äôt do anything but it also doesn‚Äôt take away anything. You can wait till the season end and watch it. A mass drop of a show takes away from the experience for me and I‚Äôm not alone in my feelings that TV show be a weekly drop."
No Good Nick,">Hart and Astin play Liz and Ed, a hyper-competitive career mom and lovable but dorky ‚Äúfun dad,‚Äù respectively, who unwittingly welcome 13-year-old Nick (short for Nicole) into their family of four before realizing she is a street-smart con artist with a secret agenda.

This sounds like a pureflix series, not a netflix series."
No Good Nick,Hard no.
No Good Nick,I thought Sam married the blonde girl from the shire?
No Good Nick,Now that she's at Netflix I wonder if she'd cameo on Sabrina ever or if it's too Satanic for her 
No Good Nick,Not looking forward to this one. 
No Good Nick,"Yuck, she can fuck off.

Also; Sean, no! You're too good for this!"
No Good Nick,"Jeez, was Sean Astin really typecast *that* much after Lord of the Rings that this was what his career has come to?"
No Good Nick,"Multi-cam doesn‚Äôt feel right on Netflix. I don‚Äôt know why, they just feel strange on there."
No Good Nick,"Anything with Melissa Joan Hart I'll at least give a chance. But this sounds really lame. I don't know why she doesn't try for more interesting shows/acting roles. She's got the charisma and has always had the potential, yet she plays it safe all the time. "
No Good Nick,I see what they did there...
No Good Nick,"Man, I love MJH, but why oh why do all these multi-cam sitcoms still exist in a post-Scrubs and The Office world?"
No Good Nick,Why couldn‚Äôt they just put them in Sabrina???
No Good Nick,"""netflix turned into a porn site so gradually we hardly even noticed""

also i hate that they dropped the R, when this was picked up the full title was ""No Good Nick R."" apparently Astin's character was also supposed to be named Nick or something so they had to differentiate them with the hard-R.  

Edit: i just assumed pureflix was a pornsite so sorry for the simpsons reference"
No Good Nick,The only bit of Fuller House I've seen was when they did jokes about Stephanie's big boobs being on display so I doubt this one will be too wholesome. They obviously want to appeal to dumb 30 somethings with nostalgia from their youth so they'll watch along with their dumb kids.
No Good Nick,Goonies never die.
No Good Nick,I think she likes a paycheck.
No Good Nick,"Looking forward to not seeing you in these threads.

But I actually can't, won't be here either."
No Good Nick,"I'm trying to remember what he did between Goonies and Lord of the Rings: only Rudy and Encino Man come up. Was he in that Kirk Cameron body-switching thing?
"
No Good Nick,"Nothing wrong with nulti cam

Laugh track can be a little annoying though"
No Good Nick,I thought it was just no one was willing to cast her. I think she even tried to raise kickstarter money just so she could cast herself in a romantic comedy. 
No Good Nick,"I think she's an ultra-Christian (kinda like Kirk Cameron, but not as extreme with it), that might explain it.  "
No Good Nick,What else would you recommend of hers besides Sabrina the teenage witch? I think that's the only show I've seen her in.
No Good Nick,"Fuller House can be surprisingly raunchy at times. And Netflix's other multi-cam sitcom, One Day at a Time, isn't some dumb ""pure for the whole family"" show either. I mean so far Netflix is 2/2 for me in terms of multi-cam sitcoms that are enjoyable to watch when you aren't in the mood for Bojack Horseman, I won't dismiss this show too easily."
No Good Nick,"Like Father Like Son, he played Trigger.  "
No Good Nick,"She did a show called Melissa and Joey, but it is a very typical family sitcom, nothing really special. The only difference being that the male (doofus, breadwinner), and female (competent, childcarer) typical of family sitcoms is reversed. "
No Good Nick,Drive me crazy was a great 90s movie she starred in with Adrien Grenier. I haven‚Äôt seen it in about 15 years though so I‚Äôm not sure how it held up.
No Good Nick,"I guess you haven‚Äôt seen Disjointed

*shudders*"
No Good Nick,I just watched it all and thought it was great.
No Good Nick,"Wow, this trailer was bad. "
No Good Nick,"""When a child doesn't feel the warmth of the community, he will burn it down to feel the warmth from the flames.""  

That's not going to happen in this show since it is a family show.  There's a chance someone will re-edit this trailer to make it seem dark.  "
No Good Nick,"""... excuse me? this show wasn't aimed at MY demographic, how dare you post it here. i don't care if it's television related. downvoted."""
No Good Nick,"I'm interested to see everyone's opinions on the show in this thread, but the phrase ""X has no right to be this good"" has really been used so much it's lost all meaning."
No Good Nick,"Swede here - I watched the show in one sitting, I enjoyed it immensly. But then again, Spotify being swedish might have contributed to that (hey, where‚Äôs the IKEA-founding show?). I thought most of the acting was really good, some of it bad (didn‚Äôt like the actress playing Petra Hansson‚Äôs preformance). But an interesting way to tell the story with one episode from each of the players; the founder, the investor, the industry, the artists etc."
No Good Nick,Ugh why do we need all these tech co founding series?
No Good Nick,Ok but Spotify still doesn‚Äôt let me reset my algorithm >:(
No Good Nick,Something that really pissed me off about the show was Daniel keeps pitching it as a ‚Äúfree streaming service‚Äù and since everyone says no to the ‚Äúfree‚Äù he goes on to say ‚Äúwe have a business plan‚Äù and when they say no he goes back and is like ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt understand artists get paid‚Äù like yeah because you didn‚Äôt tell them? Why isn‚Äôt he leading with that?
No Good Nick,Sounds like a shill article made by the people who made the show
No Good Nick,Besides the last episode it was pretty good.
No Good Nick,"Am I the only person that thought the argument in the final episode by ‚ÄúBobbi T‚Äù was extremely stupid. Record companies have far more exploitative contracts and the what Spotify does is create equity per view for each artist. The argument that the average artist makes 12$, I think is quite generous. YouTube definitely does not pay nearly as much and that content is easier to advertise on, as it is video. The found the entire thing incredibly frustrating, as it was not a cohesive argument at all. Let me know if you agree or disagree, I‚Äôd be interested in your opinions."

Midnight Occult Civil Servants,Maybe read the article.

Special,Is she the one Conan bought an American Girl doll for?
Special,"I had never heard of her prior to her most recent special, but she's quickly become a favorite for me. Very funny, looking forward to more."
Special,Just saw her live on her new tour recently and she brought her best material yet. I‚Äôm really happy for her
Special,"Glad to hear this news. Her specials have been excellent and I'm looking forward to seeing more of Tomlinson's perspective. She had an interesting platform of rationalization toward the death of her mother in her last special, and while that can be seen as heavy material, I think she navigated the topic well. 

If you're interested in her work, Neal Brennan has a podcast called Blocks where he interviews comedians about their mental health/past trauma/etc and it's been fascinating to see this type of perspective discussed by comics. [Here is the episode with Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqcDijfV5E)."
Special,"That's good news, I really like her stand up"
Special,Glad she's blowing up. Even more glad I saw her live a couple years ago since I'll never be able to afford it again lol.
Special,"luckily she had so many fucked up relationships that she can probably write 100 specials without running out of material 

(it‚Äòs a joke, taylor i love you :) )"
Special,"Taylor Tomlinson deserves this success.  She‚Äôs a top tier comedian who never disappoints.  Really tight original material, great technique, makes it look effortless.  Love seeing deserving people get success. 

I don‚Äôt want to hear any bullshit about best woman comics.  She‚Äôs just one of the best comics working."
Special,"I hope Netflix or some other studio gives her the chance to lead a comedy movie with a decent budget. I know we don‚Äôt really make those anymore, but she honestly has the charisma to be a movie star for a while."
Special,"I've seen some of her clips, and she is hilarious. 

That being said, I cant see her without assuming she is Peyton List from Cobrai Kai.  It seems like a big resemblance."
Special,"Love Taylor, she's easily the funniest standup I've seen in years."
Special,"*""I want to be the art school rejection letter that turns you into Hitler""* is one of the greatest lines in all of comedy history.  Haven't seen bad Taylor yet."
Special,"I think Tomlinson has the potential to be one of the greats. She clearly has a lot of discipline, in addition to a very unique voice. 

I know she is considered a young comedian but she's been in the business for like 15 years at this point, I think she started at a very young age just like Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock."
Special,Look at you!
Special,"Easily the funniest female comedian currently. She‚Äôs also only 29, and I think her material will improve by the time she hits 40 and I already love her voice and presence. She‚Äôs capable of those jokes that make you question your life. And imo doesn‚Äôt rely on crudeness like other female comics. Hope she‚Äôll inspire a generation of future female comics"
Special,I don‚Äôt even particularly like stand-up but she never misses.
Special,I'm so excited to see her live next month! Amazing comedian
Special,It‚Äôs great to see comedians actually talking about Mental Health like it‚Äôs a normal thing (as well as all of her other content). She‚Äôs hilarious
Special,The youtube algorithm REALLY wants me to check her out.
Special,"missed one of her live shows in the bay area, hope she comes down again she's great"
Special,"Look at you!

Happy for her, she's hilarious. Her, Nikki Glazer, and Iliza Schlesinger are some of my favorites lately and they've been crushing it."
Special,She‚Äôs funny. I liked her previous special.
Special,"She's hilarious. Hands down my favorite stand-up comic right now. She's great to follow on TikTok as well. She's killing it, but she's not quite so big (yet) that you get the sense her social media is just managed by a marketing team somewhere."
Special,"She's amazing! I've watched her 'Look at you' special 3 times now. She talks about mental illness in such a delicate yet funny manner, she never disappoints!!"
Special,I just saw her on her tour last weekend and she was great!! So excited for her come up.
Special,Awesome.  She‚Äôs super funny and likable.  Looking forward to more from her.
Special,Sweet! Loved her specials. Appreciate anyone who talk about mental health and appreciate them even more when they can make you laugh with them about it too.
Special,Hells yes.  I love her so much.  My husband and I went to see her live last month. Haha
Special,"Quarter life crisis, geez to be so young again."
Special,"Good for her.
I‚Äôm not the biggest fan, but she‚Äôs definitely got the raw skills.

Excited to see her skills progress through future specials.  With some more exp, she‚Äôs gonna be killer."
Special,I started watching her Netflix stand up specials during the COVID shut down and she quickly turned into my favorite comedian. She‚Äôs hilarious and I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs getting the recognition she deserves.
Special,Cool. I enjoy her performances.
Special,I really enjoy her specials. Super glad to hear this
Special,"itt: more astroturfing by netflix. so many obvious short posts ""never/recently/always heard about [seo keyword] but i love [seo keyword]!"""
Special,Glad to see her getting the success and recognition she deserves. She's an incredibly talented comedian.
Special,She is sooo approachable
Special,"I adore her, so happy for her success."
Special,"That's cool that she's doing 2 more specials for Netflix, Taylor's really funny, and her last special was pretty good."
Special,She is very funny. Good for her.
Special,Listened to her podcast about living in LA and NYC while I drove across the country. She just has good energy.
Special,"She is by far one of my least favorite comedians.

‚Ä¶

No, I mean my most favorite comedians, the doorbell clip made me laugh so much I snorted beer out of my nose. Which is both disgusting and a badge of success for a comedian."
Special,She was very funny in her last special
Special,She‚Äôs got a whole bit about not being a hot girl. I think we can all agree she‚Äôs definitely a hot a girl.
Special,"Love her specials, I always wanted to catch her live but the timing just hasn't worked out.  Very happy for her!"
Special,Is she actually funny or just 'netflix' funny?
Special,Pass
Special,Love her comedy. She's hot too lol
Special,"she‚Äôs a very good comedian, nice to hear she has ongoing success

she‚Äôs also hot af‚Ä¶ üòÖ"
Special,Who
Special,good she‚Äôs fucking hilarious and that‚Äôs less we have to suffer about chappelle
Special,"My wife turned me on to her.  She is extremely funny. she is a kind of tour de force in that she can do it all... One liners, physical comedy, etc, all while tying it together into a theme."
Special,Who
Special,Cant escape her on youtube recommendations. She kinda funny tho
Special,"I took a first date to see her at a small comedy club several years ago, before she blew up. Didn‚Äôt know who she was. I was just trying to show the girl I could appreciate female comedians. Anyways, that‚Äôs still one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever been to. Laughed so hard my throat hurt. I knew she was gonna explode after that, so seeing it happen just makes me happy."
Special,"Good comedian, like all her shows but the last one was more an open conversation with her mental illness rather than her regular stuff.

It's like Chappelle. Great comedian, but now he's mostly doing commentary on current social climate. Feels like a Ted talk with comedy mixed in.

I'll definitely keep watching Taylor's stuff. She has what it takes to be even greater, I like her style."
Special,I love her
Special,Let me take a wild guess. She's gonna talk about an ex boyfriend...
Special,She‚Äôs hot AF
Special,I like her.  Cute and funny.  I seem to remember Conan O‚ÄôBrien getting her an American Doll that she had wanted when she was younger.
Special,I like her
Special,She is super funny and I hope to be able to see a show in the future
Special,Good. She is hilarious. Can't wait
Special,Who?
Special,"She is great!! 

Looking forward to more content..."
Special,"Yes, please‚Ä¶"
Special,"She toured with Conan O'Brien a few years ago, and they did a terrific segment in which [he made her choose between two American Girl dolls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMXYbvCxWlE)"
Special,"I shouldn‚Äôt be her demo, but she‚Äôs great. The way she sells her material and kid of now relatable she is somehow works really well. She seems likes she‚Äôs having fun too."
Special,"The body language, and the ""Translation for guys"" is hilarious."
Special,"People have mentioned the American Girl remote she did with Conan, but she also did a great podcast episode with him too. Highly recommend, here's a great clip from it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FxYggwYtmKk"
Special,"This is fantastic news, she‚Äôs easily one of my favorite comedians right now. Her timing/delivery is absolutely amazing."
Special,"Good, she deserves it.  She's hilarious and doesn't use the same old shit that many other female comedians regurgitate."
Special,I really enjoyed both of her specials so far. She's really on the way up to being one of the greats IMO.
Special,Yes!! She‚Äôs so good man
Special,She‚Äôs a funny lady. Good for her.
Special,"Everyone here apparently knows her from Netflix. 

I know her from the show ""What Just Happened?!?"", a post-show reaction talk show for a show that didn't exist. I really enjoyed it for what it was. Not going to blow anyone's minds or be a cult classic, but in a world of Prestige Dramas and not much else I really appreciated it. Plus - she's great!"
Special,Yay she‚Äôs awesome
Special,"Never heard of her, but ill give her a shot"
Special,Am I thinking of someone else? I thought all her material was about sex‚Ä¶
Special,"She is great, but also the YouTube algorithm is pushing her clips hard to me."
Special,Wow she sucks
Special,Now if only she was funny
Special,Podcasts killed standup. I loathe all of them now.
Special,I really enjoyed her first two
Special,Great for her definitely well deserved she's hilarious. This little bit is what got me hooked. Simple but had me cracking up https://youtu.be/VLwl0yqbvso
Special,She‚Äôs funny
Special,She‚Äôs amazing!
Special,"‚ÄòLook at you‚Äô was great, next one not as good, think it‚Äôs gonna be a steep decline from here. But she gonna be RICH!!! Look at Her!!!"
Special,She is very funny AND very sexy. I do not mind that combo I will have you know....
Special,"Okay, who is that?"
Special,"Never been a fan but understand she‚Äôs not for me, I seek authentic and she‚Äôs a Christian comic who gargled her way into Rogan‚Äôs gang of comedy. People will get sick of her soon enough."
Special,Her bit on needing floaties in the pool is perfect
Special, ITT: ASTROTURF REEEEE
Special,"I saw her perform a number of times at the Comedy Cellar a couple years before she took off on YouTube. She has grown and come a very long way in a relatively short amount of time. 

Remembering her get no reaction at all back then, to now killing it with jokes that have a similar premise (but are MUCH funnier) makes me happy. It shows how hard she‚Äôs worked, and that‚Äôs awesome to see."
Special,"She's a good comic but from her last special, I sense she's running out of materials."
Special,Burnt Chrysler's podcast introduced me to Taylor Tomlinson when he mentioned how funny she was several years ago when she was opening for him. Checked out her material on YouTube and she's been one of my favorite comics ever since.
Special,She‚Äôs really good on tiktok/shorts
Special,Does she still totally straight edge (no alcohol or drugs)?
Special,I remember seeing her bits back in the day on Just for Laughs (Steve Hofsteder show).
Special,tf is she?
Special,More elder millennial neurotic neurodivergent processing of trauma through comedy? Yes please!
Huge in France,I had to Google to figure out that huge in France is the name of the show....
Huge in France,I think partly its because Gad Elmaleh is not very well liked as a comedian.
Huge in France,"I‚Äôve just started watching Huge in France, and I like it so far, but the way Luke and his mom are portrayed, wow. I hope successful people in LA aren‚Äôt that shallow and narcissistic."
Huge in France,"So good. One of the best comedic concepts of all time. He truly isn‚Äôt very funny as a comedian, but it‚Äôs the perfect setup for the show. He plays the straight man, though he is the comedian (similar to Seinfeld). It was so funny I watched it all in one sitting. The weight of the drama got very real in Jason‚Äôs character.. and don‚Äôt get me started on the Stamos acting appearance. Simply UNREAL."
Huge in France,"I like Erinn Hayes though I've never heard of this show. 

Looks like Chris D'Elia is in it? Maybe why it hasn't been advertised very much"
Huge in France,"""Nobody"" is talking about this show here because the sub is predominately American, and we have no idea about a no name show in France."
Huge in France,"We recently noticed it on Netflix and watched it over a few days.

It was funny at first, but as the show went on, we became more and more annoyed at most of the characters."
Huge in France,Has anyone heard about season 2 of the show? The internet says it was supposed to come out in April of 2021 but that is already past and I can't find any update on it.
Huge in France,"same, that's a pretty bad name marketing wise."
Huge in France,"> Gad Elmaleh is not very well liked as a comedian

in general"
Huge in France,Most are. Arrogance and shallowness isn‚Äôt a rare commodity in L.A.
Huge in France,Show aired way before all the allegations against D‚ÄôElia. And he isn‚Äôt exactly central to the plot
Huge in France,its an American show on netflix lol. Thats the whole point. the guys huge in France and comes to America and expects everyone to know who he is.
Huge in France,Please make an effort to sound less stereotypically American.  You're embarrassing the rest of us.
Huge in France,It hasn‚Äôt been renewed. Not officially cancelled. Not sure where you saw anything else.
Huge in France,"ah fair enough, yeah i didn't do much research there just had a glance at wiki cus I like Erinn Hayes and hadn't heard of this show

p.s - great username"
Huge in France,France
Huge in France,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
Huge in France,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
Huge in France,Anime Watchers: What gap??
Huge in France,"Absolutely love this show, it‚Äôs just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
Huge in France,Undone was the shit
Huge in France,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
Huge in France,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
Huge in France,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
Huge in France,"It‚Äôs ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be ‚Äúadult‚Äù with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
Huge in France,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
Huge in France,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
Huge in France,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
Huge in France,"Easily one of the best animated shows I‚Äôve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It‚Äôs amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
Huge in France,Huge gap??
Huge in France,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
Huge in France,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
Huge in France,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
Huge in France,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
Huge in France,"It is‚Ä¶ okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn‚Äôt call it bad, but I really can‚Äôt suggest it to anyone who isn‚Äôt a fan of the stream."
Huge in France,This show is so amazing
Huge in France,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are üî•üî•üî•
Huge in France,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
Huge in France,What gap ?
Huge in France,So many better shows than vox.
Huge in France,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
Huge in France,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
Huge in France,Second season is even better than the first one.
Huge in France,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

Huge in France,"It‚Äôs genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn‚Äôt care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2‚Äôs humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It‚Äôs definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I‚Äôd easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
Huge in France,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
Huge in France,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
Huge in France,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
Huge in France,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
Huge in France,"I‚Äôm really enjoying Vox Machina, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúfilling a huge gap‚Äù when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn‚Äôt shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It‚Äôs either comedy or fantasy action, that‚Äôs it."
Huge in France,Best show of the year so far
Huge in France,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
Huge in France,"To it‚Äôs credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk‚Ä¶ not this."
Huge in France,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
Huge in France,Arcane is amazing.
Huge in France,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
Huge in France,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

Huge in France,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
Huge in France,What‚Äôs the show about?
Huge in France,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn‚Äôt just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
Huge in France,Primal was fucking great too
Huge in France,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
Huge in France,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
Huge in France,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it‚Äôs platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
Huge in France,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
Huge in France,[deleted]
Huge in France,"They didn‚Äôt pay for an article, fuck em."
Huge in France,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
Huge in France,RIP Pantheon.
Huge in France,Arcane?
Huge in France,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
Huge in France,Don‚Äôt forget King of the Hill
Huge in France,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
Huge in France,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
Huge in France,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
Huge in France,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
Huge in France,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
Huge in France,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
Huge in France,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
Huge in France,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are ‚Äúhundred year old demons‚Äù or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end ‚Äúbut it was a boy in a girls body.‚Äù Fucking pervs."
Huge in France,Shows that don‚Äôt have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show‚Äôs total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
Huge in France,Cartoons
Huge in France,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
Huge in France,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
Huge in France,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge‚Ä¶"
Huge in France,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
Huge in France,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
Huge in France,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren‚Äôt corpo shills telling them, ‚Äúno, we can‚Äôt have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.‚Äù They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
Huge in France,"See I‚Äôve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that‚Äôs exactly what it delivered."
Huge in France,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero‚Äôs moving through still shots? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
Huge in France,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
Huge in France,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
Huge in France,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
Mighty Little Bheem,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Mighty Little Bheem,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Mighty Little Bheem,This was a great read.
Mighty Little Bheem,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Mighty Little Bheem,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Mighty Little Bheem,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Mighty Little Bheem,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Mighty Little Bheem,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Mighty Little Bheem,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Mighty Little Bheem,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Mighty Little Bheem,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Mighty Little Bheem,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Mighty Little Bheem,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Mighty Little Bheem,Delta state was the shit!
Mighty Little Bheem,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Mighty Little Bheem,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Mighty Little Bheem,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Mighty Little Bheem,It was on both actually
Mighty Little Bheem,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might‚Äôve been YTV
Mighty Little Bheem,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Mighty Little Bheem,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Mighty Little Bheem,"I'm so glad shows are resuming production!

  
SPN wraps for good next week, though, which makes me a little sad."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I did see filming happening downtown Vancouver the first week of August, on the steps of the Art Gallery. I wondered what that was..."
Mighty Little Bheem,"In a perfect world, Aaron Sorkin would do a Star Trek show about Federation politics.  Literally a Star Trek: West Wing show."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Ages ago I watched a tv show called The Bermuda Triangle.  The premise was simple.  A group of passengers on a boat get lost in the Bermuda Triangle and every week end up in some weird alternate universe.  This was late 1970s - early 1980's so the special effects weren't great and I'm sure the budget was pretty limited.  I think with today's budget and technology you could make an excellent series with that premise. I think rather than week by week, I would keep each season in an alternate universe for the sake of telling a more interesting and developed story. 

Second thoughts:  Watching The Great has me thinking there are a lot of historical dramas and comedies we could be exploring - lost Roman legions wandering through Spain or Britannia, Vikings in the New World or some Native American centered stories."
Mighty Little Bheem,I'd like to see a story about a boy and his dog who roam through the countryside doing good deeds and drinking beer.
Mighty Little Bheem,"More portal fantasy type shows, or shows where characters are suddenly in a strange situation and cut off from others. Kinda like alice in borderland, the society, under the dome, and Gone by Michael Grant. I love shit like that"
Mighty Little Bheem,"Modern day Cassandra (prophet in The Iliad who nobody believes.) Could go a lot of directions with this. Most obvious would be some kind of police procedural where she knows who committed the crime but no one will believe her, so she has to resort to creative and morally questionable means to see that justice is done. As she gets closer and closer to crossing the line, she must contend with doubt over whether her gift is really accurate or she is simply delusional. The situation becomes more complicated when she meets someone who actually believes her‚Ä¶ or at least claims to."
Mighty Little Bheem,"* When **The Hateful Eight** movie was coming out. I thought it was gonna be **Clue** but in a cabin in the snow. It wasn't.

But I think that would be a good miniseries. People dying left and right till only two remain. Mystery. Short and sweet. Be fun.

Or something in general like Clue. People arrive and slowly there are fewer ;)"
Mighty Little Bheem,"I would like to see an adult animated reality show series similar to Drawn Together, but I'm a competition for a big budget reboot. The competitors would be the 90s TMNT superhero shows like Street Sharks, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice, Skeleton Warriors, etc. Want to see what they were up to since their shows ended, what they villains have been up to, whether or not the teams even want a reboot."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I‚Äôd like to see the Wicked series of four books turned into a miniseries. The author did such a great job of expanding the Oz culture and showing its adult side. Not an adaptation of the Wicked musical, but rather something more faithful to the books."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I want to see a comedy series about a ghost hunting show, where the ""hosts"" truly believe in ghosts, and the show is about their producers and production crew keeping up the act.

Like, you have the crew shaking the hosts' tent at night to make them think it is being accosted by angry spirits."
Mighty Little Bheem,What if the Chosen One doesn't want to?
Mighty Little Bheem,"I'd like to see a reboot of Sliders or anything else that involves people going through different dimensions.

More historical shows that aren't based on the same exact properties or historic figures.  Give us historical romance that isn't Jane Austin.  A royal historical fiction drama taking place in Ancient China (Wu Zetian's story is crazy) or Africa.  A story following a soldier or officer and their family who moved from war to war in the 1700 and 1800's when England (and the US) was basically at war with someone all the time, sometimes multiple countries (A British officer going from the American Revolution to Waterloo)."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I think Wild Wild West could be readapted for streaming or cable tv, big weird sci fi steampunk western buddy action comedy with lots of gadgets. Find a balance between cases of the week and serialized story elements, do better than the movie."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded. 

Or Germans win WW*1* alternative history.

---

Sleepless is a noir novel. I have not read, but:

""Set in California in a dystopic alternate present, the novel portrays a world wracked by a sleeplessness pandemic caused by a prion. About ten percent of the population are infected, and, unable to find sleep, die painfully within a year. Society is on the verge of breakdown, and armed bands have turned much of the U.S. into a war zone.""

----

I'd also like to see Equilibrium, or the weird emotionless-type society given a TV series. That concept required more thought than could be condensed into a 2 hour movie. We could skip the gun-fu too."
Mighty Little Bheem,Isekai Cartoon except main character is believed to be the prophesied destroyer of worlds.
Mighty Little Bheem,"a show about the leadup to the French Revolution (1789) - it would follow Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Danton, Necker, Lafayette, and of course Napoleon.


or a couple season show following some members of the French Resistance



An anthology series following the different animals in war - Wojtek, Sergeant Stubby, Rags, Cher Ami, and others.


A show about Tammany Hall.


A show about the Carthaginian Wars, focusing on Hannibal Barca and Hannibal."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Maybe it's just me, but I really want someone to revive/reboot the unique and insane mixture of Western, Spy, and Science Fiction (perfect storm of '60s tv genres) that was *The Wild Wild West.*"
Mighty Little Bheem,"I want to see a Mass Effect TV show, mainly, but we're apparently getting that.

For revivals, I would go with a new Columbo series of TV movies, where they get Steve Carrell to play Lt. Columbo and make him look like an absolute idiot... only to completely destroy the killer's case and show he's only faking it."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I'd like to see another show like the Americans, loved the premise, didn't love the execution"
Mighty Little Bheem,"Not really a premise, some shows with asexual main characters would be nice. 

I've always wanted to see a well done drama about a Japanese internment camp. But it just seems American media has so little interest in this dark period of history. There aren't even many movies about it."
Mighty Little Bheem,"if I had billions I'd make a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen show covering every damn chapter to the very end, exactly as its written, no boxes to check and no sugarcoat. Extreme, but awesome"
Mighty Little Bheem,"I'd like to see an adventure show where the consequences for each character are based on a dice roll like in a roleplaying game. So the writers are determining what's going to happen to each one and suddenly they roll a critical against the main character and then he does a 1 etc.
  
Too bad, you'e no longer in the show. Talk about uncertainness!"
Mighty Little Bheem,"So I remember Walking With Dinosaurs being on the BBC when I was younger. I've thought a lot about that, narrated like a nature documentary, but with cgi dinos. 

And I've thought about companion pieces to big franchises, sci-fi or fantasy, that are like... Nature documentaries in fictional worlds.

In the Star Trek universe the planet of Berengaria is apparently home to creatures not a world away from classical Earth depictions of dragons... So I'd love a miniseries along the lines of ""Star Trek: Dragons of Berengaria""

And it's hybrid drama/mockumentary, of a team of Federation xenobiologists exploring Berengaria's wilds, chasing down and producing a nature documentary on these creatures."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Show following the Wars of the Diadochi. Cast Alexander for one episode and have him die in the pilot. Then just follow the historical narrative after that. It's a pretty balls to wall, game of thrones sort of clusterfuck. Plus you've got lots of interesting characters to cast: Eumenes, One Eye, Perdicas, Ptolemy, Olympius, Antipater, Alexander's sisters and half sisters, etc."
Mighty Little Bheem,"we need more tv show natural disaster series 

also an accurate anthology series depicting moments in US history...every one is extremely cheesy or has Alec balwdin as the narrator"
Mighty Little Bheem,A show where first cousins fall in love and date but they have to deal with the taboos in their family and society.
Mighty Little Bheem,There never been really good or accurate show on the American service industry. The closest we‚Äôve gotten is waiting (always sunny and below deck honorable mentions).
Mighty Little Bheem,[Long March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March) historical drama.
Mighty Little Bheem,Murder Mystery set in Medieval India. I'd like to see someone solve a mystery without using any tech or scientific knowledge after the 1400s.India because personal bias
Mighty Little Bheem,"Oh yeah, I'd love that. If for nothing else to explain exactly how politics works in the Federation.

My favourite version is the idea that each planet has its own governments who they elect and generally get the final say on what happens on this particular planet, but from them they chose  representatives who serve in the federation government and from whom the president is elected."
Mighty Little Bheem,Star Trek would be the perfect medium for Sorkin to do his idealistic shtick instead of the real world where we know better.
Mighty Little Bheem,Already made a test pilot:  The Expanse.
Mighty Little Bheem,how about a show where the Aztecs land and colonize Europe?
Mighty Little Bheem,I assume you've seen the magicians?
Mighty Little Bheem,Have you seen slasher on netflix? There's a season that's like that
Mighty Little Bheem,Clue could easily be an anthology type series. Each season can feature a new cast and a new mystery. But that's similar to what Rian is doing with Knives Out right now.
Mighty Little Bheem,Check out Wellington Paramormal! Not exactly what you want but very funny.
Mighty Little Bheem,"I would love to see that, but I've come to accept the Wild Wild West could only have come out of the sixties, a time when science fiction, western and spy fiction was loved in equal measures."
Mighty Little Bheem,The adventures of Brisco county jr was very very good if you‚Äôve seen that
Mighty Little Bheem,"> Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded. 

HBO was gonna make that show but got cold feet after Twitter had a shitfit."
Mighty Little Bheem,"> Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded.

That'd be a pretty interesting concept. Like the early 1900's with the country still split between the Union and Confederacy and slavery still being legal in the south."
Mighty Little Bheem,I really don't know why this hasn't been made. It's such an incredible story. You can throw the Haitian revolution in there too
Mighty Little Bheem,"One ace is/was on HBOMAX‚Äôs Generation, more of an ensemble tv show than singular lead. Cancelled however had a good run, enough finality to recommend."
Mighty Little Bheem,Have you seen the terror?
Mighty Little Bheem,"Check out Harmonquest.. kind of what you are pitching. Maybe a bit too literallyan RPG, but you get fun animation and acting to go with the dice rolls."
Mighty Little Bheem,"There‚Äôs a show called ‚ÄúNoughts and Crosses‚Äù,which takes place in England several hundred years after it was colonized by Africans."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Read my mind, I was even thinking WWW should have Carlton Cuse as a potential show runner because of his great work with Briscoe County Jr."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I remember the shitfit, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what canned it. D&D‚Äôs Netflix deal closed in 2019, which basically ended the show."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Why didn't Twitter have a similar shitfit to Man in the High Castle or Plot Against America?

Wait until they hear about Babylon Berlin S4"
Mighty Little Bheem,Are you referring to the War of Northern Aggression? /s
Mighty Little Bheem,Harry Turtledove writes some good alternate history fiction.  Guns of the South was an interesting take on an alternate Civil War outcome.  His work would probably be slaughtered in our current 8-10 episodes per season formats.
Mighty Little Bheem,"D&D were were tapped to do it, but ultimately it never happened

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_(TV_series)"
Mighty Little Bheem,which one
Mighty Little Bheem,How about Briscoe County The Third? And his nemesis/partner prince fedora.
Mighty Little Bheem,I almost forgot that those two circus monkeys were involved with it.
Mighty Little Bheem,What Netflix shows have come out that was produced by that D&D studio?
Mighty Little Bheem,"Because the US has an ugly, complex history with slavery and that legacy is still felt today"
Mighty Little Bheem,The War against Goddamn Yankees
Mighty Little Bheem,Guns of the South is a great book but it does have the problem of glossing over the crimes of the confederate leadership. On the other hand his southern victory series has the confederacy ending up as bad as the nazis. So your miles may vary on how delicately he handles the topic.
Mighty Little Bheem,"Sorry, French revolution."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I‚Äôd gladly take more. Trying to think of any tv stars who have the chin to play Briscoe the third, Enver Gjokaj maybe or somebody younger."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Nothing yet,but they‚Äôre producing ‚ÄúThe Three Body Problem‚Äù for Netflix. I don‚Äôt think they will be writing any episodes though."
Mighty Little Bheem,"And so does Germany with the Nazis. We still see Babylon Berlin, Downfall and many nazi-era stuff.

A Confederate alt-history show would be genuinely interesting."
Mighty Little Bheem,it would be so good
Mighty Little Bheem,"I was gonna say luka from community and then googled that name you wrote. We are clearly on the same page. 

I could see maybe a bookem woodbine or a Morris chestnut type as the lord bowler character."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I don‚Äôt think you comprehend that the issue of **race** in America is a fraught one. With conservatives pushing back against things like [Critical Race Theory](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05) and disproportionate police brutality on people of color still happening, it was very tone-deaf for Weiss, Benioff, and HBO to consider it."
Mighty Little Bheem,"in The Plot Against America good guys still win in the end tho, the difference is that the show is a bit more vague about it than the book.
 
so in TPAA ""alternative history"" basically is a 3 year hiccup."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I think that being able to explore themes regarding the crimes of the confederacy in a pseudo modern context could potentially add to the discourse surrounding such a fraught topic. Shoving it under a rug won't help anyone .In hindsight Weiss and Benioff probably don't have the tact, or knowledge in general, to pull it off. But that doesn't mean the premise doesn't have merit."
Mighty Little Bheem,"I would still watch a Confederacy victory alternative history series, and I would still support one being made."
Mighty Little Bheem,"Babylon Berlin will get grimmer and darker.

And Man in the High Castle is pretty bad.

I also would like to see a Russian language serial based around the Revolutionary period ie: Babylon Berlin style, and the idea of a prospective show not being made because people might protest and boycott that is sad."
Mighty Little Bheem,"you know what i would like to watch? that show Aaron McGruder pitched as a response to HBO's Confederate. 

> Hailing from Peabody winner Aaron McGruder (The Boondocks) and Will Packer (who‚Äôs produced everything from Straight Outta Compton to Girls Trip to the recent remake of Roots), Black America takes place in a world where the North won the Civil War, but the process of Reconstruction resulted in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama being given to freed slaves, who formed their own nation, New Colonia.

https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/1/16076200/amazon-black-america-hbo-confederate-civil-war-alternate-history"
Mighty Little Bheem,"Yup. That sounds cool too.

Did you think I would be a hypocrite and object to that?"
Mighty Little Bheem,"no, just every time i hear about that show D&D were developing, my mind gets set on *Black America*."
Mighty Little Bheem,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Mighty Little Bheem,Hooch is crazy

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"There weren't any official posts of Demon Slayer's animation material, so I picked the next best thing. You can also find stuff for the Fate/stay night: Heavens Feel movies on YouTube through unofficial sources."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Unlimited Budget Works
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Unlimited tax evasion.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I love this show but I feel like this complete trailer was a cluster fuck
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Is there a release data I‚Äôm assuming next year
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Bondage girl's back!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"So i wanna start watching this. How do I approach it? Season 1,Movie,Season 2 and then Season 3?"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"I'm very confused with Demon Slayer, I've watched season 1 and the Mugen Train film. Is this the follow on season just under a different name?"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I was disappointed by the Entertainment District Arc.  Pretty but without much substance.  Hopefully it picks up in overall quality.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"First, you start at season 1. After that, you can either watch the movie or the extended TV version of ""Mugen Train Arc"". The TV version has a complete new anime original 1st episode with the rest of the episodes being a re-edit of the movie featuring some new shots. Lastly, you watch the ""Entertainment District Arc"" followed by the upcoming ""Swordsmith Village Arc""."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[deleted]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Hopefully the plot will actually advance
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"I know I'm late and this comment is barely relevant, but this review articulates better than I could why Demon Slayer, and the Entertainment District Arc specifically, are so widely praised. Good way to kill 11 minutes if you're bored to tears. Maybe it'll give you a new appreciation!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A\_9gR41ivBU&ab\_channel=Gigguk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_9gR41ivBU&ab_channel=Gigguk)

Different strokes, but I'd be absolutely thrilled for more of the same."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Thanks ! Would you recommend the Tv or movie version of the train arc ?
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Ah okay thank you, wish they'd name them season x haha."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,There‚Äôs really only enough for 3 or so more seasons at 12 episodes each. Though I expect the finale to be a movie
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"My honest thoughts?

Swordsmith Village arc + the arc after it (Training Arc) *feel* like fillers mostly because >!the arc after that is the FINAL one. S3 will cover Village + Training with S4 being the final arc.!<"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I recommend watching the 1st episode of the TV version for the new anime original content and then the movie version for better pacing.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[deleted]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"first 7 eps of season 2 are mugen train arc, the last 11 are the entertainment district. so this post is about season 3, basically"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Training arcs are so stupid, hated it in season 1 and hearing there's another one doesn't fill me with confidence..."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"You should at least watch the first episode of the Mugen Train series. It's all new material with Rengoku being awesome and wholesome. Episode 2+ is what the movie covers, but touched up"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,When will the movie be available in North America tho??
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I still need to see the movie.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[Trailer](https://streamable.com/x09fwe)
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Okay well I need the movie first
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,still waiting for the movie but honestly the rise of demon slayer is literally unheard of..and its kind of wild because its not even up there as my top shounen properties (kaisen and hunter x hunter being the top)
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Cool!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Show fucking sucks and has the pacing of a Neil Breen movie.

Watch Dororo instead"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Babies with swords and titties.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Could anyone post a date please
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,asking the important questions
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[removed]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,In case anyone doesn‚Äôt know the Demon Slayer movie is the highest grossing film in Japan. More than Titanic or Frozen or Avatar.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Yeah the story isn‚Äôt anything unique, it‚Äôs typical shonen style. But it‚Äôs solid and consistent. Combine that with ufotables insane quality, and it‚Äôs no surprise it has a big following."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"I have to give credit to Ufotable. The story isn't great, but the production quality is amazing, fight scenes are as beautiful as the ones they made for Fate/Stay."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Which is kind of surprising that the author chose to end the manga just as the popularity reached its peak. I feel like most authors would start experimenting with new plots & storylines considering the demand would guarantee some longevity to the series. Or maybe he‚Äôs just stressed out and the pressure is getting to him
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"It's not really unheard of even though it broke into the top 10. A lot of the really popular ones probably followed a similar trend to get where they are.

Some of them even have similar time frames to go along with those numbers. Millions less mind you, but given how popular reading manga has become it's almost not fair by comparison.

Like Fist of the North Star did 100m in 6 years and that was 80s.

The movie popularity doesn't make sense honestly, but the manga is kinda par for the course.

Meanwhile Dragonball, Naruto, and One Piece exist to put things into perspective."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Watch both
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,waaaaa me no like popular stuff waaaaaa
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Probably will be one of the fall new animes

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[removed]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Ufotable definitely deserves all of the credit for this series taking off like it did.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"It's a competent but unremarkable story, just executed really well from a screenplay/world building/animation standpoint.

I also think having such a sweet, genuinely emphatic protagonist is a nice change of pace, and part of this sort of shift like Ted Lasso to lead characters being genially good again and not dark anti-heroes."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I‚Äôd like to add the uniqueness of the demons is really top notch. They are really interesting and some complex which adds to the show too. All they really need to do is tone down the slapstick from the lighting kid.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Yeah I read most of the manga then got impatient and read a summary. It's pretty average
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"The manga is not par the course at all. Per volume sales, it beat one piece handily too"

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"It didn't just beat One Piece. Its sales last year eclipsed the sales of the original big three. In their respective peak years. Combined.

It's not even that One Piece is even doing badly sales-wise. It's just a testament to how much Demon Slayer blew up in terms of popularity."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[removed]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Also ridiculous is that its sales last year were more than the American comic book industry. One series sold more than an industry. And a popular one at that.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"I was talking about per volume sales. Yeah it beat those three in their respective peak years combined (in annual sales) but that's mostly because demon slayer became as popular as it is towards its ending. A lot more backlog to buy for new fans.

A 10 book series that became popular at book 1 will have its total sales a lot more spread out than one that became popular at book 9."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,[removed]
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Oh yeah, no doubt. On top of that, everyone had nothing else to do during the pandemic, so why not throw some money towards this series that's been blowing up? That extra incentive definitely blew up its sales numbers towards the end of its run."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Can Toonami expect it that time as well?

I'm all caught up thanks to Netflix and seeing the film in theaters."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,More of a recap than a trailer..
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Also be aware for those of you who haven't been able to watch the movie, they're re-cutting it and releasing it as television episodes starting in October leading up to the *new* new episodes."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,hey thats soon
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,I watched the pilot of Season 1 and stopped after that. The seemingly endless scenes of listening to characters exact thoughts as if the viewer is a full on idiot really ruined it for me
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Wake me when Zenitsu is removed from the show.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Can‚Äôt wait!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Demon Slayer is on my list to watch and I thought it was just a one-season show for some reason. So the story is continuing and there will be more?
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Will the show get good in season 2? 

Season 1 was so bad I couldn't finish it."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"Season 1 there was about a 6 month gap between the Japanese release and the American release on Toonami.

It's grown in popularity since then, so you may see a push to get it to American audiences quicker, but there will be some kind of lag.

Production of the dub still takes time to translate the script to English, accounting for differences in idioms or anything Funimation wants to change, record the English voice actors ~~and reanimate the characters' mouths for the dub.~~

Attack on Titan had a 3-6 week lag between Japanese and American releases for most of its run (season 1 was a year behind). Best case you're looking at early January 2022 for a Toonami release"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"No I would expect it on  Toonami much much later. It is gonna be on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu it looks like, at the same time as its airing in Japan."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,"**Thunder Breathing, First Form.... Thunderclap and Flash!**"
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,Absolutely 100% agreed. Legit stopped watching because of him
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,That would be a disaster since he's one of the best and most popular characters in the show!
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,No idea why you‚Äôre downvoted. Probably the most insufferable character I‚Äôve ever seen in anything.
We Never Learn,Yep‚Ä¶they were expecting a second season but it got axed.
We Never Learn,"Pieces of her is that Jason Bourne/John Wick ripoff that Tony Collette did.

God that show was such a steaming pile of dogshit."
We Never Learn,Really? Is there like an interview or something like that about it?
We Never Learn,"When you start using expressions like ""steaming pile of doghsit"" that's proof you spent too much time at the wrong corners of the internet"
We Never Learn,"It was ordered as an ongoing show and for awards consideration Netflix sent Toni Collette in under drama rather than limited series for Best Actress consideration.

Edit: Just found this snippet:

*The showrunner Charlotte Stoudt, claims that the show is a limited series. She explains to The Hollywood Reporter, ‚ÄúIt started as a limited, and then I think there was a decision made at a certain point to go for a series. I believe that was a Netflix decision, but there‚Äôs certainly a lot more to tell, and I purposely kind of started building it out a little bit more. I tried to open it up so it could have some legs should it find an audience.‚Äù*

Seems it was originally going to be a limited series then Netflix wanted to do an ongoing drama so the showrunner changed a few things to set up potential future seasons. Bit of a pity they never happened. They should have just stuck to the original idea of doing a self contained limited series!"
We Never Learn,"Ah I see. And indeed they should have stuck to it. They could certainly give more answers in that last episode instead of doing a half hour epilogue. 

Are we sure we're not getting another season?"
We Never Learn,It is not officially cancelled but we have had no word n it for over a year and the cast are pitching up on new shows. That is generally a sign a show has been quietly cancelled. Pity as I‚Äôd have watched a second season for sure and the viewership was in line with shows like The Lincoln Lawyer and The Recruit.
We Never Learn,FX has some of the best shows on TV.
We Never Learn,FX never gets the respect or viewership it deserves despite the constant praise for Landgraf
We Never Learn,The quality of Hulu went up astronomically the second they merged with FX.  Landgraf deserves an insane amount of praise for the amount of variety he‚Äôs been able to put into their programming with a lot of shows filling in a lot of niche‚Äôs that shine really bright.
We Never Learn,"The FX and Hulu connection is kind of my favorite. The Hulu model in general has been my favorite. Let shows premiere on in their timeslot on broadcast television and then go right to Hulu. I like the shared experience of that primetime watch but people who prefere to stream on their own time can do that without waiting weeks or months for the show to go to streaming. 

I wish more streamers would do this, the most frustrating is Disney+ mainly because their other streamer, Hulu, has it so right. I wish big shows like the Star Wars and MCU shows would premiere during a primetime hour not at 2am. It's one thing to not watch a show and then complain about spoilers, it's another thing to plan on watching a show the day it comes out and yet the entire episode has already been meme'd out all over the internet before you even get to you're lunch break"
We Never Learn,"""what we do in the shadows"" is amazing"
We Never Learn,"Years ago THR [posted a roundtable discussion](https://youtu.be/NX4W9uuggd) with network executives. Fox, FX, Netflix, and Showtime. 

Netflix was still just getting into original content and they all shat on him saying that just because he had two hits with OITNB and House of Cards didn't mean he had it all figured it out and that broadcast TV would still prevail. 

Anyway, the thing that really stood out though was how great John Landgraf (FX) seemed in regards to developing content. I work in the industry and hope I can work with him one day in some capacity.

Definitely worth a watch even 9 years later!"
We Never Learn,"Behind HBO, FX is an incredible network for me, among the best of the best because they let their creators do their thing, from Legion to Fargo.  I feel they're an auteur place."
We Never Learn,"""We Had To Learn Everything Over Again"" also sounds like an FX Miniseries title."
We Never Learn,It‚Äôs crazy to me Fx has way more comedy than Comedy Central has now.
We Never Learn,"I was so happy when Disney+ in Canada expanded to include ""Star"" which means we've been getting lots of great FX shows on the service. Still waiting for season 3 of Pose to show up though."
We Never Learn,"Behind HBO, FX is an incredible network for me, smong the best of the best because they let their creator do their thing, from Legion to Fargo.  I feel they're an auteur place."
We Never Learn,"It‚Äôs kinda comical how the article points out how dead fucking wrong Landgraf was in his 2016 predictions, but eagerly awaits what he has to say next."
We Never Learn,"Was just reminded of The Bastard Executioner recently; even with the recognized great series, they had some really solid forgotten ones as well.

-Edit for some others that are now coming to mind- - like The Bridge, and hmmm what else"
We Never Learn,Yeah for well over a decade at this point
We Never Learn,FX is Fox competing with other studios with their own premium content channel
We Never Learn,"HBO
Apple TV
FX
 
Those 3 are the pinnacle of prestige television and I will give anything they release a chance right now.

FX and even FXX have been consistently putting out amazing shows for the last 10 years or so yet people seemingly forget it all the time."
We Never Learn,You're The Worst is some of the best tv I've seen
We Never Learn,They also bury their programming on Hulu and do next to nothing to market it.
We Never Learn,Does FX/Hulu do it like HBO where the show releases on streaming at the same time it broadcasts or is their a next day delay for streaming?
We Never Learn,"For you, the show comes out at 2AM but for me it comes out at 9AM (I‚Äôm in the Netherlands). 
Back to when I was a student it was a perfect time as I could watch a show before doing my homework or other stuff. Now that I‚Äôm working full-time, I love that I get to watch whenever I want to. For reactions, I‚Äôll usually go to the subreddit. 

I wish FX would release their shows simultaneously on Disney+ here. I had to wait many months to watch The Bear, The Patient, Atlanta, Dave, Breeders and many others. Welcome to Wrexham S1 has been released in the US but for some reason Disney thought it would be a good idea to release this show with weekly episodes after the US premiere. Episode 17 was released yesterday so next week I can finally watch the season finale."
We Never Learn,"> they all shat on him saying that just because he had two hits with OITNB and House of Cards didn't mean he had it all figured it out and that broadcast TV would still prevail.

Lol that is a severe lack of vision"
We Never Learn,Video not available :(
We Never Learn,"Disney kept basically the ""auteur side"" of Fox, same with movies with Searchlight Pictures."
We Never Learn,"Not gonna lie, a show about the industry switch from broadcast/live TV to streaming would be very interesting."
We Never Learn,"He was not wrong. He correctly called the slow death of cable and broadcast back in 2015. That was years before the suits above him were willing to admit they were up shit creek and the paddles were beginning to detach. 

He also called out streaming overspending a few years ago. We are just now seeing streamers admit as much and enact deep programming cutbacks. 

Dude has been pretty reliable on his calls. He just called the peak a few years too early."
We Never Learn,FX is Disney since they bought Fox FYI. It's kind of their prestige side and not their franchise side.
We Never Learn,"The spot AMC occupies belongs to FX, yeah AMC has two goat level shows but that‚Äôs it. FX has had solid shows for so long."
We Never Learn,Before it‚Äôs abrupt cancellation (for obvious reasons) Louie was top tier television
We Never Learn,AppleTV has really disproven its doubters in the years since it‚Äôs announcement.
We Never Learn,It still blows my mind that I think Apple TV+ has the best batting average of the 3 even though their very limited content helps
We Never Learn,"Binged this like 2 years ago.  What a fuckin show.  The commercials that had aired while it ran did not do the characters any justice.  Just typing this, I started laughing about the 'dramatic' scene in the season 4 finale that starts where one character punches the wrong guy (who had been a constantly shit on character all season) in the face by accident.  That description doesn't do it justice."
We Never Learn,"So true. Although the do run FX on Hulu ads during big tv events, they used to do really great marketing bumps for their shows too (justified/sons of anarchy era)

The quality level is really high. They just can't capture a big audience for some reason.

And they've started deleting some content  from Hulu. Mam Seeking Woman (FXX) and Taboo (FX) have been removed without announcement"
We Never Learn,"The shows that air on FX or FXX become available the next day on Hulu. But the other thing they do is that they release a lot of their shows exclusively on Hulu never air those on any of their channels. The Bear, The Patient and Reservation Dogs are three shows I can remember off the top of my head that they did this with."
We Never Learn,Yeah I prefer the HBO version where it's everywhere at the same time instead of the there the next day for streaming.
We Never Learn,How dare you think of your convenience over an American's convenience?
We Never Learn,For me the early morning release is nice because it gives me something to watch and not get so *bored* trying to do some exercise.
We Never Learn,"God do I hate the way Disney+ does Hulu shows. Hulu releases everything at once, but on Disney+ it's weekly. It's annoying as hell."
We Never Learn,"Yeah the international release strategy of FX and Hulu stuff is weird as fuck. Sometimes they wait months after the end to drop everything, sometimes it's week by week (but can be after the US ending or just delayed, like Only Murders in the Building season 1 had a weird one-week delay on the US for some reason). Just put it the same day (or the following day at worst if you want the live TV to be the first)."
We Never Learn,https://youtu.be/NX4W9uuggdI
We Never Learn,"> The spot AMC occupies belongs to FX, yeah AMC has two goat level shows but that‚Äôs it. FX has had solid shows for so long.

Also, for AMC if you don't like those two shows then what else is there? For FX I bet you could grab 5 different people and they could all have a unique top 5 ranking(placement of shows and some different shows) and they would all be respectable Top 5s"
We Never Learn,"I think AMC needs more respect. Breaking Bad is great, but Better Call Saul is every bit as good. Mad Man was huge prestige television. Halt and Catch Fire is one of the best shows in the past decade and never got the respect it deserved. Preacher was weirdly fantastic and deserved a better conclusion than it got, but was such a good show overall that also got little respect. 

And that doesn‚Äôt even include Hell on Wheels, Into the Badlands (the first two seasons, at least), Rubicon, or the Walking Dead (the first couple of seasons)."
We Never Learn,"I assume you‚Äôre considering Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul the GOAT shows, but don‚Äôt forget about Mad Men and Halt and Catch Fire. That said FX has waaaaaay more"
We Never Learn,"Those two great shows of AMC (I'd say 3 though, there's Mad Men too) are not even owned and produced by them but they are Sony project (for BB and BCS) and Lionsgate (for Mad Men)"
We Never Learn,"2010 was fucking bonkers good on FX, Louie premiered in June and then Terriers in September, and Lights Out not long after that."
We Never Learn,Apple TV has Severance. Instant S tier.
We Never Learn,"Marketing. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre keeping it a fucking secret. Guess what. When it‚Äôs time for Game of Thrones to come back on HBOMAX, everyone on the planet including my grandmother are going to know about, whether they want to or not. FX, the fuckers, I didn‚Äôt even know that the Sex Pistols tv series was on the fucking platform until two months after it ended, I found out by mistake."
We Never Learn,"Moving it back earlier makes it better for a lot of people you know that right? Instead of the Netherlands guy having it release at 9am, releasing it at US primetime would be like 5am for him so he could actually wake up early to watch it before work/school if he wished.

Releasing it at midnight PST, the only other place where it's prime time would be like the Eastern part of Australia."
We Never Learn,"Releasing it earlier at primetime US wouldn't change that for you, it would be earlier for you too."
We Never Learn,"I really enjoyed AMC's Pantheon, but they flubbed the release of the first season *hard* and just cancelled the second season even though it's already been produced. 

AMC must be a fucking mess, internally."
We Never Learn,"Exactly!
 

There‚Äôs a very valid argument The Shield is red headed step child when it comes to Breaking bad and Sopranos, Id also say The Americans is a slept on gem."
We Never Learn,"AMC was once S-tier level too. They had Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and TWD (before it was crap) all at the same time"
We Never Learn,Servant and Severance are what gives it S tier for me
We Never Learn,"They also have Invasion, F tier."
We Never Learn,"Lol yeah they do weird promo for their connected networks. They had the swx pistol cast doing promo on good morning America.

I get the coroporate synergy angle but they probably do not have viewership overlap"
We Never Learn,Agreed. My guess is that there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a great deal of overlap between Disney+ and FX viewership. HBO know how to market their series. FX does not or will not due to money. It‚Äôs just that simple.
We Never Learn,"I think their numbers have jumped a lot since they started including streaming. They still haven't had a breakout hit since Sons of Anarchy on the drama side


Dave and Atlanta were great on the comedy side numbers wise"
We Never Learn,"MacFarlene:

>‚ÄúI want to say, it is an absolute thrill to not be on the Fox network. We never really belonged there. And they‚Äôve curated a specific brand now. Between Beat Shazam, Name That Tune and Don‚Äôt Forget the Lyrics!, Fox has really captured the demo of people who have no idea what song they‚Äôre listening to.‚Äù
 
>‚ÄúWhen I look at Fox‚Äôs ratings, I gotta hand it to them: It takes a special talent to pander to the lowest common denominator without actually getting them as an audience. That takes talent! But hey, we‚Äôre here on Hulu, thank God.‚Äù
 
>‚ÄúHulu is literally on top of the streaming game, Kardashians aside. Just knowing our show is now available, and the public can enjoy watching $50 million worth of special effects on their phone while they defecate, really gives me goosebumps.‚Äù"
We Never Learn,"I feel like I'm waking up from a coma. All these shows that were on pause because of the pandemic, all these events that got halted for a few years, they're all coming back at once. I feel like the world is just shifting around me suddenly."
We Never Learn,TBS has shown more love and excitement and care for American Dad than fox really ever did for any of the shows. I know this isn‚Äôt about that but Fox is bleh
We Never Learn,"was curious about fox's ratings so I just looked and they were second place in the 18-49 demo barely losing to nbc https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/tv-season-ratings-cbs-nbc-abc-fox-2022-1235257080/

3rd overall though"
We Never Learn,Is the Orville renewed for a 4th season?
We Never Learn,FOX either cancels shows way too early or lets them drag on for years and years to the point the shows have jumped the shark multiple times.
We Never Learn,I just wish Hulu would sign him up for a 4th season. Would be a shame if it got the TOS treatment. The show fills a void modern ST doesn‚Äôt.
We Never Learn,He‚Äôll keep cashing those Family Guy and American Dad checks though
We Never Learn,"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, isn‚Äôt fox television studios completely separate from Fox News studios?"
We Never Learn,This show is awesome
We Never Learn,"A lot of people say the Orville is the best Star Trek out now.

They might have been right up until about a month ago.  Strange New Worlds is fire."
We Never Learn,Wait isn't family guy still on Fox?
We Never Learn,"Dude was their golden goose for 20 years. They must have really mistreated him for him to not only exit, but publicly shit-talk them."
We Never Learn,"Look, we all hate Fox for cancelling our favorite shows like Firefly, but I will say that Fox gave more scifi shows a chance than any other network, including the Syfy channel itself, so I'm willing to cut them some slack."
We Never Learn,Well there goes my ‚ÄúThe Orville is the best Star Trek show actually on television‚Äù hot take. Now all Star Trek and Star Trek like shows are streaming only.
We Never Learn,"I haven't read any of the other comments but I will say that I am also glad The Orville is no longer with Fox.  In fact, the Fox network cancelled Lucifer after 3 seasons, completely leaving me (and other fans) stumped.  Netflix benefited from that blunderbuss of a mistake, and Hulu, IMO, will also reap rewards with The Orville: New Horizons.

Not sure what the future of both traditional and cable networks hold...but big changes need to be made if they wish to retain, or even bring in new, advertisers (and viewers, of course).  I'm not even sure when the last time it was when I watched anything on the Fox network."
We Never Learn,https://i.imgur.com/kzXxcdG.jpg
We Never Learn,"I really wanted to like The Orville but found it uncanny seeing MacFarlane playing it so straight. He's made the sardonic punchline his signature to the point where I kept expecting him to break the fourth wall with another ironic smile to the camera. 

That said, I've seen comments pointing to the show finding its feet as it goes along."
We Never Learn,"Bro got his money.  Rich people are picky, poor people shut up."
We Never Learn,Love to quit Fox after milking them for 2 decades lol.
We Never Learn,Props to MacFarlane for having the balls to talk shit about a network that literally built his career.
We Never Learn,"Belonged there long enough to make his fortune and gain creative freedom.

Sounds like a kid finally leaving his parents house at 30."
We Never Learn,And yet he took their money.
We Never Learn,Should have ripped Star Trek Picard
We Never Learn,Yet he happily cashed the checks ... so once again comments of convenience in order to pander to your collective audience.
We Never Learn,But he has no problem cashing their checks
We Never Learn,wait... it's all Disney...
We Never Learn,"That's kinda strange to say considering he's still got Family Guy actively airing on Fox. Like, they know he's the same Seth MacFarlane. They know who they're making checks out to lol.

Edit - what? It's weird to bring up that he's trashing the network he still has a show on? Fucken okay."
We Never Learn,He's had no problem cashing Fox checks for the last couple decades.
We Never Learn,"I like everything this man does.  But, it seems that he was happy to take their money."
We Never Learn,My country doesn't HAVE hulu.  I can't plunk down any amount of money to legally see this show.
We Never Learn,Fox wouldn't know what to do with a good show if it came up and bit them in the ass... which I know because it has happened quite a few times now.
We Never Learn,"Fox has cancelled all the best shows we've ever had. I am always dumbfounded people went to them after their 90s descent into garbage. 

That being said, McFarlane is never one to talk about anything. Made a career ripping off everyone else. But that's hollywood for you. Just give us the same shit with a new coat of paint"
We Never Learn,Netflix could do well to scoop this up and gain some goodwill in the process.
We Never Learn,This isn‚Äôt good news. I don‚Äôt have Hulu and neither do any of my friends and family. When it was on FOX it was free.
We Never Learn,Family Guy cancelation imminent
We Never Learn,"Season 1 was fine mostly.

Season 2 was absolutely painful to watch, I could not give a fuck to watch the doctor and robot find love. 

did season 3 recover?"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Lisa Kudrow was let go from Frasier. 

The show recast the role of Roz with Peri  Gilpin."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"and after Friends, Perry had a seemlingly endless stream of failed sitcoms"
Oum le dauphin blanc,so what you're saying was courtney cox was the missing ingredient
Oum le dauphin blanc,"So, the gist of the story is that actors had acting careers?"
Oum le dauphin blanc,I remember before Blossom there was a very short lived sitcom starring Mayim Bialick that had her as a rambunctious kid and Jennifer Anniston played her older stuck up sister.  Only thing I remember from the show is Jennifer Anniston getting a plate of spaghetti dumped on her head
Oum le dauphin blanc,"If memory serves right, The Edge was a sketch show (based on an interview with Alan Ruck from a few years ago where he mentions having worked on it) and not a sitcom"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"This isn't that surprising, most actors spent quite a while as failures before they find success. The reason *Party Down* is so true-to-life is that the show's creators (Paul Rudd, Adam Scott, Rob Thomas) all worked shit jobs for years before they got their break."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Top of the Heap was pretty funny, like a Married with Children type show with a father and son con artist"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Here‚Äôs my power rankings of Friends stars before they were on Friends based on well known they were.
1. Courtney Cox - had a supporting role as Alex‚Äôs girlfriend on Family Ties. She was also in Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs Dancing in the Dark video.
2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol‚Äôs boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident. He was also in a lot of shows that only lasted a single season plus he had a supporting role in the River Phoenix movie A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.
3. Matt LeBlanc - he did a lot of commercial work as well as a recurring role on Married With Children that led to his own sitcom.
4. Lisa Kudrow - had a recurring role as Ursula on Mad About You and in three episodes of the Bob Newhart sitcom, Bob.
5. Jennifer Anniston - starred in the cult classic, Leprechaun and as Ferris Bueller‚Äôs sister in the very short lived Ferris Bueller tv show.
6. David Schwimmer - he was mostly a stage actor before Friends, but had a memorable storyline on the first season of NYPD Blue and a role on the short lived Henry Winkler sitcom Monty."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Jennifer Aniston had two shows with Friends and another one playing about the same time in different networks. So if the second show got second season, she would have to quit Friends and do the other show the then CEO of NBC put the second show against strong competition for it to be ratings flop and not to be renewed"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"All I remember was Matt LeBlanc sitting a bottle of ketchup on the the edge of a top of a building, then buying a hot dog from a street vendor, plain. Then behind the back, a perfect pour of ketchup from the sky.

Idk why I remember that I was fairly young when that commercial came out lol"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Lisa said it was a blessing, and I don't blame her. Frasier is incredible but Friends is a global and a cultural phenomenon making Lisa millions 30 year after it debut. So yes a blessing it was."
Oum le dauphin blanc,But she had a recurring role as Ursala on Mad about You.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Fun fact, Lisa Kudrow has a guest role on an episode of Cheers in the eighth season, which is sort of weird to think about just because Cheers just feels like a MUCH older show than Friends."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Some great ones though. Go On was a really funny show with a fantastic supporting cast. It really deserved another season.
Oum le dauphin blanc,I miss Studio 60.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Go On is legitimately hilarious with a great cast. I don't normally care if a sitcom gets renewed or not, but I was upset with that one."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"She was on the drama ""Dirt"" on FX. It wasn't bad, but I definitely stuck around for her."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Masters of the universe and ace Ventura prepped her
Oum le dauphin blanc,Molloy
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Came here to say this. I watched The Edge as a kid (and even have a VHS-quality DVD bootleg), and it was a sketch show--not a sitcom."
Oum le dauphin blanc,It even had a backdoor pilot on MWC
Oum le dauphin blanc,"This list is strange to me. Everyone i knew all knew Joey as the bimbo guy from married with children. He was by far the most famous in my social circle. 

I was pretty young at the time tho."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"> 2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol‚Äôs boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident.

He was also unfairly fired from this role, actually.

Kirk Cameron became a Born-Again Christian shortly after the show started and caused a shit-ton of problems for the programme by refusing to do things on account of his faith. For example, frequently forcing rewrites of jokes or even episodes because he didn't want dirty jokes in the show. And the executive producers were forced to comply because he ended up becoming *the* face of the show as the most popular actor.

He nixed the original plan for the ""Holiday In Europe"" storyline to actually film the entire set of episodes on location in Europe, the entire cost of production being covered by the tourism boards of numerous countries, because it would've meant not going to church so they filmed it on an island off the coast of California instead.

He also had two actors kicked off the show. His first on-screen girlfriend was fired at his orders for featuring in Playboy and he had Perry fired for being an ""Agent of Satan"" due to his issues with addiction.

Cameron ended up getting the show cancelled because the executive producers found out that he tried to go over their heads in regards to a joke and directly complained to then-CEO of ABC Bob Iger as well as outright slandering them. They just said they were done producing the show, locked down the rights and moved onto other projects."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"It was probably a blessing for Frasier too, she would have made a very different Roz. One I would not like to have seen."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Cheers went off the air a full year-plus before Friends debuted on NBC.
Oum le dauphin blanc,She also led Cougar Town on ABC (and later TBS). Great fun.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Fox saw the talent Matt was so they put him in another show, *Vinny and Bobby*. He was the same Vinny as MWC and TotH."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"You can argue about where the others fall on the list, but Courtney is by far the most well known when that show started. She was in the first Ace Ventura movie which came out five months before Friends premiered. Her pre-Friends IMDb credits is also a lot longer than the rest of the cast which isn‚Äôt too surprising considering she is the second oldest cast member after Lisa."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Kirk cameron never comes off looking good ever and it seems like everyone hates working with him.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Understood, it just feels like an old show whereas I've never thought of Friends as ""old""."
Oum le dauphin blanc,He got blacklisted by Hollywood because his costar on Growing Pains didn't want much else to do with him. It's why he exclusively works in Christian media now.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Probably because an Irish bar with floor to ceiling dark wood hasn't been built in over 50 years, and coffee shops with couches in them are a 90s/early 2000s thing"
Oum le dauphin blanc,I feel like letting a focus group have so much input almost guarantees your show will be dog shit.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"I feel like ""pam marries joey"" would've been a really effective marketing gimmick."
Oum le dauphin blanc,That‚Äôs why actors turn down roles that they sometimes feel will typecast them
Oum le dauphin blanc,Typecasting is such a bitch sometimes. Having a starring role that everyone knows you for is great until that role is over and your typecasted into that role again and again
Oum le dauphin blanc,Did anyone actually buy Jim's portrayal as Jack Ryan? What's this paper salesman doing in Yemen?!
Oum le dauphin blanc,No jokes I legitimately took part in a focus group for this show in Vegas at MGM and remember writing about their lack of chemistry on screen. My only focus group experience so it‚Äôs a trip to see this years later.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Man with a Plan is a weird one for me. I have never seen a single scene from that show or really seen any discussion about that show. I actually still flip through network TV a decent amount, I'll even stop and watch a random new episode of a sitcom I don't know because it just sort of reminds me of being a teenager and that's how you would find new shows on network TV but in 4 years never once did I stubble upon this show (and I watch 2 whole episodes of Kevin Can Wait In That Time Period)

Even weirder is the show wasn't really a ratings disappointment, it just cost more to produce. It's ratings in the 2019-20 season were on par with the 2020-21 ratings for any CBS sitcom that wasn't Young Sheldon or Mom, and it performed better 2 seasons ago than any CBS did this past season."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Man with a Plan is basically ""Pucks"" from Episodes"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Liza Snyder did a great job opposite LeBlanc, I thought they had great chemistry and I enjoyed Man With a Plan. It was pretty low stakes and just fun."
Oum le dauphin blanc,She said this [years ago](https://youtu.be/sT6mn-3kqak). I wonder why this is being posted now?
Oum le dauphin blanc,"HOLY SHIT I WAS IN THIS FOCUS GROUP. Jenna Fischer was aaaaawful in the pilot. Loved her in the office, but her acting was so so bad in this. I made it very clear that I thought she was not right for the part, and I‚Äôve always wondered what happened to the show."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"As much as I like Jenna Fischer, Liza Snyder definitely fit the role better imo


Edit: Liz to liza"
Oum le dauphin blanc,Thanks for listening to office ladies podcast.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Today, on ‚Äòhow grown ass adults have trouble telling actors from their characters, and thus can‚Äôt separate reality from fiction‚Äô‚Ä¶"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"The problem isn't that Pam wouldn't marry Joey.  The problem is that these studio idiots think focus groups are a great way to cast a show.  

They make tons of money for shit like this.  Geniuses."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Ohhhh.... I can actually contribute.   

I was on a focus group for both this show and Kevin Can Wait.   The other people in the group may have been the most closed minded people I've ever been in a room with.   One guy kept loudly insisting that they needed to recast Kevin James's best friend, because a black friend was unbelievable and made him uncomfortable... especially since the lead character was a retired cop and ""would know better than to be friends with him"".

I can't speak to the re-cast, as we were shown an Erinn Hayes re-shoot... But again, the same guy insisted that Matt Leblanc's character should greet people by saying ""How you doin'?"" each time as new character walked in.  

Creativity dies in focus groups."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"I honestly find her so obnoxious and annoying on her podcast. Angela is much more interesting and Jenna constantly has to point out she had a bigger part and was classically trained. Meanwhile, Angela was a much more interesting character."
Oum le dauphin blanc,If Jenna Fischer didn't want to be seen as Pam she should stop doing so much office shit. You know why Harrison Ford didn't get typecast as a scifi actor post Starwars? Because he didn't give a shit about Han Solo and has never shown up to a convention
Oum le dauphin blanc,Can anyone bitching about how dumb focus groups are make any real case for Jenna Fischer deserving that role? With how little she‚Äôs done since The Office it‚Äôs hard to argue that they missed out on something special by not hiring her.
Oum le dauphin blanc,The [Focus Group](https://youtu.be/zwkySqQU8tw)
Oum le dauphin blanc,[deleted]
Oum le dauphin blanc,I would have actually watched the show if it had Jenna Fischer‚Ä¶
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Well that‚Äôs stupid. I watched her sitcom **Splitting Up Together** with Oliver Hudson and wasn‚Äôt exactly thinking ‚Äúwait, why is Pam not with Jim? And when did Adam from Rules of Engagement break up with Jen?‚Äù"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Good thing they listened to the focus group.  Case and point, no one would ever believe Malcom‚Äôs dad would end up as a druglord"
Oum le dauphin blanc,Focus groups are the dumbest bunches of motherfuckers on planet earth.  You give a dozen people with nothing to say a platform to guide entertainment based on shit they trump up so they can feel important in the room.  Morons.
Oum le dauphin blanc,I do remember a TV critic on twitter stating that Jenna and Matt had the opposite of chemistry.
Oum le dauphin blanc,The fact that these executives take stuff like this from focus groups seriously is shockingly out of touch.
Oum le dauphin blanc,Owch
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Pam would marry Joey, but would start doing pranks with Chandler and leave Joey for him shortly thereafter."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"I mean, she married Jim and he‚Äôs just a slightly less goofy version of Joey‚Ä¶"
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Detail: But, the actress (Andrea Anders) in the last sitcom ('Joey' not 'Man with a Plan')who did get the part did marry Matt LeBlanc for a while.

Honestly it was a good pairing, but I don't see why Jenna Fischer wouldnt have worked.  


Update: Ah.. apparently, people who were in the actual focus groups said they didnt have chemistry. I could see that."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Joey couldn't pack Pam's lunch. (That's more of a sports term than sexual one...you sickos.)
Oum le dauphin blanc,"well if she's gonna be typecast as Pam, might as well reveal that she is the one that sent the monsters at Jim and his new wife in A Quiet Place"
Oum le dauphin blanc,I don‚Äôt think Jenna Fischer is a good actress so maybe there‚Äôs more to her not getting the role or other roles in general
Oum le dauphin blanc,They're right.
Oum le dauphin blanc,ugh typecasting is a bitch.  Nice to have the security of a multi year show but there's a price to pay.
Oum le dauphin blanc,One of the reasons I negatively associate the Office US is because of its brain dead fans.
Oum le dauphin blanc,it‚Äôs like a crossover of the worst fanbases in television history
Oum le dauphin blanc,I really like the woman they chose though
Oum le dauphin blanc,Focus groups are such scams
Oum le dauphin blanc,"The whole concept of a focus group is flawed. When you put a dozen strangers in a room and ask them questions, they're going to tell you what they think is proper to say, not their truth."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"They weren't wrong. Leblanc is the Gen X Tony Danza, in which they could only play a version of themselves."
Oum le dauphin blanc,So stupid it hurts
Oum le dauphin blanc,"I‚Äôm glad that she didn‚Äôt get that role. She was not suited for it. I respect her, but she‚Äôs not the best actress. 

The show she did after The Office, where she and her husband are splitting up but still living together and co-parenting, was not good. She wasn‚Äôt very good in it.

Liza Snyder ended up being a great fit for that role opposite Matt Leblanc. I like good sitcoms, and really liked Man With a Plan. The first couple seasons were really entertaining, and the third was still above average."
Oum le dauphin blanc,It‚Äôs astounding to me how consumers of film and television can‚Äôt separate the actors from the roles they play.
Oum le dauphin blanc,Jenna only has done office related stuff since the show ended. She type cast herself if you ask me
Oum le dauphin blanc,Who the hell is Joey
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Honestly, that‚Äôs pretty screwed up just seeing someone as one role solely, but long running TV shows tend to do that. Maybe that‚Äôs why Disney stars become troubled to break the image."
Oum le dauphin blanc,I was gonna say‚Äî Old news. She wrote about this in her book about the industry.
Oum le dauphin blanc,Don‚Äôt judge an actor because of a roll they played well. Pam is a terrible character in that she plays an anchor that keeps Jim from his potential. She played it perfectly
Oum le dauphin blanc,Thusly demonstrating the uselessness of focus groups.
Oum le dauphin blanc,so she got fired from a show that puts their faith in focus groups? how is this bad for her career? this seems like the best thing for her.. now she wont have this shitty show on her resume
Oum le dauphin blanc,"In all honesty, I really liked the actress they had play the role. My wife and I enjoyed the show, and wish it were still on."
Oum le dauphin blanc,"If it‚Äôs a show it makes sense because if general audiences can‚Äôt see the actors together, then the show won‚Äôt work."
Oum le dauphin blanc,Whatta you talking bout? Everybody loves Joey! How you doin? üòÇ
Oum le dauphin blanc,"This outlines how difficult it is for actors to have a career following a successful TV show. And why focus groups are absolutely worthless, unless you are aiming for forgettable mediocrity."
Oum le dauphin blanc,When people take TV characters too seriously....cringe.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"focus groups are good, they ensure cars are made without the steering wheels falling off (this was a joke from i think you should leave season 1)"
Oum le dauphin blanc,Joey is way too good for that
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Well, ""Man With A Plan"" was fine I felt. It was cute and generic, but it also oddly felt like a show that was insanely outdated. I read welcome TV critic who referred to it as ""Matt LeBlanc's Welcome To 1994"""
Oum le dauphin blanc,She dodged a bullet.
Oum le dauphin blanc,I‚Äôd rather watch a movie staring Pam. Maybe they should have ditched Matt instead
Oum le dauphin blanc,She sucks
Oum le dauphin blanc,God people are morons‚Ä¶
Oum le dauphin blanc,Man With a Plan might be the most generic family sitcom I have ever seen and I am including all of the generic family sitcoms of the '80s.
Oum le dauphin blanc,"Well if I ever get my TV show created, then I will be trying my best to get her in a role"
Oum le dauphin blanc,Bro i thought Jim wouldn't be able to stop terrorists but here we are.
Persona,I love Persona but it does not translate at all to Live Action IMO
Persona,"One way this can possibly be good is if it's a J-drama. A few anime/anime adjacent things work alright as dramas, but thinking about something like Catherine as an American production? Yeesh."
Persona,"Persona can work fine as an anime series, but I have a hard time seeing it work well in live-action. I guess it wouldn't be that different from the Japanese live-action JoJo adaptations though."
Persona,"Yoo, live action Jack Bros???"
Persona,Oh god no. No more anime/anime-inspired adaptions. They just don‚Äôt work unless it‚Äôs with a Japanese cast and even then those are hit or miss.
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,live action gonna be terrible.....
Persona,Amazing Tater movie?
Persona,I do not think think they even translated that well to anime. The player-character does not work well as a protagonist outside of a video game.
Persona,Catherine is the the one that could work most as a show if they‚Äôre doing live action.
Persona,"The one live-action adaptation I've seen with a Japanese cast was Fullmetal Alchemist, which ironically needed a western cast."
Persona,"Haven't most of the Japanese casted ones been good?  Death Note, GTO, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Wotakoi, Boys Over Flowers, and Kenshin all seemed to do well with live actions."
Persona,Live-action show adaptations of anime *do* work most of the time. The problem isn't doing live-action adaptations; it's that a lot of adaptations try to make them movies and therefore end up having to cut a whole lot or just rework the story in general to fit a movie runtime.
Persona,"There's no reason to assume these would be on Paramount+; Sega and Sony are separate companies, and Paramount just has the Sonic adaptation rights."
Persona,"How dare you, Yu Narukami was a goddamn riot in the P4 Golden anime."
Persona,P4tA made Yu the best character out of the entire gang.
Persona,He's also a fantastic character in the regular P4 anime. Makes me wish the protag had more of a personality in the actual games.
Persona,"Even though it's an RPG, I felt like Yu always had a somewhat uncanny personality despite the player-based choices in the game. At least at a much more noticeable degree than P3's protagonist."
Persona,"I think it helps that Yu was arguably given the most extensions for character development through two fighting games, a rhythm game, two dungeon crawlers, two anime, and Vita remake."
Persona,"The book this is adapted from was excellent, I've been excited for this show since they announced it. Hopeful they stay true at least to the spirit of the book, since wanting an exact story adaptation is probably a bit too much. Anyway, i cant wait to watch it."
Persona,I gave the book my best effort. I just couldn't get into it.
Persona,"This trailer seems almost breezy in tone compared to some of the dark & extreme places the book goes (though there definitely are hints). I expected something much heavier, but I wonder if that's just a misdirect to bring people in."
Persona,"Empowering people is good. Giving 100,000 of teenage girls superpowers that could be lethal and destructive seems...less good."
Persona,"I'm really hoping the trailer was just focus-grouped to death, and that's why it had this unserious, lightweight tone and framing. The novel is really far from that stylistically; it's award-winning fiction, not a teenage cash grab. Barack Obama put it on his book list. It's got more in common with *The Handmaid's Tale* than *The Hunger Games*. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_%28Alderman_novel%29):

>The Power¬†is a book within a book: a manuscript of an imagined history of the tumultuous era during which women across the world developed and shared the power to emit electricity from their hands. The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy. This historical fiction chronicles the experiences of Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde, as they navigate their rapidly changing world.

Most of those characters aren't YA, either."
Persona,I can't see this being more than a one season thing. Toni Collette is always great but these types of shows don't seem to do well on Amazon and this one was a mess bts.
Persona,Looks great! I can't wait
Persona,I‚Äôll be honest I dont think I can sit through a movie where all of the main characters are teenage girls. I just know how annoying the dialogue is going to be.
Persona,Y The Last Man failed because if you give women all the power then you have to write some women as the villains and western audiences can't handle that. I don't see this doing any better.
Persona,">Hopeful they stay true at least to the spirit of the book, since wanting an exact story adaptation is probably a bit too much. 

That's surprising to hear. Granted I only watched half the trailer, I got serious 'YA' novel vibes before closing the tab and deciding this is probably for a younger demographic than me."
Persona,The book doesn't make it out to be a cool things across the board. Some pretty fucked up things happen as a result.
Persona,Less annoying than John Leguizamo bitching about shit because he thinks he‚Äôs a movie star.
Persona,"Game of Thrones is one of the most popular shows of all time and has numerous women villains. Y The Last Man failed because it was bad, not because western audiences can't handle female villains."
Persona,The novel is far from YA. Gets pretty heavy and dark.
Persona,"The novel is absolutely not YA, although there are a few very important characters that are literally young adults at the book's start. I was actually pretty dismayed by the apparent YA framing in the first half of the trailer, but the second half seemed to steer away from that into more serious drama trailer territory. Maybe front-loading it with that YA vibe was a marketing gimmick, but I really hope it doesn't reflect their adaptation in general, as that would really deviate from the book."
Persona,"> Less annoying than John Leguizamo bitching about shit because he thinks he‚Äôs a movie star.

I dunno. Other than ""The Menu's"" stand out and ridiculously good looking Anya Taylor-Joy, Leguizamo's movie star shtick was funny."
Persona,"90% of YA books are heavy and dark, they just tend to have a rather 'immature' perception to them. Hell, Harry potter starts off as a kids book and ends with wizard Hitler turning the wizarding world into Wizard nazi Germany, and then tries to murder an entire school of kids."
Persona,Except that‚Äôs his real life persona. It‚Äôs funny in the menu. Not when he‚Äôs bitching and moaning irl
Persona,"Not sure what YA books consist of these days, but this book was very much written for adults."
Persona,"I never thought much of Thomas Jane, maybe it was cause I only ever seemed to see him in bad or mediocre films, but he was incredibly good on The Expanse."
Persona,Normally I'm not a huge fan of Billy Bob Thornton but he is putting on an acting clinic in the first season of Fargo. Still my favorite character in that universe.
Persona,"I can't think of any TV shows but I'm usually not a fan of Charlie Sheen's acting, I don't know why. I was very pleasantly surprised by his role in Platoon playing a serious character with emotions."
Persona,"The Other Two is so damn good. 

The Sinner S1 showed me that Jessica Biel can act far more than I gave her credit for. In the forefront of my mind, all I can think of is her Blade: Trinity role and random scenes from forgotten episodes of 7th Heaven. So to watch The Sinner S1 and see her deliver a solid performance was a pleasant surprise."
Persona,"I know this is blasphemy‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt usually enjoy Gary Oldman. While it‚Äôs clear to me that he‚Äôs very talented, I just don‚Äôt like watching him in most roles. 

*Slow Horses* is the first thing I‚Äôve really enjoyed him in since *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*."
Persona,"Sorry I know this post is old, but. I didn't think much of Justin Theroux. I'd only seem him in Mulholland drive where his main job was to wear a cowboy hat with a small dash of being an asshole and a sprinkle of resembling a wooden ventriloquist dummy. All that I'm sure in service to David Lynch's vision but did nothing (imo) for theroux  but it was only like 10 minutes of screen time at any rate  Then many years later it seemed like he got real famous for dating Jennifer Aniston then had a pop culture presence for wearing $500 plain white t-shirts and having famous friends. I didn't really get it but it didn't really matter so whatever. But then I saw The Leftovers. Wow, so yeah I still don't know why anyone cared about him before but I thank him for The Leftovers. A+! I was so surprised."
Persona,He‚Äôs excellent as the coke dealer friend in Boogie Nights
Persona,Pre tiger blood phase.
Persona,"I know right? I hadn't even heard of The Other Two until recently but, now that I'm watching the show, I'm hooked!

Also Biel was great on Bojack Horseman."
Persona,"It's been a minute since I watched the finale but what do you mean he's pretending to be a doctor? I thought the point was he was inspired to take on the role for real after his experience delivering babies years before. 

As a disabled doctor, Jeevan basically becomes a living memorial to his brother and sister."
Persona,"Amazing mini-series, so moving"
Persona,"You probably made the link yourself OP, but if we're talking full circle - did you catch that the store Jeevan helps deliver all the kids at is *also* the town Kirsten comes to in Ep2, where her friend/ex drops out of the troupe to raise her baby?

Kirsten even tells us what becomes of Jeevan's maternity ward mentor."
Persona,"A wonderful, uplifting, joyous series. Very special."
Persona,"The near-miss earlier in that ep with the poster is the meanest show troll I've ever seen, lol

Something I genuinely only twigged afterwards also is that, while Kirsten will never really know the details, she winds up managing to pull off exactly the same thing Miranda did - she saves the people in the airport, and that's the parallel that's being drawn between them.

I have a theory about the spaceman's identity that I will blather to anybody who listens, too.

What a masterpiece this show was though. 
There seems to be a blu ray release sketched in for the 18th on Amazon and I'm grabbing it with both hands, I don't trust HBO Max not to do something weird with it now they're vaulting stuff."
Persona,"Absolutely fantastic show. It really scratched that itch after being completely heartbroken after completing The Leftovers. Hoping to see the cast in future entertainment -particularly Young Kirsten, Jeevan And Miranda"
Persona,"Great point. I also loved the idea that the graphic novel was responsible for splitting them up in the first place (essentially) - then in the future, that child steals it from Kirsten but she lets it go. Then she turns around and finds Jeevan."
Persona,Uuuggghhh. So pretentious!
Persona,"The world that was built up in the show is frankly (heh) insulting. We spend 20 years and the child terrorist ringleader destroys what little information they had from before the collapse and Jeevan is using 18th century remedies. At least in the book they indicate that there is civilization and electricity running in some cities... but christ, the show was awful, post-modernist schlock meant to make us sympathize with a goddamn terrorist"
Persona,"I've been watching ""Station Eleven"" on a recommendation from others and it feels...eh. Very slow and boring. Nearly all the scenes are people sitting around drinking wine and chatting. Hard to be motivated to keep watching after episode 3."
Persona,"Just in the sense that he isn‚Äôt licensed.  You can deliver all the babies in the world, that doesn‚Äôt mean he has training.  So it‚Äôs cool to see him take on this role for the community especially after the first time we see him he tries to save Arthur‚Äôs life even though he‚Äôs not actually trained in CPR"
Persona,A pleasant surprise for sure
Persona,So pretentious!
Persona,Omg no I didn‚Äôt. Wow that‚Äôs fun. Thanks!
Persona,"The characters are very happy. The literal definition of joyful. I‚Äôm not crazy, just literate."
Persona,"Deserved a lot more of an audience than I think it probably got thanks to the bizarre release pattern.

In the US it was dropped in chunks of the season here and there, either side of the New Year, with sod all promo. It was shunted off into a no name Amazon addon with almost literally nothing else on it over in the UK, and it's only been released in parts of Europe this month.

A HBO Max/Discovery mess casualty I think."
Persona,"how the actual fuck is a world without anti-biotics *joyful*? Are you fucking crazy?

They let a terrorist walk away. That's not uplifting! That's enraging!"
Persona,What‚Äôs your spaceman theory I wanna hear it
Persona,I cannot get my head around Deadwyler not getting nominated for something off her almost one-woman-episode. Insane.
Persona,"I get it, even if others didn't"
Persona,"As one of the characters notes, it won't be difficult to rebuild the museum now they're back in contact with the outside world. There are artefacts everywhere.

You're not meant to sympathise with him and he's crazy, not a terrorist.

There are multiple points of dialogue about how they have antibiotics. That's how Tyler survived the stabbing, it's what the kids went to get in the plastic bag, the older kid tells Kirsten to play along with pretending they're something space related."
Persona,I don't think Tyler told the kids to be terrorists. He says to Kirsten he lost control of them while he was incapacitated by the stabbing. One of the kids came up with the idea for suicide bombing.
Persona,"I see what you mean. It's true he's not formally trained as a doctor. But he still has informal training and years of experience as a healer. He's not faking it or acting impulsively like he did in the theater. I think you're right this sets up a nice symmetry, but it's one of mirror opposites. Jeevan is a very different person by the end."
Persona,"Nobody to issue licenses anymore in the post pan world, to be fair, and when he leaves the store in the babypocalypse episode it's sketched out pretty clearly that he's going to spend the intervening years doing the legwork and learning how to do this stuff right. He's what they've got for a doctor now."
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,My favourite line from the series.
Persona,"The show does some really cool stuff with cycles and loops that you only pick up on on rewatch, I really strongly recommend doing another full watch because there's a whole lot of stuff waiting for you to find the second time.

Re the town, it's called St Deborah by the Water. Terry the doctor eventually reveals her real name is Deborah. Go back and check out the statue of ""Saint Deborah"" that Lori Petty comments on as they're coming into town, who we're told died in a chemical fire (some folks have speculated it might have been arson committed by another character we already know too, but there's no way to know)

You can also see the wreck of the store's old delivery truck on the way into town, and the hippy dippy focus on child rearing and midwifery comes from its roots as an improvised delivery centre.

I won't spoil much else, but I will say Kirsten's slightly on-edge demeanour in ep 2 makes way more sense when you realise you see some of these locations twice - once under snow. Kirsten's ""What if a wolf ate the baby?!?"" line is just a gag about how clingy she is the first time through - but it sounds much more reasonable in when you know more about her history in the area.

(Ps keep a very close eye out for the name on the Birth Certificate Deborah writes up for the baby whose mom died in labour.)"
Persona,"Maybe partially those things mentioned, but it still could have become a sleeper hit regardless.

I found the show well made and acted, but honestly I didn't care for the comic book parallels nor did I like most characters except Jeevan and child Kirsten. I don't think it needs to be a different show, but it certainly is more niche than most in terms of gripping emotionally. Many good shows deserve to have a wider audience, but often it has to do with the product rather than the release schedule or promotion.

Another example would be FX's Legion."
Persona,"1 - They have antibiotics again. It's specifically mentioned.

2 - Tyler is a crank and he's not-not dangerous now, but he didn't order the attacks and attempting to ""punish"" him would have triggered a bloodbath."
Persona,"I think that's Kirsten herself under the visor, metaphorically.

In a live chat, Patrick Somerville mentioned that he tried to reserve K names/words to have something to do with Kirsten - so for example, the reason Jeevan's kid is called Key is after the key Kirsten didn't have on the night of the outbreak, which sent him on the road the rest of his life wound up taking.

In the S11 comic book, it's strongly implied that Doctor Eleven is actually the kid - called simply K - who once led the Undersea revolt, now an adult, somehow trapped in a time loop, where she now just helplessly witnesses the whole tragedy play out again. 

(This is Kirsten's theory to Tyler, and if you check out the comic pages it makes sense - K has a distinct skin tone, and the artwork highlights Eleven's bare feet to show us ""he"" has it too. Somerville has also said that Kirsten is likely right about her interpretations of the comic)

When the spaceman shows up in the show's real world, he's sometimes clearly highlighted in the shot and sometimes semi-hidden in the background, though he's always watching over the POV characters in a similar way to K/Eleven. 

But he shows up for some more than others; he shows up to watch over little Kirsten and Miranda, but never for Clarke or Jeevan. He doesn't show up for Tyler as far as we know, even though he's got a whole child cult built around Doctor Eleven's storyverse.

Episode 7 is one of the few Kirsten related episodes we don't see the space suit in - but Mackenzie-Davis-Kirsten is performing ""his"" role anyway, as a spectral, benevolent sidestage observer. She can't change anything anymore than Doctor Eleven could - she can't save Lonegan/Frank or affect the outcome at all. Her child self even plays the K role in the play she's contrived. All she *can* do is observe it from her new adult perspective and take stock of her child self more clearly.

Ultimately though, they have to go their separate ways, divided by the door of Frank's room in a shot that directly echos the comicbook image of Eleven, divided from K by a glass wall.

I think the spaceman essentially represents Kirsten's adult self hanging over the moments ""he"" shows up in, as if she's haunting her own past from the future. Almost all of the moments he appears in are ones Kirsten either directly experiences or ones that have a major influence on her indirectly- she winds up, in many ways, the keeper of Miranda's legacy, and emulates her in saving the airport. And the last and only time we see him alongside Adult Kirsten is when she is watching the Tyler/Clarke Hamlet play out; when she's finally coming into her own and stepping up to her place as an adult, as a director, and as the troupe's new leader. 

That last shot of him is also the only time we see the spaceman in the show's ""present day"" and I think, in a sense, that moment of him watching over Kirsten as she's watching over everyone else is basically the point they come back together."
Persona,And he was driven ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô because he wanted to try and help people but the guy in charge said he was dangerous so they were gonna kick him and his mom out. Turns out the guy in charge was just a power hungry has been trying to feel important because he wasn‚Äôt in the life before. Everything that happens to Tyler in the show is Clark‚Äôs fault and he was just trying to get back at Clark by destroying the bullshit he built since he chose that over helping other people
Persona,"I downloaded episode 6 and yes, antibiotics were mentioned - that's my mistake, but it's apparent on viewing the scene again that Kristen doesn't know that this is still available, and what is made is probably not exactly pharmaceutical grade."
Persona,"Sure, and they dug up the mines by themselves?"
Persona,A healer? They don't have fucking antibiotics!
Persona,"Big potential for the show to faceplant though, given how delicate the magic of the book feels, and I mean they did make some BIG changes. The most iconic chapter of the book isn't even in it, and the main element people remember from the show was an addition. They pulled it off with real grace, but it was by no means guaranteed.

(I do have some grumbles about the Tyler stuff that said)"
Persona,"Personally, I found the show a lot more moving than the book.  Even the author has praised the show for making connections in the story that she did not."
Persona,Holy shit this blew my mind! Sorry just watched the show and dont see new threads lol. What was the name on the birth cert? I just finished it and not due for a rewatch just yet haha.
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,"Yea he‚Äôs dangerous he literally just bombed an airport and almost killed a guy on stage! Not only did they not punish him they let Alex (or whatever her name is) go with him 

I don‚Äôt recall them mentioning antibiotics. For the burns I recall a ‚Äúhealing paste‚Äù at most."
Persona,"I don't quite go with that reading tbh. Clark is flawed, but Tyler is definitely a weirdo from the get go, and even if he wasn't he does bear responsibility for what he is now.

What's more, Kirsten has been through far worse than Tyler, has grown up thinking she's probably responsible for getting Frank killed and maybe even Jeevan - if he hadn't abandoned her - has had to kill at least once by the time she was about ten, and was nursing a stab wound when she was found by Lori Petty (and there's also a strong possibility the Red Hats she's crossed paths with as a child and again as an adult were pedos)

Kirsten has grown into a fundamentally compassionate person with a kind of public vocation. Tyler had it easy by comparison and kidnaps kids from their families to a life of squalor just to play out his mommy and daddy issues.

Clark handled things badly, but Tyler's a grown ass adult and the fact he can switch off and on the Prophet persona whenever he wants tells me he has the wherewithal to at least tell right from wrong to some extent."
Persona,"Yes? I mean, it's fine you didn't like the show but it feels like you're fighting the narrative to justify your preference."
Persona,Would you mind spoiling a little detail from the most iconic chapter? You've made me mighty curious!
Persona,"I looooved the show and finally picked up the book a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm about 2/3rds in. Clark‚Äôs flight just got diverted to Severn City.

It‚Äôs amazing how much in the adaptation is different but still maintains the general spirit of the book. The show felt uneven to me, with the past episodes being much more engaging than the present episodes. So far that unevenness is completely absent from the book. And often the present chapters are grabbing me even more. 

I‚Äôm excited to see what happens with Tyler, because that definitely felt like it missed in the show. But so far I‚Äôd say the show‚Äôs version of the past is either as good or better than the book. The show‚Äôs adaptation of the present is pretty much across the board worse."
Persona,"I missed some of Kirsten's inner thoughts. There's a bit where Book Kirsten realizes she's about to die and can't save herself that I found very affecting, and the show seemed to find Tyler way more fucking interesting than I did."
Persona,"It's Alexandra. The baby is Alex. 

Alex's mother was Rose. When Alex sang a tribute to the woman Tyler talked about, she was unknowingly singing a tribute to her own mom."
Persona,"That's my point, yep.

First watch, ep2 plays out like Kirsten is being unreasonable and pulling a completely bizarre worst case scenario out of her ass just because she's desperate to keep Charlie close.

By the second time you watch it, you'll know exactly why she went there, and indeed it's clear she was actually being pretty rational about almost everything that initially read like an eccentricity in ep2."
Persona,">Not only did they not punish him they let Alex (or whatever her name is) go with him

Again, ""punishing"" him isn't an option. He and the kid cult are a moving disaster that gets averted. The alternative is having all those thousands of kids do who knows what. Last time the thing was a suicide bombing. 

Kirsten is well aware of how volatile the kids are, she knows they still have a huge stockpile of landmines, and she knows that they're on the way once the tower burns. Her options are to either pull a miracle out of her ass and keep everyone alive a little longer, just as Miranda did, or else try metaphorically stabbing Tyler again and trigger bedlam. She pulls off the first one and does what she can to decommission the kid ringleader Hayley.

That's life. They don't live in a fair world anymore than we do. The Alex thing sat uneasily with me, but what's the alternative? She's an adult.

>I don‚Äôt recall them mentioning antibiotics. 

Episode six."
Persona,"Oh yeah it doesn‚Äôt excuse all of what he does as an adult but everything he does after he leaves was to survive. Sure Kirsten handled her shit better as she was also trying to survive, but he was still a kid trying to navigate the world on his own too. Plus his parents were both famous actors so it‚Äôs not like he had a ‚Äònormal‚Äô upbringing to start with. Kirsten might not have had one either but at least she had Jeevan and Frank to help her through the beginning instead of Clark and Tyler‚Äôs mom. But the way Clark handled the situation at the airport, at least to me, explains Tyler‚Äôs motivations a little bit more and shows it‚Äôs more than him just being a crazy terrorist"
Persona,"Exactly.

They have insider knowledge on this one, too. The kids we see using the mines as suicide vests are actually *from* Pingtree. They knew the mines were there, and we're told the mines have been removed and re installed in recent memory, so they would have watched a bunch of them being defused and reactivated and maybe even shown how.

Incidentally, this is also probably the only reason Alex didn't get them all killed either time, because unbeknownst to her the mines were already gone."
Persona,"No, I'm angry at the fact that this show is being praised as being ""hopeful"" and ""uplifting"" while attempting to make an idiot kid who later became a child terrorist ringleader sympathetic! 

Do you think the kids dug up the mines from Pingtree themselves? Of course not. In the book he's a Christian fundementalist!"
Persona,"Sure, it's ""An Incomplete List"", I sometimes see it excerpted on its own as a kind of free verse poetry or else used for spoken word pieces.

It's a list of some of the basic everyday stuff that's gone after the wipeout. 

One big loss/difference between the book and the show, is that the book makes a much bigger point of having no easy answer to the question of ""preserving what's left"" vs ""letting it go to move on"", where the show is comparatively very much Team Let Go/Move On.

So there'a a lot less made in the show of the fact that Kirsten is one of the few who is the exact right age to remember life before clearly, but have had to grow up and be formed in the one after. Older troupe members will always see the post pan world as a kind of overlay over the ""real world"", while to the younger ones, the post pandemic world is the only one that's ever existed. 

Kirsten is one of the handful left with a foot in each camp, and really wrestles with it, and the fact nobody older or younger can quite relate. She believes that ""the more you remember, the more you've lost"", but still clearly treasures the memories she has of Arthur. She's adapted herself incredibly well to the post pan world and carries almost nothing she doesn't need, but still obsessively collects clippings from old gossip magazines about him. And so on.

Incomplete List crystallizes some of that, in a way that isn't quite in tune with the show. It's a list of all the stuff that would be lost in an event on that scale, but also kind of a love letter to how extraordinary it is to have this stuff now, and how sad it actually would be to see even our flawed kind of world end, even when it sprinkles in little details of people having fun after it.

You can read a chunk of it here - https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6876800-an-incomplete-list-no-more-diving-into-pools-of-chlorinated"
Persona,Is the book chronologically sequential or have broken chronology like the show?
Persona,"Oh what.... the fuuuck wow.... holy shit dude, I forgot tyler was there and forgot him talking about Rose. So... he wasn't lying about his wife Rose? Is he's not Alex's dad? I mean he was like 13 at the time but the girl looked high school age possibly."
Black Summer,"I like hyping Black Summer. The first season was just s series of action vignettes which was kind of nice as an antidote to the grim plodding nonsense of the Walking Dead.

 But even enjoying s1 I didn't think it was sustainable but you're right S2 was more ambitious with the way the story was structured. While they kept their vignette format the coming together of the separate storylines did allow the characters to build in a way that made me care more for them, in particular the mother and daughter. 

I wouldn't call it HBO calibre but the central cast are pretty good and I do hope they have plans for an s3. Unfortunately not a lot of people I know watched it so I am not betting on it."
Black Summer,S2 was incredible. But I have zero faith Netflix will do S3.
Black Summer,"Glad to see some love for it here. It wasn't that popular but I honestly think it had some of the coolest most intense action scenes of any Netflix series. If you like the infamous hallway scenes from Daredevil and Punisher. The first season is like, entirely a ""hallway scene"" lol."
Black Summer,Yeah season 2 was really good so dont expect a season 3. Just netflix doing netflix shit.
Black Summer,"Poll time: was Spears‚Äô buddy from the old world actually there in real life or was he some kind of mental guilt/death manifestation in Spears‚Äô mind? As far as I remember we never see him interact with anyone else or do anything that Spears couldn‚Äôt have done if he was alone. Either way it‚Äôs a great episode, just wondering what others think."
Black Summer,The long takes are soo impressive. These actors cardio is next level.
Black Summer,How much does it matter to have seen S1 if I just want to watch S2?
Black Summer,Why can‚Äôt the zombies see through windows? People just close the door on a zombie and then walk in front of a bay window at night with candles and a fireplace going. Why don‚Äôt the zombies just don‚Äôt smash through?
Black Summer,"I watched it straight through without stopping what a ride.  They paced the show perfectly.  It didn't drag in the middle episodes at all and really went deep in the slower moments not feeling contrived at all.

All the characters were quite interesting and I love how the show makes you think about each of them and what their backgrounds could have been.

I have faith we will see Season 3 news soon.  Netflix supports a lot of foreign content moreso now as those are their markets in this point in time.  Black Summer will get views I think to continue.

Season 3 I think Anna drives Rose and Ray Nazeri back to the ski lodge; interesting character development there how things ended in S2.  I think Mance will arrive there too.  The leader of the group that captured Ray was locked in the warehouse with the zombies I presume dead but maybe not if climbed in a plane or on top of something.  There will be conflict and resolution to whatever the source of the problems were at the beginning of S2.

Sun meanwhile will arrive somewhere.  Rose and Anna will make contact aboarding a plane meeting Sun at the compound.  Think Day of the Dead for 3rd season inspiration and citing the origin of the outbreak.  This will wrap things up pre-Z-Nation."
Black Summer,"I appreciate a good action scene, and I really appreciate the way these were shot, especially for how over the top they were. They were insane and ridiculous but I never felt lost, you get to follow the scenes all the way through. I thought season two struck a great balance between the action and story. I would have loved a third season. Something to complete the series for a change of pace.

The Walking Dead had the worst action scenes, they were so lazy. Just a bunch of disconnected shots of people firing at someone off-screen, then cut to the next character, repeat, no one gets hit. You rarely have a clear idea of where people are or where they are being shot from."
Black Summer,"Yeah, I doubt it‚Äôll see a season 3‚Ä¶ but then again I said this after season 1."
Black Summer,Same. My only point is the drastic improvement over the course of 2 seasons.
Black Summer,I thought Rose was such a refreshing main character. So many protags like Rick Grimes make so many weird decisions to amp up drama but if Rose doesn‚Äôt like your vibe she will shoot you in the fucking head. Felt very realistic for a bloodthirsty mama bear in the apocalypse.
Black Summer,I wonder this too. I‚Äôm banking on he was a hallucination brought on by the side effects of being close to death
Black Summer,"I mean, u can watch season 2 without finishing one but IMO it would be far less rewarding. Season 1 ISNT BAD‚Ä¶ it just isn‚Äôt great. And I think season 2 is great. Watching season one first, though, definitely escalates it."
Black Summer,"You don't need to see season 1 first.  

I think Season 2 stands on it's own.  

You can tell who survives Season 1 and see how characters have changed is the only reason for 1st season but really might be more.rewarding just begin with Season 2 and go backwards I think."
Black Summer,People close doors in this show? I nearly fell of out my seat when they used their guns to shoot a zombie point blank
Black Summer,"City doors vs. Country Doors.  

The zombie in the 1st episode smashed through doors and glass but the guy who killed after stopped to help had it coming.  I think the Zombies sense someone's Karmic energy.

They did break the metal doors in the hangar too."
Black Summer,Again good point. I never felt spatially lost with any of the action scenes. Good choreography
Black Summer,Fuck TWD
Black Summer,"I‚Äôve also been rewatching TWD lately and after watching Black Summer the action feels like a joke lol. I loved the decision in Black Summer to make the zombies reanimate in seconds, makes those wild gunfights so tense when you immediately start hearing the growls and shit gets out of control so fast. I also liked the choice to have pretty much no music at all in the action scenes, made it so eerie and haunting.

Not to completely diss the Walking Dead, the acting is pretty good on average and the characters are engaging. For awhile, that is."
Black Summer,"It had no buzz at all, the subreddit ist practically dead and production is probably very expensive but I still have hope. Usually Netflix clearly announces it very early on if they cancel a show, but there wasn't an announcement since the s2 release, so technically it's not dead!"
Black Summer,"Rose didn‚Äôt feel like an actress. Rose felt like this was all reality. I love Rose, such a believable performance. I‚Äôd rather the first season a 6/10. Second season, though, 10/10 no question."
Black Summer,"First his name isn't Spears I don't think?  That was a lie he gave at the beginning with the guy claiming he knew him?

I think he made the fire earlier and was tackled by the zombie so was real but also a repressed memory to make amends with.  He might have gotten infected in the woods and knew it was time to depart or maybe just worried about it and will be back in Season 3.  Bygones was the lesson he gave as he rode off is how I choose to interpret it unless the show says otherwise."
Black Summer,They take their time between each season treating it as an anthology as we didn't start season 2 at the stadium which is what I remember.  You just fill in that the mission was to get to a private airfield multiple groups vying to do so.
Black Summer,"It sort of concludes at the end of Season 2, but it's an 'open' ending, not a 'closed' ending.

And there are storylines that were not complete, so there's plenty of scope for Season 3."
Black Summer,"You get a good enough conclusion to satisfy what happens in Season 2. I enjoy this show much more than I thought I would. Season 1 was wild. Season 2 was different but good and had some standout episodes.

I love the camera work in this show, but some questions are left unanswered when the season ends. It doesn't end on a supreme cliffhanger, just minor things that may or may not get addressed in a Season 3."
Black Summer,"Yeah, you can watch it, no big cliffhanger ending from what I remember"
Black Summer,"Was it cancelled it something? S2 is definitely worth a watch regardless. It's legit good and an improvement over S1 imo. The non-linear narrative is a little disorienting at first, but the way they tie the various stories together at the end is really impressive."
Black Summer,"Black Summer Season 2 was a fucking disjointed disaster.

It doesn't tie anything up, mostly because there was nothing to tie up."
Black Summer,"Season 2 isn't worth watching. It's a mess plot and character wise and on top of that, it's really, really boring."
Black Summer,It‚Äôs been a while but it definitely doesn‚Äôt end on a cliffhanger. It‚Äôs really good
Black Summer,Is a season 3 coming?
Black Summer,"I just watched season 1...I mean it was alright, just because it had zombies, but it's just bad lol. It's real bad lol. It makes me think of those crappy scifi channel shows before they rebranded. It's just so corny lol. Ty, i'll probably find something else. I understand why there isn't going to be a season 3, after watching shows like 'All of us are dead', black summer would be an embarrassment to continue."
Black Summer,"Nah, unfortunately canceled. Ends on a cliff hanger, but that falls in line with the shoes theme. Still worth watching as it's the best zombie show to date, with znation being second as it's mostly a comedy (but still far better for drama than TWD)."
Black Summer,No idea; but I wish!
Black Summer,"i loved black summer. it put walking dead to shame, but i never hear anyone talking about it and i dont know anyone who watched it."
Black Summer,"No news in a while on whether or noyt a season 3 is coming. Kinda disappointed.

That one episode where everyone is trying to take over that manor in the snow is amazing."
Black Summer,"The best zombie show on television imo. The season 2 finale chase scene, gets the people going!"
Black Summer,"The second season had 2 of the best hours of television I saw that year (2021?)

Was kind bummed when a certain character died."
Black Summer,"I love Black Summer too but am sort of the opposite of you.

I thought S1 was solid but nothing special. However, S2 was legit good imo. The nonlinear storytelling was a little disorienting at first like you say, but they tied it all together really well by the end. 

Went back and rewatched S1 after finishing and it just confirmed my feeling."
Black Summer,I love it and I'm annoyed with Netflix that they seem to be slow boating it. We should have like 5 seasons by now.
Black Summer,"I liked the more ""realistic"" approach compared to other shows. I wish they did more tho :("
Black Summer,How did you like it compared with Z Nation?  The last season of Z Nation was total crap for me and I didn't even finish watching.
Black Summer,"It's been like 2-years now without any word of renewal? Not sure why Netflix would drag their heels for so long. 

I thought it was great, was a hidden gem that I only discovered due to lockdown. Loved the little vignettes style with some overarching characters, season 2 had some brilliant parts - especially the fight at the house and the airstrip finale."
Black Summer,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it in this era of zombie media saturation. It was a surprisingly fresh take.
Black Summer,I would also like to point out that it has absolutely the best Atmos soundtrack of any TV show (or media in general). There's a scene in the second season where there's someone walking upstairs and all the noise takes place completely overhead. So awesome.
Black Summer,"This show did the chaos of the zombie outbreak very well, which is always my favorite part. The best scene was when >!huge amounts of people were running for the stadium because they heard there was refuge there, and it became a giant clusterfuck where zombies were attacking and people were shooting wildly while running, trying to kill them and often as not hitting and killing non-zombie people, who then immediately turned into more zombies.!< Good times!"
Black Summer,The sound is incredible as well.
Black Summer,"I really love how fast everything goes to shit during the action scenes, it's a beautiful chaos."
Black Summer,I just started watching it today and I'm really enjoying it! I love the frenetic energy
Black Summer,Low key better than The Last of Us
Black Summer,Also. I just realized this is a spin off of z nation? this is good news to me. a new show to watch. apparently z nation is good? Until s4 or something?
Black Summer,"I enjoyed it, but I often thought the characters made idiotic choices."
Black Summer,"This was my go-to show before TLOU. Just give me one more season.

Too bad it's been slept on."
Black Summer,It was good but I enjoyed Z Nation better. The campy tone of Z Nation was so good. (Except for season 4 that was a disaster)
Black Summer,I despised it. I thought the acting and aesthetic were horrible.
Black Summer,"> No news in a while on whether or noyt a season 3 is coming. Kinda disappointed.

Yeah, I check on it occasionally. Good thing I'll say as at least it hasn't been canceled."
Black Summer,Yea this show does chaos so well. I also heard that it was canceled but i guess it's not? Wish we could get a s3. Definitely does not need it but would be fun to see where some of the characters end up
Black Summer,Mance right? Wow they earned that scene so much!!! Felt like he was doing what every main character already does in ep 1 on other zombie shows.
Black Summer,"Those two episodes were phenomenal.

S 2 Ep 5 ""White Horse""

S 2 Ep 7  ""The Lodge"""
Black Summer,"s1 and s2 feel pretty different overall. i think it took a few episodes to get on s2 wavelength. s2 definitely has a more flamboyant cast of characters, which I loved. a lot of people ""popped"" in a way the characters in s1 didn't, even if that sacrificed the more ""realistic"" feel that s1 had."
Black Summer,"I only watched the first season of Z Nation. If I remember correctly it was a bit humorous and slapstick? Black Summer is serious, not humorous at all."
Black Summer,Black Summer feels like the makers of Znation were challenged to make a serious zombie show and they nailed it. Its awesome that it's a prequel that stands on its own. Both are definitely better than TWD.
Black Summer,very different shows i think! I was a fan of the last of us i don't think I loved it though. For sure an amazing watch and I think looking at it as a whole will make me appreciate it more over time. TLOU show had a more theatrical feel to it. black summer is a lot more gritty.
Black Summer,"Its way better, John Hyams is much more qualified than anyone involved with TLOU."
Black Summer,Hard disagree.
Black Summer,">it drives me up the wall to see it getting so much praise

The explanation is very simple: very few people are discussing the series, usually people who like it. It applies to almost every less known series."
Black Summer,"I actually find it a relief to have such a bare bones show where it is mostly action vignettes. One thing I grew to detest about The Walking Dead was how strung along it was. While I originally liked the characters, I thought the drama became overwrought and I ended dropping it. At least with Black Summer I know it will just be action set pieces. It actually has just the right amount of character development which, given that it is mostly action, is a challenge for the actors.

>They clearly took the ‚Äúhow does everyone land perfect headshots all the time‚Äù complaint about The Walking Dead thats been regurgitated for years, and over corrected the shit out of it, because nobody can land a single shot in this show

Well considering most people don't practice shooting on the move I found it pretty realistic. I used to shoot IPSC (USPSA) and 3-gun and I can tell you most untrained people can't even hit a static target when they are on the move.

Also your comment about how no one can single shot is unfair. In S1 the soldier who was part of their group single shots a few zombies.

What I don't find realistic is that they don't reload enough. I just gave up expecting them to conform to even US-sized magazines. But I'm not going to let that wreck my enjoyment. And I'm still wondering how the Korean girl took to the Uzi so quickly\~\~. Even with national service in Korea do they get training in submachineguns?\~\~ EDIT: Apparently she is not from S. Korea. In one of her monologues in Korean she says she escaped from North Korea which explains why she is pretty awesome. 

There's certainly a lot of silliness to the show and I make fun of a lot of it but if you distill it to someone who hasn't watched it as ""action vignettes where people just try to get away from zombies"" and that's it, I don't think anyone should be disappointed going in.

EDIT: because I found out more about Son, the Korean girl."
Black Summer,"I agree, horrible show that feels like a poorly directed panic attack. I tried to get through a couple episodes cause I loved Z Nation but I just couldn't keep doing it to myself."
Black Summer,My wife and I just watched a couple of episodes and the complete and utter lack of logic in this show is so bad that it almost feels like satire at points.
Black Summer,"Never downvote opinions but insecure remarks like this annoy me:

>	You can sit on your high horse and call it ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and ‚Äúgenre-bending‚Äù as much as you want

>	I swear the people who constantly rave about this show are the people who though Walking Dead was for idiots, and think they have some sort of intellectual superiority because they like the ""realistic"" and ""gritty"" zombie show

Who upset you lol. I‚Äôd bet most normal people don‚Äôt believe themselves to be intellectually superior because of their taste in zombie TV shows. You come off in this post as doing exactly what you accuse others of: ‚ÄúThe people who like this show are _____!‚Äù

Maybe they just have different tastes? And maybe most people aren‚Äôt judging you for yours - maybe they don‚Äôt even care."
Black Summer,"I just find it quite entertaining, the things I disliked the most about TWD are the strengths of this show.

The plot moves very quickly and they don't spend time on inflated character drama.

> because nobody can land a single shot in this show

Thats great! A lot of these people didnt have any sort of weapons  training before shit ended, and hitting a running target in the head while you are panicking is very hard to do.

> you routinely get scenes where entire groups of heavily armed characters are completely overrun by like 4 zombies and it‚Äôs annoying as hell.

This is a good thing, it shows how much of a threat the virus actually is. I also like the detail of people randomly getting hit by friendly fire, then turning into a zombie."
Black Summer,"I like basically everything you described. It's frantic in a way that really works for me. It feels more 28 Days Later or the intro to 28 Weeks Later than anything else. 

No one can land a headshot because most people have little training and the zombies are all chargers. They're ferocious and fast. I'm on the 2nd season now. It's pretty clear that everyone knows to run the second a zombie notices them.

I also sort of love that it's just little stories happening during the outbreak. I don't really need anything to be explained and the characters are all secondary to the action. I also love that no character is safe.

All of that just works for me."
Black Summer,"Lance is the stupidest character I‚Äôve ever seen. He never closes doors, his axe go fucking stuck when he finally got the balls to try to kill a zombie that he could have let behind long ago and then he proceeded to kill the person who fucking saved him and got bit because he‚Äôs a fi king coward. I hate him so much I hope he die because I haven‚Äôt finished it yet. Just damn, he‚Äôs so fucking stupid."
Black Summer,"Z Nation was a follow up I believe as they mention Black Summer. That's cheesey as fuck but I loved it, shame it was cancelled."
Black Summer,"It‚Äôs so bad, some of the worst writing I‚Äôve ever seen and the characters are all borderline retarded"
Black Summer,I‚Äôve never watched Black Summer but am pondering doing so which makes it so weird that the posts on Reddit either rave about how good it is or rant about how the show is the most awful thing ever made. I‚Äôve no idea what to expect from it lol!
Black Summer,Thanks for making me want to watch the show?
Black Summer,"Honestly the fact that nobody in the show knew how to close a fucking door was absolutely infuriating. Like, these characters are all frantically trying to find weapons to use against the zombies when simply quietly closing the door behind them would work just fine. 

I just gave up after the 4th episode."
Black Summer,"The gun fights are ludicrous. Guys running (or standing) in the open without cover, shooting randomly it seems until they get shot.. And  AR-15's discharged indoors that 
are quiter than a .22. And how did Rose and her daughter survive shootouts armed with a shotgun and a bolt action hunting rifle,  against guys in body armor and full auto rifles? Only on TV I guess. I'm sure none of the crew has likely ever fired a real gun before."
Black Summer,"Just awful! I watched it because Stephen King made some positive comments about it. I love him and love how generous he is in reviewing other horror offers but stop being magnanimous and truly review these abominations! The plot and characters are under developed and frankly boring. I suffered my way far into the disaster it is and finally surrendered to the part of my brain that craves entertainment!  The character development is - so, well, underdeveloped and boring that I had to keep going back to past episodes to remember certain characters and their significance. Finally gave up in season two because I couldn't watch 1 more minute of zombies chasing people and getting shot. Ugh. What a waste of time!"
Black Summer,"Lol, I could say the same about Fast & Furious.....Not everything is for everyone, There's a reason why we have variety."
Black Summer,Companies hire people to write positive things about their products.
Black Summer,"> call it ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and ‚Äúgenre-bending‚Äù as much as you want but as far as I‚Äôm concerned its tedious and annoying

I have never watched this show but I feel validated when people recognize this.

Subverting a trope should never be used as a substitute for quality!"
Black Summer,"I love a good zombie show but I couldn't get beyond the first episode of Season 1 when I originally saw it. 

Then seeing the ads for Season 2, they made it look like an entirely different show"
Black Summer,first season is really terrible. it was kinda hate-watch for me. season 2 better be decent!
Black Summer,"Your criticism is valid, but the show also looks fresh and has some good character development."
Black Summer,You're a fool. It's awesome.
Black Summer,Has nobody in black summer ever seen a zombie show? I can't gut every time armed people ( guns) get attacked by zombies they never aim for the head. It's freaking zombie 101. Supposedly this show gets good reviews I think it's terrible. The developers may think it's a new take but it just sucks. 28 days was a new and cool take on zombies.
Black Summer,"I'm only on episode 4 but the character motivations and story logic don't seem clear. They're trying to make it to the stadium, got it but they seem to just drive around in circles of a neighborhood screaming. I thought ""hm, maybe they've been displaced and they're lost"" but the driver says he worked in the area and would know how to get to the highway. Whereas in the last of us show, they show traffic jams and military blockades keeping people from getting out clean. That makes sense.

Theres also not that many zombies or people for that matter and it's only been 5 weeks? So there's this element of societal decay but there really isn't a clear motive for thieves. I'll give it a little more time hoping more is exposed but it just seems like bad story writing."
Black Summer,"You must not watch much bad tv if you think black summer is terrible 

It‚Äôs well shot, well acted, and the action sequences are pretty awesome 

It has some great writing in certain episodes, and pretty solid dialogue.

It‚Äôs biggest crime is being too chaotic with silly plot points at times"
Black Summer,"I disagree completely with this take. The people who enjoyed the walking dead are, without a doubt, idiots. And the people that enjoyed black summer are either dually a group of idiots that enjoyed both shows, or simply a separate batch of idiots entirely. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is they‚Äôre both idiots."
Black Summer,"Agree 100%

Finished watching the first three episodes and i just can't stand the pace of the show. I don't mind slow films, but this is just annoying. There's absolutely nothing happening, and then when something happens it's the stupidest thing you could imagine. People running in circles, shooting everywhere except to the head when they already know a headshot is the only viable option. 

The camera shakes out of knowhere so you can have a sense of ""movement, rhythm and caothic action"" but it just makes you want to throw up... i mean, i know they wanted to do a somewhat realistic zombie show but that's not realistic at all when characters never learn from what they see and just keep acting the same way one time after the other. 

I just gave up."
Black Summer,I just power watched the entire 2 seasons and I have to agree. I liked it at first thinking the storyline was building up for season 2 but it just didn't happen. I would be very surprised if it got a 3rd season.
Black Summer,"Just coming in here a year later to say: 

*this is the worst dialogue I‚Äôve ever encountered in a show with a budget clearly so large.* 

The visuals are cool but Jesus Christ the script must‚Äôve been written by a failing 9th grade English student. 
People acting like this is chocked up to certain viewers being too ~high brow~ is just moronic, this shit just sucks. 

One other thing no one seems to be mentioning: 

*How the fuck does the Korean person not speak any English but somehow always understands what everyone is saying and also manages to perfectly communicate complex ideas to the other characters that can‚Äôt speak korean?!*

this show feels like an aggravating fever dream. 

*I have only managed to enjoy by relentlessly making fun of it while watching with my s/o.*"
Black Summer,"It‚Äôs amazing how many people show up on Reddit, intentionally logging in to a virtual space with limitless possibilities to explore and discuss topics, so they can shit on a show they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get‚Äù."
Black Summer,I guess i really enjoyed it because it felt like thats what would actually happen if something like that occurred. I mean i was pretty glued to the screen when i was watching it. But thats just one person‚Äôs opinion.
Black Summer,"I guess Kingdom just ruined every other Zombie show for me. It's basically fucking Game of thrones of Zombie genre. It's so refreshing in so many ways, there is actual plot going on in the background tied to the infection, strong interesting characters, really fucking scary zombies, and hey, it's set in medieval Korea. I never seen more original and interesting setting for a zombie show. That alone makes it stand out a lot. It set the bar extremely high.

Walking dead had beautifuly crafted apocalyptic world, and bet on making people the real threat, not zombies. Which i kinda like, but it's ridiculously slow, has lots of overthought and mostly bullshit wannabe philosophical talks (that often last like half of episode) and sometimes the plot armor is just unbearably obvious. I dropped it shortly after Negan arc started, it just felt like the show just refuses to move anywhere interesting, just a bad guy of the season that's a little more crazy than the guy before him.

The spin off tried to fix couple of TWD problems while introducing others. And then Nick quits the show and it just kinda falls apart.

Black summer's just..... well.... it had lots of problems from the beginning that i was willing to get over.... and then the school happened.  And i just fucking can't go beyond that. I guess it's the kind of show i can imagine hate-watching with couple of friends while being high and laughing my ass off.... but that's about it xD"
Black Summer,"You are full of cap, bad taste in movies is all i can say, your sense of what a good series is just broken, I respectfully ask you to stop commenting on zombie shows if you know absolutely nothing about it. Im korean and I think son isnt that great of a character, Im lucky because I can understand what she is saying but if I didnt I see no point in her character at all."
Fairy gone,"Just like the actual show, I didn't make it too far into your review. But you did give me an unintentional snort-laugh.

> In fact, he is a genuine wine somalian.

David Schwimmer wouldn't be able to play a convincing Somalian. He might, however, be a passable sommelier."
Fairy gone,"I don't know if you wrote about this because that's too much reading for me right now, but do you remember that flashback scene of Schwimmer's wife being hit by the car? I have no fucking idea what was going through their head when they did that scene because its supposed to be sad, but it was just flat out hilarious.

There was also another scene where the Schwimmer's son almost gets hit by a car and he literally just sits down right in the same spot and starts drawing his dead mom. 

This show was fucking stupid."
Fairy gone,I appreciate your review in lieu of viewing a show that I was passively curious about. Funny and fairly succinct.
Fairy gone,">Dion is also in good with his public defender, Marissa **(played by E.E. Cummings)**. You can tell by the way he's fucking her on a table two minutes into the Pilot episode.

To be fair, E.E. Cummings is [pretty dreamy.](http://www.litkicks.com/sites/default/files/eecummings.jpg)"
Fairy gone,It wasn't bad it just tried to do too much.  Every character had some sort of lie they were telling someone else.  Half the characters were doing illegal shit. Its like people don't understand that Breaking Bad didn't start at the fifth season.  You have to build up to that shit.  I honestly have the same issue with Ozark. 
Fairy gone,Has no one else noticed this was written by Vargas?
Fairy gone,"I remember when this was announced I was pretty hyped. I had hope for this being AMC's next great TV show. Then the premiere happened, with the 40 something metascore and the barrage of bad reviews from both critics and viewers and I never bothered checking it. "
Fairy gone,[removed]
Fairy gone,"Worst Show I ever watched to Completion: WEEDS. I watched all 6 or 8 seasons and i started hating it after season 1. I mean i didn't love season 1 but the hate was real after Season 1 and every twist and turn just made me angrier. It's one of the worst shows I've ever watched much less to completion.

I think the only reason I watched it was an NPR Fresh Air interview about the Banana thing it sounded interesting and it kinda was but           it hoenstly wasn't worth season after season of DerpFace McGee. It made me hate R.E.D. 2 Because i couldn't see the female lead as anything other than nancy botwin."
Fairy gone,The somalian thing in this review is more entertaining than the actual TV show...
Fairy gone,"From now on, I'm referring to all sommoliers as ""wine Somalians""."
Fairy gone,"Because I don't know anything about wine, I figured that's what they were called. :("
Fairy gone,"""I'm the the maitre d' now."""
Fairy gone,this is random af but did you all know there are water sommelier's? 
Fairy gone,"Hello, I am a genuine wine somalian."
Fairy gone,"Oh man, do you have a link to the scene with his wife?"
Fairy gone,Ozark is my favorite show of the year next to Dark. I loved it...
Fairy gone,"> A ‚Äúsomalian‚Äù has dengue fever and makes his living in small inflatable boat.

you know Somalians are people right? like they exist beyond the realm of TV news footage. Like 1/3 of my sister's friends are Somalian not cool dude."
Fairy gone,Wine pirates.
Fairy gone,"Don't be sad about not knowing about wine.  Nobody knows everything.  You don't need to be a douche to enjoy wine (yes, statistics seem to disprove this theory though!) but for a bit of a look at how complicated wine can be but in a really entertaining way check out Somm on Netflix.  About four people trying to achieve Grand Sommelier status.  I enjoy wine, know what I enjoy, try to keep the douchiness to a minimum, don't do tastings, etc. and found this doco fascinating.  The knowledge these guys needed was phenomenal, but they are the Michael Jordans of wine."

Fairy gone,You must be a blast at parties. 
Fairy gone,"Damn, cannot view from my country :/"
Fairy gone,You're a very funny person.
Fairy gone,Actually I'm awesome at parties and I've had people say dickish things about my ethnic background its not fun. you must suck at parties
Fairy gone,"Sorry, that was the only one I found. Honestly, it wasn't as funny as expected, just bad.

The episode is on Hulu if you have it, though I don't know what you would start."
Fairy gone,Only after 4 drinks ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
Fairy gone,"Hey, no need to apologize man. Thanks for finding the scene."
Fairy gone,"Idk I felt marissa is still cold hearted. She wanted Erik dead till the end, never really wanted Hanna dead and that stayed consistent. And in the end of the season, she wanted her job back after knowing the horrible things they do. I also think she only had a soft spot for Hanna as some sort of redemption or easement on her guilt for what she did to those babies. I thought Esme did a good job with her character. And the dance scene felt like she was feeling the music, like any teenage does and danced to it. "
Fairy gone,[removed]
Fairy gone,why would they make it same as a movie? Am i missing something here?
Fairy gone,Nah
Fairy gone,"She was cold in a broad sense, sure, but she wasn't sociopathic. ""I killed a dozen babies but I feel bad about it and now I can save one so that makes it all ok if I just help this one live"". I've seen Lifetime specials with more nuance about themes of motherhood. Hell, I don't even mind that they diverged to try out the theme, I just mind how little it added to Marissa's character for how much they took away.

EDIT:

>like any teenage does

My point exactly. She's not any teenager. 

&#x200B;"
Fairy gone,"Then David Farr didn't understand what made his original screenplay work. Although I admit that most of my criticism comes from directorial choices and acting, so maybe the writing wouldn't bother me if those two factors were handled differently. When your directing is 24 tier and your star can't act their way out of a paper bag, the script isn't going to save anything. "
Fairy gone,k
Fairy gone,"At the same time I think she‚Äôs going back to her job to help those other girls (for next season). Erik taught her a lot of things in the forest so no one suspects her. In episode 1 he was teaching her all the popular movies and such. Music is pretty universal, I don‚Äôt know if it was her humming throughout the tv show but I kept hearing that. Hanna can see others dancing. But her dancing was kind of aggressive in the beginning and Sophie was shocked and then danced along with her."

You vs. Wild,"Subserviant chicken! I had no idea that was an ad lol they had a surprising amount of responses, too."
You vs. Wild,Or the santa you could tell him what to do.
You vs. Wild,Bear was criticized for claims that he never made. He never once said that he was being filmed actually surviving in the wild without help. His show demonstrated various scenarios that a person could encounter in that particular environment. 
You vs. Wild,I'm sure in real life on his own the guy can survive. But his shows are pure entertainment nonsense with lots of bad advice. Team Les Stroud forever.
You vs. Wild,Bear was a survival instructor for the SAS. Do you really think he doesn't know what he's doing? 
You vs. Wild,"+3. You notice the bear is staring longingly at you. You can swear that you hear swelling romantic music playing, but cannot tell from where."
You vs. Wild,"Les Stroud didn't ""fail"". He was doing a totally different kind of show. He certainly wasn't trying to appeal to anyone looking for good looks and movie star antics. So what if he never achieved the fame of Bear Grylls? What he did was more interesting."
You vs. Wild,*Bear will remember that*
You vs. Wild,That‚Äôs what I mean. That‚Äôs not really a thrill of any danger 
You vs. Wild,"Can you gives some examples of this, 'lots of bad advice?'  Because to my knowledge, he was criticized for not actually being in the situations he claimed (which is pretty silly in retrospect, of course it was staged for television), not for giving bad advice.    
  
I never really got the Bear vs Les attitude.  Both guys have their value.  Les is definitely great at what he does and totally legit when it comes to putting himself in those scenarios but imo, it shows.  The camera work isn't nearly as good and he's not nearly as entertaining or animated as Bear.  "
You vs. Wild,"Les is great, except for all that bigfoot malarkey..."
You vs. Wild,Except that Les show is pretty boring. There's only so much you can watch a guy sit around.
You vs. Wild,Survivor Man was really remarkable compared to Bears show.
You vs. Wild,"I think he has some knowledge... but compared to other survival experts he's just a show man.


FYI survival training for any armed forces is relatively basic."
You vs. Wild,*Press F to pay respects to Bear*
You vs. Wild,"I haven't watched the show in years but I recall him jumping into a freezing river ""to get out of the woods and to a road quicker"". Hypothermia can kill you very fast so this is obviously an insane idea. I remember him wandering into vast deep cave in the dark with no light in an attempt to stumble onto something useful as well. Surviving is not about taking risks it's about saying calm, using whats at hand and conserving energy."
You vs. Wild,Maybe not the target audience. I can watch that shit for hours.
You vs. Wild,"People keep saying he's a phony and gives bad advice.

Such comments wouldn't be downvoted if they included examples. All you need to do is support your claim. Nobody is interested in bare bone assertions, and we're not all going to get on Google and research this.

If you know why he's a phony, then why are you so afraid to spell it out and connect the dots for us? Give us examples and you can have all the upvotes in the world, and then everyone will be more knowledgeable about this. If you can't do that, then maybe you're the phony, eh?"
You vs. Wild,"The SAS are the British Special Forces. They go a little beyond ""basic."" Bear also became the youngest person to climb Mount Everest and paddled a raft across the entire North Atlantic. I'm fairly confident that he knows what he's doing, at least just as much as any other survival show host. "
You vs. Wild,"Once the clip came out about him staging that one shot by the highway, most of this site shifted their feelings on him almost overnight.  It's silly, imo.  Just looking at the camerawork and production quality, it's obvious he's got a camera crew with him and they're not crossing those areas too so it makes sense something was up.    
  
Either way, if you don't like him for that, that's fine but this whole, 'he's a total phony' attitude is nonsense.   He still clearly knows what he's doing and still does a lot of the things he's showing.  "

"Why the hell are you here, Teacher!?","Yeah, just gonna hard disagree here. It appealed to kids while being watchable for adults. It had reasonably deep characters for the genre, that stayed consistent in their characterizations. It was consistently amusing and silly, but didn't needlessly dumb down the plots. And most of all, as this article states, its stood the test of time.

Some of the later shows were absolute crap - but the originals are still great. That's not overrated."

I think the first one with real ghosts/monsters was The 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, but not a lot of people watched that one.

CAROLE and TUESDAY,Is her name Wartha Shtewart?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I gotta have respect for Patricia Heaton. No matter how many times her new show gets cancelled she just keeps coming back.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,And then she's released and falls in love with a famous rapper.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The Middle was a criminally underrated show. I wish Ms. Heaton nothing but the best.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I can't believe Hollywood is silencing another conservative voice by putting them on television.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"If Carol‚Äôs main writing resume highlight is something that she was partly involved with 20 years ago without making something outstanding since, I‚Äôm not convinced shes an all star"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,And it‚Äôs called Orange is the New Black.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I‚Äôm in!
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Nah
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Could be fun if done right (campy/bitchy/social commentary). I have faith in Carol Liefer. I don‚Äôt have much faith in anyone involved with Big Bang Theory though.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Just gotta say she still looks great in that photo. It must be 20 years since raymond?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I respect her because she keeps getting shows
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"okay i guess i'll be the dork ass loser this time.

nothing against Patricia Heaton, she did her thing in Raymond and The Middle and lots of stuff. but this concept has been done. twice. around twenty-five years ago. BY THE SAME NETWORK. with a couple of powerhouse television actresses, too. and Martha Stewart shut that shit down. hard.

the first was Style & Substance, aired on CBS in early 98. there's some jazz behind this one--veteran tv writer Peter Tolan was creator, and it was a starring vehicle for Jean Smart. not bad, but not great. seven episodes aired before it got replaced sometime that spring.

the second aired in summer 98, also by CBS. entitled The Simple Life (not that one) it starred Judith Light and had Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin of The Nanny fame behind it. it was a paler version of S&S and it got axed after episode five. just to throw some gasoline on a smouldering fire the unaired eps of S&S were burned off at the same time TSL aired. 

not sure why CBS felt the need to doubledown on the Martha Stewart bear-poking, and boy did she not take it well. and this was before all that insider-trading Club Med-prison stuff, too. like, first-peak Martha. her cadre of legal eagles leaned hard on the network and got them to cave to cancellation.

again, two and a half decades have passed since we've deigned to parody the great Stewart on television. maybe those years have softened her a bit. maybe making edibles with Snoop made her more amenable to this type of show now. 

or maybe Pat Heat should prepare to reap the whirlwind. ijs"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Don't be ridiculous,  it's shmartha toowart"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,And she becomes good friends with a pot smoking rapper named Peep Cat.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Hear me shmaden?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"idk, she has only done Carol's second act since the Middle ended. Also between Everyobody Loves Raymond and the Middle she only did Back to you, and that got canned because of the writer's strike.

Or both of them got canned because Kelsey Grammer has been cursed since Frasier ended."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Are Snoop and Martha actually‚Ä¶ dating?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Underrated shows don‚Äôt stay on the air for 9 seasons and average around 7 million viewers an episode.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I at least like that she voiced her disapproval of Donald Trump and gave up politics following the 2016 election
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Seinfeld is one of the greatest tv comedies of all time. That‚Äôs a credit worth using forever.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Something outstanding as much as Seinfield? I'm sorry, but how many comedy shows have you worked on that were considered one of the greatest comedy shows of all time?

>I‚Äôm not convinced shes an all star

she's a four-time Emmy nomine for her comedy work, plus no one was saying she's an all star"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Not a fan of Carol's second act?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,She had a couple other shows that were pretty good but they didn't last nearly as long. She had her own show on either UPN or WB. I mean if she has a sliver of Seinfeld she might not need to work much.  Jerry hasn't done another sitcom either.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Andy Gordon has also been involved with *Modern Family*, *Just Shoot Me*, *Mad About You*, *NewsRadio*, *Last Man Standing*, *United States of Al*, etc., so he has a pretty extensive career beyond just *BBT* (some better than others, obviously)."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Yeah it‚Äôs a great photo.  She looks a lot younger than Martha Stewart
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Maybe there's a pattern to her career? Does a hit 9 season show (Raymond), followed by a new show (Back to You) which gets canceled after only 1 season. Than does a hit 9 season show (The Middle) followed  by a new show (Carol's Second Act ) which gets cancelled after only 1 season. Hopefully this does 9 Seasons and the pattern continues."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Heaton also has made some questionable right wing statements in the past that probably didn't help her to get hired.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Haha no, but you gotta sex it up for TV."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,no she didn't
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"She hasn't had any trouble, especially considering her age.  She's had steady top-billing work since the mid-90s."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Yes, how dare she have different political beliefs than most of Hollywood..and you."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I think the show as a whole was a great, if somewhat standard, musical anime. But I was straight dying when I got to this scene."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,This is the most amazing thing ever created and I have to listened to this so many times
CAROLE and TUESDAY,When the reddit post you make gets removed arbitrarily....
CAROLE and TUESDAY,u/savevideobot
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I think it was really interesting how they pretty much only use the sci-fi angle of a city on freakin' Mars to play on themes of immigration and commercialization in the music industry through reliance on AI algorithms.  Then they drop in things like drug abuse and a parent manager living vicariously through her daughter.

Beck is another great one that's a very strong coming-of-age piece."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,">Beck

You mean Mongolian Chop Squad lol Anyway, that series is why I got into J rock for a while."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The best part of the documentary is how clearly you could see each of the three central malicious morons thinking they were controlling the narrative with their camera time.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The fact that people aren't more upset about that weird dude's sex cult or the rampant animal abuse worries me.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The general public can't be trusted with people's personal information. SHOCKER...
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Carole Baskin allegedly (major emphasis on allegedly) may have played a role in her husbands disappearance, and the internet loses their mind.

Joe Exotic literally plies his husbands with meth, doesn't allow them to work or leave until one of them dies and then proceeds to make the funeral about himself, and everyone is out there asking for him to be pardoned.

Meanwhile doc antle is literally running a cult with slaves, and Jeff is a piece of shit conman.

And the worse thing is that Carole is right. In the middle of all this personal drama, you learn very little about how the tigers are actually being treated, with the exception of doc antle killing his tigers and joe exotics mass fuck ups. The documentary implies that she mistreats her tigers because she feeds them through cages, but when you get an aerial view of the zoo it's a huge piece of land that's fully available for12 tigers to roam through. Not to mention multiple accounts of people who visited the zoo and who expressed that big cat rescue was misrepresented in the show."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,[deleted]
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"All I took from this series was that big cat people are terrible, crazy lunatics and you can't trust ANY of them."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"So this is the takeaway? Not the narcissistic, gross, white haired dude grooming teenage girls to be his wife's like the pedo piece of shit he is.

Did nobody notice that? Because that was seriously more fucked up than anything else on the show."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,It did piss me off that they didn‚Äôt seem to focus on animal cruelty at all. They did gloss over it and in passing talked  about it and it sickened me to see him drag that poor mins old cub away from its mom and pull it through the fence while she was still giving birth. You don‚Äôt even separate puppies from  their moms that early before selling.I was disappointed that the fact that he clearly wasn‚Äôt taken care of his cats correctly was just a non issue it seems even though the doc started off as if they did care. And Doc Antle needs his own doc cuz Jesus he‚Äôs insane. Joe was interesting but clearly a shit human. Everyone who worked for him hates him now for a reason but no one seems to care about that for some reason. He barely showed emotion when his employee was still bleeding out on his property. And barely cared when his own husband died. This reminds me of when chicks were hot to Ted Bundy. People are stupid like that lol
CAROLE and TUESDAY,">""Baskin cites another example of how the documentary depicts her work out of context: A video clip that shows her talking to the camera in front of a lion hunched in what appears to be a cramped enclosure. But she said the lion, Joseph, had just wandered from his 4,000-square-foot enclosure into the narrow feeding chute and was free to wander back out.""

This really stuck with me during the show. Joe screams about this and they show a cat in one of these narrow areas drinking, and then they cut away. But earlier on the show it was very visually clear that they go into that area to feed and then leave. No one forces them in there, they're not stuck in there, etc.

The show had opportunities to highlight visuals that contradicted Joe as he was saying these things, but often didn't even bother. Same with how many cats were in the enclosures. Half of the shots of cats at these other ""zoos"" have six plus cats practically piling on each other."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Considering how many people came away from that documentary thinking of Joe as a hero. . . I fear for her safety as well.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"It's crazy how so many people hate Carole after watching the show. What about the grooming of minors, the murder of baby Cubs, the burning of the crocodile building including the crocodiles????"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"There are people outside their gates every day harassing the staff, volunteers and interns. There are absolutely drones being flown over the park which is stressing cats out. People fucking started a social media event intended to be like the area 51 event where they storm BCR. It's out of hand and the cats are the ones that are going to suffer but none of the internet vigilantes give a shit about them."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I wish they didn‚Äôt leave the racist shit out. This man is being considered a ‚Äúhero‚Äù type right now across the states & he‚Äôs a giant pile of shit.. he wouldn‚Äôt be so loved if they left the racist stuff in.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"The documentary really dropped the ball when comparing the sanctuary to the zoos.

There is a clear and obvious difference between a place that breeds and sells tigers as a profit and a place where tigers who were abused get to retire."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"> ‚ÄúWe hold Big Cat Rescue and the Baskins in highest regard,‚Äù said Leahy, of the Humane Society. ‚ÄúNot many sanctuaries do rescue and advocacy and Big Cat Rescue does both and they do them very well.‚Äù

Yeah I‚Äôm gonna believe the Humane Society over Joe Exotic. No contest."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,[deleted]
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Four senators sold their stocks (insider trading) and lied to their constituents about Covid 19.... and it‚Äôs Carol Baskins that‚Äôs getting the blunt of the public‚Äôs bloody outrage. Cool...cool, cool, cool."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Why did she get so much hate in particular? She was definitely the least morally dubious of the lot of them.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Honestly this series is pretty toxic. Sensationalist, polarizing and destroying lives. Doing more bad than good."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I will never in my life be able to understand how someone could watch that mess of a ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù and conclude that Joe is a sympathetic character and Carole Baskin is some kind of evil lady.

They‚Äôre all weird in their own right but at the very least Carole Baskin seems to be working towards an admirable goal of stopping everything that makes the Joes and Docs of that world possible.

We were offered almost no coverage of her actual work and sanctuary. The only time they try to show her place is when Joe has a hidden cam and then charters a helicopter to fly above the grounds and they discover fuck all. Looks like wide open spaces and they ‚Äúexpose‚Äù nothing. Then the one episode that focuses on her is entirely about her missing husband presumed dead and the only people they interview are people that didn‚Äôt or don‚Äôt like her."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Let's get something straight though-- She was 19 when she met Don-- he was 40.   He had two passports he obtained overseas which is what someone does when they are planning to disappear.  He was involved in a mafia of sorts in South America.  He had underage 'girlfriends' or prostitutes overseas.   

All of this was pretty much left out or glossed over in the documentary."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Not enough people coming to grips that Tiger King was entertaining, but may not be trustworthy as journalism. ""XXX seemed like a good guy!"" is as much that's how the doc team presented them. You don't know these people because you watched them for 8 hours over the span of several years."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Wasn't there a ""r/bestof"" where someone broke down how her portrayal was intentionally misleading?"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Her husband flew small aircrafts ‚Äúlow so as to avoid radar‚Äù.

He made frequent trips to south america in said aircraft.

He hid money outside of banks (buried it, etc).

Nobody in his family could even really explain how he had so much money, or exactly how much he had - ‚Äúeverything he touched just seemed to make money‚Äù.

He mysteriously vanished during one of his trips south of the border.

Do I need to spell it out? He was running drugs. The documentary even mentions that there is some overlap between illegal tiger trades and the drug trade.

Carole seems like a shitty person in her own way, and she is definitely a hypocrite. But she didn‚Äôt murder her husband. He died running drugs south of the border and she probably knows that but can‚Äôt say anything because she doesn‚Äôt want anyone digging too deep and seizing her husband‚Äôs drug money."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Her husband who died was clearly a fucking drug smuggler.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Gonna get buried obv but Carole is clearly the person done the dirtiest by the documentary. Obviously she's a little shady, weird, and petty, but come on. Antle is running a sex cult and Exotic's relationship dynamics were clearly abusive, perhaps criminally so ‚Äì not to mention what appeared to be pretty suboptimal treatment of his animals.

The only thing Baskin has against her is heretofore unsubstantiated rumors about her husband's disappearance and a nonprofit that Netflix clearly framed to be exploitative in its staffing model regardless of whether or not it is."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"She definitely came across as the type of person that wouldn't expect to be seen as a bad guy when doing the interviews with the crew. 

The power of these types of docs have on people is pretty remarkable. All it takes is a few edits here or there and all of a sudden you're feeling sympathetic towards someone who you shouldn't be at all. 

Case and point them editing out all of Joe Exotic's racism."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I watched this series last night, way later than everyone else.  Based on the ""Carole Baskins Killed Her Husband"" stuff I'd been seeing online, I expected that to be the main story.  It's not.

Carole Baskins might have a shady past, but there is really no evidence she killed her husband.  Odds are good the husband was killed by a cartel.

But she runs a reputable big cat shelter and got into it with roadside zoo owner Joe Exotic.  Joe Exotic becomes psychotically obsessed by her and that's what the show is about.

Joe Exotic is basically running a sex cult in a zoo.  Joe has married a string of barely legal young men with drug problems.  His buddy Doc has a harem of teenage girls who he encourages to get breast implants.  The staff at Joe's zoo are on the fringes of society, living in falling apart zoo provided trailers and working for next to no money.  The animals are often underfeed.  Two chimps were kept in separate cages for 10 years because no one considered their socialization needs.  At least one staffer lost a limb while working for Joe.

It boggles my mind that people are more concerned over Carole's shady husband than Joe's teenage grooms."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I hate this crazy Team Joe/Team Carole shitshow this has caused. It's not nearly as interesting as something like Making a Murderer was.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Honestly if anyone approaches you for a documentary in today's age you should hardcore check your ego and analyze the intentions and outcomes. It's been playing out for a while now.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"How can you be betrayed when you so obviously suck? I'm not on the Joe-Exotic-is-ok train, he sucks worse. But Carole isn't some animal conservation warrior. She used to breed cats. Up until 1992 Big Cat Rescue was Wildlife on Easy Street - a bed and breakfast experience where a cat stayed in your cabin with you. Big Cat Rescue didn't cut off guest and cat contact until 2003. They tried to get accredited as a zoo but couldn't get certified because they didn't have *any* actually trained zoological staff. She's been called out by animal conservationists on this before. 

*Her only recognition as a sanctuary comes from [this nonprofit](http://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/gfas/) started in 2007.* She's basically just another private zoo owner who decided to rebrand herself.

Giving her the benefit of the doubt on actually murdering her husband, there's zero chance in hell she didn't alter the will and take control of the money."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I haven‚Äôt watched the tiger king but I listened to ‚Äúover my dead body‚Äù podcast and the second season was this story before the show came out (by like 6-8months) I heard the carol stuff but I never got the impression she was a bad person or she actually killed her husband. I‚Äôm wondering what they added to the show that painted her in such a bad light. That‚Äôs friggin sad though bc she was literally just doing a good thing for a ‚Äúhelpless‚Äù creature. What a backwards world we live in now man. I‚Äôm pretty sure this IS hell
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Why the fuck isnt anyone doing anything about antle????
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I really wish they highlighted the animal abuse more. The scene at the end was nice, but they could've brought it up more throughout the series, and they ESPECIALLY could've underlined the difference between the sanctuary and the zoo."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I really dont understand why everybody hates Carole. I understand she's a little bit strange. But the documentary only shows a bunch of crazy rednecks saying she killed her husband. And the whole world believes it. Out of all the people in the documentary she and her husband seemed the more reasonable.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Look how the documentary even has a bunch of redditors hating on her dragging her name through the mud when I doubt they‚Äôve heard of her before this.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Carol fuckin' Baskin is a weirdo but Jeff Lowe and his toadie were the real villains of the show.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"It‚Äôs really stunning to me that everybody just went with the husband-murder accusations that the documentary was blatantly pushing for entertainment value. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was very entertaining, but her ex-husband seemed like a real piece of work, too. Where did he get all his money? He had multiple planes that he never kept flight logs for? In Florida, in the 1980s and 1990s? He was flying to Central America regularly, for ‚Äúthe cats,‚Äù when Scarface told you he used exotic animals to smuggle drugs. 

Her husband was probably a drug trafficker, and the cartels probably put him at the bottom of the ocean.

There‚Äôs no evidence Carole killed anybody. Just an awful lot of hearsay from people who have a direct financial and personal incentive to ruin her."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Why in the fuck do people own big cats
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Sad how idiots are chasing conspiracy theories and harrassing her while ignoring what was done to the animals.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The ones who lost the most out of all of this are the actual animals.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"This series has like...killed my dream to interact with an exotic large cat.

If they‚Äôre domesticated enough for me to interact with them as an adult, something is very wrong in their lives.

If they‚Äôre presented to me as a baby, and are at a stage where they‚Äôre ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù docile, something is very wrong in their lives.

I am not in a situation where I could volunteer, or help from a distance. So I dreamed about going to things like this, because it‚Äôs the only way I could do it.

But now that I know how brutal and cruel it is, I would never want to support it.

My desire to cuddle a big cat, and ooh and aww over it, is not worth that cat suffering. I can‚Äôt see how anyone can disagree.

If one good thing came out of the documentary...it‚Äôs that it helped educate people like me.  

I fall for bullshit very easily.  You could have probably convinced me that there was a safe way to handle large cats, without hurting them in any way, if I had no other knowledge saying otherwise.

Now I know how traumatic the lives of these animals are, to support stupid human greed and petty desires.  I‚Äôm sadder, but wiser.  And since I love cats, I can help share what I‚Äôve learned with other people who love them, and haven‚Äôt thought about this subject hard enough."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,This whole tiger king phenomenon seems like it should‚Äôve had Zach Galifianakis involved.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Fuck doc antle, that guys a prick"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Why do people hate her but like Joe? He seems much worse.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"I'm just gonna copy something I posted on /r/tigerking the other day:

So yesterday I spent all day binging through Tiger King and really enjoyed it. I was very disappointed however with how quickly they dropped the fact that the rampant animal abuse is an issue that needs to be stopped. It stops being a documentary series and just straight up becomes a reality show about these wacky characters. It still pretends its a docuseries though, and it really tries hard to ""both sides"" the situation by trying to make everyone as equally likeable and unlikeable when that shouldn't even be the case. Not once on the show do they consult a zoologist or wildlife expert or anything. With that, the audiences opinion on Big Cat Rescue is heavily skewed by having a large focus on it being shown through the eyes of the lying animal abusers she wants to take down, and the series never really makes an effort to touch upon what the actual situation is.

So here's the thing about Big Cat Rescue; it's a non-profit organisation accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and has a perfect charity navigator score. Carole Baskin has a public salary which you can look up. Any extra money BCR makes, such as from facebook and youtube as the series gets into, goes toward funding itself and not their family personally. I also found it super fucking weird how the series tries to make out the fact that they use volunteers with a shirt system as this weird cult-like system. It's a charity. They're actively volunteering to work there. They go for a few weeks at the time and work for a good cause while getting compensated for proper food and shelter. You work there longer you get promoted to do more serious and responsible tasks. Summer camps for kids work the exact same way, but I'm pretty sure the scouts aren't some weird cult. I also think it makes a tonne of sense that maybe you should work your way up a year or two before actually working directly with the tigers, but that's just me.

But maybe some people just think it's hypocritical that BCR keeps all these cats in cages while criticising the zoos that do the exact same thing! Well, unfortunately that's really the only reasonable option in this situation. They don't breed or buy any of the animals they ""own"", they save them and let them live out their lives in their sanctuary. They can't let them out in the wild because all these domesticated big cats can't survive in the wild and would just die within a week of being released. Or I suppose they can, but then they may as well just euthanize them.

So their non-profit charity is basically based on rescuing big cats and letting them live out their lives the best that they can until they die. And they definitely live better lives at BCR. The series does an awful job at portraying this because they only show BCR's cats in what appears to be these absolutely tiny cages where they can barely do more than eat. Those small cages are apparently extended from a much larger enclosure for the sole purpose of feeding. It's apparently for safety as well. BCR has like half the cats that GW Zoo had at like twice the size. But you would never know this from the series. It's all about crazy cat lady is ruthless in wanting to take down insane methed up zoo owner, because according to said zoo owner she wants to monopolise the business and that's the only viewpoint we need.

See, the thing is she's working to end animal abuse. She is actively trying to get laws passed to stop people from privately owning big cats. Her goal is to basically make her business go out of business. Her primary goal is to end further breeding more and more big cats and other exotic animals. If BCR only keeps rescuing cats, the problem will never go away. Until some law passes the best they can do is make sure privately owned zoos go out of business.

""Okay, but Carole definitely needs to go to jail for killing her husband though."" Yeah maybe. I don't know though and neither does anyone here. If I had to bet money I'd probably say yes. She looks shady as hell in that situation. But we only know what the series tells us, and it's very effective in setting up that story for entertainment and intrigue. I don't want to get into this at all since I want this post to focus more on the actual animals. If she killed her husband she obviously deserves to go to jail. As it stands right now though, we just have a woman running a legitimate charity trying to stop animal abuse who may or may not have killed someone. Really her and Howard's biggest crime are being unlikeable and uncharismatic. But it was entertaining and probably made the creators money, ironically(?) at the complete expense of the tigers

Tl;dr: Carole Baskin runs a legitimate non-profit charity working for a good cause. Big Cat Rescue is sanctuary taking proper care of rescued animals where they can live out the rest of their lives. Baskin has a public salary and really isn't a hypocrite. Her portrayal on Tiger King is heavily skewed to make her out to being as bad as everyone else for entertainment. Tiger King is a fucking awful as a documentary and will very probably have a negative effect on animal rights in the US."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"The girl that lost her arm was pretty straight up, that whole crowd was rather crazy in one way or another. And the Tiger King himself is getting his 15 minutes of fame, but can only celebrate it with his cell mates."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I worked with Carole on a piece of legislation and helped her lobby for a bill in DC. I haven‚Äôt watched the series but she struck me as a good hearted person who genuinely cares about the big cats and animal abuse.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,I can‚Äôt read the name Carole baskin and not have it be in Joe Exotics voice in my head
CAROLE and TUESDAY,You can clearly tell the blonde dude that worked for joe was completely devastated. In the last couple of episodes he is drunk as a skunk and noticeably upset. That‚Äôs the only guy I feel sorry for.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Honestly I feel bad for her. I did some research on Big Cat Rescue and it seems like it‚Äôs a legitimate, non-profit animal sanctuary. I don‚Äôt understand why they tried to make it look like her place was just like the other zoos they talked about."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,There should be modern anti-lynching laws protecting people from these vindictive online mobs.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Everyone who is certain she did it, you‚Äôre the reason we need due process"
CAROLE and TUESDAY,That whole 'documentary' is a crap show. I mean don't get me wrong it's certainly entertaining-- but it's also really trashy and it doesn't spare anyone. Whatever gets views I guess?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Finally, I get to say what I've been wanting to say ever since I started seeing the Carole Baskin memes.  People need to realize that TV isn't all fake and Carole Baskin is a real person who is now under a real threat thanks to memes.

I started seeing those memes before I even watched any of Tiger King, and thought it was strange that people were ""joking"" about killing Carole Baskin.  By spreading the word more, they're spreading the word to potential killers or stalkers who might get wrapped up in the whole thing.

I watched the first episode of Tiger King (not interested enough to watch any more) and IMO it's kind of disgusting how they make the Tiger King guy all ""likable"" while making her, not so much."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"Everyone is talking about these fucking retards...

I just feel bad about the big cats eating road kill and living in small cages."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,The film makers did a good job of making the series entertaining from start to finish. Who would have guessed it blew up to these levels of popularity. ‚ÄúThat bitch Carole Baksins‚Äù is more of a meme than anything but of course of few idiots will take it too far.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,"The one thing i thought stood out to be as truly awful throughout this whole series, which subsequently was the one thing no one mentioned ever when discussing it, was the tragic suicide and reaction of said suicide on camera."
CAROLE and TUESDAY,You buried the lead.... there is an EPISODE 8 AIRING ON SUNDAY!?
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Somehow the entire cast made the ex-mafia guy to be the only sane person in the show.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,Can she sue Goode or Netflix for defamation? She's clearly experiencing a ton of bad pushback from the public as a direct result of this series.
CAROLE and TUESDAY,2020 what a time to be alive haha. When someone like the tiger king can can be looked at as a hero. They are all fucking nuts lmao
Fruits Basket,"Is it just me, or is the music WAY loud and it almost sounds like they're yelling to be heard over the music?

I like that there's nothing that references the chapter 1 plot twist, so if you're a newcomer you'll be totally surprised by it. "
Fruits Basket,"The trailer tells nothing about the plot. I imagine if you are not familiar with the anime or manga and you go into this by the trailer, alone, thinking it's going to be a cute, run of the mill high school drama then you are going to be...shocked. Or at the very least, weirded out. ""Wait, that guy turned into a seahorse? A seahorse?!"""
Fruits Basket,"Well, Laura Bailey is back in the anime game again. "
Fruits Basket,"Aw man, the animation looks kinda lazy and not very dynamic. Regardless, I‚Äôm really excited to relive this story from my childhood! "
Fruits Basket,Is this an old show? It feels old 
Fruits Basket,"I am really looking forward to this. This was a property we all assumed was never going to get a proper adaptation. While I will always love the first anime, It made a lot of changes from the source material and because of that it left a sour taste in the manga creator's mouth. I am happy to see that it will get a proper FMA: Brotherhood style adaptation. I was surprised to see the author insist on a whole new cast since doing a massive re-casting is rare in Japan. That said I was always planning to watch this with the dub as that was how I saw the first series and I was beyond thrilled they got Laura Bailey back to voice Tohru. She dosen't do a lot of anime work anymore, mostly vocusing on video games. So when you see her in a new anime it's really cool."
Fruits Basket,Cuz its on this sub for some reason I thought this wouldve been live action.
Fruits Basket,It doesn't look like the manga art style.
Fruits Basket,I'm still conflicted about this. 
Fruits Basket,"So this is some serious weeb shit, eh?

No hate, it just seems very... anime."
Fruits Basket,">Who's in the forest strolling?
>The birds and the bees sing Momiji!

üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢"
Fruits Basket,"None of this makes sense but I'm hoping that in some random scene he just turns into a literal seahorse that's like... 3 inches long and then is just in a fish tank. None of the other characters react like this is a big deal. He's just a seahorse now. He doesn't speak, he doesn't do anything that a seahorse doesn't do. Other characters say hello to him, and feed him, but in no other way interact. Because he is a seahorse and does not have the ability to communicate."
Fruits Basket,So far the only roles not reprised by the original cast are Kagura Momiji and Tohru's two friends. That is pretty much because aside from a recurring role in say DB Super or maybe One Piece or MHA most of their original VA have moved on from voice acting or acting in general. Parisha Fakhri who played Arisa Uotani has a recurring role on Seal Team but other than that the others have more or less fallen off the face of the earth.
Fruits Basket,"Actually they already confirmed she's coming back to reprise her role.

As are a good portion of the male voices as well."
Fruits Basket,It still looks a million times better than Sailor Moon Crystal. Like they spent more than 3 seconds on each frame.
Fruits Basket,"Yeah, pretty generic animation. At least we'll get the full story, and it only took eight years lol"
Fruits Basket,"There's been an earlier version. I think this one will be fully adapted from the manga. But yeah, it's almost the exact original animation style, so feels a bit dated compared to recent anime."
Fruits Basket,Original manga ran from July 1998 ‚Äì November 2006. The first anime was in 2001. 
Fruits Basket,why? at least it gets to adapt the full manga =) 
Fruits Basket,"> but I'm hoping that in some random scene he just turns into a literal seahorse that's like... 3 inches long and then is just in a fish tank.

Wonder Twin powers activate!"
Fruits Basket,"We need more full manga adaptations, I'd do a lot for a Trigun Maximum anime.

A lot."
Fruits Basket,Although I do not watch with the dub. Huyay! There‚Äôs no such thing like enough Laura Bailey. Can‚Äôt get her enough actually.
Fruits Basket,I was really on the fence but I adore Laura so I'm much more intrigued now! 
Fruits Basket,Yay!!!!
Men Behaving Badly,"It went to shit when they couldn't explain their The Reichenbach Fall moment, and mocked the viewer for wanting a solution."
Men Behaving Badly,First two seasons were awesome. Season 3 was iffy. Season 4 was god fucking awful 
Men Behaving Badly,"I'm one of the few, or perhaps only who still like it. But it's the characters I like, so the writing doesn't bother me."
Men Behaving Badly,"They just got caught up in their own hype, and the quality deteriorated "
Men Behaving Badly,"Sherlock was always stupid. Sorry. The show, not the character. The writers were way too impressed with themselves."
Men Behaving Badly,I think I'm one of the few who just did not like Sherlock from the beginning. I still believe the [premise](https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-the-princess-bride-l2YWs5DDmnhTKrOyk) of he first episode was stupid. 
Men Behaving Badly,"Shame because the second episode of the latest season was pretty amazing, so you can tell that the show as a whole in it's latter half could have been much better. Cumberbatch and Freeman really were the glue keeping the show together and why the show didn't fall apart as the writing got more all over the place. "
Men Behaving Badly,Not all of the first two seasons. The Baskerville episode was fucking idiotic. 
Men Behaving Badly,"I‚Äôm with you, I loved all of it. Maybe I had lower expectations to begin with. I wouldn‚Äôt put any of the seasons on a pedestal as being unbelievable. Just a fun show to watch"
Men Behaving Badly,that's moffat for ya. He's good till he's not :/

The Inbetweeners is absolutely fantastic.^best^friends.

Misfits, Pramface, Peepshow, QI, I am having a hard time remembering what other comedies I have seen and loved. Bean of course.

For non comedies, Sherlock and Downton. Luther I watched some of and was enjoying it but just dropped off of it and never picked it back up for some reason. Just about any documentary that BBC produces. I know i've seen more but drawing a blank.

Men Behaving Badly,"I love British TV. It just makes me a little mad (and a little angry), that I watched a BBC show from 2006, and they can show full frontal male nudity - no sex, but important to the scene, and I'm sure no one batted an eyelash. "
Men Behaving Badly,"Not american, but i appreciate a large variety of tv shows. British ones have a particular appeal, i don't know how to explain it.

Men Behaving Badly,"Well received. Sometimes Netflix has a section just for British TV shows. But keep in mind that usually they don't show the shitty British tv shows over here in the states, they only import the good ones.

I love Downton Abbey and plan to go see the traveling costume exhibit in a few months when it comes to a town near me. I also like Sherlock, but not as fan-girly as some people get. 

Does the Planet Earth series count as ""British TV""? We watch those plus other nature documentaries featuring Mr. Attenborough a lot.

I also like Fawlty Towers and all seasons of Doctor Who. I liked the Inbetweeners and the first Inbetweeners movie, but it gets to be a bit repetitive and crass so I don't rewatch it very often.

Men Behaving Badly,"I'm replying super late, but Downton Abbey became a smash hit here, even rivaling our Sunday Night Football broadcasts with 14+ million viewers live. It was also huge globally as well, but I don't have specific numbers on that.

Many people are familiar with literary BBC productions through PBS Masterpiece Theater: Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, etc."
Men Behaving Badly,No arguments here.
Men Behaving Badly,"Damn you should really check out the few I mentioned I think you'll really enjoy them.

How kind did it take you to get used to the lingo and accents?"
Men Behaving Badly,"Love all you listed, but I was wondering if you haven't seen Yes minister/Yes prime minister or if just didn't make it on your list? I'm almost obsessed with that series, some of the dialogue is beyond my descriptive power."
Men Behaving Badly,Is their anything particular about British tv that appeals to you?
Men Behaving Badly,I have no idea why but I can't stand the inbetweeners at all. I love Peepshow which have the same writers iirc but I just find the show really unfunny 
Men Behaving Badly,"My God that show is amazing aha I would say order the DVD from Amazon, the new series just started up the other week."
Men Behaving Badly,"You might enjoy Broadchurch, it's a recent show but from what I've heard is an excellent crime drama."
Men Behaving Badly,"""Bus Turd"" in the American version of Inbetweeners makes me cringe."
Men Behaving Badly,"Series 4 of Torchwood was, sadly, abysmal.

That is what happens when you let Americans try their hand at producing British shows."
Men Behaving Badly,"They're kind of a mixed bag though, the remakes of The Inbetweeners failed as did The IT Crowd but The Office exploded."
Men Behaving Badly,"It's not *un*appreciated, but for the most part it's pretty niche. Outside of shows like Doctor Who or Sherlock, UK shows don't really come on TV here and have to be sought out."
Men Behaving Badly,"Some of them go beyond ""remake"" to direct ripoff, *Three's Company* for instance, (at least the first two seasons) aside from Americanizing the language and names, is an almost exact copy, right down to plot, gags, and dialogue, of --*Bless This House*

edit --*Man About The House*  NOT Bless this house"
Men Behaving Badly,">blatant racism and all

Does anyone else remember a show called ""Curry & Chips""?
>Set on a factory floor of 'Lillicrap Ltd', it starred a blacked up Spike Milligan as an Asian immigrant who went by the name of Kevin O'Grady. 

edit:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlB3qEm1gOs  holy shit it sounds racist just from the first few seconds"
Men Behaving Badly,Why does that anger you?
Men Behaving Badly,"Yeah me too, Royle Family especially, I think most Englishmen can really relate to how we all used to sit around and watch tv like that.
One poor sod was always designated to make the brews ahaha"
Men Behaving Badly,"Most of the panel shows aren't imported because Americans will find it tough to relate to them. Mock the Week and Have I got News for You are very British-orientated.

Other shows, such as 'Never Mind the Buzzcocks' (now sadly cancelled) are not imported due to licensing restrictions.

Americans don't even get the full version of QI as they are having a tough time clearing the rights for some of the images and sounds to be broadcast in America."
Men Behaving Badly,Lots of QI on YouTube.

Men Behaving Badly,I don't really seek her stuff out but Colman is such a brilliant actor. She's got so much charisma
Men Behaving Badly,"I will definitely check them out thanks, accept Black Adder of course, it's one of my all time favorites and I own the series on dvd.

I've been watching so many years I'm not exactly sure when I stopped having trouble understanding the language and slang (still not sure who the hell Gordon Bennet was, though, or why his name is a curse) But my wife still needs me to interpret much of it for her"
Men Behaving Badly,"Yes, I've seen both series many times I just had to cut my list short and left out many. Nigel Hawthorne is brilliant in that show."
Men Behaving Badly,"The humor is more intelligent and devoid of political correctness. Also British celebrities are more articulate, smart and knowledgeable than their American counterparts.

Men Behaving Badly,"Yes, we've seen that too!"
Men Behaving Badly,Yah since the American version couldn't let Jay say anything close to the UK version it just wasn't right.
Men Behaving Badly,"yeah I won't argue with you there.

Like... whaaa?  Why isn't Jack jumping on everything now?   Is he... totally gay now and not bi like he was before?

At least that was the big shock for me when I started watching."
Men Behaving Badly,"You're right. Either way, it indicates that the US writers recognised the huge potential in the shows from the very start before they remade them."
Men Behaving Badly,"Shameless, House of Cards and The Night Of are examples of some quite recent succesful remakes."
Men Behaving Badly,"I watched the US version of Life on Mars, even though most of the dialogue was verbatim from the original source.

There is an American version of Bless This House?! Who played Sid James' character?"
Men Behaving Badly,"Holy shit, this is the worst thing I've ever seen and I can't stop watching it."
Men Behaving Badly,"Because NBC showed a British series here. and it was pathetic. Dubbed over curse words, and a really funny scene of an old couple laying naked in the road, with nothing really showing, and they still felt the need to blur things out. (This was not done in the UK) "
Men Behaving Badly,"No one really knows where the Gordon Bennett curse came from, just theories as far as I'm aware. There is also Flaming Nora"
Men Behaving Badly,">The humor is more intelligent and devoid of political correctness. Also British celebrities are more articulate, smart and knowledgeable than their American counterparts.

Exactly this. Also, usually, the music is top notch (for example the Great British Bake Off), the cinematography is outstanding, the direction and story lines are much tighter (only 6-8 shows per series helps)- overall British TV is much much better. I've abandoned most US tv shows. Most of it is trash. Many US Celebrities are so full of themselves they should be embarrassed. 

OP: For some laughs try to find ""W1A"", ""The Windsors"" and ""Life is Toff"" - all hilarious and very British. ""Ballot Monkeys"" was also worth watching. Laughed so hard I think I pulled a muscle. "
Men Behaving Badly,"> The humor is more intelligent and devoid of political correctness.

Really? I hadn't considered that. But I would argue the panel shows are nearly exclusively PC/right-on especially the TV circuit comedians.  "
Men Behaving Badly,I do admit though that scene had me laughing at lot 
Men Behaving Badly,"Crap.. I'm sorry, I meant to say *Man About The House*. Sorry if I got your hopes up


What an interesting idea though, Sid was brilliant, he and Kenneth Williams can make me laugh no matter what the circumstances"
Men Behaving Badly,Oh right it sounded like you were angry the BBC showed nudity.
Men Behaving Badly,I would give them a try. Thank you for recommending. 
Men Behaving Badly,I wonder if Americans could watch the Carry On films.
Men Behaving Badly,"No, I thought it was great.  It was unexpected, and had everything to do with the scene. I guess you have to get pay service here to even think about adult oriented drama."
Men Behaving Badly,"If not, they're missing out on some comic genius for sure."
Men Behaving Badly,The show isn't more well known because it was stuck on Cinemax.
Men Behaving Badly,"Soderbergh casually directing, DPing and editing 20 episodes of TV should really be held up as a bigger feat than I feel like it was."
Men Behaving Badly,"Wonderful show. The episode with the riot aftermath is one of my favorite episodes of television in semi-recent memory. The dude that just picks up the ambulance (horse-drawn) and starts dragging it like a damn mule is badass. Also the ‚Äúbusy flea‚Äù is delightful. 

‚ÄúI want you to find me an ocean of cocaine.‚Äù"
Men Behaving Badly,"It is straight up among the best tv shows ever made. The fact it lasted only 2 seasons is criminal, even if it does wrap things up for the main character. There were rumors that barry jenkins was going to revive it for season 3 with andre holland as the main character, but I haven't heard anything since. the writers and showrunners are taking over perry mason season 2, so that's exciting also."
Men Behaving Badly,"Eh, it fell off in the second season. A really solid show with the perfect lead. I just felt that the end was sudden and, at the same time, too late."
Men Behaving Badly,"I had a low-grade panic attack during one of the surgery scenes my first watch through.  Despite this, I've now seen the show start to finish 3 times, and I'm about ready for my 4th.  *That's* how good this show is."
Men Behaving Badly,"Marc Bernadin and Michael Green once wrote on Twitter that this shows failure or lack of ratings was, for them, the end of the Golden Age of TV. 

Both of those writers btw, are a part of the movement that killed OFF that Golden Age: the nerd franchise movement! 

As evidenced by all the franchise stuff plastered on this sub for a medium that, for a short time I guess, was a refuge from the franchises of modern mainstream American cinema."
Men Behaving Badly,"Its been on my watch list and i know its good.  But does it have a legit enough ending? I know it got cancelled after only 2 seasons.

Im not going to bother committing to it if it just ends flat due to the cancellation."
Men Behaving Badly,It‚Äôs a travesty that we don‚Äôt have more episodes of the Knick.
Men Behaving Badly,"I discovered The Knick last year on HBO max, it was soooo good. Not a bad subplot anywhere, no weak actors, fascinating medical, ethical and social situations and my god, the lighting‚Ä¶.the lighting‚Ä¶"
Men Behaving Badly,The Knick is one of my all time favorite shows. I regularly listen to the soundtrack.
Men Behaving Badly,"On top of everything everybody already mentioned, the composer Cliff Martinez thoroughly knocked it out of the park.

It‚Äôs an electronic score to rival Reznor/Ross (Social Network, Watchmen) and Oneohtrix Point Never (Good Time, Uncut Gems). The fact it‚Äôs set in the early 1900s or so makes it even better.

It does that Greenwood-y thing of becoming a character in the show. It broadcasts just how scary it is to see overconfident and overcoked doctors try out these surgical procedures for the first time."
Men Behaving Badly,"The fact that so many people never watched it, on top of not getting the closure it deserved, is why it's often not mentioned up there with the best.  Most people mentioning those shows simply haven't seen it.  It's fantastic though, both seasons are excellent.  
  
I mean, you look at IMDb, it has almost the same score as Mad Men, but Mad Men has almost 250k votes, The Knick doesn't even crack 50k."
Men Behaving Badly,"I love that it‚Äôs starting to get more well known. I was one of the 6 people that watched it daily and was always so sad it was virtually unknown. 

And I usually hate medical dramas but this was the best show no one ever saw."
Men Behaving Badly,"the show feels like mad men but in the 1800s and in medicine.

Clive Owen's Thackery plays a lot like Hamm's Don Draper.

A genius at work but with very deep personal problems and a hidden dark edge.

Holland's black doctor is the plucky protege ala Peggy Olson from Mad Men.

The Gallinger character is the villain and rival of the black doctor, there's enough similarities to a Pete Campbell (early seasons) or a Ted Chaough (middle seasons)."
Men Behaving Badly,"I've had multiple people tell me that they tried it, but the opening scene was too intense for them and they stopped watching.

That's about as strong an endorsement as I can give the show."
Men Behaving Badly,"It makes no sense to.me when people put breaking bad in the same tier as the wire and mad men. Breaking bad was entertaining, but it's a comic. It's cartoonish sometimes.  It's just not the sopranos. Honestly, the first few seasons of Saul were better. But even that turned silly."
Men Behaving Badly,"stumbled upon it having heard nobody mention it and was impressed.      

It really is a mix of good acting and good writing."
Men Behaving Badly,Awesome show.  Hopefully there‚Äôs another season in the future.
Men Behaving Badly,[Ping Wu](https://youtu.be/nHdu8rONhqY)
Men Behaving Badly,Really like the first season than my subscription plan changed and I lost Cinemax. Now that I have HBO max I should finish it up. Thanks for posting this!
Men Behaving Badly,"It started off really well but I ended up ditching it when they introduced the Kung Fu assassin stuff, it was ridiculous"
Men Behaving Badly,"Yeah, too bad it got cancelled."
Men Behaving Badly,"Yup, its the real deal. Some of Soderbergh's best work which is saying a lot."
Men Behaving Badly,love that show
Legacies,At least once a month I get stuck in a YouTube hole of Craig and Geoff clips.
Legacies,"Looks like Craig Ferguson will be starting a podcast so that might be worth checking out. 

Late-night is dying and I don't think Ferguson's ""legacy"" is hurt by the guy who came after him running the show into the ground."
Legacies,"Shirley Manson, the singer from the band Garbage, was on the show 6 times. They are both Scottish and sometimes they just talk about Scotland and stuff no one else has any clue. It‚Äôs hilarious

https://youtu.be/1FuPXcsYa3Q"
Legacies,"My God, when was the last time I read a Cracked article for any reason?"
Legacies,"""I enjoy ze simple pleasures of Daffy Dook."""
Legacies,‚ÄúHas there been a muuuuurder!‚Äù
Legacies,His show is a big reason why I'm in love with Kristen Bell.
Legacies,His Britney monolog is legendary
Legacies,OMG that brought back deliriously happy memories. I almost never watched any of the late night shows because I‚Äôd fall asleep (had to be up super early) but for some reason I watched Craig once and fell instantly in love with the entire show. So I started recording every show and watched the next day.  Craig was so gifted and delightful that I felt like I was part of the live audience ‚Äî and alone in my living room I‚Äôd participate as if I were actually in the audience. And like Craig in this clip I would often laugh ‚Äòtil I cried. I‚Äôd even get up and dance like an idiot when ‚ÄúSecretariat‚Äù came out. To have James Corden replace Craig was truly a sublime to ridiculous situation. I still miss him! Looks like I‚Äôm going to have a YouTube weekend.
Legacies,"Careful, Icarus!"
Legacies,"""No salsa, but if you have to have salsa... spicy."""
Legacies,"i just never got into the show but his book, ""American on Purpose"" is an excellent read."
Legacies,"Craig always kept it so real. His takes were always thoughtful, and you could just tell the man had seen and been through a lot and was trying to communicate, not just entertain. And he never punched down! Mad respect."
Legacies,"Greatest late night show host of all time. Craig imo as the leader of the show was the perfect blend of circus ringleader, relatable Everyman, and off the wall charming weirdo that kept you laughing and never got too deep."
Legacies,"Since the moment they decided Corden was taking over it was not a fucking great day for America. Ferguson, Geoff and Secretariat were the real alternative for late night among the blandness of Fallon or the ""I'm old and the young internet people are dumb"" Kimmel mindset. Thanks you round unfunny beige void of humanity Corden. I'm gonna go swap logs with someone this Valentine's in honor to the Late Late Show. Assm√∂de for everyone."
Legacies,"It‚Äôs interesting how late night shows are such a staple of US television and the formats are nearly identical. You could easily lose about 5 of these shows and still have options lol.

I get their purpose back in the day was to give the public a way to access beautiful and charming movie stars or whatever, so it made sense to have a circuit every night that people could go on to promote their wares. At the end of the day it‚Äôs cheap television to produce and only requires a stream of new stars and musical acts to keep going.

I suppose booking a slot on one was also a major goal for comedians through the years and acted like a stepping stone from working clubs to appearing in films or sitcoms.

The internet and social media has changed it all though. You can follow your favourite sexy actor on Twitter/Instagram or watch interviews in far fresher formats on YouTube e.g. Hot Ones.

Comedians have also found a great outlet in podcasting and are often much funnier when given time rather than a short 5 min slot.

Imagine how screwed your are when you have an actual turd (Corden) as your host. Between him and Jimmy Fallon (esp the whole monkey NFT episode) the genre has truly reached its nadir. It‚Äôs definitely time to try something new.

Craig Ferguson was great though. He sort of realised all these flaws and messed around with the format enough to make it feel fun. He was actually a genius in a weird way."
Legacies,He is the BEST late night show host by faaar
Legacies,Only Ferguson could make raunchy something your grandmother would find endearing.
Legacies,Craig Ferguson was way better than every James and Jimmy ever were or could be.
Legacies,Do we have a picture of Paul McCartney?
Legacies,"Corden following on from Craig makes me believe the Illuminati runs Hollywood stuff you hear, because how the fuck else could be have been chosen?

Craig is real and watching the Late Show was like hanging out with a good mate.

It was never pointless drivel, one sided politics or PR promote my show hokiness.

One of the rawest, realest moments was when he spoke about his mum passing away.

Watch from 7:20 to see why people trusted him. He was real, honest, entertaining.
https://youtu.be/Scpo9hvXitE"
Legacies,Craig remains THE best late night talk show host since Carson. Personally he is my favourite of all time
Legacies,The Late Late show finished when he did
Legacies,His story about when he was going to commit suicide on Christmas Day in London by jumping off tower bridge was the most real and sincere thing I‚Äôve ever seen on any show full stop.
Legacies,"I never connected Corden and Craig TBH...when Craig left I just stopped watching, and everything I heard about James Corden made me not want to watch anyway. I'd forgotten he was his successor. 

We loved Craig Ferguson in college. We'd say ""It's Craigy Ferg time!"" and watch almost every night. It was just wholesome and weird and fun and I enjoyed it so much, I was so sad when it was over."
Legacies,"So many amazing moments, but this accidental one from Craig while talking to ScarJo is my favorite. https://youtu.be/6DJNqcsbddo"
Legacies,"""you're a racist man!"" Oh God i miss him"
Legacies,James Corden really ruins everything
Legacies,Easily my favorite late night talk host.
Legacies,I can‚Äôt see Geoff without thinking about his creator Grant from myth busters. Rip.
Legacies,CBS or Worldwide Pants (Letterman) or whoever owns the rights should make his entire run available for streaming somewhere.
Legacies,Do we have a picture of me and my ferrets?
Legacies,"No its not!  This is a man that, for the 1000th show, did the entire episode using puppets!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpStl77s158"
Legacies,">If¬†@midnight¬†succeeds at CBS, Corden may be seen in retrospect as the connective tissue that transitioned the late-night format into an internet-friendly extravaganza...

Ha! If @midnight succeeds, it will be *in spite* of Corden, not *because* of.

Also, this article does nothing to convince me that Ferguson's legacy is ""collateral damage""."
Legacies,"The sillier he got the better it got. There was almost a giddy boyish fun to it all. And the stunning women he had on there didn't hurt, either. His interviews with Robin Williams are legendary IMHO."
Legacies,"His run on The Late Late Show was a very special time.  I was an insomniac during his run, there was no YouTube, and staying up to watch Craig felt like hanging out with a friend.  He was so naturally funny and as much as I love Conan, Craig seemed so effortlessly funny and could talk with anyone."
Legacies,"I look-up to Letterman, meh on Leno, bored by Colbert, respect and love Conan, eh on Kimmel and Fallon but absolutely adored Craig and his show. 

Does he have a podcast or has he done anything recently? I bet Geoff is unfortunately the IP of the network but I'd love to see him in something else"
Legacies,It's not Craig's fault Corbin sucks.
Legacies,Craig Ferguson legitimately made me stop changing the channel when he was on
Legacies,I just recently realized that Craig Ferguson was the one  playing Lister‚Äôs confidence in Red Dwarfs ‚ÄúConfidence and Paranoia‚Äù episode.    Blew my mind that I never picked up on that.
Legacies,You could also say: Craig Ferguson‚Äôs Legacy is Collateral Damage in ‚ÄòThe Late Late Show‚Äô being hosted by Corden for all these years.
Legacies,"I don't get it. The show needs to continue endlessly for his legacy to be preserved? The man is a legend and the show ending takes nothing away from that.

If anything, this is further proof of what a great host he was. His successor couldn't compete to the point of the show ending.

""This isn't the same without Ferguson. Let's call it a day"""
Legacies,"I vaguely remember watching ""I've got a place down there"" live... Geoff+Craig are some of my favorite comedy shit ever. Pure genius of off the cuff absurdism."
Legacies,It‚Äôs funny how most of the coverage of Corden leaving the Late Late Show seems to digress into ‚Äúremember how funny Ferguson was?‚Äù
Legacies,Craig Ferguson will always be my favourite host of any show ever.
Legacies,"A bad take on cracked.com.... what a surprise.

Fucking bozos. James Corden ran it into the ground by being a pos.

Craig was a legend."
Legacies,Craig is my favorite late night host‚Ä¶ by a lot. He‚Äôs not for everyone but I really like his interactions with guests the most out of the late show hosts.
Legacies,""" I JUST SAW MYSELF IN THE MONITOR!""

&#x200B;

"" ANYONE WANNA GET A HOAGIE OR SOMETHING.. BOPBIPEEBOPBIDDYBOPBO"""
Legacies,"It‚Äôs funny to me, I didn‚Äôt even think of Craig‚Äôs version and Corden‚Äôs version as the same show in my head."
Legacies,He should have gotten Fallon‚Äôs slot.
Legacies,"Craig was funny and fun‚Ä¶ he brought the best out of his guests, never at their expense. He was the very best since Johnny. 

Johnny was the goat to end goats."
Legacies,It‚Äôs a great day for America.
Legacies,"Craig Ferguson will always be the king of Late Night to me.

I‚Äôm a huge Letterman fan as well, but Craig‚Äôs style was so fresh I have to put him at the top."
Legacies,"I was lucky enough to get to go to a taping of Ferguson's Late Late Show in the final season. It was absolutely hilarious. I miss Craig. And Geoff, too.

One of the episodes I was in the audience for. 
https://youtu.be/ioXVgYKC_SQ"
Legacies,"Not really, he will **always** be fondly remembered."
Legacies,Craig Ferguson is the only talkshow host that had actual conversations with guests.
Legacies,That show was for stoners. I loved every second.
Legacies,Lauren Cohen: I told Jeff Goldblum that I had a dream about him singing karaoke and he cried.
Legacies,"I mean... Feguson is a real person, Corden is as fake as they come."
Legacies,I miss Geoff
Legacies,Stopped watching after Craig left.
Legacies,"""We are looking for something more youtube friendly""

Meanwhile, clips of Craig Ferguson are highly viewed and adored by youtube.

TV execs seem to actively hate their own business."
Legacies,Fucking legend. Him and Geoff Petersen and Secretariat.
Legacies,"Ah, when late night television was fun and not all about politics.

Genuinely miss Ferguson and his take on late night. It was such an amazing run."
Legacies,Craig is the best. Love him. Love how he refused to poke fun at Britney at her worst. He had major empathy for her.
Legacies,Balls.
Legacies,Damn I‚Äôm glad I grew up on Craig F and Craig K‚Äôs hosted versions of The Late Late show and not James Corden
Legacies,Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time the English ruined something the Scottish made.
Legacies,Another favorite Craigy Ferg show was the night he and Jeffrey Dean Morgan discovered the joys of facemasks and swearing. https://youtu.be/CjtvhcQcn3A
Legacies,Awkward pause ?
Legacies,WHO‚ÄôS THAT AT THE DOOR? IT‚ÄôS SECRETARIAT!
Legacies,"Kind of an over-inflated opinion piece. The 18-34 demographic and even older adult demographics are just not into the traditional late-night talk show anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they start to transition the Late Show, the Tonight show and even Kimmel to a new format in the next few years because of the trend. I know Conan and Ferguson will probably never go back to a TV talk show."
Legacies,"Chlamydia, your dad's here!"
Legacies,"Craig Ferguson was the best of all Late Shows, most of those shows look and feel so fake that are boring but with him the interactions always felt so natural. People felt like glad to be there talking about the smallest things, after he left I only watched Conan and after that no one."
Legacies,Episode with him and Robin Williams talking about chlamydia. They played off each others manic energy so well
Legacies,"He was such a great talk show host, truly funny and kind as well. Honestly he‚Äôs who we need right now."
Legacies,Miss his banter with Betty White.
Legacies,"It doesn't really do any damage in my mind. I've never seen Cordon's show, thankfully, so for me the Late Late Show will always be with Craig Ferguson, with a touch of Tom Snyder and Craig Kilborn in the early years"
Legacies,Craigs Autobiogrpahy is pure gold fyi
Legacies,Goddamn I miss Craig Ferguson hosting the Late Late Show. I was wondering why I was thinking about Geoff the robot.
Legacies,"The hustler was great! Watch his films, he‚Äôs a screenwriter too!"
Legacies,The Seabiscuit bit had me in tears every time.
Legacies,Craig Ferguson has surpassed late night TV.
Legacies,Love him
Legacies,One ding and we are German. 2 dings and what Geoff?
Legacies,How exactly? His run was great. The show wasn't great before him and wasn't great after. Cancelling doesn't impact that.
Legacies,"What I truly loved about Fergy Craig was that he valued silliness. Man, it‚Äôs the end of the day, and if I‚Äôm watching Craig Ferguson, it‚Äôs past my bedtime. Don‚Äôt throw calculated schlock that you taped in advance at me. Be like Craig and Geoff: just goof around and be silly. My brain needs it.  
  
Nowadays, Seth Meyer is the best of the late, late slot. And even so, it‚Äôs a lot of outrage and sarcasm. Not what I want while I‚Äôm relaxing in bed, not sleeping. Ring a bell, Seth! We are German now!"
Legacies,No its not. The same way Corden killing the show didn't damage Tom Snyder's legacy
Legacies,"Well, I kinda doubt a fucking @midnight reboot lasts in that slot."
Legacies,I don't think it has anything to do with him.  He already moved on from it.  His legacy was secure.
Legacies,RIP CBS Conan‚Ä¶
Legacies,Is cracked still a thing.
Legacies,"I used to record Ferguson because he was so funny, but well past my bedtime."
Legacies,[Thank God I found this!](https://twitter.com/CraigyFerg/status/1623727751344562178?t=Bkwl-C_pyP0w9d0a7MRdug&s=09)
Legacies,"Cheese and rice, I saw this headline & my first thought was ""oh no, did he flippin die or something??"""
Legacies,I loved this show so so so much!
Legacies,The absolute BEST host of the Late Late Show.
Legacies,Does anyone remember Craig Kilborn?
Legacies,Best late night show ever. Hands down.
Legacies,I used to love Cracked magazine in the 80s!
Quicksand,"I thought the dialogue was a bit stiff, but other than that it was alright"
Quicksand,Thanks to all who answered my questions about Swedish culture as it related to the freedom granted to teenagers. It makes the story much more plausible to me.
Quicksand,"Is the student / teacher relationship in the show realistic or quite fictional? Is it for example normal in Sweden to shake teachers hands, to discuss private matters or to be asked about / helped with private problems?"
Quicksand,"I love how there was so much truth in how the dialogues were scripted, in terms of depicting the quotidien of a Swedish lifestyle. What I found peculiar was the way the court was made to seem almost informal."
Quicksand,"I appreciated the subject matter and it managed to hook me in till the end. However I dislike extensive court/interrogation flashback/flashforwards. I found myself fastforwarding through those scenes.

Great show nonetheless."
Quicksand,"Hey, I'm Brazilian and I just watched the series. I'm here for two things. First, in the end, did Maja intend to kill Amanda or not? Some friends of mine think so.

Second, is your penitence system what it seems? For us it's like ... utopian. A cell for one person, with a bed, a table, a window ... a gym! I'm curious"
Quicksand,"Haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but I‚Äôm excited because they shot a lot of scenes in my town (in the school I went to as well I believe). They even filmed party scenes a couple of nights at my neighbor‚Äôs pool. Recorded a few videos of it actually (out of camera view of course)."
Quicksand,"Ok, the acting, accents and Swedish lifestyle have been thoroughly discussed now. But how do we really feel about Maja? The story tells she shoots him because he tells her to (which is suposedly misinterpreted) but I completely missed how it got to the point he wants her to kill him as most of the series it just seems to me he just likes to be the center of attention?"
Quicksand,The whole thing seems so unlikely.. it's just weird to me so many things don't add up
Quicksand,"Having read the book quite recently, I think the series is good as well. Though, someone who haven't read the book probably wouldn't enjoy the series as much."
Quicksand,"I wrote a semi-long post but I'm too tired to finish it at the moment. But in short, I loved it."
Quicksand,"Hey, I just finished the show and I had a question. Was there also a funeral for Sebastian or only Amanda?"
Quicksand,That is just being Swedish.
Quicksand,"It was pretty good so far, the dialogue sounds fairly natural. As you may know, it's pretty difficult to speak Swedish in an emotional way, it always sounds stiff no matter what.

&#x200B;

I think it's a bit of a bias due to seeing so much American television, where there's a lot of drama expressed from the voice. Swedish doesn't really do well in that aspect, it just doesn't work out. If you think something sounded more dramatic/emotional in real life, it was probably because of your actual feelings at the moment, not the pronunciation or anything."
Quicksand,"Depends on the teacher but yeah. Generally one teacher is a mentor to a class; so they have more interest in those pupils. I guess this teacher was the mentor for that class. Was a bit oddly portrayed though, generally classes have more than one classroom and more than a few teachers."
Quicksand,"Fairly normal I would say. We are formal with each other here, we don't use teachers last name and don't have a lot of hierarchies."
Quicksand,"Mostly. The main task of Swedish schools is rarely to just get paid, with education or care being a mere addition in the process. Here in Sweden schools take mental health and students very seriously, genuinely trying to help them and make sure they feel good about going to school."
Quicksand,"I think those scenes are needed to actually tell the story. The show starts with a crime that already took place, how else can they explain all that happened without using flashbacks or interrogations?"
Quicksand,I liked the show and all and kinda liked the ending but god the english voice of Maja was god awful and some of dialogues were really meh.
Quicksand,"Wait, the entire series consists of court/interrogation and flashbacks right?"
Quicksand,*flashforwarding
Quicksand,"No, I don't think she killed Amanda on purpose. In fact I think that the show did a great job portraying how fast it all took place and how she genuinely feared for her life, she just kept shooting at Sebastian until he went down..

The prison part is quite accurate. Keep in mind that she has not gotten her sentence yet, she is only a suspect and she just needs to be isolated for the sake of the investigation. But yes, even prisons treat prisoners humane, retribution is not a core part of the sentence like it is in for example USA."
Quicksand,"This is more of a cultural question then about the show but I noticed how Maja doesn‚Äôt have perfect teeth. The USA does have an obsession with perfect teeth, but no way would someone who is higher class have teeth like Maja, the character straight up will not be realistic. So are Swedes not as obsessed with perfect teeth? I feel bad pointing the teeth thing out because the actress who plays Maja is a real person but I‚Äôm generally curious."
Quicksand,I just watched it and I think I‚Äôm still digesting it. Having the same connection to it as you do as a fellow VRG alumni (and actually being acquainted with the main actress) many elements of it hits close to home. 
Quicksand,"My feeling was that he was miserable and wanted to kill himself since he felt worthless, a good deal thanks to his abusive pos father. He just wanted to take people with him that he felt had fucked with his life, his drugdealer who kept dealing to him even though he obviously could not handle it (though as the dealer pointed out, if I dont he will just get it from someone else). The teacher who called his dad commenting on his performance, most likely getting him beat up in the process. The kid who called his dad during the big party causing his dad to beat him up infront of everyone he knows. And shot his dad at the morning. So I think he wanted to kill himself"
Quicksand,"I am swedish, I live in stockholm, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt think the dialogue was all that great. Specifically between the main actor, boyfriend, bestfriend and friend/loveinterest. It felt ‚Äúkrystat‚Äù at times. "
Quicksand,*informal
Quicksand,"The show is similar to Big Little Lies in construction with the crime already occurring, and the audience finding out what happened through flashbacks + interrogations.
I think BLL did it a little better in that the interrogation scenes were not lengthy and most of the scenes were depicting the events that led to the crime.  I personally disliked the lengthy court/interrogation scenes in Quicksand 
but I think the book is described as a court drama so I should have expected it."
Quicksand,"Yeah, it's absurd to me that anyone can just fast forward through huge chunks of the show.  The whole point is to build the story, if you're just looking for action scenes why even bother watching such a slow burn mystery.  Plus, with this show, if you're fast-forwarding through the court room scenes and the flashbacks, what are you even watching?"
Quicksand,"I agree. The voice-overs were so terrible, I gave up and  watched with subtitles.

&#x200B;

Also the plot is unrealistic to a certain extent as it could only happen with an extreme laissez-faire parenting style,-->allowing her to stay  on a yacht with teenage  boy and his dad  they just met for 3 weeks in a foreign country.

But I like implausible storylines."
Quicksand,"Teeth work is fairly rare I  believe, I don't know a single person that has done any replacements other than hockey players or wearing braces."
Quicksand,I think her teeth are cute
Quicksand,"Teeth work doesn't cost anything if you're under 21(might be year up or down) if it's anything that is going to cause you issues but since you have to pay out of pocket for aesthetic work and you have to find a specialist who are mainly located in the major cities it's not as common for swedes to fix ""ugly"" teeth."
Quicksand,I enrolled at VRG too!
Quicksand,"Well, I grew up in similar in a similar setting as them, it's not ""krystat"" it's how a certain type of upper-class speak. Which is pretty ""krystat"". "
Quicksand,"I think her parent's hands-off style is part of the indictment of everyone else's handling of Sebastian - oh, he's so rich (in the book Claes is the third richest man in Sweden), so attractive, of course Maja should spend time with him and be his girlfriend! In the book Maja says her parents practically pushed her onto the boat. Everyone was willing to excuse Sebastian's behavior of who he was, and when he did anything wrong, they wanted Maja to be the one to deal with it."
Quicksand,"Swedish teens or ‚Äùkids‚Äù usually get treated as adults earlier than some other developed countries. Her turning 18 in a few months is like her almost being an adult, and going away on a yacht for three weeks is nothing special tbh. (Except that it‚Äôs a fucking huge yacht)"
Quicksand,"Only watch the first episode.

&#x200B;

They knew each other from long ago, but was separated sometime in high school or maybe middle school. They were ""together"" back then before too, so they knew each other.

&#x200B;

The rich father probably couldn't care less if his son is with a girl, he doesn't appear to be very fond of him anyway."
Quicksand,Why would you ever want to watch it with voiceover to begin with?
Quicksand,Yeah the only reason i didnt watch with subtitles is because I was playing Division 2 the whole time at the sametime.
Quicksand,94:a h√§r!
Quicksand,"Aha, d√• kanske det bara √§r att alla fr√•n djursholm k√§nns som d√•liga sk√•disar d√•:) "
Quicksand,"Don't agree. I recognize it, but that's definitely not how everyone sounds. Also not a fan of the acting and script, felt forced."
Quicksand,"En del √§r krystat, en del √§r inte. De sl√§nger in ‚Äùgumman‚Äù lite v√§l ofta f√∂r att g√∂ra en point.."
Quicksand,"Kan vara... Kommer man till ""orten"" √§r det ju andra bullar."
Quicksand,"Her parents seem well off so it was pretty weird to me that her mom seems to be begging her to date him even if his family had more money.

Did you find M and S's relationship authentic? At times in the show it felt like it was all pretense on his part, and his interest in her felt forced. 

The audience is supposed to believe that he is completely infatuated with her but by the end of the series I still don't know why."
Quicksand,"Although I am aware that many American families are more ‚Äúhands on‚Äù with young adults, the yacht thing was kinda weird, but I figured it was a cultural thing. 

However, eventually you can see Maja was disappointed with her parents lack of concern. I remember Maja coming home from her first hard party night and looking like she expected a stern voice or some kind of discipline. Instead, she was asked to put her jacket in the basement.  Following a more intense party, she sarcastically remarked about her mom asking ‚Äúthe important questions.‚Äù Finally, she showed sarcasm when her dad finally asked about Sebastian during her 18th birthday. There was so much damage by that point. 

Moreover, it appeared like they were more involved with her prior to meeting Sebastian and Maja liked it. I remember hating family trips in my late teens, but she hardly protested. 

Was it really Sebastians money that changed the parents? If so, they were no better than a pair of pimps."
Quicksand,97:a!
Quicksand,typ
Quicksand,"Vad tyckte du va problemet? Tycker sj√§lv det k√§ndes mer ""√§kta"" √§n de flesta amerikanska serierna."
Quicksand,"Yeah, there is a distinct difference between pimping out your daughter and letting her go into adulthood. In one way you can‚Äôt blame the parents about their treatment about her partying since you can‚Äôt really expect them to think that she‚Äôs been taking pills and getting really fucked up (parents always like to believe the best about their children), but them not noticing how she‚Äôs turning into a different, physically unstable person is bad parenting. They are definitely pimping her out, and that is not acceptable parenting in Sweden either."
Quicksand,Seen alot of comments about the yacht thing. I'm swedish and went on trips with friends or friend singular from the age of 16 or something the first time. Plenty of people I know did too so in my opinion that is not so weird
Quicksand,Du √§r ju knappt f√∂dd √§n
Quicksand,"Yeah I figured it might be a cultural difference and not her parents being completely aloof....yet. 

Wish I had grown up in Sweden !"
Quicksand,Netflix sure does like producing the dark depressing stuff.
Quicksand,oh another murder mystery with a female protagonist. haven't seen enough of those lately
Quicksand,Just pandering to the masses.
Quicksand,"> with a female protagonist

The 52% part of the world population, AGAIN!"
Quicksand,point being it's a trend. relax lil snowflake
Quicksand,">  relax lil snowflake

You are upset about women in movies. You are the only little snowflake here."
Quicksand,yeah thats part of the trend that finally half of the population starts to get good representation too

Quicksand,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Quicksand,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Quicksand,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Quicksand,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Quicksand,Dark should be top this list

Quicksand,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Quicksand,[deleted]
Quicksand,I see you haven‚Äôt watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Quicksand,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Quicksand,[deleted]
Quicksand,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Quicksand,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Quicksand,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend ‚Äúthe last kingdom‚Äù one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show ‚Äúrussian doll‚Äù had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it‚Äôs 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Quicksand,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Quicksand,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Quicksand,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Quicksand,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Quicksand,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Quicksand,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I‚Äôve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Our Planet,This should be well known by now. A real shocker would be if there were any consequences.
Our Planet,They wrote shocking instead of depressing
Our Planet,SHOCKING
Our Planet,Anyone on the internet is going to watch and be like yea no shit.
Our Planet,Can I watch this if I haven‚Äôt seen Big Oil I-IV?
Our Planet,The people responsible for this are all retired and playing golf while laughing at us all. Their investments in corruption are giving immense returns every day and they know it
Our Planet,I‚Äôm pretty sure we are past the brink and in full fuck it mode unfortunately.
Our Planet,Can they do the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry now?
Our Planet,Brink? Brink? Is it 1992 again?
Our Planet,You know Frontline kind of already did this...
Our Planet,Bring it to the brink? We can‚Äôt even see the brink in the rear view mirror.
Our Planet,When will we stop! The oil industry needs to be dissolved and all of their trillions used to fix the planet

Our Planet,"It was known decades ago.  If people continue to pay lip service to the lies so they can drive their big ass trucks around, who's at fault really?"
Our Planet,"It was well known a long long time ago. This is just preaching to the choir considering the people in charge loves ruining the environment and say it‚Äôs ok. Case in point, SCOTUS and GOP."
Our Planet,"The consequences will be there, by the planet, which is playing the long game.

All the crooks who think they get away with anything in life will be in for a surprise at the end of their journey."
Our Planet,lotta right wingers on the internet absolutely do not believe this

Our Planet,Don't forget the porn versions Big Oil: Makin' 'Em Gush 1-32
Our Planet,I feel like more activism protests should focus on these people rather than politicians. Let them feel the heat of their decisions.
Our Planet,I‚Äôm beginning to think they are all the same people.
Our Planet,"Oil isnt going anywhere, sorry.

Even if you were to make every car an EV, that only accounts for 16% of CO2 in the US, youll still need oil.

Wind turbines need it, EVs need it, on and on. Going green isnt going to affect oil at all.

Go read up on big oil being the biggest investors in the green energy field, then ask why is that?"
Our Planet,Chances are you'll die if that happened.
Our Planet,"Fuck right off with that. Where is the personal responsibility of the people of the board rooms that actually make the choices. 

We don't need random people on the streets taking responsibility, we need those people on the streets to force the people who are responsible to admit it."
Our Planet,"this is a movie review, now get back in the mine"
Our Planet,"I think it might be because we don't burn 88 million barrels of apple products per day, I think that may be why we're focusing on the stuff that's largely responsible for destroying the world. Hell, the vast majority of the damage Apple does is probably done using oil at some point. Basically in the land of bad takes, your take was the worst."
Our Planet,unblocked.co then best series is you best bet
Our Planet,It‚Äôs on bbc iPlayer.
Our Planet,"I just googled, it is, it was aired in April 2022, and first episode is 90 mins long, and it's on YouTube. It's called front line the power of big oil. I will be watching the pbs version rather than the edited bbc, sounds like a great doc!"

Our Planet,"Jesus it has so little to fucking do with people driving their trucks around. Look around you right now. Where the was everything you see produced?  What is everything made out of?  If everything you see was made on a different continent and everything you eat is trucked to you from 3000 miles away then you are in it just as fucking deep as someone driving a truck. This is literally the fucking shit they program you to fight over instead of changing the systems that are actually fucking doing this.

For the record I live in NYC ride public transportation and use a bicycle as my primary mode of transportation. Yes I also own a truck. It drives about 6k miles a year because I like to load it with tents and bikes and surfboards and go experience the planet while it is still here. No amount of consumer level reduction is going to make a dent in the emissions that the structure of the global supply chain creates. Those emissions aren‚Äôt even allowed to be fucking counted. This shit is so tired. Point the finger up for once for fucks sake.

What do you people think the mining equipment that digs up the lithium for EV batteries burn?  What do you think the power plants that charge the EV burn?  This problem needs to be handled so much fucking further upstream than getting pissed at your fucking neighbor for owning a truck."
Our Planet,Willful ignorance will always be blind to the wall infront of them.
Our Planet,Or they're just liars. They'll let the world burn before admitting climate change is real
Our Planet,[BP is sorry..](https://youtu.be/15HTd4Um1m4)
Our Planet,I think it is.
Our Planet,Thanks for sharing what I already know
Our Planet,What‚Äôs your point? Are you afraid of death?
Our Planet,Guess I should buy a boat.
Our Planet,Wow obscure Hanson reference ftw!
Our Planet,"Climate change isn‚Äôt real. But if it is, it‚Äôs not THAT big of a deal. But if it is, then it‚Äôs completely natural and human impact is minimal. But if it isn‚Äôt, then meh, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs anything we can do about it anyway.

Sigh‚Ä¶"
Our Planet,"Then why try to dissolve it?

Bearings, tires, plastic, etc‚Ä¶.all need to be made still."
Our Planet,I‚Äôve bought one that‚Äôs now electrically powered
Our Planet,GOP in nutshell.
Our Planet,"The point I believe OP is making, is that these ""Big Oil"" investors and operators should actively be researching alternatives and proper solutions to the evident consequences of their actions. Oil is essential right now, yes, but that doesn't justify allowing our entire planet to go apocalyptic."
Our Planet,but can you grow food on it?
Our Planet,"Oil in itself isnt going anywhere, sorry but true.

Those wind turbines need plenty for their bearings and such. Not only that, they do need power, before they can make power and that comes from fossil fuels.

Edit‚Ä¶.

Prove it wrong if youre going to downvote.

Its common knowledge that a wind turbine needs power to run the electronics and oil to lubricate. Its silly to say otherwise."
Our Planet,Aerogarden for the win! Hydroponics seem like a good answer.
Our Planet,exactly what you said
Our Planet,And is wind the only solution? Or does that energy they need initial forced to be fossil? Why no nuclear as an example? Oil can be replaced for bearings with new materials and green versions.
Our Planet,"I agree, however I think it's mass consumption and monopoly of the global energy sector that is negative. Oil should be a supplement to a majority energy pool sourced from renewable or minimal impact energies like nuclear fusion.

 I think advanced nuclear fusion technology should be the primary focus of every energy sector that's stable and reliable enough to use it."
Our Planet,"Yes Yes.

Now all you need is an apocalypse militia to wield all your apocalypse AR-15's you may or may not be hoarding to fight off all the pirates trying to steal your apocalypse beans from your apocalypse aerogarden on your apocalypse boat.

The fun never ends."
Our Planet,"Because solar and wind seem to be all people want, so businesses go with whats popular, thus leaving nuclear out of the picture (Which is a better and more reliable source). Big oil prefers it this way, just saying. This is why their invested into these ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù.

But Im sure youve heard natural gas is now being part of that ‚Äúgreen/clean energy‚Äù we hear about.

As far as your question on bearings and oil‚Ä¶.Not sure what you mean here? Oil/grease is needed to lubricate, bearings, etc‚Ä¶not made out of them. What would be a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù solution for lubrication, if thats what you mean?"
Our Planet,Youre not going to get every country to agree on something like this. Were not a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù state and never will be.
Our Planet,Come find me at point Nemo
Our Planet,"It's more popular but the mentality can change if govs actually wanted to but you are right.

Oil we q lubricant can be replaced with other oils not made from fossil. Maybe not right now but the tech exists just needs more light shined on"
Our Planet,"Global trade does it. Convince global markets that it's in their best interest to control our consumption of oil in exchange for long-term profits going into the next centuries instead of the next 50 years.

I agree that getting through propaganda/invested interests is nigh impossible with a system as deep-rooted and wealthy as the oil industry, but I do believe it is in everyone's self interest to convert to more reliable energy solutions. When I think of preserving the environment all humanity lives in, in exchange for switching our methods of energy consumption, everyone wins."
Our Planet,"Youre speaking of synthetics. The issue is, although man made, they do require carbon. Carbon comes from, well‚Ä¶..

If you really want to make something work, hydrogen would be the way to go. It can be burned or can power a battery. By product‚Ä¶.heat and water. This would be alot better for the environment than a EV by far, but again, its more popular and is seen as the only way, which is dumb."
Our Planet,"National Geographic is definitely a hidden gem on Disney+.

All the new stuff is gorgeous imo."
Our Planet,"Thanks for posting about this, I never would have heard about it otherwise and it really looks like something I'd be interested in. It's posts like these why I joined this sub."
Our Planet,But is it in 4K? I‚Äôve been disappointed that their National Geographic stuff hasn‚Äôt been.
Our Planet,Thanks for letting me know. I will check it out when I get home.
Our Planet,"First episode was unreal, jaw dropped the entire time. But dude, basically 30 min straight of boring shots of LA on episode 2...?? Show us something actually cool, there are SO many better skylines to choose from lmao. (biased opinion from someone who lives in LA and thinks it's gross) 

But yes, absolutely stunning production quality. Also, note, Moving Art on Netflix is basically the same thing and is equally as amazing."
Our Planet,Season 2 when!
Our Planet,It is! I can‚Äôt say as much for everything they have done but this series is üëçüèæ
Our Planet,"yup, i worked with the guy who did all the color correction for Earth Moods.  its 4k HDR in all its glory"
Our Planet,">Repeatedly, unambiguously, and urgently,¬†Our Planet¬†reminds its viewers that the wonders they are witnessing are imperiled by human action. After seeing a pair of mating fossas‚Äîa giant, lemur-hunting, Madagascan mongoose‚Äîwe‚Äôre told that the very forests we just saw have since been destroyed.¬†"
Our Planet,"TBH when I saw the title I thought it meant that the series was going to include all the raunchy stuff other shows didn't include, like footage of animals going to the bathroom or licking their genitals. 

Then I remembered that Planet Earth devoted a bit of time to a giant pile of bat guano. And actually had a special where they talked a bit about climate change too. "
Our Planet,"I agree completely with what they're trying to do, but I don't think the right people would make themselves watch it. It sounds so damn depressing. I don't think I could get through it, and I'm already convinced everything they're saying is right."
Our Planet,">Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄòOur Planet‚Äô Says What Other Nature Series Have Omitted

...dear God, I hope it's not the n-word..."
Our Planet,"Um, the most popular nature series *haven‚Äôt* omitted it. "
Our Planet,"David Attenborough: I‚Äôm gonna say it. I‚Äôm really gonna say it this time guys...

NNNNNNNNN"
Our Planet,"Planet Earth brought it up constantly, like every episode it was ""I hope you enjoy these islands because they're sinking"" or ""these creatures aren't native to the area and are decimating the locals"".  "
Our Planet,Both Planet Earth and Blue Planet have said human activity is harming the environment of the specific animals they show. I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so new about this show.
Our Planet,"> In a groundbreaking move, the beautiful but uncomfortable documentary forces viewers to acknowledge their own complicity in the decline of nature.  

Groundbreaking?  Is this an April fools joke?  As an avid consumer of nature documentaries, there hasn't been one in the past decade that hasn't acknowledged humans complicity in the decline of nature.  This is almost symbolic of modern journalism.   Either zero research was done before writing this article or it's paid advertisement for Netflix in article form.  "
Our Planet,"Great so what can i do about it? i'm buying as responsibly as possible, recycling all i can and buy my electricity from a renewables company and my gas from a company that offsets the carbon. I donate money fairly regularly to climate change charities and *none of it matters because the people who have the actual power to fix the world are greedy, rich old shits who will be protected from the consequences of their continued actions until the day they die of old age.*"
Our Planet,Anyone and eveyone impeding the construction of modern nuclear power is at fault 
Our Planet,[removed]
Our Planet,"All nature series‚Äô say this. All of them. Every year or two someone new says we only have a few years left to make major changes. The first time I personally recall was in school in the early 70s when a teacher I adored had just read a book by a very respected professor, Dr. Paul Ehrlich, called The Population Bomb. She said the book said millions upon millions of us would be starving to death in less than ten years. Instead, they came up with new farming techniques and a food pyramid that made everyone fat. You get jaded after decades of scientists crying wolf. Maybe this time it‚Äôs real, but too late for me. I just don‚Äôt believe you.  "
Our Planet,"Every single earth documentary I have seen talks about deforestation, pollution, and climate change.

Seems like Netflix is trying to hype something BY omission."
Our Planet,.........
Our Planet,The vast majority of nature docs that I have seen include this... not sure why this is considered news
Our Planet,And everyone is gonna virtue signal but change nothing about themselves. 
Our Planet,Blue Planet 2 did. So yeah you can say that if you ignore the other nature series that exist.
Our Planet,"Yea... for the same reason I couldn‚Äôt watch blackfish, I can‚Äôt watch this. 

It‚Äôll make me go on a murderous rampage or just shoot myself for being part of this. 

Anyway, I think it‚Äôs good that kids will watch it and be way more aggressively protective of their planet.  I hope so. 

Our parents failed us, but we also failed ourselves. There‚Äôs LOTs of forewarning that happened with our generation too. 

In fact, I was just showing my brother a Disney comic book from 1986 that was published by Exxon, but it was all about moving onto cleaner energy sources fast. "
Our Planet,You really can‚Äôt make nature docs without mentioning global warming. A doc that really focuses on it is cool and nature docs should have this message. But to say they‚Äôre the first to do this is just inaccurate.
Our Planet,I don't think this is as ground-breaking as they think.  Maybe in a way that there is zero enjoyment of nature in the show without being constantly reminded that we are ruining and killing everything... but the vast majority of nature programs in one way or another highlight the perilous contributions to nature by humans.
Possessed,"I missed the Marlena possession storyline, but was watching the many faces of Kristen plot where her doppelg√§ngers were getting into all sorts of trouble and the real Kristen was holding the other‚Äôs baby.  It was camp but had my dad hooked (he had a phase where during his breaks he‚Äôd come home watch DoOL and Passions then go back to work)."
Possessed,How is this show still going? My God. I was a freaking kid when this last happened...
Possessed,"I remember watching this storyline with my Mom in the 90s during the summer break after kindergarten... she made me stop watching with her whenever I'd ask why people were doing what they were doing, so I would sit in the hallway discretely and just try to parse what could possibly be happening. I never broke through, but I was fascinated by it. There was also a story, potentially on a different soap besides DooL where someone was buried alive and that definitely didn't fuck me up for years at all."
Possessed,"I remember watching the original possession plotline with my grandmother as a kid.  It was must-see TV.

I don't understand why soaps are getting so much hate in this thread though... they were doing season long storylines, plots that actually have weight/consequences, and some pretty deep storytelling decades before most of us were even born.  I'd argue that Stefano DiMera is one of the greatest, and most underrated, villains in the history of television.

Yeah, it's cheesy and campy, but that's the point.  My wife still watches Days sometimes (though her favorite was Passions), I'll probably try and catch a few episodes of this with her.  It sounds interesting."
Possessed,"I've never watched soap operas, but I find them fascinating in concept.

When I was little (early 90s), my newspaper had toll-free numbers you could call to get pre-recorded weather reports, sports scores, horoscopes, jokes, etc. My parents let me play with it because it was free and kept me from begging to call a 900 number to talk to Urkel or some shit.

All the major soaps had a number that would tell you what happened last episode, and I'd start calling these once I'd exhausted all other options. They were *bizarre* to my tiny brain.

*""On the last episode of Dark Glistenings, Mandy reveals to Paul that she's pregnant with Aaron's evil twin. Duke returns from Mars to find that his father was murdered by Shriners. But the wicked Chrysanthemum knows more than she's letting on about who broke the tureen, and will stop at nothing to steal Jake back from his lover, the antichrist. Will Barbara succumb to cancer before she can die of scurvy? Find out on the next Dark Glistenings.""*"
Possessed,"I'm actually stoked for this. Monday's episode with possessed Doug was an absolute riot, can't wait for even more."
Possessed,Is Bo still on the show?
Possessed,"I‚Äôve never been super close with my siblings but for some reason my sister and I started watching Days of Our Lives the year of the Marlena possession and became *obsessed*. We watched and laughed like crazy at the Marlena demon, Kristen evil twin storyline and the constant weird use of the phrase ‚Äúmaking back breaking love.‚Äù I think John used to say it a lot lol"
Possessed,Why does this news make me so happy?
Possessed,"So glad to see I wasn‚Äôt the only one that stumbled upon ‚ÄòPasssions‚Äô when I was home sick from school. My sibling and I loved it because it was so outrageously written, but we couldn‚Äôt stop watching. Idk how far into it we got, or even really wth was going on, but I remember being terrified of that witch lady that fucked with everyone‚Äôs lives."
Possessed,Stefano!
Possessed,It Never Ends
Possessed,"Dol was my afternoon guilty pleasure through my childhood and early teenage years, was one of the ways I connected with my mom. The devil possession, dopplegangers, and living burial storylines were kino"
Possessed,"Genuine question: is there anyone who actually watches every episode, or do most fans of these shows just tune in whenever they feel like it? I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd keep up with a show that‚Äôs on every day."
Possessed,Bring back Dr Jake Ramoray!
Possessed,How the fuck does this show have 50+ seasons? Do they re-use a lot of plots? Do they just not try with the writing? I don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs so much content.
Possessed,"I'm not familiar with the show and had to google background information, but this sounds like intentional targeting an fundamentalist or superstitious audience. 

> ""The hypnosis meant to make her fall in love with him left her open to demonic possession and ultimately led to Marlena becoming possessed by the devil. ""

What an absolutely ridiculous and moronic idea."
Possessed,OMG!  I thought Trump had to be dead in order to possess another person!
Possessed,After 30 years does anyone really give a shit at least she can join  former President Trump obviously he‚Äôs been possessed.
Possessed,This stuff makes *Eastenders* and *Coronation Street* look tame!
Possessed,"Finally, I was wondering why the Devil was giving her so much leeway."
Possessed,"Let‚Äôs have an intervention and keep her away from Donald Trump then 
he is the antichrist someone‚Äôs got a find that 666 under that Comb over! Former president Donald Trump and leader of all the free Oompa Loompa‚Äôs around the world"
Possessed,Passions was amazing.  I watched it in big groups in college.  Timmy and Tabitha forever
Possessed,I used to watch passions on my break from work. It was the trashiest most batshit show ever and I loved it
Possessed,It‚Äôs too bad you can‚Äôt re-watch the earlier storylines on Peacock. They‚Äôre all just sitting on tape in some vault at NBC Universal gathering dust.
Possessed,"They just got renewed for seasons 57 and 58, plus they had a spin-off miniseries on Peacock a couple weeks ago."
Possessed,"Soaps are cheap and have a dedicated audience. ABC found out when they got rid of All My Children and One Life to Live that they totally lost their audience for those time slots with the talk shows they put in place. 

If you keep it under budget, it‚Äôs easy money"
Possessed,Despite never really watching a single episode I know about 10 years worth of storylines and characters from cornonation street and emmerdale (north UK soaps) through osmosis as a kid ......
Possessed,"Didn't the buried alive plot also famously happen on Days of our Lives? I remember watching that one specifically one summer break and I don't remember if the lady ever made it out, but I usually ended up tuning in because Price is Right was over and there was never anything else on."
Possessed,[deleted]
Possessed,"I feel like Days has done ""Buried Alive"" a few times, unless I'm mashing up a couple of different soaps.

A male character named Austin was buried alive, and in one ""famous"" scene (at least in my house), his hand breaks through the ground at the end of an episode as he's escaping.  My sister and I still reference this scene.

Then Carly was buried alive, which is definitely the one you're thinking of.  For weeks you would get shots of her in the casket, crying, talking, begging, while being taunted by her rival.

Marlena wasn't buried, but she was underground in a giant cage for a while.

That show has had some wild storylines."
Possessed,"We didn't have cable as kids, so in the summer or on days we were sick, soaps were what my sister watched and I would occasionally pop in. They find ways to exist in a single minute scene for weeks. It's crazy how long they can draw everything out. It is probably because most people can't watch their ""stories"" every day, so you are never that lost. They serve an audience and tell a story and somehow are both scandalous and the most conservative television at the same time. I'm a little glad to see Days is still going, but it doesn't mean I'm going to tune in."
Possessed,"to be honest, im not a fan of soaps, but i always wondered how come streaming services like paramount+ or peacock didnt put their entire video library of soap opera series on their service, but the only conclusion i can come up with seems to be its either it would be way too expensive [probably cause you gotta cut new deals with the actors for some of the money] or they dont have all the episodes anymore, kinda like dr who, where as some episodes are lost to time due to that warehouse fire they had a long time ago, some of the older episodes, they may no longer have"
Possessed,I have a soft spot for soaps myself but the demographics for reddit users and soap watchers don't exactly overlap. I actually think the comments in here aren't too bad. I was expecting worse.
Possessed,"I think this hatred stems from people who typically don't care for soap operas, never watched them growing up, and just want them canceled for whatever reason. Many probably don't realize that daytime television isn't the same as primetime and there are people watching these day-to-day."
Possessed,Soaps get a lot of hate because they repeat the same conversations over and over again.  Personally I think this repetition slowly drives the actors insane...you can see it in their eyes.
Possessed,"> ""On the last episode of Dark Glistenings, Mandy reveals to Paul that she's pregnant with Aaron's evil twin. Duke returns from Mars to find that his father was murdered by Shriners.

Possessed,He died
Possessed,He was the best!  I remember being a huge fan of Days in college and going to some charity event that they had where they did a panel and a baseball game.  Stefano was there and it was literally my main reason for going.
Possessed,Btw for any movie fans. Stefano‚Äôs actor is the sleezy businessman in Jaws 2

Possessed,"Soap operas simply are a staple for daytime television, don't know what else to tell you."
Possessed,"It‚Äôs serialized. They run basically 5 or 6  storylines at any given time and have characters intersect in and out. Then characters get older and phase out and new characters phase in. Then you‚Äôll have different things become popular. 

For instance General Hospital started as a hospital drama, then became kinda a stereotypical show trying to be topical in the 70‚Äôs, then it became a bit of an action based show during the 80‚Äôs by having a more reckless heroic lead and bringing in a spy organization and some crazy villains, then in the 90‚Äôs some characters in the mafia got popular and they patterned it on some Godfather concepts and later the Sopranos, now you have a giant cast of legacy characters and it‚Äôs kind of a mix of everything"
Possessed,"YOU write 14,000 episodes of a tv show and see how long it takes before you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for storyline ideas."
Possessed,It was actually pretty popular. Sometimes you just need to do crazy things
Possessed,Passions was so goofy yet fun. One of the few soaps that leaned into the nuttiness that soaps often have. It also had a solid ending that concluded show long storylines
Possessed,"> Didn't the buried alive plot also famously happen on Days of our Lives?

I truly, truly do not know. I wonder if I can find the clip."
Possessed,All My Children? They had a plotline about a girl surviving a rape and her guy friend (eventual boyfriend) helping her through it.
Possessed,"summer soaps were the best.  in February the show's kids would be 11, but by July they were 17 and in bikinis all summer long, lol

it is good that a couple of these have lasted a good long while"
Possessed,Yes! I have been watching more soaps during the pandemic. It amazes me how one conversation can be dragged out for weeks! I have to laugh at the characters wearing the same clothes/not using the bathroom for a month real time.
Possessed,"A complete soap on streaming would be revolutionary but such a massive waste of time and server cost as no one would ever watch most of it

For instance Bold and Beautiful has only been airing since 1987 and allegedly has 8363 episodes. Thats 2787 houses of content and would take 116 straight days to watch everything.

and I doubt 80% of those episodes even exist anymore as they were likely recorded to tape then thrown away or taped over"
Possessed,"I've always wondered what it's like for soap actors who have literally played the same role for decades. On one hand, they have incredible job and financial security that the vast majority of actors will never have. But on the other hand, the boredom must be crippling, especially for an artistic type."
Possessed,All the people on this sub that rip on Riverdale don't realize that that show in particular is a spoof/homage of daytime soaps with a bigger budget.
Possessed,Yeah but is he still on the show
Possessed,"Just cause something is old, doesn‚Äôt automatically make it good"
Possessed,"Good writer would have went at least 19,000 before repeating the storylines

This is just slacking off"
Possessed,"Well, looking at the downvotes, there seem to be a lot of fans loving this kind of crap. ;-)"
Possessed,Yea it was days of our lives and it was magical
Possessed,[deleted]
Possessed,Pretty much this. If you think about a soap probably puts out about 170 hours of tv a year. So imagine dedicating 1700 to just one decade like the 80‚Äôs that the majority of people are never going to go back and watch.
Possessed, No the actor who played him left to spend more time with his family
Possessed,Doesn't automatically make it bad either.
Possessed,Who got buried alive?
Possessed,"That‚Äôs the one. It‚Äôs one of the most famous soap storylines and basically made Todd and by proxy his actor a mega star in the soap world. You can watch the entire storyline on YouTube. 

It was revolutionary because literally a decade earlier GH had the famous Luke and Laura storyline where Luke became a romantic lead after raping his love interest, so OLTL wanted to do a serious rape story. They went all in with research and discussions with psychologists"
Possessed,Carly by Vivian
Possessed,"I dont know it was like 30 years ago, its wasn't marlena it was the chick who dated patch and stefano.
Edit: it was vivian"
Possessed,"That was a great read, and I can immediately appreciate as a veterinarian one of things mentioned:  Putting a pet ""to sleep"".  

By luck, I hold Mr. Rogers' same perception of not using the term ""put to sleep"" around small children because of the same fear \- of making them believe that they might fall asleep and never wake up, and thus make them anxious or fearful of something they should never be, at least as a child.  I generally will talk to parents of very young children, and when they ask how they should tell them what is happening, I generally ask them not to use that expression.  Instead, I am gently honest with them, I reassure them that it's okay to be sad, and they should talk to their family about it."
Possessed,">‚ÄúRephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.‚Äù Not all children know their parents

That made me smile"
Possessed,"""Fred Rogers‚Äôs production company, Family Communications, Inc., recalls Rogers once halted taping of a show when a cast member told the puppet Henrietta Pussycat not to cry; he interrupted shooting to make it clear that his show would never suggest to children that they not cry."""
Possessed,"As someone currently raising a toddler, this makes a ton of sense. Has definitely given me a few things to think about in terms of getting better at communicating clearly with young children."
Possessed,Go see the doc *Won't You Be My Neighbor* which just opened in theaters. It's so good!
Possessed," > Rogers also wrote a song called ‚ÄúYou Can Never Go Down the Drain‚Äù because he knew that drains were something that, to kids, seemed to exist solely to suck things down.

this brought back so many warm memories of growing up with this show and how Mr. Rogers was able to provide a rare moment of peace and an escape from what was for many of us an otherwise tumultuous childhood "
Possessed,We really need someone like that again right now. The world could use a little Mr. Rogers-type compassion. 
Possessed,"My first ever kids coaching gig when I was around 17 taught me a lesson about this. 

I had a bunch of 5 year olds line up one behind each other in a sort of queue. I layed out a simple ""obstacle"" course (really just little arrows and dots on the ground) that they had to do various things like run past the arrows, hop to the next dot, leap over the solid line, etc. 

Then I said ""Go"", and watched in horror as every 5 year old - each one about 2 inches in front or behind the next - tried to run forward at exactly the same time. Of course they all topped over like a stack of dominoes. Some started laughing, others looked confused, a couple started bawling their eyes out.

It didn't occur to me that they wouldn't know to wait until they had enough space to take a step forward. They all just jumped forward as soon as I said ""go"". "
Possessed,"Another thing I've noticed with how Mr. Rogers worked vs how modern day kid shows work:

Mr. Rogers never yelled.

*NEVER*

Dora The Explorers:  Yells

Diego:  Yells

Little Einsteins:  Yells

Paw Patrol:  Yells

all the ""popular"" shows have yelling/shouting character. I  nearly went insane when my kids were younger because of this.  "
Possessed,"I think more important than the things he said, was the way that he said them,  He had a very calm reassuring presence."
Possessed,"I explicitly told all my children that they would get sucked down the bathtub drain.  They laughed, and told me I was wrong.  I asked them to explain why I was wrong, because I was worried I would get sucked down the drain, too.  They showed me how toys were too big to go down the drain, and explained to me since I was much bigger than the toys there was no way I could fit.  I expressed some doubt, but they reassured me I was completely safe.

TIL I am the anti-Freddish."
Possessed,"Great advice.

He was amazing. I was truely heartbroken when he passed."

Possessed,"If Mr Rogers gets ""me too'ed"", I'm done forever. Same Tom Hanks. "
Possessed,"Hmm, the nine steps listed in the pamphlet about how to phrase something so a child can understand. 


Those nine steps in fact apply to all humans regardless of age. They really are the nine steps to phrasing something in such a way that promotes teaching and learning. 


Once you get to a certain level of cognitive development, most of the issues addressed by those nine steps are things that you start understanding by yourself, without the need for the teacher to address them. However, you soon start taking them for granted, and (depending on your environment) your understanding of them may begin to warp. Its at *this* point that it becomes important again for the teacher to apply the steps, to ensure that you truly understand. "
Possessed,"If most Christians were like Fred Rogers I would feel very differently about Christianity and religion in general. 

He seemed like an exceptional exception rather than the rule. "
Possessed,Didn‚Äôt he have a background in child psychology?
Possessed,This is amazing. 
Possessed,Thanks for sharing. Really good read.
Possessed,Mr. Rogers did things that are still foreign in kid' television today. Not talking down to your audience for one.
Possessed,I love those 9 laid out steps in translating a statement into ‚ÄòFreddish‚Äô. It‚Äôs so much like the process I go through in altering my words when writing social stories for children on the autism spectrum.
Possessed,"He was such a great man.

His show was on during a portion of my childhood that was particularly difficult, and his show was one of my islands of comfort and solace.  "
Possessed,Mr. Rogers was one of the most wholesome humans who has ever lived. Reading about him always seems to bring a smile to my face.
Possessed,"> Greenwald recalls: ‚ÄúFred made us redub the line, saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to puff this up with some air,‚Äô because ‚Äòblow it up‚Äô might sound like there‚Äôs an explosion, and he didn‚Äôt want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.‚Äù

My thought is that if kids misinterpreted the line, they would be more to likely be *disappointed* there wasn't a pop or explosion, not fearful of one. However, I appreciate the level of care Mr. Rogers always put into every show."
Possessed,"The epitome of what is good in humanity, and a constant class act amd legend. It was an interesting read and doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

He was too good for this world, and that is why we needed him."
Possessed,"The recent attention on Fred Rogers and his philosophy makes me happy and it is important to introduce him to people who may not know of him.  

However, I find it depressing that the only reason that we are seeing so much about him on the front page is from marketing people driving awareness to increase sales (money) for the upcoming movie. Something Mr Rogers was deeply against. 

"
Possessed,"Damn, this is so enriching! One thing I have to point out though:

> Fred Rogers‚Äôs production company, Family Communications, Inc.,

This isn't his production company's name anymore. [It was changed to Fred Rogers Productions just recently,](http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/daniel-tiger-studio-rebrands-as-fred-rogers-productions/) with Daniel Tiger on the logo to represent the company's signature property. "

Possessed,"Honestly I‚Äôm so glad my parents made me watch stuff like Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, Arthur... basically on stuff on PBS instead of Disney/Nick/CN.

Ultraman,"It's part of a genre called tokusatsu that's about japanese monster shows - from godzilla to ultraman to power rangers and more. If you like Ultraman, try digging into r/ultraman or r/tokusatsu to find out more.

I am a huge fan of ultraman after just starting it last year. Tubi picking up so many series has been amazing to explore the franchise. Hope you check out more!"
Ultraman,"As a kid, loved the original Ultraman produced in the Godzilla era. Have to check it out."
Ultraman,"MCE puts out all the different Ultraman series [on Blu-ray and DVD](https://www.millcreekent.com/search?type=product&q=ultraman), and also makes them available to buy digitally on their [MovieSpree streaming service](https://www.moviespree.com/) (non-subscription; it's more like Vudu than Netflix)."
Ultraman,How are you watching it? Is this the Ultraman from Ready Player One the book?
Ultraman,"You can download a ton of fansubbed tokusatsu shows at [KRDL](https://krdl.moe/), including the non-licensed Ultraman series."
Ultraman,"Tsuburaya Productions posts episodes of new Ultra shows on their official YouTube channel, for free. Ultraman Decker, the newest series, will air on July 9th of this year. They've previously uploaded episodes of Ultraman Z and Ultraman Trigger on their YT channel."
Ultraman,Thanks for posting all that! that helps out a lot going to eventually get some of those blu rays now
Ultraman,"I think the Ultraman in RPO refers to the original from the ‚Äò66 show, but there‚Äôs been a lot of different Ultramen since then. At some point Ultraman even got a Guinness Book record as show with the most spin-offs."
Ultraman,"it's on a streaming service called Tubi, there are multiple seasons of Super Sentai and Ultraman on there.  I haven't read the book Ready Player one"
Ultraman,"There are plenty of websites that host all seasons of Ultraman. 
Ultraman Trigger NEW GENERATION TIGA is the newiest."
Ultraman,There's also Pluto Tv! They have a lot of different Tokusatsu seasons on there.
Ultraman,"Does anyone remember Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad?

 The resemblance is amazing."
Ultraman,"There it is, that complete shit 12 fps CGI. Another hard pass for me, I am done giving Netflix chances or ""just getting use to it"" I can't and it's just bad"
Ultraman,Ew. Why is CG anime still a thing?
Ultraman,"A CGI show. I am just confused. The design on some parts looks great, the old guy also looked great. But the moment when they panned on the protagonist, man it looks bad. I also hope that they move away from 24fps. Looks too jarring. Land of the Lustrous did a much better job, especially with it's action scenes, which just flows smoothly. Why are they not learning the lesson here?"
Ultraman,This animation style is absolutely terrible imo
Ultraman,Is this Ultraman or Iron Man? Looks weird...
Ultraman,God I hate Netflix 3D animation it just looks so choppy and gross I can‚Äôt watch any of their anime originals that are in 3D
Ultraman,"The Robotic look of the Ultraman is interesting, Ultraman and Power Rangers is my fav show during my middle school time. Cant Wait!"
Ultraman,"I saw you guys complaining about the frame rate but this looks watchable. It's not Land of the Lustrous or Clone Wars but it looks good and the movement is more fluid than most CGI anime.

Apparently, this is based on a manga that is a sequel to the very first Ultraman show and ignores everything that came after that. Also, they don't turn giant, Ultraman and the monsters are all human sized. Not sure why he has a robot suit though.

Anyway, I look forward to watch this with my dad, who loved Ultraman!"
Ultraman,This looks like a Telltale game running on an old phone. 
Ultraman,Hopefully the story is good.
Ultraman,"the resemblance is intentional, they're both made by a company tsubaraya"

Ultraman,Never heard of it but it looks cool and I appreciate any animated Netflix show with proper FPS.
Ultraman,I remember ultraman for the SNES.   He looked more like the Rocketeer.   
Ultraman,Seems alright. Interesting animation style trying to emulate hand-drawn animation.

Ultraman,"That show is actually an Americanization of Hyper Agent Gridman, there‚Äôs currently an anime reimagining of that show currently airing called SSSS. Gridman. 

Gridman I believe is made by the same company as Ultraman. I believe the genre is Tokuyatsu (spelling?) I‚Äôm familiar with Kaiju shows like Godzilla from my childhood but it‚Äôs pretty crazy to see how much content there is when it comes to Ultraman. "

starring matthew lawrence? you bet i do. i got the two shows confused for a long time because of how similar they look. "
Ultraman,It moves like a Metal Gear Solid 2 cutscene on an old disc covered in scratches. It's so gross.
Ultraman,"The fact its production I.G. is mind boggling that they would go with CGI when they have so many good animes they made.

"
Ultraman,Netflix didn't produce this. 
Ultraman,[deleted]
Ultraman,"Yup, shit looks awful and it's disappointing seeing how many titles are using it."
Ultraman,I don't get why they keep trying. Do they think we're blind?
Ultraman,I was playing the original Warcraft 3 the other day and the CG cutscenes in that game are way better than this. That game came out in 2002.
Ultraman,it sucks cuz dragon prince is soo good. Wish they can fix the animation. Berserk 2016 was just plain bad (story & animation)
Ultraman,Thank you im not even going to give this a chance.
Ultraman,[deleted]
Ultraman,I‚Äôm sitting over here still mad that the Berserk adaptation is absolute visual trash.
Ultraman,Ever saw Karas?
Ultraman,I love CG anime. I despise the intentional low FPS that seems to come with them.

Ultraman,"Looks pretty violent for kids. There's a part where he hits a guy in the face and a bunch of blood comes spurting out.

Ultraman,Tokusatsu
Ultraman,And also has Studio Trigger working on it as well. It's been a great show so far.
Ultraman,"It seems I should have been more clear, I meant CGI the shows/movies"
Ultraman,That show doesn't look the same as this. This kind of CGI should be dropped it's almost always bad.
Ultraman,Inuyashiki?

Ultraman,Ajin and Knights of Sidonia did it pretty well. But I agree that it should be used sparingly.
Ultraman,That show doesn't look the same as this. This kind of CGI should be dropped it's almost always bad.

Ultraman,"Knights had some of the best Acton animation I've seen. I agree that most of the non action wasn't good, but the fights were great. "
Ultraman,I'm just talking about this specific 12 fps CGI. It should never be used. It's awful. The anime you spoke about has a different type of CGI which is fine. I have no issues with that.
Ultraman,"> My only point was that you were implying that CGI anime was always bad 

He specified this art style with the stuttery low frame rate. Nobody said all CGI anime except for you."
Ultraman,I don't know what is up with these wierd 3d animes with low fps Netflix keeps churning out.
Ultraman,Animated tokusatsu kind of takes the fun out of it.
Ultraman,god is the frame rate so low on the animation in the series? looks like a video toaster highschool level project
Ultraman,You lost me at CG.
Ultraman,Was the first season also this jittery?
Ultraman,That's not the same Ultraman I used to watch :)
Ultraman,"They spend so much money on the ""live action"" but because of how cheaply they produce anime it's gotten to the point for me that if they talk about a new series coming out I won't even consider it"
Ultraman,"I would bet that it has something to do with production or streaming performance, because it isn't a style most of the studios use for all of their other works.

It doesn't bother me, but it bothers enough people that there's almost certainly a non-artistic reason."
Ultraman,"From what I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre much cheaper to animate but audiences are still resistant to them I guess that‚Äôs why they usually do it with series that already have a strong Brand name recognition like ultra man, knights of the zodiac, cyborg 009 and dorohedoro."
Ultraman,"they intentionally reduce the frame rate to look more like normal animation. If they kept the original rate, it would look like pure cgi"
Ultraman,"Well, there's been about 20. Even the Ultraman you used to watch probably isn't the original, since it didn't get popular until Ultraseven (Second Ultraman series and third Ultra series.)"
Ultraman,"I've read it's considerably cheaper than traditional animation. And It's hit or miss, sometimes it looks good and other times horrible. I personally facial animations are god awful with CG anime, but I can tolerate it if the show is good. 

Knights of Sidonia jumps between looking awful and great. But it's such a great show that I ignored the shitty at times animation.

On topic here though. Ultraman actually looks pretty decent most of the time. The story didn't book me enough to keep watching though"
Ultraman,If they are going CGI at least the animation should be fluid.
Ultraman,"I used to watch Ultraman and Ultraseven, Ultraseven was my favorite with its cool glasses and his 'pokemon-before-there-was-pokemon' pocket monsters :)"
Ultraman,"I tend to not be a fan of the CG anime look, but fuck it, I'm willing to give Ultraman a shot."
Ultraman,As someone who grew up watching Ultraman and still has some of the toys I cannot put into words how much I am looking forward to this.
Ultraman,I've never watched Ultraman but I'm looking forward to this.
Ultraman,this rendered on a fucking ps3?
Ultraman,"Ugh, it moves like a cut scene to a video game from 20yrs ago. "
Ultraman,"Am I the only one who wishes the CG had the classic ""guy in a suit"" look?"
Ultraman,"- Hype for Ultraman

- Not hype for that cheap CGI look"
Ultraman,"For anyone wondering, the original manga version is about the world post your typical ultraman era. Now some every day people are descendants of monsters and some are descendants or ultraman. They don‚Äôt grow the size of a building and the protagonist doesn‚Äôt actually transform to ultraman, they just have this Ironman-like suit for him. "
Ultraman,But when is Ultralord getting his own show?
Ultraman,Animation looks terrible...
Ultraman,Hey that's not Ultraman of the Crime Syndicate

I can't fucking wait."
Ultraman,"I am wondering if they insist on using 3D for anime, when someone will use the technique from Dragonball Fighter Z. A 3D Videogame but almost indistinguishable from classic 2D."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I was skeptical as fuck about this. I'm 6 episodes in and I've really enjoyed it. Felt better than some of the recent seasons. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Reminds me when G4 made a spaceballs animated show 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Will watch as long as they keep putting them out. Not like its some serious drama like the leftovers or something. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it goes on to long, its enjoying the characters and bringing you back the environment. "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I'm actually enjoying the animated show more then I thought I might. I hope they continue to put out some live stuff on Netflix. But they did say they will do a live action series on Swearnet still so I'll pay for that of it comes down to it. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I don't think I'm going to bother, and I say that as a Canadian fan of the show since day one of its original run on Showcase.  I even liked the later Netflix seasons (which weren't the same, but still had their moments).

This just seems like a last, desperate attempt to milk the franchise."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Two episodes in and... it's alright I guess.

Don't envy those guys. With Lahey passing away, they really were kind of backed into the corner with the live action stuff. I'll finish the season with an open mind and hope it wins me over by the end."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,This show has gone on far too long
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I thought it was pretty fucking funny. The snippets of Dunsworth's voice seemed a little odd. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Without Mr Dunsworth,its pointless"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,do i need to have seen any other seasons of this show to enjoy this one?
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,It's not up to the heights of the old seasons but I was actually surprised I liked this animated version as much as I did. I think it's better than the most recent seasons. No Lahey but people have to move on. It's far better than any generic sitcom on CBS and I'd rather support these guys than a huge network. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I was also skeptical about them doing an animated series. But I really don't think they had much of a choice. After Dunsworths passing (RIP) and the guys are getting pretty old.  I don't think they had much of a choice. Don't get me wrong I hope to see some more live action but it would be nice to have both. Because the animation series does open up a lot of new possibilities for some fresh new writing.  Personally I enjoyed the animated series and thought it was better than some of the more recent series.  I did have an idea though about how to incorporate Lahey into the live action. What if they did him just like they're doing in the animation show? Like he speaks to Randy or whomever through the liquor?  Maybe use like a hologram of him or maybe even CGI. I'm not a professional on film by no means but im sure it could be pulled off enough for him to make an appearance every now and then. But then again it could be totally cheesy.  But I'm just glad that the show is still going on! Because it could have stopped the show all together. So as long as I get a few laughs I will continue to support them. When you've been watching from the begining like a lot of us have, Then the guys feel like family and I feel some what obligated to support them and the show.  

Edit: I really enjoyed the flashback episode!!"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I'm a huge fan of TPB but the last few seasons and now this are just disappointing. Sorry, the jokes are just recycled and the gimmick just isn't working anymore.

These guys are funny, they should keep trying other things! Also RIP John Dunsworth he was the driving force of the shows as the antagonist.
"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Anyone a fan of Shelley Thompson (Barb Lahey)? She stars in my web series and I can flip you the link. I love her. She's hilarious!
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Jumped the shark 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,How embarrassing...
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,#APRIL FOOLS
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,No kidding? That was my biggest criticism from the last few seasons. It just felt really forced and typical. Couldn‚Äôt tell you anything about the last few seasons 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"It has a similar look to it, but I found this to be a lot more faithful to the original and pretty damn funny."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Was that worth a watch at all?
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Agreed.  I have almost no critical faculties for that show whatsoever.  It's basically just a real documentary of those actors and how they decide to continue their show.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I'll watch as long as they keep making me laugh
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I want another out of the park series 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I have found it fresh and hilarious so far. I'd recommend giving it a shot. The premise makes sense and they have definitely taken advantage of these characters being in an animated world.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Then don't watch it. I want it to go on forever personally. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Disagree wholeheartedly.

Last season was great imo, and I still enjoyed the other Netflix seasons."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I knew that the show was over when they made the ham-fisted decision to name the baby ""Motel."""
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Mr Laheys legacy will live on. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Not really but it a lot of the jokes and humor will not make sense/ be funny 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Not really.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Don't watch it then. I enjoy it so far and continue to enjoy everything they do. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,How so? They have an audience and are supplying that audience. If you don't like it don't watch it. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I wish it was.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"It was utter garbage. Atleast I thought so when it aired, though I highly doubt it's gotten better with age."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,More like Europe and less like USA tho. The USA one was way to bubble centric. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"People can have negative opinions on stuff, especially in the television subreddit, I don't see why you would be defensive about a show that's been on as long as TPB has been on for.

&#x200B;

I lost interest during season 8 or 9.  The show didn't seem as ""natural"" to me anymore."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,In the liquor. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"The flashback episode in this new season, you won't get any of the jokes. But all others you'll be pretty good. "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Eh 90% of the jokes are inside jokes about the characters from previous seasons at this point. I would argue it‚Äôs not going to be funny to someone that hasn‚Äôt watched these characters be established over the years.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Do they?

Seems like they're trying a new gimmick because their audience has dwindled to such a point that a complete revamp to the format of the show is what they're hoping will bring in new viewers."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Europe was way better but I still really liked the US one. The song they made was great lol. Mexico or something would be cool 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,As a Canadian I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing the boys explore the rest of the great white north. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Same. I'd love to see their take on Japan or Australia.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,He wasn't negative. He just said to not watch it if you don't like it. No one is forcing you to watch shows you don't like. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Because it's people who are not fans. If you don't like the show don't comment? 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"People can have negative opinions about negative opinions, I don't see why you would be defensive about a Reddit comment when your argument collapses in on itself like a dying star.

Oh, right, because you agreed with that negative opinion.

Your opinion is stupid, in my oh-so-humble opinion."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"It basically became ""DUDE, WEED!: The Show"" once Netflix picked it up."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,[...I am the liquor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWCBghizQUs)
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Actually it's because they are getting old and can't keep up apperences anymore. The actor who plays Julian has been balding for awhile, it's very noticeable on the live podcasts they do weekly and with the death of the actor who plays Jim Lahey, John Dunsworth, they had little choice. Even if the animated switch was being though of prior, his death forced their hand.

But to answer you direct question, yes they do have an audience. One big enough to support yearly live tours to sell out crowds (I've been in a few of them) and for Netflix to continue to renew their shows and spin offs. "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Well I'm a fan of animated shows so I will definitely give this a shot.  Haven't watched much of TPB recently but the animated show has me intrigued.  
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,It was good. But was to much focused on the song. I liked when they did more tasks. USA seemed to abandon the tasks premise a little to much. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"People get emotionally invested in characters and want to see the journey through.  I disliked the Office after Michael Scott left but I kept watching to see the journey through.  I've watched Chris Carter piss all over the mythology of the X-Files in hopes that he'd somehow provide resolution (spoiler: he didn't).  Not saying it's right, but I think it's fairly common."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Lol so you only want positive reviews? I'm a fan of the live show but I think this animated show is pretty bad..
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I too prefer circle jerk over having my opinions mildly challenged. This is a safe place, please bury the infidels comments with downvotes, make us whole again. "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I knew about that one guy dying, but really if they can't keep up with it then just end it. Don't create a wholly new aesthetic and try to pass it off as the same thing.

But, frankly, what do I care? I'm just an outsider looking in on this, I don't even like *Trailer Park Boys*. I've tried three times to enjoy it and I just find it extremely annoying."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Yeah that was disappointing.

The ice sculpting was my favorite park of Europe "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Reviews are fine. The gentleman I was speaking with didn't even watch it. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,This isn't politics. It's entertainment. You dislike the show so there's not really any reason to post other then to shit on something others enjoy. No one is going to have their opinion changed about what entertains them. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"So why not just ignore this thread?  I don't really watch TPB but I don't feel the need to poke my opinion into a thread.  


Edit: I'm definitely interested in the animated version though because I like animation.  "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Thats a lot of assumptions, i havent seen the show,  last time i checked this is r/television for television discussion and news, key Word being discussion here, believe it or not i like reading both slides and find those type of gate keeping comments frustrating. "
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Never saw an episode of corner gas but its cartoon series last year was a highlight
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,If someone watched it and didn't like it that's fine. The guy I was speaking with didn't watch it and doesn't like the show. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"just noticed you are all over this thread, i don't know why it bothers you so much to have people saying they don't like something you do, they aren't even being particularly offensive.

What ever makes you sleep better at night dude."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,It doesn't effect me but when I see people posting negitive comments when they haven't watched something and I'm bored I'm gonna probably reply. Just as you are wasting time replying to me about replying to them. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"You realize the guy you were talking to never said if they watch it or not, right? You are actually the one who told them to not watch it if they don't like it.

And besides, this is a TPB ~~subreddit~~ post--for discussions of all things TPB. And that includes making negative comments. There's a reason the downvote button is for comments that ""don't contribute"" to the discussion, rather than for being posts that disagree. If someone came on here randomly talking about Pokemon then yeah tell them to fuck off/downvote them. But as far as I'm concerned, if the post or comment is related to the topic then talk as freely as you want.

Edit: meant to say ""post"" not ""subreddit"""
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,This isn't a trailer park boys subreddit. This is the /r/television subreddit. 
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Are they going to do an more seasons of the regular show? I imagine it's probably a lot cheaper and easier to just keep making the animated one instead. Couldn't get into the first season but I didn't really give it a fair shot.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I actually like the animation style. Even though the coloring is a bit flat, the animation is quite smooth."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Not a fan , but LOVE the og show pre Netflix"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I think it‚Äôs a means to get around the core element of conflict of the live action show, Mr. Lahey, can no longer happen due to the actors death. Going animated allows them to do the more wacky stuff they couldn‚Äôt do live action. Also it could be to get around the actors getting older too or something. Corner Gas also went the animated route."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I gave it a fair shot.  It was ok at best.   
      
   
I think they should have kept it more grounded more like the show more realistic. For example: losing an arm, having it go black, then reattaching it with no problems.         
It was kind of funny but it took away from the real reason TPB are funny.            
Seeing them young was ok, and seeing how the ""cast"" was long ago was good ( fucking seeing Sam Lasco was great ). But the whole space adventure was fucking dumb ( again it goes back to my original statement - was just to unrealistic).       
  
I'll watch season 2 but I don't think I could watch a 3rd animated season. Time to get back to live action boys.  
And fuck off with the Out of the Park !! I'll never watch that garage."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"There's a new season coming later this year, set In jail.

The whole gang are imprisoned and there's strong indications that the long-missing, twiggy alien-armed cocksucker Trevor is returning.

Gimme a smoke hairdo."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,The show went off the tracks seasons ago. Flanderization to the max.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Bro if Trevor comes back fans are gonna watch TPB again like crazy. All they'd need then is Mike Clattenburg and maybe get Barrie Dunn to play some Ray cameos as a guest star. Shit would be fucking top.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"In 2015, Netflix was more like HBO than NBC. They used to take time and only release shows that passed whatever quality checks they had. Now it seems they pretty much buy any  show they can get their hands on, and hope something sticks"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Where‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äù ? It‚Äôs one of their biggest hits.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Still can't believe they cancelled Tuca & Bertie & Sense8
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I remember when I started watching OITNB, the fucking sensation it was, even in my very-conservative country. It had the raunchiest sex scenes that somehow surpassed GOT's, it was nominated for just about every award show in every category. Then the show itself started to fade in season 4 (which is coincidentally the same time Netflix started putting out hundreds of shows). 

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects. 

I'll forever be grateful that it housed Bojack Horseman, Dark, and a few others, but damn, what a fall."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"You left out dark, elite, la casa de papel, and other foreign shows that are extremely popular on netflix"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Grace and Frankie is still the best Netflix original
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"One word: fatigue.

Be it netflix, be it the viewer. Somewhere fatigue is showing up."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,You was originally a Lifetime show
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,What does being a conservative have to do with it?
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Looking at his lists, his definition can‚Äôt be very accurate. Also, if something getting buzz doesn‚Äôt really say anything. I‚Äôm not sure why you would use that as a factor."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,yeah wasn't sure what comparison to make for a network that has a lot of shows but some gems in the dust. Was thinking USA or AMC
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"Here in Brazil it means being against things that are feminist, LGBT, etc. We're mistaken as a sex-positive, progressive country because of carnival but we're really not."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Sabrina started in 2018
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"I believe I nominated American Dad, Bob‚Äôs Burgers, Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty and The Simpsons."
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,I hope the nominated Primal because it is a masterpiece but I'm very doubtful.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Bojack‚Äôs View from Halfway Down is the best episode of television I‚Äôm glad I never have to watch again.  It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúRequiem for a Dream‚Äù of tv episodes.
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,"My picks would be American Dad, BoJack Horseman, Duncanville, Harley Quinn, Primal"
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Good choices dude!
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Nominations on Tuesday the 28th
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Why not watch again?
Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series,Good picks
Touch,"having the son become a teenage father was an interesting choice. It's one of those things that makes me think ""damn, well his life is over"", but they show that even if you make a huge mistake like that, life can still go on and be fine. Your life will be harder, but it's still possible to live life."
Touch,"‚ÄúHey Dad can I use your -‚Äú

uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh no.‚Äù"
Touch,Man I love this show as a kid
Touch,It was great until they made all the characters utterly stupid to get cheap laughs.
Touch,"This show is a classic, and after almost twenty years it still a massive hit here in Brazil. I'm surprised to hear that it wasn't very successful in the US."
Touch,I loved Franklin.
Touch,"‚ÄúDances with Wolves isn‚Äôt a porno‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is if you freeze frame!‚Äù

That quote still sounds in my head from time to time lol"
Touch,"I started watching this on Hulu just as a nostalgia thing. When I was young my family would watch it during dinner. I forgot or was too young to realize how damn funny it is! The Wayans family in general I still think are underrated despite all they‚Äôve done and continue to do. ILC, Wayans Bros, My Wife and Kids, the Scary Movie franchise. Classic stuff.

Also ABC had a chokehold on the sitcom game in the early 2000s"
Touch,"‚ÄúThat sounds like the car from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want to spell Chitty with an S‚Äù"
Touch,"I loved this show. This, George Lopez, and Home Improvement were my favorites"
Touch,"The episode where they go on holiday and the son falls in love with a girl he meets and doesn't want to leave, then the dad explains puppy love and how to deal with it was the type of life lesson I never got from my family. There should be more of this on TV.

[Stuff like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooAOc9Fwg0U)"
Touch,He treated his son like shit throughout.
Touch,Underrated!? I loved that show!
Touch,"It was quite popular in France back in the days, but at the end it could never reach the legendary status that Malcolm in the middle had (and still has) here

To me it was OKish, the humour was extremely redundant and the prerecorded laughing is always a turnoff"
Touch,I‚Äôve been watching this and The Bernie Mac Show since I was a kid and never understood why no one else watched them
Touch,"I've been quoting 'Open the door, Close the door, I,  am, so, confussssssseeeddd'  for years and only recently looked it up and realised it was from this show!

For some reason I had convinced myself that everyone knew the quote and that it was the equivalent of asking 'Who loves orange soda??'... It is not."
Touch,There was a show called ‚ÄúRoc‚Äù with Charles S. Dutton that touched on real topics every episode.
Touch,üßëüèæ‚Äçü¶≤üí•üëã
Touch,Downtown charlie brown. Funky clown
Touch,Damon Wayans is a talent. Miss him on TV.
Touch,"It's a classic here in France it's called ""ma famille d'abord"" (translate to my family first) and everyone know it a bit watched a few episodes not too long ago and it's style pretty cool"
Touch,"The only reason I didn‚Äôt like this show was junior was so stupid, And NOONE IS AS STUPID AS JUNIOR"
Touch,"It was an incredibly stupid sitcom, especially the later seasons"
Touch,üé∂ No touching her behind. No kissing in the dark. üé∂
Touch,I blame this show for swelling Damon‚Äôs head to the point that he was insufferable on the set of Lethal Weapon and ruining the final season by getting Riggs fired.
Touch,"Now .  ""Homie don't play that"""
Touch,"In Brazil it's part of the culture. Everybody knows this show, just like Woody Woodpecker, El Chavo Del Ocho and Everybody Hates Chris. There is a couple of years since I last watched TV, but I bet it still airs to this day. It's a lunch time go-to show. The series is complete in portuguese on youtube. There is also a lot of channels live streaming it, on both twitch and youtube."
Touch,"Watched it recently, some of it is quite dated. These strong family values seem very archaic by modern standards"
Touch,"My favorite part was the laugh track. Whenever the husband is making fun of the wife, you hear what sounds like a big guy laughing obnoxiously loud. It‚Äôs hilarious."
Touch,It taught me all about Euro Training. Now I'm the size of a house.
Touch,"When I was a kid, I used to stay up late into morning on school days (I remember one time staying up till 5:00 AM) to catch reruns of MWAK, Everybody Hates Chris and George Lopez. I still remember EHC the best but it was such a great lineup. I should see if I can watch this show somewhere, it's been awhile."
Touch,Just went and rewatched this show last year. It was fantastic and it fit right into the era.
Touch,Re watched the series the very recently and its actually even better than i remember. Extremely funny parts and serious parts. Can't believe it was cancelled instead of finishing itself properly though
Touch,"Eu üí™üèø ro  
Trai üèãüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ning"
Touch,Watching Television shows doesn't create serial killers... CANCELLING TV shows does! The Wayans Brothers was a good show!
Touch,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs underrated . Growing up this was everyone‚Äôs fav ! People just fell off .
Touch,I loved this show :)
Touch,"I loved this show when I was a kid!!! It came on nick at night around 8 when technically I should‚Äôve been getting to bed, so the jokes went over my 8-9yo brain most of the time but there were a lot of great lessons in there about being loving and patient with your family"
Touch,"What‚Äôs crazy about this show is that it was on from 01-05 and had Michael Jordan, Shaq, and Lebron on it."
Touch,Loopalinda!!!!
Touch,I remember there was an episode about the son breaking his dick from masturbating too much
Touch,Yeah great show
Touch,The Jim Gaffigan Show is sadly missed. It was amusing and pleasant.
Touch,Superb show ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
Touch,"I remember Franklin playing the piano and thinking Katie is a sucker for not jumping on the Franklin ship while she can  üòÇ

I was young at the time but I knew he had major game"
Touch,"I really liked this show. I wonder if it's on streaming anywhere...

Edit: shit it's on Disney. Hell yeah."
Touch,It was somehow a good show but individually each of the characters was extremely annoying.
Touch,"The most golden scene in the show was when Junior and his friend got high, and the parents started acting all crazy to freak them out"
Touch,"I‚Äôm glad to see this show get praise. Use to watch it all the time, and was hilarious yet took itself seriously"
Touch,"I went back and re-watched this show recently on Hulu and I must say I appreciated it way more now than I did before. Solid performances from everyone across the board, it was actually hilarious, and I really loved seeing Damon Wayans and Tisha Campbell play off of each other. Definitely a show I could see myself watching again soon."
Touch,Didn‚Äôt he call his son a dummy and hit him? I get the comedy of it but I wouldn‚Äôt call those strong values.
Touch,My grandma and I would watch this and According to Jim everytime they came on. Good shows.
Touch,"Kinda don't give a shit about a sitcom promoting strong values or touching upon necessary topics, just looking for them to be funny."
Touch,The bar has never been lower for below average sitcoms getting member berry pieces
Touch,"I rember it being really mean spirited, sexist and not very funny. I can generally only cope with two of those at a time."
Touch,I remember it being merely okay.
Touch,"Great Great show, especially the first 2 and a half seasons."
Touch,Every time the dad made fun of the son‚Äôs funny shaped head made me laugh.
Touch,Never loved watching Nick@Nite more as a kid than when they added this
Touch,"In Italy this was huge, great sitcom"
Touch,"Didn't the series end with the dad lying to the mum about getting a vasectomy then then banging and get getting pregnant?

I'f it didn't end that way I definitely remember it happening and it's suck with me because I'm fairly certain that that classified as rape.  I don't remember the scene getting any laughs but it's still weird to end your sitcom with one main character raping another."
Touch,Anything the Wayans family worked on is generally underrated
Touch,The episode where the Dad coaches the daughter's soccer team did not age well. Very transphobic.
Touch,"When i was little I had a huge crush on Damon Wayons and then when his son was a New Girl I had a huge crush on him too. He looked just like Damon Wayons, but someone turned the sexy waaay up."
Touch,Yeah I liked that show when I was a kid
Touch,Nd it was fucking hilarious.
Touch,"If I recall, at least at the time it aired, it was the longest running sitcom without a holiday episode."
Touch,Great show
Touch,Hate sitcoms but this one was actually pretty good. Dealt with interesting topics and most importantly was actually funny.
Touch,Oh please. That show is boring. It Shames teenagers.
Touch,"Too bad the father is a fucking piece of shit, a horrible person, horrible father, other than that, I laughed a lot and still laugh when I watch it, still a hit in Brazil, just like: everybody hates Chris, fresh prince, chaves, Chapolin and this one (and I miss Kenan and Kel)"
Touch,Dude Michael and his wife are the best honestly. So many fights and things in their relationship are so real and I can relate to them. Great show
Touch,[removed]
Touch,So like most family sitcoms....
Touch,"Parker McKenna Posey sure has grown up, wow."
Touch,Damon wayans is a goat.
Touch,I thought ‚ÄúMy Wife and Kids‚Äù was the John Ritter show‚Ä¶
Touch,"And in 20 years we‚Äôll find out something horrible about a cast member, ala the Cosby Show"
Touch,"Damon Wayans, the whiny petulant second in the Lethal Weapon television series? No thanks."
Touch,"In my vague after school haze of memories I remember something about this show being problematic, as most black shows i saw growing up were unfortunately."
Touch,Yeah but no one here knows about it because you actually gotta have some flavor
Touch,No sitcom can or ever will be underrated. Sitcoms are brain death and rot. Opiate for masses.
Touch,That show was fire
Touch,"My noons weren't complete without watching it, great show."
Touch,Loved it here in Aus too
Touch,Love this show so much. The Wayans were on another level. You mean now I can watch Maj. Payne on ABC?! Good times.
Touch,I loved watching this when I was growing up and would definitely go back and watch% same with George Lopez
Touch,I love this show so much. Me and the missus watch it over every so often.
Touch,I don‚Äôt really like sitcoms at all but I fucking loved MWaK
Touch,The kid that played jr was hilarious and him and Damon Wayans played off each other very well.
Touch,Good show indeed.
Touch,Loved this show
Touch,"We live in a world where marketing sinks or floats everything.  

That‚Äôs daunting, but at the same time inspiring due to its indication that taste is subjective and the media is curated by coin, not excellence."
Touch,Uh‚Ä¶ uhh‚Ä¶. UHHHHHH‚Ä¶. neh?
Touch,I love this show. Also the episode where the father is trying to pump gas at the gas station.
Touch,so was the hughleys!
Touch,Loved this show when it aired.
Touch,"Need me a relationship like Mike and Jay tbh, learned a lot about relationships and the family unit watching this and still watch it till today! Defo up there with Fresh Prince"
Touch,I still love watching this
Touch,"Saw a few episodes of it one weekend once, was enjoyable from what i saw"
Pablo,"Hollywood Reporter called it ""a less entertaining version of The Mandalorian"" in [their review](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/halo-review-1235111130/)."
Pablo,"""Serviceable"" is actually better than what I have been expecting."
Pablo,"Halo is such a video game story I always felt like to tell it in a different visual medium you had to leave Chief behind and do something else

I‚Äôll still check this out but it‚Äôs not great start, hopefully past episode 2 it improves"
Pablo,">Serviceable

Hey, we should be thankful that the Halo show (so far) is just okay instead of downright garbage like other video game shows/movies"
Pablo,Serviceable is probably the best anyone could have hoped for if we are being honest.
Pablo,Read Pablo Shreiber as Paul Schrader while scrolling and that def put some interesting ideas in my head
Pablo,"This doesn't sound that different than the Witcher reviews, and reddit blew that show"
Pablo,Curious to see how it goes. Kinda wished it came out when Halo 3 was fresh in our mind but it's hopefully better than nothing.
Pablo,"Honestly, reviews in B+ - B- ranges is pretty good. I can live with an ok first season if it has potential and capacity to improve.





Variety also reviewed: https://variety.com/2022/tv/reviews/halo-review-paramount-plus-1235204379/"
Pablo,"This snippet from Polygon doesn't bode well at all

>Halo is like an adaptation of a video game series as handled by someone who played a few levels of it once in college. Or maybe he just watched his friend play, he can‚Äôt quite remember. There‚Äôs definitely a guy in recognizable green armor, and he definitely fights some aliens, but beyond that it‚Äôs a bit of a blur. There‚Äôs some kind of relic, it may or may not have something to do with a ring world, which might also be a weapon. It‚Äôs really hard to say.

>This is a show for people who have, at best, a passing familiarity with the games. There‚Äôs little to no actual explanation of who or what is going on, so you better know the Master Chief and the Covenant. But it‚Äôs also not a show for people to know too much, because otherwise you might get confused why none of this seems to match up with the story of the games that have been released over the last 20 years. It‚Äôs a very tight window.

>In other words, if your conception of Halo is a guy in green armor doing space shit; congratulations, you finally have your Halo show. ‚ÄîAusten Goslin"
Pablo,Serviceable is considerably better than my expectations
Pablo,"I‚Äôll take it, since it‚Äôs alreAdy renewed for a S2 I hope it does well viewership wise and then they get a bigger budget and a quality increase for S2. I was pretty worried about this so if it‚Äôs serviceable I‚Äôll take that for the 1st season, it‚Äôs gonna need to improve for S2 tho."
Pablo,"Paramount seems to always be stuck in 2nd place. The reviews remind me of the way 1883 was reviewed, with damn near everyone comparing it to *Deadwood* and calling 1883 an inferior copy. Except in this case it's *The Mandalorian*.

Lets just say it's probably better than Book of Boba Fett and call it a day? That still makes it better than 99% of most video-game adaptations."
Pablo,Serviceable is much better than I expected
Pablo,"Nice, haven't been taking much interest in this since most game-to-tv adaptations don't go the best. 

But if it's good, will be a nice thing to borrow from the bay of pirates because wtf is a Paramount+."
Pablo,"For those who prefer reading reviews written by people who actually spellcheck, proof-read and appear to enjoy writing: [https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/halo-review-series-paramount-plus-1234707833/](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/halo-review-series-paramount-plus-1234707833/)"
Pablo,"Guys guys... you don't get it, 343 *had* to break apart the timeline to make sure that they had the creative freedom to make a completely average show after 9 years in development. *sigh* why do we even bother with Halo."
Pablo,"Serviceable to me means, there's MUCH more that could have been done."
Pablo,Halo fandom is approaching dangerous level of hopium regarding this show nearly on par with OW fans regarding OW2.
Pablo,"When Collider, of all sites, is not circle-jerking about your product, then you just might have a steaming pile of shit on the horizon."
Pablo,"Well, the last thing I watched was The Book of Boba Fett so the bar's set pretty low right now."
Pablo,Wow‚Ä¶so Pornstache is playing master chief in this? Now I kinda wanna watch it just out of morbid curiosity.
Pablo,everything they wrote about the plot is making me cringe.. awwww fuck.
Pablo,They made a halo show?
Pablo,high praise indeed!
Pablo,"Okay so the reviewer only got the first 2 episodes. So literally impossible to judge even close to the full picture‚Ä¶

While I highly doubt the show will be an amazing piece of TV entertainment at least it‚Äôs good to know it‚Äôs not terribly cringe inducing.

I‚Äôll obviously watch since there‚Äôs still part of the Halo fanboy from my childhood in me that wants to be in love with the franchise again. But keeping expectations super low.

Who knows maybe we‚Äôll get another Witcher and have an actual solid video game show to watch. (And yes I know The Witcher was originally adapted from a novel series)"
Pablo,"Pablo is sexy AF , he got super jacked for the role and I was peeping big time on Ig üëÄüëÄ"
Pablo,When does it come out?
Pablo,All of these reviews are for the whole show? Or just the first episode? Only the first episode was shown at SXSW right?
Pablo,So it‚Äôs exceeding expectations
Pablo,"The optimist in me means this won't be very good but has potential to fix a lot of the issues by the second season. 

The cynic in me is saying this article is trying to be as polite as possible at saying it's generic and boring."
Pablo,I'll wait for the full series to come out before I decide if I want to watch it. So far none of it interests me.
Pablo,"Let‚Äôs be real here, Jessica McNamee (Sonya blade) was the worst acting wise in the film."
Pablo,"Well it sounds like the best case scenario for a Halo adaptation, especially for one they've been trying to get off the ground for over a decade. Still, the games got more interesting when they gave more spotlight to the Covenant, so they'll have the opportunity to do the same thing here as the series progresses."
Pablo,"Reviews so far sound very bleh. Doesn't matter if it's a gaming-oriented site full of Halo players or reviewers that have no idea about the game. They *all* seem to call it ""okay and middling, not bad. Not great.""

I'll be honest, after the long development hell, Steven Spielberg involved and over 200 drafts, I expected better."
Pablo,"The showrunner made the mistake of taking a well established, popular franchise and changing it to their own vision."
Pablo,Eh. I don't have high expectations for the show so in my mind that's a pretty favorable review.
Pablo,"Mandalorian is a pretty high bar to be fair, wasn't it basically a viral hit?"
Pablo,In fairness that is also how I would describe the book of boba Fett and I (eventually) watched all of that
Pablo,"As soon as there was word that they were finally actually going ahead with the Halo TV series I immediately thought to myself that it was too late and the Mandalorian comparisons are going to kill it immediately. Even with the similar story beats that review outlines, Master Chief's design has always been blatantly inspired by Boba Fett."
Pablo,That‚Äôs grim. 343 have cocked it up again
Pablo,Same but it's still a kick in the nuts given what they have to work with lol.
Pablo,">Serviceable

I'll take it. It's a better result than most video game adaptations."
Pablo,"This was why I thought the Forward Unto Dawn movie they made (to promote Halo 4) was surprisingly decent for what it was. Focused on a bunch of recruits, their drama and commentary on the world within the lore and get caught in the middle of a Covenant attack. The Chief only shows up towards the end and has his quick moments of glory before the story wraps up by focusing back to the main recruit. 

As a long time fan, I‚Äôve always been far more fascinated to see more Halo stories from the point of view of the regular soldiers, one of the reasons why ODST was such a great game."
Pablo,[deleted]
Pablo,Younger Sgt. Johnson near the beginning of the war would be prime
Pablo,thats what happens when your main character is the most generic motherfucker this side of the mississippi who has all the plot armor available to them but nothing that makes them stand out asides from their aesthetics
Pablo,"I don't disagree, but you're not getting a show greenlit without Chief. Indeed, I'd imagine execs are so risk adverse that you're not getting anything to be greenlit unless it follows a proven commodity as much as possible (whether it be 100% the games or the games mixed and matched with elements from other shows)."
Pablo,A lot of people really underestimate how hard it would actually be to translate most games into movies.
Pablo,"I like playing through the Halo games but I always found the story and characters to be wafer thin. It sets up a standard ‚Äòyou vs alien horde for 8 hours‚Äô shtick, maybe some lite twist towards the end of the game, but that‚Äôs it. It feels like they came close to ditching the story entirely in the last game - I don‚Äôt know why I was fighting whoever I was fighting. Still enjoyed it though."
Pablo,I want to do reach as a band of brothers behind enemy lines war story. Dunno if paramount would pick that up.
Pablo,Halo‚Äôs game story is downright terrible most of the time so them taking the cliff notes of it and doing their own thing is probably for the best.
Pablo,"Unfortunately, we live in a post Arcane world."
Pablo,And that's the reason you will countinue to get bad adaptations.
Pablo,"And the pilot is *usually* the worst episode of a show too. If we‚Äôre lucky, it gets better and better after it‚Äôs done setting everything up in the pilot."
Pablo,And it's says alot. Tells me the show is average as shit and gone in one season.
Pablo,Paul Shaffer
Pablo,"I got hung up on ""the dusty planet of Madrigal"" singing the song from encanto... üé∂ welcome to the family Madrigal üé∂"
Pablo,High school me would‚Äôve been super excited.  Now? I gotta figure out how to watch it. Knowhatimsayin?
Pablo,"It has the same meta score as the Netflix Witcher adaptation on Metacritic. If that means anything. 

Also *Variety* and *Playlist* ended up giving the Witcher and Halo identical scores."
Pablo,Yeah and they'll have a new show runner next season. So it COULD improve. Though idk if the new showrunner is any good.
Pablo,"Yikes. Yeah, based on this, and the pretty stiff acting in the trailers and lack of Steve Downes, I‚Äôm just going to pass on this."
Pablo,im basically the target audience. YES!
Pablo,">There‚Äôs little to no actual explanation of who or what is going on, so you better know the Master Chief and the Covenant.

Honestly, that was true for most people who played Halo: CE too. If you read the book that came out alongside it as backstory then you have a better idea, but otherwise both the Chief and Covenant are total blank slates. All you know is that humanity is being threatened by a coalition of aliens, and there's a big mysterious ringworld that the aliens are interested in. CE manages to be compelling/enjoyable with minimal backstory so that alone isn't enough to write off the show. The Covenant didn't really get fleshed out at all until Halo 2's story. That was a great part of H2, but the series doesn't require it to work at least in the beginning."
Pablo,"Shows rarely onot get one season these days, there‚Äôs a lot of upfront costs to that first season (sets, costumes, etc.) which are one-off expenses.

When shows are signed they are usually a 2 season deal because that second season is so cheap compared to the first because the initial investment is already in the first season.

That said, if a show bombs they can have the second season torn up. The only reason they say ‚Äúrenewed for a second season‚Äù always just before the first season premiere, is to make the public think it‚Äôs worth checking out cos they greenlit a second season. The reality is that it was always greenlit, it‚Äôs just publicity."
Pablo,[deleted]
Pablo,"You saying 1883 was often compared to Deadwood made me want to watch 1883!

Then the guy below you said it's nothing like Deadwood and I'm back to not caring. What a ride."
Pablo,because its a great and massive success in video games and books?
Pablo,">	sigh why do we even bother with Halo.

Looks like you certainly talk a lot about Halo."
Pablo,"It‚Äôs a solid start for a video game adaptation, already renewed for s2 as well so not out of the question that the show could improve in quality"
Pablo,"Yup, great actor and he‚Äôs like 6‚Äô5 and got jacked as shit so I think it‚Äôs honestly a great casting."
Pablo,Giant leprechaun to giant guy in a green suit.
Pablo,yes... you been livin under a rock?
Pablo,"The reviews are pretty much on par with the Witcher, also renewed for a S2 so hopefully they can improve on the show for the 2nd season. I think this is a solid start for a video game adaptation."
Pablo,premiere's on the 24th
Pablo,First two episodes.
Pablo,[deleted]
Pablo,"About as good as it gets as far as Star Wars content in the last 5 years goes, which is a low bar imo. I'd say a mando-comparison is a medium bar tbh."
Pablo,Not really. If it's worse than The Mandalorian I'd definitely be disappointed
Pablo,"It's Star Wars.

Quality hasn't been a factor in anything Star Wars' success for a long time.

There's been good stuff, bad stuff, terrible and great stuff, it all gets devoured the same."
Pablo,Mandalorian wasn't anything special though. It is popular among its target audience but as a show it relies on fan service too much and it is so cliche and repetitive. It is okay at best so I wouldn't say that is a pretty high bar.
Pablo,"Not really. People love Grogu, but in terms of actual story, Mando is pretty lacking. It's the same episode seven times, and then the finale."
Pablo,[deleted]
Pablo,Mandalorian was unwatchable
Pablo,">blatantly inspired by Boba Fett.

Uh, what? Because he has a helmet and is predominantly green?"
Pablo,Chief is clearly doomguy inspired...
Pablo,I would say the whole UNSC aesthetic is more directly inspired by the Alien franchise.
Pablo,"As a huge Halo fan, a show always faced an uphill battle. Translating a super soldier who can flip a tank fighting aliens into live action is God damn hard."
Pablo,"Honestly the best thing for a halo tv show

is have master chief just randomly show up to fuck shit up and help the main cast before heading off to his next adjective

Like he is doing his own plotline that your not focused on and only see the bits where he intersects with the main one"
Pablo,"Wait you're right... Halo 2 is my favorite because of the Arbiter's story, and it has nothing to do with Chief.... oh man."
Pablo,"Wait,what. Everyone in Noble Team had John-117 level characterization(under Bungie). If anything ODST was the game that treated characters best(mute Rookie notwithstanding)."
Pablo,"Eh, I don't agree? I can't remember a single character from Reach. They were all as interesting as can of soda. The only reason to get emotionally attached was how it connected to previous games. It was like Rogue One before Rogue One. 

At least Chief has that unique relationship with Cortana and at least the 4th game gives him some interesting conflict."
Pablo,"Lol, this opinion would have gotten you flamed to hell and back in 2010."
Pablo,"It always makes me laugh when people retroactively pretend Halo Reach had sophisticated complex characters.

They're all walking clich√©s. One guy even has a skull carved into his visor - y'know, the thing he has to see out of. And the one-liners, oh god. Most of them had forced unnecessary deaths too."
Pablo,"He's fun in doses, but he loses his appeal if you try too hard to make him three dimensional. Contact Harvest was good as a one off."
Pablo,This is basically the pitch for the show ‚ÄúJoey‚Äù
Pablo,"> nothing that makes them stand out asides from their aesthetics



I think he‚Äôs in love with a computer woman like the guy from that movie ‚ÄòHer‚Äô and that shit is kinda weird - so he has that going for him too."
Pablo,"He‚Äôs got a lot more personality and stuff in the Books so hopefully they take advantage of that instead of him just being the super cool but bland character in the games, that formula works way better as a video game"

Bitter Daisies,"As my brother would say - ""WRONG!!""

You said -

""I don't mean to be that person, but for a romance series, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal don't have that much on-screen chemistry.""

I mean.. What?? Sorry, but I just can't even muster up a proper rebuttal as that is just so..""WRONG!"""
Bitter Daisies,">As for Connell, well after this rewatch I've come to the conclusion that Connell is a bitch ass. Big-big fucking pussy! 

Well shoot, I didn't need to watch it twice to learn that.  Still loved the show though."
Bitter Daisies,How many romantic works have u seen? Connell and Marianne are dead as fuck.
Osmosis,is the main character called jones?
Osmosis,[deleted]
Osmosis,Its already 5am and im gonna start binging
Osmosis,"Sound interesting, I am sold"
Osmosis,"One of the worst pilots I've ever seen. Shitty characters, no plot progression at all, useless dialogue."
Osmosis,"Dull, pathetic, slow, wooden delivery. That wouldn't even work without the subtitles handicap. "
Osmosis,Just finished the first season. It's good. And entertaining. Give it a try.
Osmosis,Just finished binge watching the whole season in one day. Wonderful show. Good storytelling with some nice surprises and great cinematography.
Osmosis,I feel like I only like half the characters. So half the show. Only on episode 3. 
Osmosis,is this worth watching? i'm interested bc i love **A Very Secret Service** which sadly got cancelled :(
Osmosis,"What's with the revolting anorexic cadavers they're starving to death on this show?
 The dubbing is absolutely horrible. I wish they'd kept the French dialogue and provided subtitles. "
Osmosis,"""I haven't heard that name in a long time."""
Osmosis,It‚Äôs all the same message 
Osmosis,Exactly what I was thinking. 
Osmosis,is it good ?
Osmosis,"Have you seen all 7 episodes? I thought the same initially, but it gets much better. Characters develop and the plot definitely threw me for a loop."
Osmosis,french movies in a nutshell really i think ill give it a try
Osmosis,you can switch the audio & subtitle options
Osmosis,"
Esthers really the only one thats very skinny. I wouldnt say anorexically so. I mean anyone can be anorexic but to look anorexic implies thinness beyond that of the
average fashion model imo. Though I appreciate that all men dont find that attractive i dont need the leading female to be my type. As fat as tje other females Josephine is svelte with curves and Ana just has the body of a regular gal (and all the subsequent insecurities of one too. She thinks she is fat but notice nobody else sees it that way). Niels lover is svelte but very healthy looking and she has a young teens body. I dont really recall Swann showing much skin. Billie  seems so dramatically thin and tall because she is trans and her male body is going to read as stretched when judged by female body standards. The men seem pretty much average tjin athletic range which is pretty expected on tv unless theyre older.

I didnt even know dubbing was an option. I usually prefer it do i have tje option of doing chores while i watch. Although all things being equal, i think original language captures something dubbing cannot. But if im also folding laundry or doing dishes i need to be able to look away for a minute or two at a time without losing the thread of whats going on. Subtitles in a thriller with lots of twists and turns and characters means you just cant move your eyes from the screen"
Osmosis,"I'm into E4 now and I find it too trashy to really recommend it. 

The story seems too constructed. High tech good looking scenes, but not really deep. 

It's probably ok to binge watch it like I'm doing it now, but who is looking for a deep, well written series with meaningful characters is wrong here lol. 

&#x200B;"
Osmosis,Its good once you get past that its dubed lol
Osmosis,"I've heard it's good, I'm halfway through episode 3 but the way I see it is: if it doesn't develop and draw the audience in, when it's basically halfway through the season, what's the point of slogging on? 

Having said that I'll probably still watch it during my train commute but it's a thumbs down from me. Wooden and boring characters, bad delivery. Good premise ruined by the execution."
Osmosis,"I disagree, I love French cinema."
Osmosis,"Yep, not like ""Transferts"" which was a lot better. Too much corporate drama, not enough about the implications of the technology. "
Osmosis,Wait there is no original audio subtitled ? 
Osmosis,"Try watching it in French with English subtitles, much less awkward when I did that.

I did find the characters weird and unrelatable. But it gets better, trust me."
Osmosis,Me too
Osmosis,"on my netflix there is german , english , european spanish and brazilian portugueze dubs and english, german , arabic , french, and spannish subtitles
"
Osmosis,the french is the original audio.
Osmosis,Uhh i have no idea i didn't look :NotLikeThis:
Osmosis,[deleted]
Osmosis,I fucking love Matthew Rhys and noir shit. Loved this show.
Osmosis,Loved season one. A little wary about season two because of the new showrunners. We‚Äôll see I guess.
Osmosis,"My wife and I love this show.  

We certainly don't feel like Rhys is doing a Robert Downey Jr. impression in the role. If anything, we've compared his way of interpreting the character as similar to Bill Murray, but not as flippant. Messy and hard-to-respect-things, but not usually comedic.  

The entire cast is incredible. The writing is gripping. The look of the cinematography is perfect. 

We can't wait for the 2nd Season."
Osmosis,"Yeah I watched it initially because I was a huge fan of Matthew Rhys from The Americans, and thought he was equally good as a leading man here. 

A surprisingly very good TV show and really look forward to seeing what they do with a second season"
Osmosis,I really enjoyed it. Anyone else who did should probably give Bosch a shot as well. That show is clearly inspired by the original Perry Mason and the new Perry Mason takes some cues from both the original and Bosch.
Osmosis,"Check out Burr's run of the original show.  It's on Paramount streaming and Freevee(with ads though).  It is one of those shows where the cast has good chemistry between them which enhances the viewing experience.  I was a little put out they made Della gay in the remake, but she does kind of give that vibe in the show, so I can see where they got that.  I kinda hope they use each of Gardner's book and make a season long movie of them.  Even the tv show scripts that they wrote after they ran out of Gardner's work might make good story arcs.  the radio stories are pretty good as well.

So yes I'm looking forward to see if they can improve on season one."
Osmosis,"I really liked it. I started it thinking it was just a limited series, so I‚Äôm pretty excited for season 2."
Osmosis,"I‚Äôm a fan, I really had no context from the original series but I throughly enjoyed the narrative and Matthew Rhys is of course fantastic. I enjoyed all the characters really. I feel like there isn‚Äôt really any hard-boiled noir on television a d it really hit the spot for me. Add in the performances from the mother and of course Tatiana Maslany and I really hope they continue with the second season."
Osmosis,I just went into it blind when it was first released and ended up loving it. I didn't know i missed that genre so much. Actors did a great job too.
Osmosis,"Tatiana Maslany deserved an Emmy for this scene

[https://youtu.be/OSRjpZGTOy0](https://youtu.be/OSRjpZGTOy0)"
Osmosis,"Oh yeah I really loved it. Its utterly beautiful to watch, the cinematography is glorious. The cast is sublime, and play off each other so well. The story is engaging and kept me guessing up until the end.

And whilst its a great departure from the source material, I think it overall still managed to capture the spirit of the character quite well.

I'm really looking forward to the next season."
Osmosis,"More cautiously hopeful for Season 2, [**since there's been a showrunner team swap**](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hbo-perry-mason-new-showrunners-season-2-4172107/).  Granted, the new time are the guys who did *The Knick,* Michael Begler and Jack Amiel. But I didn't really like *The Knick* (ymmv). I liked Season 1 of *Perry Mason* a lot. I would have *preferred* it if they'd kept the guys who created/wrote/ran Season 1, Ron Fitzgerald and Rolin Jones.

Rolin Jones is now creator/showrunner on *Interview With the Vampire* (AMC).

Also, as someone who saw the OG show as a kid, I spent a lot of time wondering how the two were related. :D  (Also, in the books, Perry Mason was *always* a lawyer). But they did eventually swing around to the base configuration of the show by the end of the season, and the OG show viewers got an extra little easter egg as the end credits on the season finale *finally* used that brass-heavy original theme song."
Osmosis,"They didn't play the Ozzy song, other than that it was pretty damn good."
Osmosis,It's good but weird. The pacing just throws me. The gut drop death in the middle of the seasons just killed me.
Osmosis,"I started it but lost interest, but loved how it was shot. Maybe I should try it again."
Osmosis,I really liked it.  The set and production design was fantastic.
Osmosis,Oh hell yeah. Loved that show so much.
Osmosis,"I thought it was great. I keep forgetting a season 2 is coming.

I watched both Perry Mason and the Bosch season that featured Angel's Flight at the same time. That little trolley has been used in so many noir films and TV shows, including the original Raymond Burr version. It was interesting watching two TV detective shows that take place in L.A. 50 years apart but both use it as an important setting."
Osmosis,"I started it, but haven't finished it yet.  It just got so bleak after a while that I needed a break from it."
Osmosis,"I'm the exact opposite.

Huge fan of the original Raymond Burr TV series, as well as the early Perry Mason Hollywood movies of the 1930s and 40s."
Osmosis,Yeah I enjoyed it very much.  I'm a sucker for that time period of Los Angeles.  I'm a fan of everyone in the cast and can't wait to see what they do in the next season.  It's taking forever because of the show runner change.
Osmosis,"Felt like Perry Mason wasn't an important character in his own show. Found it very average, which is a shame, i love Matthew Rhys."
Osmosis,"I thought it was OK. It actually is the perfect example for me of a show that does not benefit from being a ""long movie"" instead of your standard procedural. It's a lot of time spent on a single case that isn't particularly interesting, and the characterization does not offset this."
Osmosis,"I bailed when the mexican woman sexed him so hard he fell from the bed, like wtf am I wasting my time with this garbage. If season 2 is more about Mason being Mason maybe I'll watch"
Osmosis,It was ok.  The acting is great but it‚Äôs a slow show
Osmosis,I loved the noir aspects of it the lawyer stuff though not so much
Osmosis,"I honestly didn‚Äôt even know there was a s2 happening, feels like I haven‚Äôt seen or heard anything at all about the show in awhile"
Osmosis,Meh
Osmosis,Great noir atmosphere and excellent hat game
Osmosis,"Loved it, very unique feel compared to other recent shows. Acting, writing, set design we‚Äôre all great. I thought there would be something more substantial with Sister Alice arc but maybe there will be more to that in season 2."
Osmosis,fyi /r/perry_mason
Osmosis,"Oh yeah, love some Shea Whigham!"
Osmosis,"I was a fan of season one but I'm done with season 2. It is so boring, I don't care about their personal lives, I want to watch them solve a case."
Osmosis,Yeah he just kinda...shows up.
Osmosis,"It didn't bug me.  The conceit was that California hadn't changed the bar exam questions in years. So all the DA had to do was get Perry to memorize the correct answers.

*edited to add the letter ""t""*"
Osmosis,"Yeah that was disappointing. I was personally hoping they would go down the route that Mason had already started studying law before the war, but his experiences meant he never went back.

I feel that would have fit better."
Osmosis,"Yeah. It was like ""we need to get him in the court room, Stat! This is a Perry Mason show!  Just gloss over all the details."""
Osmosis,"Matthew Rhys grew on me, between watching The Americans, Mason and that Mr Rogers movie in the same month I got nothing but respect for him."
Osmosis,Can you recommend any other good noirs you like? I loved Perry Mason it was nuts
Osmosis,"I‚Äôm kind of excited, the first season was great but kind of dragged a bit in the middle. Would be cool if the new show runners make it a little more fast paced. We‚Äôll see how it‚Äôs done"
Osmosis,It's also on either MeTV or AntennaTV every day.
Osmosis,"> I was a little put out they made Della gay in the remake, but she does kind of give that vibe in the show

She's a dame that's competent and don't take no guff! Clearly she should be a lesbian because that's the only thing that makes sense"
Osmosis,The cast of season 1 was really stacked with great actors.
Osmosis,[deleted]
Osmosis,[deleted]
Osmosis,"Obligatory YOU LISTEN TO JESUS, BUT NOT US!?"
Osmosis,"I know this question is a few months old but I‚Äôd strongly suggest Chinatown (1974). 

Perry Mason has a very strong Chinatown vibe and it takes place around the same time and place (post WWI, before WWII Los Angeles). JustWatch isn‚Äôt showing any services streaming it, but I‚Äôd strongly suggest renting it. It‚Äôs that good. 

Also strongly suggested is LA Confidential. Also takes place in LA, but post WWII. It pretty much kicked off the careers of Russell Crow and Guy Pierce. It‚Äôs on Hulu. 

If you want to go old school, you could go with Double Indemnity, one of the black and white noir classics. (Again, set in Los Angeles. See a pattern?)

The thing is, film noir has extended to include movies like Blade Runner (also set in LA) and Taxi Driver (which takes place in NYC if you want a change), not just period crime movies."
Osmosis,"""So Perry has to become a Lawyer on super short notice.""  
""Oh man, that sounds pretty hard.""  
""Actually, it's super easy. Barely an inconvenience!"""
Osmosis,You kind of can though. California is one of the few states that allows a person to take the bar exam without a law degree.
Osmosis,Yeah that would be great. I wish they had gone for that.
Osmosis,"Doesn‚Äôt he need to absorb hundreds of case studies to pass the Bar?

Heyshutup‚Äîso he‚Äôs a lawyer now"
Osmosis,It was also in like 1934 or wtev. Anyone have a sample CA bar exam from the 30s? Prolly not as hard or exacting as today!
Osmosis,Not really. You read hundreds or thousands of cases throughout law school to understand various legal concepts but the bar tests your knowledge of these concepts and not specific cases. For example you might face several questions where you have to know whether a binding contract was formed but you wouldn‚Äôt have to know the names of any cases where those concepts are spelled out. Someone particularly bright and motivated could probably pass the bar after several weeks of intense and highly focused study. And back then it might have been a lot easier.
Osmosis,Wowwowwowwow... wow
Osmosis,"Frank Abagnale Jr. passed the bar for real without attending law school (the guy Leo Dicaprio played in Catch Me if You Can), it was even in the movie."
Osmosis,"I was sad to read that this was not a new continuation of ""Osmosis Jones""."
Osmosis,"good, it's a sci-fy show this time and not a football related drama.

> ‚ÄúBy giving us the opportunity to work on the production of ‚ÄòOsmosis,‚Äô Netflix offers us the tremendous opportunity to explore a rare genre in France ‚Äì grounded sci-fi

it's rare in french TV but there is a shittone of french scify (grounded or not) in books and comics book form waiting to be adapted..."
Osmosis,It's gonna be hard to do worse than *Marseille*.
Osmosis,"Speaking of, how cool is that movie? Regardless of how good it is, there's no denying it has a look all its own, and it is a good one."
Osmosis,I love that animation and the weird split between the cartoon world and reality (with the strangely separated plot lines). 
Osmosis,Theon Greyjoy
Osmosis,"So, have you watched Supernatural?"
Osmosis,Chief Miles O‚ÄôBrien.
Osmosis,Al Bundy
Osmosis,George Costanza
Osmosis,Homelander from the boys
Osmosis,The Great Owl from The Secret of Nimh
Osmosis,Daniel Holden from Rectify
Osmosis,Barry
Traitors,"Not surprising, but very welcome news. The series was brilliant. I've binged the UK, US and Australian version now, so just need more!"
Traitors,About FUCKING time. Can't believe this was the last of the three English speaking Traitors series to be renewed because for my money it was the most entertaining
Traitors,They‚Äôll need to stop the last person entering at breakfast always being a faithful. Way too easy to work out who the traitors are (or aren‚Äôt) just on that.
Traitors,Now just get rid of the challenges and let them just play the social deception game :)
Traitors,100%
Traitors,"Good news! Just please please please don‚Äôt now pick a load of wanna be celebs or love island types.  
Season one worked well because it was such a great range of (mostly) average Jo‚Äôs"
Traitors,"I am really looking forward to this. There is a lot of room for improvement, but the core concept was so fun. Cannot wait to see contestants who will now have an actual plan and strategy."
Traitors,The Traitors is already so iconic. Loved the Season 1 cast but would love to see a new bunch of people for the next season.
Traitors,So we all agree the UK version is the best? I am about to watch with wifey for the first time.
Traitors,"Same, binged them all in a week, so addictive!"
Traitors,Is the Australian one on anything?
Traitors,Is the Australian version decent? I loved the UK one but the American one was a painful slog packed with the usual reality tv kind of people and cheesy sound effects (eg that super overused violin screech for any 'bad thing happens').
Traitors,It was probably always renewed given the traction it gained but they usually wait a month or two to announce renewals because the show naturally gets press up till about then. If they‚Äôd announced this when the show finished we couldn‚Äôt be talking about it near March.
Traitors,"Yep, thought the same thing.

It‚Äôs always a faithful and always the other person they were considering for murder."
Traitors,They have to mix up a lot of the rules for season 2 since everyone will have watched the show. There are just too many obvious giveaways if you were an outsider looking in.
Traitors,"I think the challenges are probably needed to some extent, to pad out episodes, give contestants something to work towards, and allow the show to feel like a ""proper"" game show.

Personally, I'd love if there was a separate Traitors prize pot, that they could increase by sabotaging tasks or having separate challenges. Have it that they can earn extra money for the traitors, and thus also give the faithfuls a chance to suss out who might be undermining them.

Cause as much as I love the show, the faithfuls have absolutely nothing to go on other than pure luck for 90% of the show."
Traitors,"The challenges were good for getting them to bond though, form a team and aim towards a shared goal of winning money. The BBC version had a good balance between the two I think. The American version got it totally wrong - not enough time getting to know the contestants and them bonding.

I think if you had no challenges, you'd have no reason for people to work as a team. It was because everyone got so close and friendly that the Traitors were so successful and impactful.

So glad there will be a second series!"
Traitors,I ended up fast forwarding the comps. Rest of the show was indeed awesome.  Some of the car rides to and from the comps are important though.
Traitors,"I enjoyed some of them but they were my least favourite part of the episodes. That being said, it always made me really excited when they finally got to the round table."
Traitors,"The competitions are somewhat pointless, but the beginning and ending of each episode is amazing.  It makes you keep coming back for more.  I‚Äôve watched the US and Australian version and Australian was my favorite so far.  That finale was nutz."
Traitors,Peacock
Traitors,The high seas?
Traitors,They‚Äôre all on peacock
Traitors,"Aussie version has 1hr long episodes.  Seems like it's a lot less rushed and like there was less manufactured drama/creative editing, although that may just be my perception.  I liked the US version the least, then the UK, and enjoyed the AU one the most.  I'd love to see the original Dutch series."
Traitors,"I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the US one too though (mainly cause as a Survivor fan, I enjoyed the dynamic the celebrities and Cirie brought to the whole show after two ""normal"" seasons). I didn't feel there was a huge difference between the US and UK ones personally.

It's not got as much of the emotional stuff imo. Way more people are there to actually play the game. But it's also Australian reality TV, meaning it's a bit longer than the other seasons iirc."
Traitors,"I liked the traitor outfits / room in the AU version the best.  The UK version had the best host.  I didn't like how the US version had a bunch of reality TV ""stars"" in the cast."
Traitors,"The US versions just can't help themselves with this stuff

Even small things like the people walking through the door for breakfast, the US version has like 6 cutaway/reaction shots of everyone else before we see who it is

The reactions are, of course, hideously over the top

It's eye-rolling. Just show them walk through the door and then you can see the reactions from everyone in the same shot

UK version managed it, it didn't lose any 'tension' or 'drama' but the US version, they just can't let stuff breathe like that, have to *ham* it up"
Traitors,"The AU one has a much more serious feel. UK is more silly/fun, and the US one is more in between."
Traitors,"I agree 100%. I didn‚Äôt love the show as many people did.

The most enjoyment I got was watching people who claimed they were smart betting their lives on knowing who the traitors were.

 ‚ÄúI KNOW IT‚ÄôS YOU! YOU‚ÄôVE SLIPPED UP, IT‚ÄôS SO OBVIOUS!‚Äù 

To then be proven completely wrong just a day later. They had nothing to work with.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt say hi to me at breakfast, she‚Äôs so guilty‚Äù. 

The armchair psychology on show was incredible.

And I get to sit at home laughing because I knew all along they were wrong. 

But I know full well if I was in there I would have nothing to go on. At all. It would be rubbish. The closest anyone came to guessing who a traitor was in the UK series was blind luck.  Everyone throwing out baseless accusations was a bit silly by the end. 

I‚Äôd love to give the faithful‚Äôs something. A clue for good work. ‚ÄúA traitor was born in the second half of the year‚Äù. Something to make it a game and not just a weird social experiment.

If the second series is the exact same I doubt I will watch. Not that that‚Äôll make a difference to the huge viewership lol"
Traitors,"I think the earlier challenges had nothing of interest in them cause everyone wanted to win the money so it was just like a distraction, that's it, not real 'tactics' involved

Then, they introduced the exemption thingy so at least there's *that* but it still felt like the exemption protected the entire winning team and not a lot of tactics/strategy surrounding that either

They could maybe tweek things here and there"
Traitors,I‚Äôm in the US and liked the Australian version 10 times better.  Can‚Äôt wait to binge the UK version now.
Traitors,"Nice, I'll give it a shot. I still finished the US version it was just less interesting to me than the UK one."
Traitors,"The problem is none of them realized you shouldn‚Äôt care during early game about voting out a traitor or not, you should be focused on forming a clique with at least one traitor in it, then voting out people not in it while your traitor advocates for executing people not in the clique, all in preparation for the endgame where the traitor and the faithfuls want to split the money up with the least amount of people"
Traitors,"I‚Äôve always loved playing Werewolf, but I can relate to those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100% sure X is a baddie‚Äù people cause I‚Äôve absolutely been there too. Just rabbit holing on someone who is genuinely good. Yet I refuse to accept that üòÇ

But Werewolf games typically have someone like a Seer, who can check one persons alignment a night. Or a Bodyguard who can protect someone.

I feel that season one of all the different country versions introduced the basic concept of the game. And they can and should expand out now to offer additional roles to the faithful."
Traitors,"the hilarious thing about the show, ive watched the US and UK versions, is the only time a traitor is ever killed is when another traitor or traitors decides they need to go, like not even on accident have the normies killed a traitor"
Traitors,I like the concept it‚Äôs just stacked in favor of the traitors
Traitors,I almost didn't finish the US version.
Traitors,And people keep saying ‚Äú so and so would make a good traitor so they‚Äôre a traitor‚Äù
Traitors,"The Traitors rules. Good old fashioned paranoia and backstabbing in a beautiful Scottish castle. Alan Cumming is goofy as hell as the host, clearly having a ball."
Traitors,Ever since someone said when he says dollars he sounds like moira rose I can‚Äôt unhear it. However he is a fucking great host
Traitors,When is Alan Cummings not POTW material? I ask you.
Traitors,"I'll admit, I've only seen Alan Cummings in a few things, but he's always a hoot. Loved him in ""Reefer Madness"" and he was enjoyable in ""Schmigadoon!"" too. Haven't had much of a read on Traitors, but I may need to check it out!"
Traitors,"I got hooked on the version they did here in the UK a few weeks back and then got really excited when I saw there was now a US version, but I really wasn't a fan of the way they translated the concept. It's honestly really bizarre how toned-up and American TV everything is despite the format and location being the same, Alan Cumming is fine (love the outfits) but the contestants were incredibly irritating and made me stop after about twenty-odd minutes. 

I was especially not into them bringing in existing reality TV stars (wasn't familiar with any of them so I didn't have the benefit of recognising and liking them going in) and the fact that the tasks are exactly the same was kind of the nail in the coffin for me.

I will say I'm obviously not the target audience as an English person. It very much feels like the intention is for the show to be geared towards the country each version is made for and you're not really supposed to jump between them because you start seeing repeated tasks and whatnot, and the general vibe of the contestants can be jarring if you're not from that country, especially in this case.

It is a great format, though! Watching the UK version was edge-of-the-seat stuff, which was new for me as someone who usually isn't a fan of reality stuff at all, it felt like the best aspects of early big brother combined with Cluedo."
Traitors,"Honorable Mentions:

* Nico Parker - The Last of Us
* Bruce Greenwood - The Resident
* Brian Dietzen and Katrina Law - NCIS"
Traitors,"ok ok , Alan is doing what in the traitors ???"
Traitors,Yes. Love him !
Traitors,I can‚Äôt read ‚ÄúMurdered‚Äù without hearing it in his voice. The Traitors is the perfect sampler of all the vain dramatic people from other reality shows in a format that I can enjoy. This show can‚Äôt cost that much so hopefully we get another season soon.
Traitors,"Love him in anything he does.  So great in the Good wife, too"
Traitors,The chosen thumbnail has me thinking about floop all over again
Traitors,"I just watched Eyes Wide Shut for the first time last night and finally saw Alan Cumming give the most incredible one-scene performance ever committed to film.

Josie and the Pussycats is also unfairly overlooked imo and worth a revisit if you're a fan of his."
Traitors,"My friend (Sam) did the music for this and weirdly another friend was at a party with Alan Cummins a few weeks ago (in QLD) 

I was like huh! 2 people I know connected to Alan Cummins - I guess it‚Äôs not that a big a thing in the context of the world but made me raise my left eyebrow a smidge!"
Traitors,"His accent is awful !! 
He‚Äôs hammed up his Scottish accent and it sways between Mrs Doubtfire and Victor Mildrew - he can‚Äôt keep in character.

Don‚Äôt come at me with hate - I am Scottish and know he is Scottish but he‚Äôs faking a Scottish accent and it‚Äôs awful"
Traitors,I'm not so sure I want to watch Alan Cumming in the traitors.
Traitors,"Okay, reddit cut out the title and I just got 

""Alan cummin in"" 

And I thought, he seems very procreate-y doesn't he."
Traitors,This picture looks like he‚Äôs playing every single Batman villain in one.
Traitors,He looks like pee wee Herman
Traitors,That‚Äôs my face when I silently fart and am waiting for the chaos to start
Traitors,Nah he looks like a Walmart Giancarlo
Traitors,I feel like an idiot because I watched the entire season and not til just now did I find out the host wasn't Pee Wee Herman!!! Am I probably the only one? Lol I thought he was just putting on a great accent. I don't know what else Alan Cumming has been in so wouldn't have known until I just read an article about him lol and I'm like wait what Pee Wee Herman is British huh?! Lol only to discover oh wait Paul Reuebens is Pee Wee haha
Traitors,"He deserved Performer of the Week just for the way he pronounced ""murdered"" and ""dollars"""
Traitors,He‚Äôs bringing us the fashion and I‚Äôm here for it!
Traitors,"I know only say the word ""traitors"" in a Scottish accent."
Traitors,He remains one of the legendary Bond henchmen for his role in *GoldenEye*.
Traitors,Definitely check out Plunkett and Maclean‚Ä¶such an underrated movie!
Traitors,"It was 100% not for me. There's so much of that trumped up reality show interpersonal drama that I couldn't take it. I thought that between Alan (whom I adore) and the game competition stuff (which I generally like, as in Taskmaster) I would enjoy it, but hoo boy, not at all. The cutaways to the individual interview parts were constant and painful. To me. Others really love it so ymmv.

If you do want an extra dose of Cumming, check out ""Miriam and Alan: Lost in Scotland"" a short travel series with him and Miriam Margolyes whom you may recognize from Harry Potter (or elsewhere, I don't know you). I found it very charming, endearing, cozy, and enjoyable."
Traitors,I really enjoyed it. I was surprised how well done and fun it was. Give it a go!
Traitors,"I‚Äôd definitely recommend the Australian version, no celebs just normal people and some excellent gameplay.

I found it on par with if not better than the UK version (whilst I really liked the UK version, the poor faithful were annoyingly dense!)."
Traitors,Pretty much what my Mrs said about it too. She loved the UK version. (We're Scottish)
Traitors,">  (wasn't familiar with any of them so I didn't have the benefit of recognising and liking them going in)

The production company said that they wanted to see if anyone benefited or suffered from the reputation they already had when going into the show. As someone from the UK, that was lost on me, although some things were brought up at roundtables where it was clear certain contestants had done duplicitous things in the past on other shows - it was still enjoyable enough, with a couple of shocks and some tension, but not a patch on the British one."
Traitors,Nico Parker was fantastic
Traitors,[deleted]
Traitors,Cumming is incredible in the good wife!
Traitors,"Loved him in Spy Kids, he nailed the children programs host who may be slightly disturbed."
Traitors,Have you ever seen Limmy‚Äôs skit of Glasgow University Student asking questions? It‚Äôs that. His accent is that. Glasgow Uni.
Traitors,"nobody says ""murder"" better than scots."
Traitors,And traitors. I love the way he said traitors.
Traitors,Me too!
Traitors,‚ÄúI am Invincible!!!‚Äù
Traitors,"If you haven't, you might prefer the UK version.  There's no reality-tv-celebs, it's much more low key and nice towards the beginning.  Although both shows become equally tumultuous in a very personal/emotional way eventually.  That said Alan Cumming is not the host of the UK version."
Traitors,"Curious as a scot, was Alan‚Äôs accent accurate, I thought maybe he turned it up a notch."
Traitors,"When these started getting posted on here, all the comments were telling the OP to stop spamming their shitty site.

Not sure what happened that changed the perception of it."
Traitors,Yes! Loved that show
Traitors,Link it
Traitors,"> That said Alan Cumming is not the host of the UK version.

I'd say Claudia is an equally enjoyable host, albeit in a different way."
Traitors,"Neat, thanks!"
Traitors,"Search ‚ÄúLimmy:Yes or No‚Äù on YT.

There‚Äôs different versions as I think he redid it for his TV show, but they‚Äôre both heavy Glasgow uni accent-vibe"
Traitors,Yeah I think she did great!  But I don't think many americans would know who she is.  Alan Cumming seems to be the invitation to watch the show for a lot of people.  And he is hosting the show in a much hammier way which some people might love some might hate lol.
Traitors,[removed]
Traitors,LOVED this show
Traitors,"Even though I watched the UK version, which had the same missions (except for 1) and no ex-reality competition stars, I really enjoyed both seasons. Both versions also ended with explosive twists, so the final episodes were really fun to watch.

But I was just dumbfounded by the end of the US season: >!Quentin and Andie were the last faithful; they knew from the start that there were 3 traitors, but they only banished 2 - so why would they both vote to end the game?!!<"
Traitors,Ultimate Werewolf + Survivor
Traitors,It‚Äôs such a good idea. I just wish they added safety and punishment prizes to the missions to add more flavor to their scheming and brainstorming.
Traitors,"The UK version was fun & entertaining with a great cast of ordinary people.

The US version is hot garbage full of annoying reality tv 'stars'. Even Alan Cumming couldn't save it."
Traitors,"My fianc√© and I have been watching this and have a few complaints. The traitors take no risk. At all. Ever. They don‚Äôt have to do anything. The biggest issue is that they‚Äôre all fighting to put money in the same pot. If the traitors win, they keep it, if the faithful win, they keep it. What SHOULD happen is the traitors should be building a pot based of what the faithful FAIL to accrue. Yeah, it‚Äôll be smaller, but there are less of them anyway. But they‚Äôll be motivated to sow chaos and mastermind subterfuge during the challenges."
Traitors,I loved this show! I wish the us version had more of the reality stars. It got really boring once they got picked off! I think they should have done a week to week release and it would‚Äôve picked up more steam.
Traitors,It doesn‚Äôt make sense. The traitors have the same goal as the faithful. The stakes are super confusing
Traitors,alan is doing what
Traitors,Reminds me a little bit of ‚Äúthe mole‚Äù
Traitors,English version is great. Australian version is great for the most part but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it because it ends incredibly depressingly.
Traitors,"As a big fan of the older seasons of The Mole, I couldn't get into the new season because everyone was casted off of being an IG influencer and it showed. Somehow The Traitors, a show casted mostly from already established reality tv shows including Real Housewives' and Below Decks fame has a likeable cast I actually can stand watching. Which shows just how bad the the Mole fucked up it's casting. Also The Mole's newest season was was way too brutal. Everyone wanted to act like The Mole which led to almost every game and their insane win conditions a failure. Meanwhile The Traitors have people actually trying to play the game in front of them instead of trying to be the seasons bad bitch. Such a better application of the secret traitor formula."
